American women have a long history of helping in times of hardship, filling positions on the home front vacated by men who enlisted as soldiers during World War I and similarly serving in crucial roles on U.S. military bases, on farms, and in factories during World War II. The COVID-19 pandemic has represented a novel battleground, as the first in which women have taken center stage, not only in their roles as physicians, respiratory therapists, nurses, and the like, but also by serving in leadership positions and facilitating innovations in science, technology, and policy. Yet, the pandemic has exacerbated multiple pain points that have disproportionally impacted women in health care, including shortages in correctly sized personal protective equipment and uniforms, inadequate support for pregnant and breastfeeding providers, and challenges associated with work-life balance and obtaining childcare. While the pandemic has facilitated several positive advancements in addressing these challenges, there is still much work to be done for women to achieve equity and optimal support in their roles on the frontlines.","output":"Women on the Frontline: A Changed Workforce and the Fight Against COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Speckles are introduced in the ultrasound data due to constructive and destructive interference of the probing signals that are used for capturing the characteristics of the tissue being imaged. There are a plethora of models discussed in the literature to improve the contrast and resolution of the ultrasound images by despeckling them. There is a class of models that assumes that the noise is multiplicative in its original form, and transforming the model to a log domain makes it an additive one. Nevertheless, such a transformation duly oversimplifies the scenario and does not capture the inherent properties of the data-correlated nature of speckles. Therefore, it results in poor reconstruction. This problem is addressed to a considerable extent in the subsequent works by adopting various models to address the data-correlated nature of the noise and its distributions. This work introduces a weberized non-local total bounded variational model based on the noise distribution built on the Retinex theory. This perceptually inspired model apparently restores and improves the contrast of the images without compromising much on the details inherently present in the data. The numerical implementation of the model is carried out using the Bregman formulation to improve the convergence rate and reduce the parameter sensitivity. The experimental results are highlighted and compared to demonstrate the efficiency of the model.","output":"Despeckling and enhancement of ultrasound images using non-local variational framework"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Distance measure is one of the research hotspot in Pythagorean fuzzy environment due to its quantitative ability of distinguishing Pythagorean fuzzy sets (PFSs). Various distance functions for PFSs are introduced in the literature and have their own pros and cons. The common thread of incompetency for these existing distance functions is their inability to distinguish highly uncertain PFSs distinctly. To tackle this point, we introduce a novel distance measure for PFSs. An added advantage of the measure is its simple mathematical form. Moreover, superiority and reasonability of the prescribed definition are demonstrated through proper numerical examples. Boundedness and nonlinear behaviour of the distance measure is established and verified via suitable illustrations. In the current scenario, selecting an antivirus face-mask as a preventive measure in the COVID-19 pandemic and choosing the best school in private sector for children are some of the burning issues of a modern society.

Reduction of the primary care practice carbon footprint could contribute to decreasing global carbon emissions. This study aims to quantify the average carbon footprint of a primary care consultation, describe differences between primary care practices (best, worst and average performing) in western Switzerland and identify opportunities for mitigation. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective carbon footprint analysis of ten private practices over the year 2018. We used life-cycle analysis to estimate carbon emissions of each sector, from manufacture to disposal, expressing results as CO(2) equivalents per average consultation and practice. We then modelled an average and theoretical best- case and worst-case practices. Collected data included invoices, medical and furniture inventories, heating and power supply, staff and patient transport, laboratory analyses (in/out-house) waste quantities and management costs. RESULTS: An average medical consultation generated 4.8 kg of CO(2)eq and overall, an average practice produced 30 tons of CO(2)eq per year, with 45.7% for staff and patient transport and 29.8% for heating. Medical consumables produced 5.5% of CO(2)eq emissions, while in-house laboratory and X-rays contributed less than 1% each. Emergency analyses requiring courier transport caused 5.8% of all emissions. Support activities generated 82.6% of the total CO(2)eq. Simulation of best- and worst-case scenarios resulted in a ten-fold variation in CO(2)eq emissions. CONCLUSION: Optimizing structural and organisational aspects of practice work could have a major impact on the carbon footprint of primary care practices without large-scale changes in medical activities.","output":"What is the carbon footprint of primary care practices?

This study provides insights into the effect of videoconferencing on the quality of data, evaluating interviewers and respondents engagement level in videoconferences compared with face-to-face interviews. METHODS: We used cTTO data collected in Belgium and Spain following the EQ-5D-Y-3L valuation protocol. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, both projects interrupted the face-to-face data collection before reaching the target sample. The remaining interviews were conducted by videoconference. We compared both modes of administration in terms of interviewers engagement (task duration and number of moves in each example) and respondents engagement (task duration and proportions of specific response values, in half-year units). To minimise interviewers learning effects, we split our sample into three groups: (1) first 20 interviews conducted face-to-face; (2) subsequent interviews conducted face-to-face; and (3) videoconferencing interviews. RESULTS: The comparison between videoconferencing and subsequent face-to-face interviews showed the interviewers engagement was not affected by the mode of administration as almost no significant results were found either in the task duration or the numbers of moves shown in the examples. Similarly, none of the respondents task duration or proportion of specific responses or half-year units were affected by the mode of administration in either of the two countries.

Anthropometric data and fasting blood samples were taken from 775 Saudi adults visiting different primary care centers in Riyadh [387 T2DM and 388 non-T2DM]. TL, derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, was analyzed by Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and circulating endotoxin levels by Limulus Amebocyte Lysate assay. Subjects were stratified based on obesity and T2DM status. A significant lower TL was observed in the non-obese T2DM group as compared with their non-obese, non-T2DM counterparts (p = 0.002). Significant inverse associations between TL, endotoxin and endotoxin activity were observed in the cohort with obesity.

Lack of screening and limited access to healthcare has delayed diagnosis and treatment of various malignancies. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on sphincter preserving surgery in rectal cancer patients. METHODS: A single-center retrospective study of patients undergoing surgery for newly diagnosed rectal cancer. Patients operated during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020-February 2021) compiled the study group (COVID-19 era); while patients operated earlier (March 2016-February 2020) served as the control group (pre-COVID-19). RESULTS: 234 rectal cancer patients were included, 180 (77 %) patients in the pre-COVID-19 group, and 54 patients (23%) in the COVID-19 era group. There were no differences between the groups in terms of mean patient age, sex or BMI. The COVID-19 era group presented with a significantly higher rate of locally advanced disease (stage T3/T4 79% vs 58%; p=0.02) and metastatic disease (9% vs. 3%; p=0.05).

Recent experimental evidence indicates that mitochondrial depolarization promotes arrhythmogenic delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) in cardiac myocytes. However, the nonlinear interactions among the Ca2+ signaling pathways, ROS, and oxidized Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) pathways make it difficult to reveal the mechanisms. Here, we use a recently developed spatiotemporal ventricular myocyte computer model, which consists of a 3-dimensional network of Ca2+ release units (CRUs) intertwined with mitochondria and integrates mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling and other complex signaling pathways, to study the mitochondrial regulation of DADs. With a systematic investigation of the synergistic or competing factors that affect the occurrence of Ca2+ waves and DADs during mitochondrial depolarization, we find that the direct redox effect of ROS on ryanodine receptors (RyRs) plays a critical role in promoting Ca2+ waves and DADs under the acute effect of mitochondrial depolarization. Furthermore, the upregulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter can promote DADs through Ca2+-dependent opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores (mPTPs). Also, due to much slower dynamics than Ca2+ cycling and ROS, oxidized CaMKII activation and the cytosolic ATP do not appear to significantly impact the genesis of DADs during the acute phase of mitochondrial depolarization. However, under chronic conditions, ATP depletion suppresses and enhanced CaMKII activation promotes Ca2+ waves and DADs.","output":"Mitochondrial Contributions in the Genesis of Delayed Afterdepolarizations in Ventricular Myocytes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Community clinics often face pragmatic barriers, hindering program initiation and replication of controlled research trial results. Mentoring is a potential strategy to overcome these barriers. We piloted an in-person and telehealth mentoring strategy to implement the Telehealth-supported, Integrated Community Health Workers (CHWs), Medication-access, group visit Education (TIME) program in a community clinic. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants (n=55) were low-income Latino(a)s with type 2 diabetes. The study occurred in two, 6-month phases. Phase I provided proof-of-concept and an observational experience for the clinic team; participants (n=37) were randomized to the intervention (TIME) or control (usual care), and the research team conducted TIME while the clinic team observed. Phase II provided mentorship to implement TIME, and the research team mentored the clinic team as they conducted TIME for a new single-arm cohort of participants (n=18) with no previous exposure to the program. Analyses included baseline to 6-month comparisons of diabetes outcomes (primary outcome: hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)): phase I intervention versus control, phase II (within group), and research-run (phase I intervention) versus clinic-run (phase II) arms. We also evaluated baseline to 6-month CHW knowledge changes. RESULTS: Phase I: compared with the control, intervention participants had superior baseline to 6-month improvements for HbA1c (mean change: intervention: ?0.73% vs control: 0.08%, p=0.016), weight (p=0.044), target HbA1c (p=0.035), hypoglycemia (p=0.021), medication non-adherence (p=0.0003), and five of six American Diabetes Association (ADA) measures (p<0.001C0.002). Phase II: participants had significant reductions in HbA1c (mean change: ?0.78%, p=0.006), diastolic blood pressure (p=0.004), body mass index (0.012), weight (p=0.010), medication non-adherence (p<0.001), and six ADA measures (p=0.007C0.005). Phase I intervention versus phase II outcomes were comparable. CHWs improved knowledge from pre-test to post-tests (p<0.001).

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the content posted to a popular social media platform (Twitter) by OHNS residency programs. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we identified Twitter accounts for accredited academic OHNS residency programs. Tweets published over a 6-month period (March to August 2019) were extracted. Tweets were categorized and analyzed for source (original versus retweet) and target audience (medical versus layman). A random sample of 100 tweets was used to identify patterns of content, which were then used to categorize additional tweets. We quantified the total number of likes or retweets by health care professionals. RESULTS: Of the 121 accredited programs, 35 (28.9%) had Twitter accounts. Of the 2526 tweets in the 6-month period, 1695 (67.10%) were original-content tweets. The majority of tweets (1283/1695, 75.69%) were targeted toward health care workers, most of which did not directly contain medical information (954/1283, 74.36%). These tweets contained information about the departments trainees and education (349/954, 36.6%), participation at conferences (263/954, 27.6%), and research publications (112/954, 11.7%).

Because an unknown proportion of reported symptoms among SARS-CoV-2 positives will be attributable to another infection or affliction, the observed, or 'crude' proportion without symptoms may underestimate the proportion of persons without symptoms that are caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Based on two rounds of a large population-based serological study comprising test results on seropositivity and self-reported symptom history conducted in April/May and June/July 2020 in the Netherlands (n = 7517), we estimated the proportion of reported symptoms among those persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 that is attributable to this infection, where the set of relevant symptoms fulfills the ECDC case definition of COVID-19, using inferential methods for the attributable risk (AR). Generalised additive regression modelling was used to estimate the age-dependent relative risk (RR) of reported symptoms, and the AR and asymptomatic proportion (AP) were calculated from the fitted RR. RESULTS: Using age-aggregated data, the 'crude' AP was 37% but the model-estimated AP was 65% (95% CI 63C68%). The estimated AP varied with age, from 74% (95% CI 65C90%) for < 20 years, to 61% (95% CI 57C65%) for the 50C59 years age-group. CONCLUSION: Whereas the 'crude' AP represents a lower bound for the proportion of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 without COVID-19 symptoms, the AP as estimated via an attributable risk approach represents an upper bound. Age-specific AP estimates can inform the implementation of public health actions such as targetted virological testing and therefore enhance containment strategies.

In contrast to other cities or countries, Taiwan did not enforce strict social lockdowns or mandatory stay-at-home orders to combat COVID-19. The major prevention strategies to the pandemic in Taiwan include promoting social distancing, mandating the wearing of face masks in public areas, and requiring all international arrivals to quarantine for 14 days. Using administrative data on confirmed cases of COVID-19 and ridership from metro stations with the difference-in-differences model, we find that an additional new confirmed case of COVID-19 reduces metro use by 1.43% after controlling for local socio-demographic variables associated with ridership and the number of international arrivals to Taiwan. This result implies that the reduction in metro trips is attributable to decreases in residents' use of public transportation due to perceived health risks. Furthermore, the effect of COVID-19 on metro use disproportionally impacts stations with different characteristics. The effect is more pronounced for metro stations connected to night markets, shopping centers, or colleges. Although decreases in metro ridership lower the revenue of the Taipei Metro System, our results indicate a tradeoff between increased financial burdens of public transportation systems and reducing medical expenses associated with COVID-19.","output":"Does COVID-19 affect metro use in Taipei?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE Viral infections of the upper respiratory tract may influence the commensal nasopharyngeal bacteria. Changes in the bacterial niche could affect transmission dynamics. Attenuated vaccine viruses can be used to investigate this empirically in humans. OBJECTIVES To study the effects of mild viral upper respiratory infections on nasopharyngeal bacterial colonization using live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) as a surrogate. METHODS We used trivalent LAIV to evaluate the effects of viral infection on bacterial carriage and density of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus. A total of 151 healthy children were randomized 1:1 to receive the vaccine starting either at recruitment (n = 74) or 28 days later (n = 77) in a stepped wedge fashion, allowing comparisons between recipients and nonrecipients as well as whole-group comparisons pre- and postvaccination. Bacterial carriage and density were determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS A total of 151 children were recruited, 77 in the LAIV group and 74 in the control group. LAIV recipients (n = 63 analyzed) showed an apparent transient increase in H. influenzae carriage but no further significant differences in carriage prevalence of the four bacterial species compared with controls (n = 72 analyzed). S. pneumoniae density was substantially higher in vaccine recipients (16,687 vs. 1935 gene copies per milliliter) 28 days after the first dose (P < 0.001). Whole-group multivariable analysis (prevaccine, after one dose, and after two doses) also showed increases in density of other species and H. influenzae carriage prevalence. CONCLUSIONS In the absence of any safety signals despite widespread use of the vaccine, these findings suggest that bacterial density, and thus transmission rates among children and to people in other age groups, may rise following attenuated influenza infections without associated clinical disease. LAIV could therefore be used as an experimental tool to elucidate the dynamics of transmission of nasopharyngeal bacteria.","output":"The Effects of Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine on Nasopharyngeal Bacteria in Healthy 2 to 4 Year Olds.

In contrast, a patient can possess the CDS even if they cannot appreciate their condition or reason about the relative risks and benefits of their options. Patients who lack DMC for many or most kinds of medical choices may nonetheless possess the CDS, particularly since the complex means-ends reasoning required by DMC is one of the first capacities to be lost in progressive cognitive diseases (eg, Alzheimer's disease). That is, patients with significant cognitive decline or mental illness may still understand what a surrogate does, express a preference about a potential surrogate, and be able to provide some kind of justification for that selection. Moreover, there are many legitimate and relevant rationales for surrogate selection that are inconsistent with the reasoning criterion of DMC.

Using data from Our World in Data (ourworldindata.org), we performed comparisons for two prototypical yet disparate pairs of countries: Bolivia versus the United States (large vs. small-to-moderate TP rates), and South Korea vs. Uruguay (two very small TP rates of similar magnitude). Three different statistical procedures were used: two frequentist tests (an asymptotic z-test and the 'N-1' chi-square test), and a Bayesian method for comparing two proportions (TP rates are proportions). Results indicated that for the case of large vs. small-to-moderate TP rates (Bolivia versus the United States), the frequentist and Bayesian approaches both indicated that the two rates were substantially different. When the TP rates were very small and of similar magnitude (values of .009 and .007 for South Korea and Uruguay, respectively), the frequentist tests indicated a highly significant contrast, despite the apparent trivial amount by which the two rates differ. The Bayesian method, in comparison, suggested that the TP rates were practically equivalent-a finding that seems more consistent with the observed data. When TP rates are highly similar in magnitude, frequentist tests can lead to erroneous interpretations. A Bayesian approach, on the other hand, can help ensure more accurate inferences and thereby avoid potential decision errors that could lead to costly public health and policy-related consequences.","output":"Statistical Methods for Comparing Test Positivity Rates Between Countries: Which Method Should be Used and Why?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article traces developments since the publication of John Readers Theology and New Materialism (2017) with the aim of establishing conceptual resources that link concerns for the environment with those for digital technology.

It then addresses the question of why it remains difficult to operationalize appropriate responses and the concepts of disinhibition (Latour and for Stiegler) and autoimmunity (Derrida) offer possible explanations. To counter these difficulties, the idea of a modest ethics and from within theology, the dynamic between proximity and distance and then panentheism are presented as solutions. Each links back to key ideas from New Materialism such as distributed agency and mini or local transcendences and the concept of God who is beyond in the midst.

The COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing social restrictions disrupted young peoples social interactions and resulted in several periods during which school closures necessitated online learning. We hypothesise that digitally excluded young people would demonstrate greater deterioration in their mental health than their digitally connected peers during this time. MethodsWe analysed representative mental health data from a sample of UK 10-15-year-olds (N = 1387); Understanding Society collected the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire in 2017-19 and thrice during the pandemic (July 2020, November 2020 and March 2021). We employed cross-sectional methods and longitudinal latent growth curve modelling to describe trajectories of adolescent mental health for participants with and without access to a computer or a good internet connection for schoolwork. OutcomesAdolescent mental health had a quadratic trajectory during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the highest mean Total Difficulties score around December 2020. The worsening and recovery of mental health during the pandemic was greatly pronounced among those without access to a computer, although we did not find evidence for a similar effect among those without a good internet connection. InterpretationDigital exclusion, as indicated by lack of access to a computer, is a tractable risk factor that likely compounds other adversities facing children and young people during periods of social isolation.

DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective analysis of international asymptomatic travellers entering Alberta, Canada. INTERVENTIONS: All participants were required to receive a PCR COVID-19 test on arrival. If negative, participants could leave quarantine but were required to have a second test 6 or 7 days after arrival. If the arrival test was positive, participants were required to remain in quarantine for 14 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion and rate of participants testing positive for COVID-19; number of cases of secondary transmission. RESULTS: The analysis included 9535 international travellers entering Alberta by air (N=8398) or land (N=1137) that voluntarily enrolled in the Alberta Border Testing Pilot Programme (a subset of all travellers); most (83.1%) were Canadian citizens. Among the 9310 participants who received at least one test, 200 (21.5 per 1000, 95% CI 18.6 to 24.6) tested positive. Sixty-nine per cent (138/200) of positive tests were detected on arrival (14.8 per 1000 travellers, 95% CI 12.5 to 17.5). 62 cases (6.7 per 1000 travellers, 95% CI 5.1 to 8.5; 31.0% of positive cases) were identified among participants that had been released from quarantine following a negative test result on arrival. Of 192 participants who developed symptoms, 51 (26.6%) tested positive after arrival. Among participants with positive tests, four (2.0%) were hospitalised for COVID-19; none required critical care or died. Contact tracing among participants who tested positive identified 200 contacts; of 88 contacts tested, 22 were cases of secondary transmission (14 from those testing positive on arrival and 8 from those testing positive thereafter). SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage was not detected in any of the 200 positive cases. CONCLUSIONS: 21.5 per 1000 international travellers tested positive for COVID-19. Most (69%) tested positive on arrival and 31% tested positive during follow-up. These findings suggest the need for ongoing vigilance in travellers testing negative on arrival and highlight the value of follow-up testing and contact tracing to monitor and limit secondary transmission where possible.","output":"COVID-19 infection among international travellers: a prospective analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Service or Program: In March 2020, clinical pharmacy leadership at Greater Baltimore Medical Center in Towson, Maryland implemented emergent protocols in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to promote safe management of warfarin and DOAC patients in a pharmacy-driven outpatient anticoagulation clinic The protocols protected patients and staff while increasing access to anticoagulation care New workflows included pre-appointment telephone screening, an isolation room with trained staff for PUI/COVID+ patients, extended INR monitoring intervals for stable patients, home INR monitoring, telehealth visits, and transition to DOACs for housebound/ vulnerable patients who were appropriate candidates Justification/Documentation: During the COVID pandemic, anticoagulation patients face unique challenges in receiving appropriate care due to quarantine restrictions, social distancing, and fear Lack of timely care increases bleeding risk and clotting events COVID triggered a creative approach by pharmacy leadership to include telemedicine visits to minimize exposure risk and safely manage warfarin and DOAC patients As a result, financially and clinically sustainable anticoagulation services have been maintained during this pandemic To date, zero transitioned to DOACs, 16 being home monitored, 6 engaged in telehealth services, and 23 adopted extended INR intervals Adaptability: These protocols and workflows are easily replicable in outpatient anticoagulation clinics across the country and can be implemented in other pharmacy-led outpatient clinics with minor modifications These changes are sensitive to diverse populations and address social determinants of health that burden anticoagulation patients Unprecedented collaborations between pharmacy and finance are supported by new CMS regulations establishing billable auxiliary (pharmacy) personnel Significance: These initiatives ensured continuous care for anticoagulation patients while preventing hospitalizations during a period of overstrained inpatient care New CMS rules allowed anticoagulation pharmacists to perform and bill for previously unreimbursed services Pharmacy leadership facilitated the management of outpatient warfarin/DOAC therapy while simultaneously reducing infection risks, and both staff and patients expressed gratitude for the extra measures taken within the anticoagulation clinic","output":"An anticoagulation clinic's journey during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this covid pandemic situation retailers are finding a better option for their e- commerce businesses to boost up.

As pregnant and reproductive-aged women account for a large proportion of the population with particular concerns regarding vaccination against COVID-19, this survey aims at investigating their current attitudes and beliefs within our own institution. OBJECTIVE: To understand vaccine acceptability among pregnant, non-pregnant and breastfeeding respondents and elucidate factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. METHODS: We administered an anonymous online survey to all women (including patients, providers and staff) at our institution assessing rates of acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination. Respondents were contacted in one of three ways: by email, advertisement flyers and distribution of QR codes at virtual townhalls regarding the COVID-19 vaccine. Based on their responses, respondents were divided into three mutually exclusive groups: (1) non-pregnant respondents (2) pregnant respondents and (3) breastfeeding respondents. The primary outcome was acceptance of vaccination. Prevalence ratios were calculated to ascertain the independent effects of multiple patient-level factors on vaccine acceptability. RESULTS: The survey was administered from January 7, 2021 to January 29, 2021 with 1,012 respondents of whom 466 (46.9%) identified as Non-Hispanic White, 108 (10.9%) as Non-Hispanic Black, 286 (28.8%) as Hispanic, and 82 (8.2) as Non-Hispanic Asian. The median age was 36 (IQR 25-47) years. Of all the respondents, 656 respondents (64.8%) were non-pregnant, 216 (21.3%) were pregnant and 122 (12.1%) were breastfeeding. There was no difference in chronic comorbidities when evaluated as a composite variable (Table 1). 390 respondents (39.2%) reported working in healthcare. Non-pregnant respondents were most likely to accept vaccination (457 respondents, 76.2%, p<0.001) with breastfeeding respondents the second most likely (55.2%). Pregnant respondents had the lowest rate of vaccine acceptance (44.3%, p<0.001). Prevalence ratios revealed all non-White races except for non-Hispanic Asian respondents and Spanish speaking respondents were less likely to accept vaccination(Table 3). Working in healthcare was not found to be associated with vaccine acceptance among our cohort. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this survey study of only women at a single institution, pregnant respondents of non-White or non-asian races were more likely to decline vaccination compared to non-pregnant and breast-feeding respondents.

The surface spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 mediates the process of coronavirus entry into human cells by binding angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Due to the critical role in viral-host interaction and the exposure of spike protein, it has been a focus of most vaccines developments. However, the structural and biochemical studies of the spike protein are challenging because it is thermodynamically metastable1. Here, we develop a new pipeline that automatically identifies mutants that thermodynamically stabilize the spike protein. Our pipeline integrates bioinformatics analysis of conserved residues, motion dynamics from molecular dynamics simulations, and other structural analysis to identify residues that significantly contribute to the thermodynamic stability of the spike protein. We then utilize our previously developed protein design tool, Eris, to predict thermodynamically stabilizing mutations in proteins. We validate the ability of our pipeline to identify protein stabilization mutants through known prefusion spike protein mutants.

To describe the experiences of parents of hospitalized preterm children regarding the restrictions implemented in the neonatal intensive care unit -NICU- during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS. Qualitative study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted between April and October 2020 with 12 parents of preterm children, whose children were hospitalized and discharged from NICU during the pandemic. The analysis was performed with tools from grounded theory through open and axial coding. RESULTS. The study identified four categories regarding the experience: 1) needing information: refers to the need for clear and close information to compensate for the physical distance; 2) limiting the interaction with the children: expressed as a painful situation, which minimizes opportunities for learning to care at home for their preterm child; 3) the pandemic: adding to the fears: in which the virus appears as a new threat for the children, who are vulnerable given their premature condition; and 4) limiting social support after discharge: identifies that the parents had less family and professional support for care after discharge during times of pandemic. CONCLUSION. Parents of preterm children lived a difficult experience that became complex within the context of the pandemic. The experiences of parents of preterm children during times of COVID-19 indicate that restrictions to enter neonatal units to prevent the virus transmission limited the interaction with the preterm child and with the health staff and increased the needs for information.","output":"Experiences of Parents of Preterm Children Hospitalized Regarding Restrictions to Interact with Their Children Imposed Because of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Scene query is an important problem for the visually impaired population. While existing systems are able to recognize objects surrounding a person, one of their significant shortcomings is that they typically rely on the phone camera with a finite field of view. Therefore, if the object is situated behind the user, it will go undetected unless the user spins around and takes a series of pictures. The recent introduction of affordable, panoramic cameras solves this problem. In addition, most existing systems report all significant objects in a given scene to the user, rather than respond to a specific user-generated query as to where an object located. The recent introduction of text-to-speech and speech recognition capabilities on mobile phones paves the way for such user-generated queries, and for audio response generation to the user. In this paper, we exploit the above advancements to develop a query system for the visually impaired utilizing a panoramic camera and a smartphone. We propose three designs for such a system: the first is a handheld device, and the second and third are wearable backpack and ring. In all three cases, the user interacts with our systems verbally regarding whereabouts of objects of interest. We exploit deep learning methods to train our system to recognize objects of interest.

The household transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, the causative pathogen, remains elusive. METHODS: Based on a comprehensive contact-tracing dataset from Guangzhou, we estimated both the population-level effective reproductive number and individual-level secondary attack rate (SAR) in the household setting. We assessed age effects on transmissibility and the infectivity of COVID-19 cases during their incubation period. RESULTS: A total of 195 unrelated clusters with 212 primary cases, 137 nonprimary (secondary or tertiary) cases and 1938 uninfected close contacts were traced. We estimated the household SAR to be 13.8% (95% CI: 11.1C17.0%) if household contacts are defined as all close relatives and 19.3% (95% CI: 15.5C23.9%) if household contacts only include those at the same residential address as the cases, assuming a mean incubation period of 4 days and a maximum infectious period of 13 days. The odds of infection among children (<20 years old) was only 0.26 (95% CI: 0.13C0.54) times of that among the elderly (60 years old). There was no gender difference in the risk of infection. COVID-19 cases were at least as infectious during their incubation period as during their illness. On average, a COVID-19 case infected 0.48 (95% CI: 0.39C0.58) close contacts. Had isolation not been implemented, this number increases to 0.62 (95% CI: 0.51C0.75). The effective reproductive number in Guangzhou dropped from above 1 to below 0.5 in about 1 week. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible in households than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and the elderly 60 years old are the most vulnerable to household transmission.

In response to the pandemic, Cameroon like most countries instituted a number of control measures to curb the spread of the pandemic across the country. These COVID-19 control measures added to the fear of this disease within the population may have led to other detrimental health effects like; the pattern of hospitalizations and hospital outcome. METHODS: We did a cross-sectional study with data from in-patient admission records of children admitted at the pediatric ward of the Regional Hospital Bamenda over a 24 months period, (1(st) of March 2019 to the 28(th) of February 2021). The pre-pandemic period in Cameroon (that is the first 12 months, from March 2019CFebruary 2020) and the pandemic period (that is the last 12 months, from March 2020CFebruary 2021) were compared. RESULTS: A total of 2,282 hospitalization records were included in the study. Most of the hospitalized children were males (57.23%). There was a 19.03% decline in pediatric hospitalizations during the first twelve months of the pandemic, which was statistically significant (P = 0.00024). The causes of hospitalizations and mortality remained similar over both periods, with severe malaria the leading cause of admissions. Hospital deaths before and during the pandemic were 1.6% and 1.9% respectively. CONCLUSION: There was a statistically significant decline in pediatric hospitalizations during the first twelve months of the pandemic, as compared to the same period before the pandemic. Hospital mortality, and causes of hospitalizations remained similar over both periods. LAY SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic is a public health emergency and challenge to the health systems of most countries worldwide. The initial response of the Cameroon government to the COVID-19 pandemic was to put a number of measures in place to stop the spread of the virus across the country. These measures, though beneficial in the fight against COVID-19 could have led to other detrimental health effects on the population, through a change in the pattern of hospitalizations and hospital outcome, and all these made worse by the fear of COVID within the population. We carried out a descriptive and retrospective cross sectional study using hospitalization and mortality data from the pediatric ward of the Regional Hospital Bamenda, in Cameroon. We compared the data for the last twelve months before the pandemic (March 2019CFebruary 2020) to that of the first twelve months during the pandemic in Cameroon (March 2020CFebruary 2021). The comparison of the two periods showed that there was a statistically significant decline in pediatric hospitalizations during the first twelve months of the pandemic, by 19.03% (P = 0.00024).

MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients who were brought via scene flight from rural parts of the region to our institution, from December 1, 2014 to June 5, 2015, with severe hemiparesis or hemiplegia. We assessed the accuracy of the diagnosis of stroke and the number of patients requiring endovascular therapy. Moreover, we reviewed the times along the pathway of patients who were treated with endovascular therapy. RESULTS 45 patients were brought via helicopter from the field to our institution. 27 (60%) patients were diagnosed with an ischemic stroke. Of these, 12 (26.7%) were treated with mechanical thrombectomy and 6 (13.3%) with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator alone. An additional three patients required embolization procedures for either a dural arteriovenous fistula or cerebral aneurysm. Thus a total of 15 (33%) patients received an endovascular procedure and 21/45 (46.7%) received an acute treatment. For patients treated with thrombectomy, the median time from first medical contact to groin puncture was 101 min, with 8 of the 12 patients (66.7%) being discharged to home. CONCLUSIONS We have presented a pilot study showing that severe hemiparesis or hemiplegia may be a reasonable prehospital tool in recognizing patients requiring endovascular treatment. Patients being identified earlier may be treated faster and potentially improve outcomes.

Although several recent studies have analyzed these changes over different regions of the globe, these analyses have been constrained due to the usage of station-based data which is mostly limited upto the metropolitan cities. Also, the quantifiable changes have been reported only for the developed and developing regions leaving the poor economies (e.g. Africa) due to the shortage of in-situ data. Using a comprehensive set of high spatiotemporal resolution satellites and merged products of air pollutants, we analyze the air quality across the globe and quantify the improvement resulting from the suppressed anthropogenic activity during the lockdowns. In particular, we focus on megacities, capitals and cities with high standards of living to make the quantitative assessment. Our results offer valuable insights into the spatial distribution of changes in the air pollutants due to COVID-19 enforced lockdowns.

Patients were divided into two groups: 19 patients eligible for DBS over the follow-up and 41 patients who did not meet the criteria to undergo DBS. Patients selected as candidates for DBS did not undergo surgery at this stage. Sixty age- and sex-matched healthy controls performed baseline evaluations.

At baseline, network analysis showed a higher mean nodal strength, local efficiency, and clustering coefficient of the occipital areas in candidates for DBS over time relative to controls and patients not eligible for DBS. The occipital hyperconnectivity pattern was confirmed by regional analysis. At baseline, a decreased functional connectivity between basal ganglia and sensorimotor/frontal networks was found in candidates for DBS compared to patients not eligible for surgery. In the longitudinal analysis, patient candidate for DBS showed a progressively decreased topological brain organization and functional connectivity, mainly in the posterior brain networks, and a progressively increased connectivity of basal ganglia network compared to non-candidates for DBS.

Available interventions to help adolescents improve their stress responses, however, have not been effective in rigorous evaluation studies, or they have been difficult to administer widely. Here we show that replicable improvements in adolescent stress responses can be achieved with a short (~30-minute), scalable synergistic mindsets intervention. This intervention, which is a self-administered online training module, targets both growth mindsets (the idea that peoples intelligence can be developed in response to challenge) and stress-can-be-enhancing mindsets (the idea that peoples stress responses can be fuel for optimal performance). Its goal is to promote positive engagement with stressful events (e.g., learning from failure on a quiz or a conflict with a peer) and to encourage adolescents to use their responses to stressful events and even their bodily symptoms (e.g. racing heart, sweaty palms, butterflies in their stomach) to their advantage. In five double-blind, randomized, controlled trials (total N = 4,091 adolescents), the new synergistic mindsets intervention improved stress-related cognitions (Studies 1-2), cardiovascular reactivity (Study 3), daily internalizing symptoms and cortisol levels (Study 4), and generalized anxiety symptoms during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdowns (Study 5). Effects on downstream outcomes (in Studies 3-5) were stronger among individuals who, at baseline, held the two negative mindsets targeted by the intervention, providing evidence for the proposed mechanisms. Confidence in this conclusion comes from a conservative, Bayesian machine-learning method for detecting heterogeneity.","output":"A Synergistic Mindsets Intervention Protects Adolescents from Social Stress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Port site herniation is one of the serious complications of laparoscopic surgery, which decreases its benefits. Closure of a fascia defect at the port site is an important problem of laparoscopic surgery, especially in obese patients. Aim To evaluate needle grasper fascia closure. Material and methods We closed the port site fascia using a percutaneous organ-holding device (needle grasper) in laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients. This study included 334 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy between January 2015 and January 2017 in our hospital. Patients were divided into 2 fascia closure groups: group 1 with a standard simple suturing technique and group 2 with a needle grasper to close the port site. Patient demographics, operative details, and postoperative outcomes were collected and evaluated. Results There were 243 female and 91 male (total 334) patients with the mean age of 49.18 13.15 years. Only 1 patient in the BMI > 30 kg/m2 group of patients had port site hernia development with the needle grasper technique at the end of the 8-month follow-up period. The port site hernia incidence was higher in group 1 than group 2 (p < 0.001), but there was no significant difference in terms of operation duration between the two groups (p < 0.001, p = 0.709, respectively). In patients with a BMI > 30 kg/m2, both operation duration and port site hernia incidence were higher in simple suture closure than in the needle grasper technique (p < 0.001, p = 0.016, p = 0.005). Conclusions The needle grasper technique is easy, simple, safe, fast, and effective for fascia closure of port sites.

Liver transplant (LT) recipients are at risk of lower vaccine immunogenicity and were not included in the registration trials. We assessed vaccine immunogenicity and safety in this special population. METHODS: LT recipients followed at the Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center and healthy volunteers were tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies directed against the Spike-protein (S) and Nucleocapsid-protein (N) 10-20 days after receiving the second Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose. Information regarding vaccine side effects and clinical data was collected from patients and medical records. RESULTS: Eighty LT recipients were enrolled. Mean age was 60 years and 30% were female. Twenty-five healthy volunteer controls were younger (mean age 52.7 years, p = 0.013) and mostly female (68%, p = 0.002). All participants were negative for IgG N-protein serology, indicating immunity did not result from prior COVID-19 infection. All controls were positive for IgG S-protein serology. Immunogenicity among LT recipients was significantly lower with positive serology in only 47.5% (p <0.001). Antibody titer was also significantly lower in this group (mean 95.41 AU/ml vs. 200.5 AU/ml in controls, p <0.001). Predictors for negative response among LT recipients were older age, lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, and treatment with high dose steroids and mycophenolate mofetil. No serious adverse events were reported in either group. CONCLUSION: LT recipients developed substantially lower immunological response to the Pfizer-BioNTech SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-based vaccine. Factors influencing serological antibody responses include age, renal function and immunosuppressive medications. The findings require re-evaluation of vaccine regimens in this population. LAY SUMMARY: The Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine elicited substantially inferior immunity in liver transplant recipients. Less than half of the patients developed sufficient levels of antibodies against the virus, and in those who were positive, average antibody levels were 2x less compared to healthy controls. Factors predicting non-response were older age, renal function and immunosuppressive medications.","output":"Low immunogenicity to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among liver transplant recipients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tackling stereotypes and assumptions that deter men from nursing is essential to meet the growing shortage of nurses and improve diversity, say Thomas Kearns and Paul Mahon","output":"How to attain gender equality in nursingan essay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE The purpose of our study is to determine if there is a relationship between dose deposition measured by PET/MRI and individual lesion response to yttrium-90 ((90)Y) microsphere radioembolization. MATERIALS AND METHODS 26 patients undergoing lobar treatment with (90)Y microspheres underwent PET/MRI within 66 h of treatment and had follow-up imaging available. Adequate visualization of tumor was available in 24 patients, and contours were drawn on simultaneously acquired PET/MRI data. Dose volume histograms (DVHs) were extracted from dose maps, which were generated using a voxelized dose kernel. Similar contours to capture dimensional and volumetric change of tumors were drawn on follow-up imaging. Response was analyzed using both RECIST and volumetric RECIST (vRECIST) criteria. RESULTS A total of 8 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 4 neuroendocrine tumor (NET), 9 colorectal metastases (CRC) patients, and 3 patients with other metastatic disease met inclusion criteria. Average dose was useful in predicting response between responders and non-responders for all lesion types and for CRC lesions alone using both response criteria (p < 0.05). D70 (minimum dose to 70 % of volume) was also useful in predicting response when using vRECIST. No significant trend was seen in the other tumor types. For CRC lesions, an average dose of 29.8 Gy offered 76.9 % sensitivity and 75.9 % specificity for response. CONCLUSIONS PET/MRI of (90)Y microsphere distribution showed significantly higher DVH values for responders than non-responders in patients with CRC.

Lymph node metastasis is extremely rare in true gastrointestinal leiomyosarcoma, and there are no reports of malignant transformation from leiomyoma. CASE PRESENTATION The patient was an old woman who had undergone endoscopic mucosal resection for an Is polyp on the left side of the transverse colon at the age of 73. She was diagnosed with leiomyoma with positive surgical margins. Subsequently, she presented to our institution with a sensation of pressure in the upper abdominal region as a chief complaint at the age of 76 years. Abdominal computed tomography and colorectal endoscopy showed a tumor lesion with invagination of the intestines in the transverse colon, the same site as that of the previously resected leiomyoma. A biopsy suggested a smooth muscle tumor, and we performed partial left transverse colectomy and lymph node dissection under a diagnosis of recurrence and enlargement of the previously incompletely resected leiomyoma. Histopathological examination revealed spindle-shaped tumor cells, and the mitotic activity was 30-40/10 high-power field. Tumor cells were immunohistologically positive for -smooth muscle actin and h-caldesmon; partially positive for desmin; negative for c-kit, CD34, DOG-1, and the S-100 protein; and showed a Ki-67 labeling index of 70-80%. She was diagnosed with leiomyosarcoma malignantly transformed from leiomyoma. Metastasis was found in 1 of the 14 resected lymph nodes. The patient did not undergo adjuvant chemotherapy, but has survived with no recurrence at 2 years after the surgery.

Methods We retrospectively analyzed endoscopies performed in 15 Dutch hospitals by comparing periods 15 March to 25 June of 2019 and 2020 using the prospective Trans.IT database. Results During lockdown in 2020, 9776 patients underwent endoscopy compared with 19 296 in 2019. Gastroscopies decreased by 57 % (from 7846 to 4467) and colonoscopies by 45 % (from 12219 to 5609), whereas endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography volumes remained comparable (from 578 to 522). Although endoscopy results indicative of cancer decreased (from 524 to 340), the likelihood of detecting cancer during endoscopy increased (2.7 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 2.5 C 3.0] in 2019 versus 3.5 % [95 %CI 3.1 C 3.9] in 2020; P < 0.001).

Postmortem investigations reveal renal involvement in COVID-19, and most recently, several biopsy researches reveal that acute tubular injury, as well as glomerular nephropathy such as collapsing glomerulopathy were common histological findings. However, to our best knowledge, there is limited data regarding IgA nephropathy in the setting of COVID-19. CASE PRESENTATION: In the present case, we report a 65-year old Chinese woman who presented with dark-colored urine, worsening proteinuria and decreased renal function after COVID-19 infection. She received a renal biopsy during COVID-19 infection. The renal biopsy revealed IgA nephropathy without any evidence for SARS-Cov-2. The findings suggest that the renal abnormalities were a consequence of exacerbation of this patient's underlying glomerular disease after COVID-19 infection. After a regimen of 3-day course of glucocorticoid and angiotensin II receptor blocker therapy, the patient recovered and remained stable upon follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to consider the underlying glomerular disease exacerbation as well as virus induced injury when dealing with renal abnormalities in patients with COVID-19.

METHOD: This was a cross-sectional survey among COVID-19 inpatients in two isolation wards of a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, from March 7, 2020, to March 24, 2020. Participants demographic data, clinical data and levels of circulating inflammatory markers were collated. Mental health symptoms were evaluated with questionnaires, which included the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scale, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, and questions about patients self-perceived illness severity. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to explore factors that associated with mental symptoms, and a structural equation model (SEM) was used to assess the possible relationships between those factors and the patients mental health. RESULTS: Among the 85 participants, 45.9% had symptoms of depression (PHQ-9  5), 38.8% had anxiety (GAD-7  5), and 54.1% had insomnia (ISI  8). According to multivariate regression analysis, female sex, a higher level of interleukin (AL)-1 and greater self-perceived illness severity were all significantly associated with a higher PHQ-9 score, higher GAD-7 score and higher ISI score. In addition, the disease duration and the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were positively related to patients self-perceived illness severity. The results of the SEM analyses suggested that sex ( = 0.313, P < 0.001), self-perceived illness severity ( = 0.411, P < 0.001) and levels of inflammatory markers ( = 0.358, P = 0.002) had direct effects on patients mental health.

Unrelated benefits to resident education have accrued from those efforts, but, despite rigorous study of the issue, there is little evidence of a positive impact on patient safety resulting from trainee duty hours adjustments. Moreover, the discussion has become worrisomely myopic in its singular preoccupation with the impact of postgraduate medical education duty hours on safe patient care. The author argues that patient safety efforts should focus instead on the three essential elements of capacity, of which a discussion of duty hours and fatigue are an important part, commitment, and competence. Commitment requires altruism and professionalism, which are discouraged by a shift-work orientation. Competence is essential for safe patient care; as duty hours are constricted in the name of reducing fatigue-related medical error, it must be remembered that a certain amount of time is required to both acquire a knowledge base and attain proficiency in needed technical skills. Until a competency-based educational system can be implemented, the profession and patients would be well served by a heightened awareness of the increased number of years required in a constrained work hours environment to achieve proficiency in the independent practice of medicine, especially when procedural competence is required.

Based on real-life pandemic scenarios encountered in Germany, we develop and use a discrete-event simulation model to examine SC operations and performance dynamics with the help of anyLogistix digital SC twin. The computational results show that food retail SC resilience at the upheaval times is triangulated by the pandemic intensity and associated lockdown/shutdown governmental measures, inventory-ordering dynamics in the SC, and customer behaviours. We observe that surges in demand and supplier shutdowns have had the highest impact on SC operations and performance, whereas the impact of transportation disruptions was rather low. Transportation costs have spiked because of chaotic inventory-ordering dynamics leading to more frequent and irregular shipments. On bright side, we observe the demand growth and utilization of online sales channels yielding higher revenues. We propose several directions and practical implementation guidelines to improve the food retail SC resilience. We stress the importance of SC digital twins and end-to-end visibility along with resilient demand, inventory, and capacity management. The outcomes of our study can be instructive for enhancing the resilience of food retail SCs in preparation for future pandemics and pandemic-like crises.","output":"Food retail supply chain resilience and the COVID-19 pandemic: A digital twin-based impact analysis and improvement directions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is an airway disease that has affected ~125 million people worldwide, caused by a novel coronavirus termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), spread through respiratory droplets, direct contact, and aerosol transmission. Although most patients presenting with absent or mild symptoms recover completely, the highest morbidity and mortality rates are seen in the elderly, and patients with comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, immunosuppressive diseases, diabetes, and pre-existing respiratory illnesses. Several therapeutic strategies have been examined, but a wide-ranging therapeutic option for particularly severe cases of COVID-19 remains to be elucidated. Considering the indications presented by COVID-19 patients who present similarly with inflammatory conditions, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) administration has been examined as a possible route to reduce proinflammatory markers such as ESR, CRP and ferritin by reducing inflammation, based on its anti-inflammatory effects as indicated by utilisation of IVIG for numerous other inflammatory conditions. Herein, summarising the recent key clinical evaluations of IVIG administration, we present our hypothesis that administration of IVIG within a specific dosage would be extremely beneficial towards reducing mortality and perhaps even the length of hospitalisation of patients exhibiting severe COVID-19 symptoms.","output":"Application of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) to modulate inflammation in critical COVID-19 C A theoretical perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is challenging healthcare preparedness, world economies, and livelihoods. The infection and death rates associated with this pandemic are strikingly variable in different countries. To elucidate this discrepancy, we analyzed 2431 early spread SARS-CoV-2 sequences from GISAID. We estimated continental-wise admixture proportions, assessed haplotype block estimation, and tested for the presence or absence of strains' recombination. Herein, we identified 1010 unique missense mutations and seven different SARS-CoV-2 clusters. In samples from Asia, a small haplotype block was identified, whereas samples from Europe and North America harbored large and different haplotype blocks with nonsynonymous variants. Variant frequency and linkage disequilibrium varied among continents, especially in North America. Recombination between different strains was only observed in North American and European sequences. In addition, we structurally modelled the two most common mutations, Spike_D614G and Nsp12_P314L, which suggested that these linked mutations may enhance viral entry and replication, respectively. Overall, we propose that genomic recombination between different strains may contribute to SARS-CoV-2 virulence and COVID-19 severity and may present additional challenges for current treatment regimens and countermeasures.

Globally comparable, annual, local estimates of routine first-dose measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) coverage are critical for understanding geographically precise immunity patterns, progress towards the targets of the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP), and high-risk areas amid disruptions to vaccination programmes caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)(5C8). Here we generated annual estimates of routine childhood MCV1 coverage at 5  5-km(2) pixel and second administrative levels from 2000 to 2019 in 101 LMICs, quantified geographical inequality and assessed vaccination status by geographical remoteness. After widespread MCV1 gains from 2000 to 2010, coverage regressed in more than half of the districts between 2010 and 2019, leaving many LMICs far from the GVAP goal of 80% coverage in all districts by 2019. MCV1 coverage was lower in rural than in urban locations, although a larger proportion of unvaccinated children overall lived in urban locations; strategies to provide essential vaccination services should address both geographical contexts.

This study aims to investigate the link between density and pandemic spread through a case study of Tehran that has been the epicenter of the pandemic in Iran. Based on data obtained from an online platform and analyzed using structural equation modeling, we found that density alone cannot be considered a risk factor for the spread of COVID-19. In fact, density alone did not explain the geographic distribution pattern of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths across the 22 municipal districts of Tehran. We, therefore, argue that efforts should be made to minimize concerns about living in dense urban environments. Indeed, residents of high-density districts can live safely when an outbreak occurs, provided they make some changes in lifestyle and follow public health instructions.

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey carried out involving 1635 community dwellers across eight divisions in Bangladesh conducted from April 15, 2020 to May 10, 2020. A structured questionnaire incorporating socio-demographic, attitudes towards lockdown and adverse lifestyle amidst lockdown measures was employed to collect data using the Google Forms. Multiple regression analyses were executed to determine the associated factors of positive attitudes towards lockdown and adverse lifestyle. RESULTS: The mean scores of attitudes towards lockdown were 67.9 (SD = 8.4) out of 85 with an overall correct rate (positive attitudes) of 79.9%; whereas the mean scores of adverse lifestyle amidst lockdown were 16.1 (SD = 4.8) out of 34 with an overall rate of 47.4%.

An early and safe triage in the emergency department (ED) is especially crucial for proper therapy. Clinical symptoms of COVID-19 comprise those of many common diseases; thus, differential diagnosis remains challenging. METHOD: We performed a retrospective study of 314 ED patients presenting with conceivable COVID-19 symptoms during the first wave in Germany. All were tested for COVID-19 with SARS-Cov-2-nasopharyngeal swabs. Forty-seven patients were positive. We analyzed the 267 COVID-19 negative patients for their main diagnosis and compared COVID-19 patients with COVID-19 negative respiratory infections for differences in laboratory parameters, symptoms, and vital signs. RESULTS: Among the 267 COVID-19 negative patients, 42.7% had respiratory, 14.2% had other infectious, and 11.2% had cardiovascular diseases. Further, 9.0% and 6.7% had oncological and gastroenterological diagnoses, respectively.

This study used microarray-based transcriptomic analysis of PBMCs from experimentally infected pigs to explore the patterns of immune dysregulation after infection with two East European PRRSV strains from subtype 2 (BOR and ILI) in comparison to a Danish subtype 1 strain (DAN). Transcriptional profiles were determined at day 7 post infection in three tested groups of pigs and analysed in comparison with the expression profile of control group. Microarray analysis revealed differential regulation (> 1.5-fold change) of 4253 and 7335 genes in groups infected with BOR and ILI strains, respectively, and of 12518 genes in pigs infected with Danish strain. Subtype 2 PRRSV strains showed greater induction of many genes, especially those involved in innate immunity, such as interferon stimulated antiviral genes and inflammatory markers. Functional analysis of the microarray data revealed a significant up-regulation of genes involved in processes such as acute phase response, granulocyte and agranulocyte adhesion and diapedesis, as well as down-regulation of genes enrolled in pathways engaged in protein synthesis, cell division, as well as B and T cell signaling. This study provided an insight into the host response to three different PRRSV strains at a molecular level and demonstrated variability between strains of different pathogenicity level.

Given the diversity of these conditions and their complex interactions, our aim was to determine whether they could be structured into synthetic dimensions in order to facilitate the management of multimorbidity. DESIGN: The underlying structure of 10 GSs and 8 age-related diseases was identified using a multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), and confronted to subjective and objective health outcomes. SETTING: Community residents from Bordeaux City (France) older than 75 years in 2010 PARTICIPANTS: 630 adults aged 75+ years who lived in Bordeaux and participated in the 10-year follow-up of the Three-City study. MEASUREMENTS: GSs included physical frailty, cognitive impairment and dementia, dependency, depressive symptoms, polymedication, thinness, falls, sensory deficit, social isolation, incontinence. Age-related diseases were cancer, cardiac diseases, peripheral vascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension, pulmonary diseases, osteoporosis, other chronic diseases. Association of the MCA-derived independent dimensions was assessed with 10-year visit subjective health and well-being, and with incident death and entry into institution during the remaining cohort follow-up. RESULTS: Most of the participants (82%) had at least two age-related syndromes or diseases. The MCA structured the 18 conditions into three major dimensions: Degradation (D) driven by GS, Vascular (V), and Psychosocial (P) representing 68.7%, 7.4%, and 5.7% of the total variance, respectively. Dimension D was a strong predictor of future death and institutionalization. Dimensions D and P were strongly associated with current well-being. CONCLUSIONS: This work confirmed that multimorbidity is very common among older adults, and demonstrated the essential role of GS as manifestations of aging, even more than age-related diseases.","output":"Co-Occurrence of Geriatric Syndromes and Diseases in the General Population: Assessment of the Dimensions of Aging"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, societies face the formidable challenge of developing sustainable forms of sociability-cumsocial-distancing - enduring social life while containing the virus and preventing new outbreaks. Accordant public policies often balance between retributive (punishment-based) and assistance (solidarity-based) measures to foster responsible behaviour. Yet, the uncontrolled spreading of the disease has divided public opinion about which measures are best suited, and it has made salient group disparities in behaviour, potentially straining intergroup relations, elevating heated emotions, and undercutting coordinated international responses. In a 2  2 between-subjects experiment, British citizens (N = 377) read about national in-group or outgroup members (categorical differentiation), who were either conforming to or deviating from the corona regulations (normative differentiation). Participants then reported moral emotions towards the target national group and indicated support for public policies. In general, support for assistance policies outweighed support for retributive measures. Second, however, norm deviation was associated with less positive and more negative moral emotions, the latter category further relating to more punitiveness and less assistance support. Finally, respondents who read about norm-violating outgroup members especially reported support for retributive measures, indicating that people might use norm deviation to justify outgroup derogation.

Subunit vaccines use one or more antigens suitable for eliciting a robust immune response. However, the major concern is the efficacy of subunit vaccines and elicited antibodies to neutralize the variants of SARS-CoV-2 like B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta) and P1 (Gamma), B.1.617 (Delta) and C.37 (Lambda). The Spike protein (S) is a potential fragment for use as an antigen in vaccine development. This protein plays a crucial role in the first step of the infection process, as it binds to Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and enters the host cell after binding. Immunization-induced specific antibodies against the receptor binding domain (RBD) may block and effectively prevent virus invasion. The focus of this review is the impact of spike mutated variants of SARS-CoV2 (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Lambda) on the efficacy of subunit recombinant vaccines. To date, a low or no significant impact on vaccine efficacy against Alpha and Delta variants has been reported. Such an impact on vaccine efficacy for Beta, Delta, Gamma, and Lambda variants may be even greater compared to the Alpha variant. Nonetheless, more comprehensive analyses are needed to assess the real impact on vaccine efficacy brought about by SARS-CoV-2 variants.","output":"The impact of spike mutated variants of SARS-CoV2 [Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Lambda] on the efficacy of subunit recombinant vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Chest computed tomography (CT) provides an effective modality to evaluate patients with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, overlapping imaging findings with cardiogenic pulmonary edema is not uncommon. Reports comparing the chest CT features of these diseases have not been elaborated. Thus, we aimed to show the difference between the low-dose lung CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia and comparing them to those with acute heart failure (HF). Methods This retrospective analysis enrolled hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (n=10) and acute heart failure (n=9) that exclusively underwent low-dose chest CT scans within 24 hours of admission. Clinical and lung CT characteristics were collected and analyzed. Results The appearance of ground-glass-opacities (GGOs) has been recorded in all individuals in the HF and COVID-19 groups. There was no significant statistical difference between the two groups for rounded morphology, consolidation, crazy paving pattern, lesion distribution, and parenchymal band (P> 0.05). However, diffuse lesions were more frequent in HF cases (55.6% vs. 0%) than in COVID-19 pneumonia, which had a predominantly multifocal pattern. Notably, CT images in HF patients were more likely to have signs of interstitial tissue thickening, such as the interlobular septums, fissures, and peribronchovascular interstitium (55.6% vs 0%, 88.9% vs 20% and 44.4% vs 0%, respectively), as well as cardiomegaly (77.8% vs 0%), increased artery to bronchus ratio (55.6% vs 0%), and pleural effusions (77.8% vs 0%).

ICEES is equipped with basic features to support exploratory analysis using statistical approaches, such as bivariate chi-square tests. We recently developed a method for using ICEES to generate multivariate tables for subsequent application of machine learning and statistical models. The objective of the present study was to use this approach to identify predictors of asthma exacerbations through the application of three multivariate methods: conditional random forest, conditional tree, and generalized linear model. Among seven potential predictor variables, we found five to be of significant importance using both conditional random forest and conditional tree: prednisone, race, airborne particulate exposure, obesity, and sex. The conditional tree method additionally identified several significant two-way and three-way interactions among the same variables. When we applied a generalized linear model, we identified four significant predictor variables, namely prednisone, race, airborne particulate exposure, and obesity. When ranked in order by effect size, the results were in agreement with the results from the conditional random forest and conditional tree methods as well as the published literature. Our results suggest that the open multivariate analytic capabilities provided by ICEES are valid in the context of an asthma use case and likely will have broad value in advancing open research in environmental and public health.","output":"Open Application of Statistical and Machine Learning Models to Explore the Impact of Environmental Exposures on Health and Disease: An Asthma Use Case"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Under the global pandemic of COVID-19, the use of artificial intelligence to analyze chest X-ray (CXR) image for COVID-19 diagnosis and patient triage is becoming important.

An examination of their content will help to eliminate the existing negativity related to vaccine hesitancy through scientific methods. Hence, a systematic approach to the prevention of vaccine hesitancy worldwide can be developed. This article aims to survey how vaccine hesitancy is addressed in the PubMed articles about \\"vaccine hesitancy\\" over the novel coronavirus disease, for which the MeSH criteria have been published; to understand their recommendations for the prevention of vaccine hesitancy; to evaluate any related research described as \\"cross-sectional,\\" \\"case-control,\\" and \\"cohort\\" according to Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology criteria; and to contribute to the current literature on the subject. MATERIAL AND METHODS This study is planned to use a systematic review format and STROBE checklist was used to evaluate the articles accessed from PubMed database. Microsoft Excel was used as the data calculation tool. RESULTS Sixty-five (81.3%) of the 80 articles investigated in the scope of this study mention \\"vaccine.\\" While 64 articles (80%) discuss the determination of vaccine hesitancy, 57 (71.3%) articles address its prevention. The keyword \\"COVID-19\\" is used in 61 articles (79.2%). The second most frequently used keyword is \\"vaccine hesitancy\\" (n = 37, 48.1%), followed by \\"vaccine\\" (n = 25, 32.5%).

Traditionally, the acquisition of these skills is guided by an instructor, who adapts the training to the level of the trainee. However, due to the measures that are taken globally against the COVID19, a great number of training facilities have partially or completely restricted access to their trainers. To facilitate the practice of ballroom dance without the need of a human instructor nor human contact, this paper presents a mixed-reality human-machine interface that provides part practice of ballroom dance. It achieves it by fractionalizing the dance into only the footwork and conveying the tempo, position trajectory, and velocity trajectory with multimodal feedback. The multimodal feedback is generated with a floor projection, vibrotactile actuators, and a metronome, which provide visual, haptic, and auditory feedback. In an experiment with 15 participants, results suggest that the motor learning of dance skills occurs when visual and haptic feedback is present, whereas it is further improved when the three modalities (visual, haptic, and auditory) are employed during training. ? 2022 IEEE.","output":"Modality Influence on the Motor Learning of Ballroom Dance with a Mixed-Reality Human-Machine Interface"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"What would a romantic relationship between a biological human and an artificial intelligence system look like?

Market expectations plummeted, foreshadowing the risk of a global economic crisis and mass unemployment. Governments provide huge financial aid programmes to mitigate the economic shocks. To achieve higher effectiveness with such policy measures, it is key to identify the industries that are most in need of support. In this study, we introduce a data-mining approach to measure industry-specific risks related to COVID-19. We examine company risk reports filed to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This alternative data set can complement more traditional economic indicators in times of the fast-evolving crisis as it allows for a real-time analysis of risk assessments. Preliminary findings suggest that the companies' awareness towards corona-related business risks is ahead of the overall stock market developments. Our approach allows to distinguish the industries by their risk awareness towards COVID-19. Based on natural language processing, we identify corona-related risk topics and their perceived relevance for different industries. The preliminary findings are summarised as an up-to-date online index. The CoRisk-Index tracks the industry-specific risk assessments related to the crisis, as it spreads through the economy.

The rapid growth and the widespread diffusion of the digital business models seem to have received a sharp acceleration during the COVID-19 pandemic, due to social distancing and mobility restrictions, changing consumer shopping preferences, and the growing trend of working remotely. In this article, the author also recognizes the exceptional and unprecedented policy response undertaken by governments, central banks, supranational, and multilateral institutions in order to help mitigate the health, social, and economic consequences of the COVID-19 crisis and to support a coordinated, sustainable, and resilient economic recovery. The underlying argument of this article, supported by empirical evidences in the industries, is that the pandemic event, despite its severe health and social consequences, is becoming also a major catalyst of accelerated business and economic transformation towards the adoption of innovative and more digitally-driven business models in all industries. Among these innovations, some of the most relevant ones includes: AI-based innovations and industry 4.0 solutions, digital transformation, blockchain-based technologies, fintech and embedded finance innovations, and environmentally-friendly and socially-inclusive economic models. As a consequence of the disruptive pandemic event, firms are in fact, reinventing, redesigning, and reconfiguring their business models, value chains, and value networks relying increasingly more on digital and cloud-based technologies and on remote working, but also completely rethinking their cost structure, operations, supply chains, and customer experience journey in order to increase productivity, speed of innovation, profitability, customer knowledge through Big Data and Data Science, and to achieve also ambitious inclusion and sustainability goals.

Even though HIV testing is crucial for all strategies related to care, prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, we hypothesized that it is less practiced among university students, and, therefore, this study aimed to assess the uptake and factors associated with HIV testing in southern part of Italy. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from 1st to 31st July 2020 among undergraduate university students aged 18C29 years. Data were collected through an anonymous online questionnaire and included questions on socio-demographic and sexual history characteristics, knowledge and attitudes toward HIV infection, sexual and testing behaviors, and sources of information about HIV. FINDINGS: Among 1007 students, 41.5 and 54.7% knew that in Italy the test for early detection of HIV infection has not to be prescribed by a physician and that it is provided to anyone free of charge, respectively. Only 16.2% of the eligible students reported having ever tested for HIV and a very similar proportion (17.8%) was displayed among those who reported risky sexual behaviors. The multiple logistic regression analysis results indicated that the strongest predictor of HIV testing was attending medical or life sciences majors. INTERPRETATION: The uptake of HIV testing was low among Italian university students.

The initial clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infection are quite nonspecific and not all suspected patients can be tested to exclude or confirm the diagnosis. Increasing scientific evidence has shown that abnormalities in routine laboratory tests, particularly hematological tests, have the potential to indicate, in a quick, practical and economical way, the need for specific laboratory tests for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, besides assisting in the prognosis of the disease and in the optimization of its clinical monitoring. In order to address in a simple and practical way the various aspects related to SARS-CoV-2 infection, this review reports the history of the virus, the epidemiology and pathophysiology of COVID-19, with emphasis on its laboratory diagnosis, particularly in hematological changes found during the course of the disease.","output":"COVID-19: Review and hematologic impact"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Some theories of auditory categorization suggest that auditory dimensions that are strongly diagnostic for particular categories - for instance voice onset time or fundamental frequency in the case of some spoken consonants - attract attention. However, prior cognitive neuroscience research on auditory selective attention has largely focused on attention to simple auditory objects or streams, and so little is known about the neural mechanisms that underpin dimension-selective attention, or how the relative salience of variations along these dimensions might modulate neural signatures of attention. Here we investigate whether dimensional salience and dimension-selective attention modulate the cortical tracking of acoustic dimensions. In two experiments, participants listened to tone sequences varying in pitch and spectral peak frequency; these two dimensions changed at different rates. Inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) and amplitude of the EEG signal at the frequencies tagged to pitch and spectral changes provided a measure of cortical tracking of these dimensions. In Experiment 1, tone sequences varied in the size of the pitch intervals, while the size of spectral peak intervals remained constant. Cortical tracking of pitch changes was greater for sequences with larger compared to smaller pitch intervals, with no difference in cortical tracking of spectral peak changes. In Experiment 2, participants selectively attended to either pitch or spectral peak. Cortical tracking was stronger in response to the attended compared to unattended dimension for both pitch and spectral peak. These findings suggest that attention can enhance the cortical tracking of specific acoustic dimensions rather than simply enhancing tracking of the auditory object as a whole.","output":"Dimension-Selective Attention and Dimensional Salience Modulate Cortical Tracking of Acoustic Dimensions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Our objective was to conduct a systematic review of the literature to identify, categorise, assess, and synthesise the healthcare costs of patients with breast cancer (BC) and their relatives in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). METHODS In December 2020, we searched for published data in PubMed, LILACS, EMBASE, and other sources, including the grey literature. Studies were eligible if they were conducted in LAC and reported the direct medical costs, productivity loss costs, out-of-pocket expenditure, and other costs to patients with BC and their relatives. No restrictions were imposed on the type of BC population (metastatic BC or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive/negative BC, among others). We summarised the characteristics and methodological approach of each study and the healthcare costs by cancer stage. We also developed and applied an original ad hoc instrument to assess the quality of the cost estimation studies. RESULTS We identified 2725 references and 63 included studies. In total, 79.3% of the studies solely reported direct medical costs and five solely reported costs to patients and their relatives. Only 14.3% of the studies were classified as of high quality. The pooled weighted average direct medical cost per patient-year (year 2020 international dollars [I$]) by BC stage was I$13,179 for stage I, I$15,556 for stage II, I$23,444 for stage III, and I$28,910 for stage IV. CONCLUSION This review provides the first synthesis of BC costs in LAC. Our findings show few high-quality costing studies in BC and a gap in the literature measuring costs to patients and their relatives. The high costs associated with the advanced stages of BC call into question the affordability of treatments and their accessibility for patients.

Some previous evidence has suggested COVID-19-associated strokes are more severe with worse outcomes for patients, but further studies are needed to confirm these findings. The aim of this study was to determine the association between COVID-19 and mortality for patients with ischaemic stroke in a large multicentre study. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using electronic medical records of inpatients from 50 healthcare organizations, predominately from the USA. Patients with ischaemic stroke within 30 days of COVID-19 were identified. COVID-19 was determined from diagnosis codes or a positive test result identified with CO-VID-19-specific laboratory codes between January 20, 2020, and October 1, 2020. Historical controls with ischaemic stroke without COVID-19 were identified in the period January 20, 2019, to October 1, 2019. 1:1 propensity score matching was used to balance the cohorts with and without CO-VID-19 on characteristics including age, sex, race and comorbidities. Kaplan-Meier survival curves for all-cause 60-day mortality by COVID-19 status were produced. RESULTS: During the study period, there were 954 inpatients with ischaemic stroke and COVID-19. During the same time period in 2019, there were 48,363 inpatients with ischaemic stroke without COVID-19 (historical controls). Compared to patients with ischaemic stroke without COVID-19, patients with ischaemic stroke and COVID-19 had a lower mean age, had a lower prevalence of white patients, a higher prevalence of black or African American patients and a higher prevalence of hypertension, previous cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, ischaemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease, neoplasms, and mental disorders due to known physiological conditions. After propensity score matching, there were 952 cases and 952 historical controls; cases and historical controls were better balanced on all included characteristics (all p > 0.05). After propensity score matching, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed the survival probability was significantly lower in ischaemic stroke patients with COVID-19 (78.3% vs. 91.0%, log-rank test p < 0.0001). The odds of 60-day mortality were significantly higher for patients with ischaemic stroke and COVID-19 compared to the propensity score-matched historical controls (odds ratio: 2.51 [95% confidence interval 1.88-3.34]).

In the field of veterinary medical big data, information collected from companion animals, primarily dogs, can be used to inform healthcare decisions in both dogs and other species. Currently, veterinary medical datasets are an underused resource for translational research, but recent advances in data collection in this population have helped to make these data more accessible for use in translational studies. The largest open access dataset in the United States is part of the Dog Aging Project and includes detailed information about individual dog participants physical and chemical environments, diet, exercise, behavior, and comprehensive health history. These data are collected longitudinally and at regular intervals over the course of the dogs lifespan. Large-scale datasets such as this can be used to inform our understanding of health, disease, and how to increase healthy lifespan. ABSTRACT: Dogs provide an ideal model for study as they have the most phenotypic diversity and known naturally occurring diseases of all non-human land mammals. Thus, data related to dog health present many opportunities to discover insights into health and disease outcomes. Here, we describe several sources of veterinary medical big data that can be used in research. These sources include medical records from primary medical care centers or referral hospitals, medical claims data from animal insurance companies, and datasets constructed specifically for research purposes. No data source provides information that is without limitations, but large-scale, prospective, longitudinally collected data from dog populations are ideal for further research as they offer many advantages over other data sources.","output":"Veterinary Big Data: When Data Goes to the Dogs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This first International Alliance for Biological Standardization Covid-19 webinar brought together a broad range of international stakeholders, including academia, regulators, funders and industry, with a considerable delegation from low- and middle-income countries, to discuss the virology, epidemiology and immunology of, and the vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2.","output":"SARS-CoV-2: Virology, epidemiology, immunology and vaccine development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The virulence of genotype I (GI) Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is under debate.

However, another evolving focus is assessing and mitigating the risk of vertical transmission amongst COVID-19-positive mothers. The objective of this review was to summarize the current evidence on the vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection in the third trimester and its effects on the neonate.Methods: OVID MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trial (CENTRAL) were searched from January 2020 to May 2020, with continuous surveillance.Results: 18 studies met the inclusion criteria, consisting of 157 mothers and 160 neonates. The mean age of the pregnant patients was 30.8 years and the mean gestational period was 37 weeks and 1 d. Currently, there is currently no conclusive evidence to suggest that vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs. Amongst 81 (69%) neonates who were tested for SARS-CoV-2, 5 (6%) had a positive result. However, amongst these 5 neonates, the earliest test was performed at 16 h after birth, and only 1 neonate was positive when they were later re-tested. However, this neonate initially tested negative at birth, suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2 infection was likely hospital-acquired rather than vertically transmitted. 13 (8%) neonates had complications or symptoms.Conclusions: The findings of this rapid descriptive review based on early clinical evidence suggest that vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mother to neonate/newborn did not occur.

At the end of 2019, COVID-19 emerged as a previously unknown respiratory disease in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The world health organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic in the second week of March 2020. Simultaneous deep learning detection and classification of COVID-19 based on the full resolution of digital X-ray images is the key to efficiently assisting patients by enabling physicians to reach a fast and accurate diagnosis decision. In this paper, a simultaneous deep learning computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system based on the YOLO predictor is proposed that can detect and diagnose COVID-19, differentiating it from eight other respiratory diseases: atelectasis, infiltration, pneumothorax, masses, effusion, pneumonia, cardiomegaly, and nodules. The proposed CAD system was assessed via five-fold tests for the multi-class prediction problem using two different databases of chest X-ray images: COVID-19 and ChestX-ray8. The proposed CAD system was trained with an annotated training set of 50,490 chest X-ray images. The regions on the entire X-ray images with lesions suspected of being due to COVID-19 were simultaneously detected and classified end-to-end via the proposed CAD predictor, achieving overall detection and classification accuracies of 96.31% and 97.40%, respectively. Most test images from patients with confirmed COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases were correctly predicted, achieving average intersection over union (IoU) greater than 90%. Applying deep learning regularizers of data balancing and augmentation improved the COVID-19 diagnostic performance by 6.64% and 12.17% in terms of the overall accuracy and the F1-score, respectively. It is feasible to achieve a diagnosis based on individual chest X-ray images with the proposed CAD system within 0.0093 s. Thus, the CAD system presented in this paper can make a prediction at the rate of 108 frames/s (FPS), which is close to real-time. The proposed deep learning CAD system can reliably differentiate COVID-19 from other respiratory diseases. The proposed deep learning model seems to be a reliable tool that can be used to practically assist health care systems, patients, and physicians.","output":"Fast deep learning computer-aided diagnosis of COVID-19 based on digital chest x-ray images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a preemptive response to the widespread need for respiratory medical devices developing in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, we propose a low-cost incentive spirometer for respiratory rehabilitation in patients with reduced lung function.

Operating in accordance with governing physical formulae including Ohm's law and the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, Paperometer is intended to improve the user's lung function through repeated use of the device, which facilitates slow, deep breaths of air. Several prototypes were created based on a list of design criteria established through background research and stakeholder interviews. From four initial prototypes, all created predominantly from simple foldable geometries, one design was selected for further iteration. The most promising functional prototype was crafted from recyclable plastic and paper folded into various shapes including a box, tube, and pinwheel.

Physical tethering of these molecular machines during translocation, in conjunction with their internal architectural features, generates DNA topological strain in the form of template supercoiling. It is known that the build-up of transient excessive supercoiling poses severe threats to genome function and stability and that highly specialized enzymes-the topoisomerases (TOP)-have evolved to mitigate these threats. Furthermore, due to their intracellular abundance and fast supercoil relaxation rates, it is generally assumed that these enzymes are sufficient in coping with genome-wide bursts of excessive supercoiling. However, the recent discoveries of chromatin architectural factors that play important accessory functions have cast reasonable doubts on this concept. Here, we reviewed the background of these new findings and described emerging models of how these accessory factors contribute to supercoil homeostasis. We focused on DNA replication and the generation of positive (+) supercoiling in front of replisomes, where two accessory factors-GapR and HMGA2-from pro- and eukaryotic cells, respectively, appear to play important roles as sinks for excessive (+) supercoiling by employing a combination of supercoil constrainment and activation of topoisomerases. Looking forward, we expect that additional factors will be identified in the future as part of an expanding cellular repertoire to cope with bursts of topological strain. Furthermore, identifying antagonists that target these accessory factors and work synergistically with clinically relevant topoisomerase inhibitors could become an interesting novel strategy, leading to improved treatment outcomes.","output":"Chromatin Architectural Factors as Safeguards against Excessive Supercoiling during DNA Replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic has affected the global socioeconomic and healthcare infrastructure.

Previously described long term sequelae include cerebral vascular accidents, liver and kidney disease, and psychological disease, albeit without a consistent pattern of presentation. Recently, several cases have been published regarding multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children following known SARS-CoV2 infection. There has been one reported case of post-infectious Kawasaki-like illness in an adult. We present a patient with a similar multisystem inflammatory reaction, giving support for a Kawasaki-like disease in adults post-SARS-CoV2. Case description: A 27-year-old male with history of mild SARS-CoV2 infection one month prior without respiratory distress presented with fevers, abdominal pain, vomiting, and headache. Physical exam revealed injected bilateral conjunctiva, cheilitis, cervical lymphadenopathy, nuchal rigidity, a morbilliform rash on chest and hands, bilateral hand edema, and suprapubic tenderness. An abdominal CT scan suggested pyelonephritis and prostatitis. Hepatocellular and cholestatic markers were elevated without serological evidence of viral hepatitis. ESR, CRP, ferritin, LDH, d-dimer, and IL-6 were all elevated. SARS-CoV2 PCR was negative but IgG was positive. Blood, urine, and lumbar puncture studies were negative for bacterial, fungal, viral, and tick-borne evidence of infection. Rheumatologic workup was unremarkable. He developed hypotension requiring vasopressor support. ECG was notable for new-onset atrial fibrillation and echocardiogram showed systolic dysfunction with global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 45-50%. Cardiac MRI did not show evidence of myocarditis or infiltrative disease. Morning cortisol was low consistent with adrenal insufficiency and started on hydrocortisone. All his symptoms began to resolve with steroid therapy. One month after discharge, he was found to be in normal sinus rhythm. He experienced full resolution of his symptoms other than visual field disturbances with occasional floaters deemed to be of unknown etiology following complete neurologic and ophthalmologic workup. Repeat echocardiogram continued to show global systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 40-45%. The patient continued on goal directed medical therapy and hydrocortisone therapy. Discussion: Post inflammatory conditions secondary to SARS-CoV2 have not been well described in adults. We present a patient whose post SARS-CoV2 inflammatory syndrome mimics the known pediatric post-inflammatory state, including characteristic timing, exam and laboratory findings, and resolution with steroid therapy. Further description of similar presentations is needed to better gauge the incidence of this inflammatory syndrome in young adults.","output":"Severe post-sars-cov2 multisystem inflammatory syndrome mimicking kawasaki disease shock syndrome in a young adult"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by novel coronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was initially identified as the cause of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China and has now rapidly spread throughout the world causing a pandemic. Although, 81% of patients have mild disease (pneumonia), 14% could have severe disease leading to hospitalization and 5% end up in intensive care unit. The mortality of patients in ICU is variable and has been reported to be as high as 80%, particularly the patient who require intubation. Not much is known about the factors leading to progression of hospitalized patient needing ICU care and the predictors of mortality among ICU patients. We did the univariate followed by multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine the predictors of mortality in ICU. Method: Retrospective data were collected from consecutive 101 patients admitted from March, 2020 to June, 2020. Data were collected from 5 different community hospitals in Eastern Virginia with varied demographics. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was done to determine the factors associated with progression of hospitalized patient to ICU and the predictors of mortality in ICU. Result: Total 101 consecutive hospitalized patients in 5 community hospitals in Eastern Virginia were enrolled in the study. Total 52/101 patients were admitted into the ICU for respiratory failure. Of these, 40 patients required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Altogether, 32/52 patients died. Of these 32 patients, 25 had required intubation. Total 22/25 (88%) intubated patients passed away while 3 were successfully extubated. Of these 32 patients, one had mild ARDS, 6 had moderate ARDS and 18 had severe ARDS. Patients aged 60 years and above accounted for &gt;2/3rd of the cases in ICU;mortality rate was higher in this age group as well. The inflammatory markers (CRP, D-dimer, Ferritin) peaked on day 8. The medications like Hydroxychloroquine, Azithromycin, Tocilizumab and Remdesivir did not alter the outcomes. Logistic regression analysis (univariate and multivariate) were done in the patients to determine the predictors of ICU admission from floor or ED. Logistic regression analysis was also done in the patients admitted to the ICU to look for the predictors of mortality. Conclusion: Based on logistic regression, none of the demographics (age, sex, race), symptoms, laboratory findings, chest imaging, ventilator settings or treatment identified the predictors of mortality in ICU in patients with COVID 19.","output":"Predictors of ICU admission and mortality in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID 19) in community hospitals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A local outbreak of unknown pneumonia was detected in Wuhan (Hubei, China) in December 2019.

We sought to evaluate the frequency at which alternative pedicle maneuvers were required for these reconstructions and determine if there was any association with flap survival or postoperative complications. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective review at three tertiary care institutions. METHODS Database review. RESULTS Free flap reconstruction of the upper and midface was performed in 295 patients (108 bony, 187 soft tissue). In 82% of cases, the vessels reached the ipsilateral neck for anastomosis to traditional target vessels. Arterial grafts were required in 2% of reconstructions (4% bony and 1% soft tissue). Venous grafting was required in 7% of reconstructions (21% fibula, 16% scapula, and 3% soft tissue) and was associated with an increase in flap failure rate (19% vs 3%, P = .003). The most common recipient artery for revascularization was the cervical facial artery (78%). Alternate recipient vessels were selected in 13% of cases, including the superficial temporal vessels (7%), distal facial branches through a separate facial incision (4%), and angular vessels (2%). Vein grafting was associated with a higher flap failure rate. Alternative maneuvers did not affect need for intraoperative pedicle revision or complications. CONCLUSIONS In upper and midface reconstruction, vascular grafting, targeting more distal branches of the facial system, or additional maneuvers to optimize pedicle orientation is often required to secure revascularization. Vein grafting is associated with a higher free flap failure rate. Scapular border flaps often require vascular grafting or atypical anastomotic locations.

The marked increase in the understanding of the virus and the disease within such a short time has allowed the development of diagnostic tests, animal models, antivirals, vaccines, and epidemiological and infection control measures, which could prove to be useful in randomized control trials if SARS should return. The findings that horseshoe bats are the natural reservoir for SARS-CoV-like virus and that civets are the amplification host highlight the importance of wildlife and biosecurity in farms and wet markets, which can serve as the source and amplification centers for emerging infections.","output":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus as an agent of emerging and reemerging infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstact Purpose: To provide an overview of the feasibility and outcomes of robotic-assisted upper extremity training for individuals with cervical spinal cord injury (SCI), and to identify gaps in current research and articulate future research directions. MATERIALS AND METHODS A systematic search was conducted using Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CCTR, CDSR, CINAHL and PubMed on June 7, 2017. Search terms included 3 themes: (1) robotics; (2) SCI; (3) upper extremity. Studies using robots for upper extremity rehabilitation among individuals with cervical SCI were included. Identified articles were independently reviewed by two researchers and compared to pre-specified criteria. Disagreements regarding article inclusion were resolved through discussion. The modified Downs and Black checklist was used to assess article quality. Participant characteristics, study and intervention details, training outcomes, robot features, study limitations and recommendations for future studies were abstracted from included articles. RESULTS Twelve articles (one randomized clinical trial, six case series, five case studies) met the inclusion criteria. Five robots were exoskeletons and three were end-effectors. Sample sizes ranged from 1 to 17 subjects. Articles had variable quality, with quality scores ranging from 8 to 20. Studies had a low internal validity primarily from lack of blinding or a control group. Individuals with mild-moderate impairments showed the greatest improvements on body structure/function and performance-level measures. This review is limited by the small number of articles, low-sample sizes and the diversity of devices and their associated training protocols, and outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS Preliminary evidence suggests robot-assisted interventions are safe, feasible and can reduce active assistance provided by therapists. Implications for rehabilitation Robot-assisted upper extremity training for individuals with cervical spinal cord injury is safe, feasible and can reduce hands-on assistance provided by therapists. Future research in robotics rehabilitation with individuals with spinal cord injury is needed to determine the optimal device and training protocol as well as effectiveness.","output":"Robot-assisted upper extremity rehabilitation for cervical spinal cord injuries: a systematic scoping review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Indoor air pollution is one of the human health threat problems in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. In these countries, due to unfavorable meteorological conditions, such as elevated ambient temperature, high relative humidity, and natural events such as dust storms, people spend a substantial amount of their time in indoor environments. In addition, production of physical and biological aerosols from air conditioners, cooking activities, burning of Arabian incense, and overcrowding due to pilgrimage programs are common causes of low quality indoor air in this region. Thus, due to infiltration of outdoor sources as well as various indoor sources, people living in the GCC countries are highly exposed to indoor air pollutants. Inhalation of indoor air pollutants causes mortalities and morbidities attributed to cardiorespiratory, pulmonary, and lung cancer diseases. Hence, the aim of this review study is to provide a summary of the major findings of indoor air pollution studies in different microenvironments in six GCC countries. These include characterization of detected indoor air pollutants, exposure concentration levels, source identifications, sustainable building designs and ventilation systems, and the mitigation strategies. To do so, >130 relevant indoor air pollution studies across the GCC countries were critically reviewed. Particulate matters (PM(10) and PM(2.5)), total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs), carbon dioxide (CO(2)), sulfur dioxide (SO(2)), nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), and heavy metals were identified as the reported indoor air pollutants. Apart from them, indoor Radon and bioaerosols were studied only in specific GCC countries. Thus, future studies should also focus on the investigation of emerging indoor air pollutants, such as ultrafine and nanoparticles and their associated health effects. Furthermore, studies on the mitigation of indoor air pollution through the development of advanced air purification and ventilation systems could improve the indoor air quality (IAQ) in the GCC region.","output":"Indoor air pollution and exposure assessment of the gulf cooperation council countries: A critical review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus causing COVID-19. The clinical characteristics and epidemiology of COVID-19 have been extensively investigated, however, only one study so far focused on the patients nasopharynx microbiota. In this study we investigated the nasopharynx microbial community of patients that developed different severity levels of COVID-19. We performed 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing from nasopharyngeal swab samples obtained from SARS-CoV-2 positive (56) and negative (18) patients in the province of Alicante (Spain) in their first visit to the hospital. Positive SARS-CoV-2 patients were observed and later categorized in mild (symptomatic without hospitalization), moderate (hospitalization), and severe (admission to ICU). We compared the microbiota diversity and OTU composition among severity groups and built bacterial co-abundance networks for each group. RESULTS: Statistical analysis indicated differences in the nasopharyngeal microbiome of COVID19 patients. 62 OTUs were found exclusively in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, mostly classified as members of the phylum Bacteroidota (18) and Firmicutes (25). OTUs classified as Prevotella were found to be significantly more abundant in patients that developed more severe COVID-19. Furthermore, co-abundance analysis indicated a loss of network complexity among samples from patients that later developed more severe symptoms. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that the nasopharyngeal microbiome of COVID-19 patients showed differences in the composition of specific OTUs and complexity of co-abundance networks. Taxa with differential abundances among groups could serve as biomarkers for COVID-19 severity. Nevertheless, further studies with larger sample sizes should be conducted to validate these results.","output":"Nasopharyngeal Microbial Communities of Patients Infected With SARS-CoV-2 That Developed COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bcakground: This study was to investigate the clinical characteristics and prognosis of COVID-19 patients combined with or without major chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension or coronary.

Patients were divided into simple COVID-19 group(n=134), COVID-19 combined with diabetes, hypertension or coronary group(n=49). Besides, COVID-19 patients with diabetes, hypertension or coronary were further classified into severe pneumonia group(n=23) and common pneumonia group(n=26), death group(n=17) and survival group(n=32). The prognosis of COVID-19 patients was evaluated by analyzing the clinical data and the results of laboratory tests. Results: 183 patients were included in this study, of whom 166 were discharged and 16 died in hospital. 49 (26.92%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common [37 (20.33%) patients], followed by diabetes [25 (13.74%) patients] and coronary heart disease [4 (2.2%) patients]. Compared with simple COVID-19 group, the proportion of history of chronic respiratory system disease, age, D-dimer, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, myoglobin, cardiac troponin I, creatine kinase MB, lactate dehydrogenase, white blood cell count, neutrophil count, neutrophil percentage, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine and mortality rate were significantly higher in COVID-19 combined with chronic diseases group, whereas lymphocyte count, lymphocyte percentage and alanine transferase were significantly lower in COVID-19 combined with chronic diseases group. Among COVID-19 patients with chronic diseases, D-dimer, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, myoglobin, cardiac troponin I, lactate dehydrogenase, white blood cell count, neutrophil count, neutrophil percentage, blood urea nitrogen, death rate was significantly higher in severe pneumonia group than common pneumonia group. While lymphocyte count and lymphocyte percentage were significantly lower in severe pneumonia group than common pneumonia group. Besides, we found that the proportion of history of chronic respiratory system disease, D-dimer, procalcitonin, myoglobin, cardiac troponin I, creatine kinase MB, lactate dehydrogenase, neutrophil count, neutrophil percentage, blood urea nitrogen were significantly higher in death group compared with survival group, whereas lymphocyte count and lymphocyte percentage were significantly lower in survival group. In COVID-19 combined with chronic diseases group, univariate logistic regression showed that the risk for severe pneumonia were D-dimer, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, white blood cell count, neutrophil count and neutrophil percentage. Univariate logistic regression also showed that the risk for death were D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, white blood cell count, neutrophil count, neutrophil percentage and blood urea nitrogen. Multivariate regression logistic showed that lactate dehydrogenase were independent risk factors for death among COVID-19 patients combined with chronic diseases. Cox regression analysis showed that compared with simple COVID-19 group, the RR(95% CI) in COVID-19 patients combined with diabetes, hypertension, and coronary were 2.187 (1.141~4.191) for death (P<0.05). Conclusion: Among COVID-19 patients combined with diabetes, hypertension or coronary, the risk factors for severe pneumonia were D-dimer, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, white blood cell count, neutrophil count and neutrophil percentage, whereas the risk factors for death were D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, white blood cell count, neutrophil count, neutrophil percentage and blood urea nitrogen.

Whether this translates to improvement of the quality of the resected specimen is not yet clear. The aim of the study was to compare the quality of the TME and the short-term oncological outcome between robotic and laparoscopic rectal cancer resections. METHODS 20 consecutive robotic TME performed in a single institution for rectal cancer (Rob group) were matched 1:2 to 40 laparoscopic resections (Lap group) for gender, body mass index (BMI), and distance from anal verge on rigid proctoscopy. The quality of TME was assessed by 2 blinded and independent pathologists and reported according to international standardized guidelines. RESULTS Both samples were well matched for gender, BMI (median 25.9 vs. 24.2 kg/m(2), p = 0.24), and level of the tumor (4.1 vs. 4.8 cm, p = 0.20). The quality of the TME was better in the Robotic group (complete TME: 95 vs. 55 %; p = 0.0003, nearly complete TME 5 vs. 37 %; p = 0.04, incomplete TME 0 vs. 8 %, p = 0.09). A trend for lower positive circumferential margin was observed in the Robotic group (10 vs. 25 %, p = 0.1).

As prior research demonstrated a survival benefit among patients screened for symptoms using the Edmonton symptom assessment system (ESAS), this study aims to examine the association between being ESAS\\\\screened and the risk of mortality across varying intensity levels of pre\\\\diagnosis psychiatric care utilization. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective matched cohort study using population\\\\wide administrative databases. All patients diagnosed with cancer in Ontario, Canada, from January 2007 to December 2015 were identified. Propensity score matching was used to pair ESAS\\\\screened individuals to those not screened. Pairs were also hard matched on a pre\\\\diagnosis psychiatric care utilization gradient. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model was implemented to estimate the association between ESAS and mortality, for each intensity level of pre\\\\diagnosis psychiatric care. RESULTS: The matched cohort consisted of 119,806 patient pairs (ESAS\\\\screened and not screened), of whom 54,468 (45.5%) pairs had prior outpatient psychiatric care and 2249 (1.8%) pairs had experienced emergency department visits or had been hospitalized for psychiatric care. Overall being exposed to ESAS was significantly associated with a 51% decrease in the hazard of mortality (HR 0.49, 95%CI 0.48C0.50, p\\\\value <0.0001). This association was similar across all levels of prior psychiatric use, however, there was no evidence of a differential impact. CONCLUSION: In addition to routinely monitoring symptom severity, including depression, among patients with cancer, it is also important to identify those with preexisting psychiatric comorbidities at the time of diagnosis. This information can be used to ensure that timely and appropriate psycho\\\\oncology services and psycho\\\\social supports are offered to help the patient and their family cope during the cancer disease trajectory.","output":"The impact of symptom screening on survival among patients with cancer across varying levels of pre\\\\diagnosis psychiatric care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: To explore the peripheral blood cells (neutrophil/monocyte/lymphocyte/platelet) to apolipoprotein AI or high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ratio (NAR, MAR, LAR, PAR, NHR, MHR, LHR, and PHR) as independent prognostic indicators for stage III nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Patients and methods: Between 2009 and 2014, 562 patients diagnosed with stage III NPC who were treated with a concomitant chemotherapy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy with cumulative cisplatin dose 200 mg/m2 were included in this retrospective study. Routine blood and biochemical variables and baseline clinical characteristics (T and N stage, age, sex, and induction chemotherapy) were collected.

N-linked glycans are synthesized from Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 precursors that are trimmed and modified in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus by glycoside hydrolases and glycosyltransferases. Endo--1,2-mannosidase (MANEA) is the sole endo-acting glycoside hydrolase involved in N-glycan trimming and unusually is located within the Golgi, where it allows ER escaped glycoproteins to bypass the classical N-glycosylation trimming pathway involving ER glucosidases I and II. There is considerable interest in the use of small molecules that disrupt N-linked glycosylation as therapeutic agents for diseases such as cancer and viral infection. Here we report the structure of the catalytic domain of human MANEA and complexes with substrate-derived inhibitors, which provide insight into dynamic loop movements that occur upon substrate binding. We reveal structural features of the human enzyme that explain its substrate preference and the mechanistic basis for catalysis. The structures inspired the development of new inhibitors that disrupted host protein N-glycan processing of viral glycans and reduced infectivity of bovine viral diarrhea and dengue viruses in cellular models. These results may contribute to efforts of developing broad-spectrum antiviral agents and bring about a more detailed view of the biology of mammalian glycosylation. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The glycosylation of proteins is a major protein modification that occurs extensively in eukaryotes. Glycosidases in the secretory pathway that trim N-linked glycans play a key role in protein quality control and in the specific modifications leading to mature glycoproteins. Inhibition of glucosidases in the secretory pathway is a proven therapeutic strategy, and one with great promise in the treatment of viral disease. The enzyme endo--1,2-mannosidase, MANEA, provides an alternative processing pathway to evade glucosidase inhibitors. We report the 3D structure of human MANEA and complexes with enzyme inhibitors that we show act as antivirals for bovine viral diarrhea and human dengue viruses. The structure of MANEA will support inhibitor optimization and the development of more potent antivirals.","output":"Structure of human endo--1,2-mannosidase (MANEA), an antiviral host-glycosylation target"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Obesity is a major global concern with more than 2.1 billion people overweight or obese worldwide which amounts to almost 30% of the global population. If the current trend continues, the overweight and obese population is likely to increase to 41% by 2030. Individuals developing signs of weight gain or obesity are also at a risk of developing serious illnesses such as type 2 diabetes, respiratory problems, heart disease and stroke. Some intervention measures such as physical activity and healthy eating can be a fundamental component to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Therefore, it is absolutely essential to detect childhood obesity as early as possible. This paper utilises the vast amount of data available via UKs millennium cohort study in order to construct a machine learning driven model to predict young people at the risk of becoming overweight or obese. The childhood BMI values from the ages 3, 5, 7 and 11 are used to predict adolescents of age 14 at the risk of becoming overweight or obese. There is an inherent imbalance in the dataset of individuals with normal BMI and the ones at risk. The results obtained are encouraging and a prediction accuracy of over 90% for the target class has been achieved.

For this study, the public data set \\"COVID analytics\\" was used, which provided all the necessary medical information and the classification of the groups, which are then interpreted as useful labels to better deduce the degree of mortality of the affected person. After completing the data analysis, it is determined that the factors that aggravate the condition of a patient with COVID19 are: hypertension, advanced age and any other disease.","output":"Subgroup classification model identifying the most influential factors in the mortality of patients with COVID-19 using data analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) focuses on many diseases that place disparate burdens on minority groups and the poor, such as obesity, diabetes, and kidney disease.

Small studies have shown an effect of glucocorticoids on inflammatory marker levels, but definitive proof is lacking. We investigated the influence of prednisone on inflammatory biomarkers in a previous multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial that compared a 7-day treatment course of 50-mg prednisone to placebo in patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia. We compared levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), leukocyte and neutrophil count between patients with and without glucocorticoid treatment at baseline and on days 3, 5, and 7 and at discharge by Wilcoxon tests and analysis of variance. A total of 356 patient data sets in the prednisone group and 355 in the placebo group were available for analysis. Compared to placebo, use of prednisone was associated with reductions in levels of CRP on days 3, 5, and 7 (mean difference of 46%, P < .001 for each time point). For PCT, no such difference was observed. Leukocyte and neutrophil count were higher in the prednisone group at all time points (mean difference of 27% for leukocytes and 33% for neutrophils, P <.001 for all time points). We conclude that after administration of glucocorticoids in community-acquired pneumonia, patients had lower CRP levels and increased leukocyte and neutrophil count as compared to the placebo group. PCT levels were not different between treatment groups. PCT levels thus may more appropriately mirror the resolution of infection compared to more traditional inflammatory markers.","output":"Influence of Prednisone on Inflammatory Biomarkers in Community-Acquired Pneumonia: Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Four new HLA class I alleles were characterized by next-generation sequencing and haplotypes determined.

Methods: We conduct data-driven and model-free estimations for the growth rates of the COVID-19 epidemics in Italy and Canada, by fitting an exponential curve to the daily reported cases. We use these estimates to predict epidemic trends in Canada under different scenarios of public health interventions. Results: In Italy, the initial growth rate (0.22) has reduced to 0.1 two weeks after the lockdown of the country on March 8th ,2020. This corresponds to an increase of the doubling time from about 3.15 to almost 7 days. In comparison, the growth rate in Canada has increased from 0.13 between March 1st and 13th, to 0.25 between March 13th to 22nd. This current growth rate corresponds to a doubling time of 2.7 days, and therefore, unless further public health interventions are escalated in Canada, we project 15,000 cases by March 31st. However, the case number may be reduced to 4000 if escalated public health interventions could instantly reduce the growth rate to 0.1, the same level achieved in Italy. Interpretation: Prompt and farsighted interventions are critical to counteract the very rapid initial growth of the COVID-19 epidemic in Canada. Mitigation plans must take into account the delayed effect of interventions by up to 2-weeks and the short doubling time of 3C4 days.","output":"Canada needs to rapidly escalate public health interventions for its COVID-19 mitigation strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the development of high-throughput sequencing technology, biological sequence data reflecting life information becomes increasingly accessible.

Pretraining models are used for embedding biological sequence and extracting feature from large biological sequence corpus to comprehensively understand the biological sequence data. In this survey, we provide a broad review on pretraining models for biological sequence data. Moreover, we first introduce biological sequences and corresponding datasets, including brief description and accessible link. Subsequently, we systematically summarize popular pretraining models for biological sequences based on four categories: CNN, word2vec, LSTM and Transformer. Then, we present some applications with proposed pretraining models on downstream tasks to explain the role of pretraining models.

This book is part of that chorus, that march, to express appreciation for the giving of care. And beyond doctors and nurses, bless their hearts, to mothers caring for their babies, for captains for their teams, for the soon-to-be widowers for their wives and teachers for their students, but also for the ranchers for their cattle and the contemplative world for our environment. This is a book to think more closely of the support for care, individual as it so often will be, to be woven more closely together in a paradigm of care. Care is always prominent. Care for others, of the family, care for those of the tribe, care for animals and homes and gardens and properties, self-care. And the purse. Even without teaching, compensation, or legislation, care survives, but even with these helpings, it falls short of the need. We live in a crisis of care. Thinking explicitly and beyond health care. There is no mechanism of state and conscience that delivers care to all the venues of need, and seldom in the amounts needed. The reservoirs of care are far from empty, but at a mark that needs topping up. There is need for care advocacy, a care ethic, a paradigm. This book is about that paradigm. A care paradigm may bring comfort and recovery more fully to the people and organic creations of the world. The paradigm hears the moan of indifference. It draws upon the eyes of the heart. The paradigm is about how we see the need for care. The care paradigm, the grand beholding, is manifest in how we provide for others, how we nurture them, give succor, how we are disposed, and are not, to sacrifice to relieve their hurt. It is not only caring for those visibly needing care, unable to care for themselves, but caring for all. It is having a disposition that the hurts, large and small, that all of us carry, arouse concern and appreciation from and for each individual, the community and the world.

Subsequently, the organization of the health care should reflect that as well. These principles should (a) prevent the possible effects of stigmatizing attitudes toward mental health issues, possibly leading to potentially deleterious situations, such as psychiatric patients being treated (even temporarily) separately from other patients, in psychiatric facilities, where the staff is not equipped and trained adequately for the management of COVID-19; (b) highlight the fact that patients with mental health disorders are at greater risk for developing serious complications of COVID-19 infection due to other factorsthey often smoke and have comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, all associated with higher morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 infection; (c) highlight that measures should be taken to minimize the risk of the spread of infection in psychiatric wards/institutions; (d) provide a general framework for the reorganization of mental health services toward the provision of services for persons in need, including frontline medical workers and patients with COVID-19 without previous mental health problems as well as for persons with pre-existing mental health problems under new circumstances of pandemic.","output":"Principles of mental health care during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increasing clinical evidence shows that acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and severe complication in critically ill COVID-19 patients.

Thus, treatments by targeting these inflammatory molecules and pathways with a monoclonal antibody against IL-6 (Tocilizumab), C3 inhibitor AMY-101, anti-C5 antibody, anti-TGF- OT-101, and the use of CRRT in critically ill patients may represent as novel and specific therapies for AKI in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Inflammatory stress in SARS-COV-2 associated Acute Kidney Injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Supercritical Carbon Dioxide treatment of clean and soiled Filtering Face-Piece respirators is shown to meet mandatory requirements for safe reuse of FFP2.

RESULTS: Of the OSCE components, scores for the acquisition of informed consent and resuscitation showed significant correlations with CC performance (P<0.001 for each). In contrast, scores for diagnostic imaging showed a slightly positive, but non-significant, correlation with CC performance (P = 0.107).

These consequences can be measured through patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). As current PROMs had methodologic and content deficiencies with an underrepensentation of the changes in appearance, the FACE-Q HNC Module was developed and translated into Dutch. To date, EORTC-QLQ-H&N35 is the most used PROMs for HNC patients. We therefore investigated the content and known groups validity of the FACE-Q HNC module and the convergent validity with the EORTC-QLQ-H&N35. Methods: A cross-sectional multicenter PROM study in five Dutch HNC centers. Patients recently diagnosed with and/or curatively treated for HNC within the past three years were included. Both PROMs were simultaneously offered to patients before treatment or at three, six, twelve, or twenty-four months post-treatment. The validity of the Dutch FACE-Q HNC was assessed according to the COSMIN tool. Convergent validity will be tested in comparison with the EORTCQLQ- H&N35.

OBJECTIVES Three questions were addressed while only considering studies that observed heading exposure directly: (1) how frequently does heading occur within football training and matches, (2) what are the biomechanical characteristics of heading, and (3) is cognitive function affected by heading? METHODS This review followed the steps described in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Electronic databases including MEDLINE and SPORTDiscus were searched from the earliest entry to July 2020. Studies that reported independently quantified heading exposure, biomechanical characteristics of heading or the relationship between heading and cognitive function were included. Data were extracted and used to populate summary tables with reference to each research question. RESULTS Heading incidence ranged between one to nine headers per player per match. The number of headers observed in small-sided games during training varied depending on the exact format used but generally speaking ranged between zero to one per player per game. The three most commonly reported biomechanical variables were head acceleration, head rotational velocity and overall movement kinematics during the heading action. Average head acceleration ranged from approximately four to 50 g. Nine out of 12 included studies did not observe a negative impact on cognitive test performance following exposure to heading and while three did, these negative effects were limited to specific outcome measures: reaction time and memory function. CONCLUSION The current weight of evidence summarised herein does not support the notion that heading is deleterious to cognitive performance in the short term; however, this conclusion is tentative due to methodological shortcomings in the existing evidence base.","output":"Heading in Football: Incidence, Biomechanical Characteristics and the Association with Acute Cognitive Function-A Three-Part Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Limited attention has been paid to how and why older adults choose to engage with technology-facilitated health care (e-health), and the factors that impact on this.

RESULT 14 papers were included and synthesised into five thematic categories and related subthemes. Results are discussed with reference to the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology2. The most prevalent barriers to e-health engagement were a lack of self-efficacy, knowledge, support, functionality, and information provision about the benefits of e-health for older adults. Key facilitators were active engagement of the target end users in the design and delivery of e-health programs, support for overcoming concerns privacy and enhancing self-efficacy in the use of technology, and integration of e-health programs across health services to accommodate the multi-morbidity with which older adults typically present.

Our hypotheses were that being a junior doctor, having a previous mental health diagnosis and treating Covid-19 positive patients would predict higher rates of distress. METHODS Cross-sectional survey conducted via Survey Monkey. Voluntary participants were recruited from the mailing list of a national-based referral service for doctors to psychiatrists. Distress was measured using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). Demographic factors were analysed for predictive value of a higher rating on the K10. Areas of concern in relation to Covid-19 and preference for support services were measured on a Likert scale and compared to levels of distress. RESULTS The rate of very high distress was 15%. Being a junior doctor and having a previous mental health diagnosis were predictive factors of a higher K10 score. K10 was not affected by likelihood of contact with Covid-19-positive patients. Social isolation had a larger impact on mental health in the context of a previous psychiatric diagnosis. Face-to-face assessments were preferred.

Male gender was the only independent predictor of needing intensification of care, while age and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) were good predictors of in-hospital and 30-day mortality. Differences were also found in the survival functions between the groups. Conclusions: After a period of observation of 100 days, ST patients, despite their older age and their greater load of comorbidities, have similar survival functions to NST patients. Adjusted for age and CCI, the survival functions of the ST group are considerably more favorable than those of the second group.","output":"Statin therapy and COVID-19: A retrospective cohort study in a province of Northern Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) represent an accessible tissue source for gene expression profiling in schizophrenia that could provide insight into the molecular basis of the disorder.

To understand the role of aerosols in disease transmission, we adopted a prospective cross-sectional study design and investigated the count and size distribution of aerosols generated by a non-contact tonometer and its correlation with individual tear film characteristics. METHODS: This study constituted two parts. The study population included outpatients who underwent an intraocular pressure examination in an intraocular pressure examination room (Part I) and 20 participants who underwent an intraocular pressure examination in a laboratory (Part II). The following main outcomes were measured: aerosol counts at 0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 cm from the non-contact tonometer (Part I); aerosol counts after each participant underwent non-contact tonometry, and lipid layer thickness score and tear film break-up time (Part II). RESULTS: The aerosol count decreased with increasing distance from the tonometer. The aerosol count at 0 cm had the highest value compared to that at other distances. For aerosols of diameters 0.25-0.5 m and 0.5-1.0 m, the count decreased at 50 cm and remained stable at further distances. For aerosols of diameters 1.0-2.5 m and &#8805; 2.5 m, the count dropped progressively at all five distances. The aerosol count from each tonometer correlated positively with the lipid layer thickness score (r = 0.490, P = 0.028), whereas the aerosol count correlated negatively with the tear film break-up time (r = - 0.675, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Aerosols tended to coagulate during diffusion. A 50-cm distance from the tonometer could confer safety from aerosols with < 1.0-m diameter. Aerosols generated during non-contact tonometry could contain a lipid layer component. Moreover, tear film stability could affect aerosol generation. Protective eyewear is recommended for reducing infection risk from aerosols. Individual tear film characteristics should be considered during non-contact tonometry.","output":"Quantitative Evaluation of Aerosol Generation from Non-contact Tonometry and its Correlation with Tear Film Characteristics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper studies the interplay between the social distancing and the spread of COVID-19 disease, a widely spread pandemic that has affected nearly most of the world population. Starting in China, now the virus has reached the United States of America with devastating consequences. Other countries severely affected by the pandemic are Brazil, Russia, United Kingdom, Spain, India, Italy, and France. Even though it is not possible to eliminate the spread of the virus from the world or any other country, it might be possible to reduce its effect by decreasing the amount of infected people. Implementing such policies need a good understanding of the systems dynamics, generally not possible with mathematical linear equations or Monte Carlo methods because human society is a complex adaptive system with complex and continuous feedback loops. As a result, we use agent-based methods to conduct our study. Moreover, recent agent-based modeling studies for the COVID-19 pandemic show significant promise assisting decision-makers in managing the crisis through applying some policies such as social distancing, disease testing, contact tracing, home isolation, providing good emergency and hospitalization strategies, and preventing traveling would lead to reduce the infection rates. Based on imperial college modeling studies that prove increasing levels of interventions could slow down the spread of disease and infection cases as much as possible, and taking into account that social distancing policy is considered to be the most important factor that was recommended to follow. Our proposed model is designed to test if increasing the social distancing policies strictness can slow down the spread of disease significantly or not, and find out what is the required safe level of social distancing. So, the model was run six times with six different percentages of social distancing with keeping the other parameters levels fixed for all experiments. The results of our study show that social distancing affects the spread of COVID-19 significantly, where the spread of disease and infection rates decrease once social distancing procedures are implemented at higher levels. Also, the behavior space tool was used to run ten experiments with different levels of social distancing which enough more supported the previous results. We conclude that applying and increasing social distancing policy levels led to significantly reduced infection rates which result in decreasing deaths. Both types of experiments prove that 80% to 100% of following social distancing policies reduces the infection rates dramatically.","output":"Quantifying the Effects of Social Distancing on theSpread of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Phase III platform trials are increasingly used to evaluate a sequence of treatments for a specific disease Traditional approaches to structure such trials tend to focus on the sequential questions rather than the performance of the entire enterprise We consider two-stage trials where an early evaluation is used to determine whether to continue with an individual study To evaluate performance, we use the ratio of expected wins (RW), that is, the expected number of reported efficacious treatments using a two-stage approach compared to that using standard phase III trials We approximate the test statistics during the course of a single trial using Brownian Motion and determine the optimal stage 1 time and type I error rate to maximize RW for fixed power At times, a surrogate or intermediate endpoint may provide a quicker read on potential efficacy than use of the primary endpoint at stage 1 We generalize our approach to the surrogate endpoint setting and show improved performance, provided a good quality and powerful surrogate is available We apply our methods to the design of a platform trial to evaluate treatments for COVID-19 disease","output":"Two Stage Designs for Phase III Trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Law is a universal institution that has pretensions of being ubiquitous and complete However, in a complex, plural and volatile world, its limits and possibilities are shaken by the speed, depth and extent of ongoing transformations, its resulting ethical dilemmas, and the difficulties of forming consensus in the political universe This article provides a reflection on how the law has attempted to deal with some of the main afflictions of our time, facing demands that include the needs to (i) keep the technological revolution on an ethical and humanitarian track, (ii) avoid democracy being perverted by populist and authoritarian adventures, and (iii) prevent solutions to climate change from coming when it is too late At a time when even the near future has become unpredictable, the law cannot provide a priori solutions to multiplying problems and anxieties When this happens, we must set clear goals for the future of humanity, basing them on the essential and perennial values that have followed us since antiquity","output":"Technological revolution, democratic recession, and climate change: The limits of law in a changing world"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Destructive impacts of COVID-19 pandemic worldwide necessitates taking more appropriate measures for mitigating virus spread and development of the effective theranostic agents.

This fall semester, I employed a ?Choose your own adventure? approach to instruction, giving students the ability to tackle subjects in the order they chose to rather than the order determined by the instructor or the book. In preparing for the fall semester, I focused on redeveloping my undergraduate non-major physiology course in a way that allowed students the most flexibility- fully asynchronous presentation. The move to an asynchronous teaching model required the creation of activities and presentations that students could attend to on their own schedule. While creating these resources, I decided to make the class even more asynchronous by allowing students to choose the path of learning that they took through the course. Following a short introduction and review module, students were allowed to choose the order that they would cover material in the course during three ?blocks? of information;each with its own quizzes, activities and an exam.

Introduction: Povidone-iodine and hydrogen peroxide could be effective in against SARS-CoV-2. Methods: A non-interventional trial in 88 patients (4317 yrs., 55% men) with SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs (RT-PCR). 31 received mouth rinses/gargling with povidone-iodine (every 8 hours, two consecutive days), 17 with mouth rinses/gargling of hydrogen peroxide, and 40 controls. Were repeated PCR in 3, 11 and 17 days. Results: After intervention the viral load (Log10 copies/ml) remained similar in povidone-iodine (4.32.7 copies/ml), hydrogen peroxide (4.62.9 copies/ml; p=0.40) and controls (4.43.0 copies/ml). The percentage of patients with a negative result in the second PCR was 27% in povidone-iodine group, 23% in hydrogen peroxide and 32% in controls; in the third PCR, 62%, 54% y 58% respectively; and in the fourth PCR, 81%, 75% y 81%. Conclusion: Our results do not support the clinical usefulness of mouth rinses/gargling with povidone-iodine or hydrogen peroxide in patients with COVID-19.","output":"UTILIDAD DE LOS ENJUAGUES CON POVIDONA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The majority of online video contents remain inaccessible to people with visual impairments due to the lack of audio descriptions to depict the video scenes. Content creators have traditionally relied on professionals to author audio descriptions, but their service is costly and not readily-available. We investigate the feasibility of creating more cost-effective audio descriptions that are also of high quality by involving novices. Specifically, we designed, developed, and evaluated ViScene, a web-based collaborative audio description authoring tool that enables a sighted novice author and a reviewer either sighted or blind to interact and contribute to scene descriptions (SDs)-text that can be transformed into audio through text-to-speech. Through a mixed-design study with N = 60 participants, we assessed the quality of SDs created by sighted novices with feedback from both sighted and blind reviewers. Our results showed that with ViScene novices could produce content that is Descriptive, Objective, Referable, and Clear at a cost of i.e., US$2.81pvm to US$5.48pvm, which is 54% to 96% lower than the professional service. However, the descriptions lacked in other quality dimensions (e.g., learning, a measure of how well an SD conveys the video's intended message). While professional audio describers remain the gold standard, for content creators who cannot afford it, ViScene offers a cost-effective alternative, ultimately leading to a more accessible medium.","output":"The Efficacy of Collaborative Authoring of Video Scene Descriptions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important cause of severe acute respiratory tract infection in young children. Alere i RSV is a novel molecular rapid test which identifies respiratory syncytial virus in less than 13 min. METHODS: We evaluated the clinical performance of the Alere i RSV assay in a pediatric point-of-care setting during winter season 2016 / 2017. Test results from 518 nasopharyngeal swab samples were compared to a real-time reverse transcription PCR reference standard. RESULTS: The overall sensitivity and specificity of the Alere i RSV test assay was 93% (CI(95) 89% C 96%) and 96% (CI(95) 93% C 98%), respectively. Alere i RSV performed well in children of all age groups. An optimal sensitivity of 98% (CI(95) 94% - 100%) and specificity of 96% (CI(95) 90% - 99%) was obtained in children < 6 months. In children  2 years, sensitivity and specificity remained at 87% (CI(95) 73% C 96%) and 98% (CI(95) 92% C 100%), respectively. False negative Alere i RSV test results mostly occurred in samples with low viral load (mean CT value 31.1; CI(95) 29.6 C 32.6). The Alere i RSV assay is easy to use and can be operated after minimal initial training. Test results are available within 13 min, with most RSV positive samples being identified after approximately 5 min. CONCLUSION: The Alere i RSV assay has the potential to facilitate the detection of RSV in pediatric point-of-care settings.

In terms of ethnic minority people, government tried to reach out to them by distributing pamphlets and making public awareness videos in their own languages which were distributed through community NGOs, volunteers and leaders who all worked together and did their best from their own side by distributing masks, sanitizers together with organizing health awareness programs. This maybe largely because a. everyone in Hong Kong who were present during SARS virus time already knew the drill and knew what they had to do despite the uncertainty b. public are well disciplined in terms of health c. community leaders connect with people and act like channel for government awareness program. Remarkably the most pronounced thing that I observed in all this was, just before the pandemic period, Hong Kong was going through political upheavals but much to everyones surprise, Hong Kong people managed to pick themselves together keeping their political differences aside and came together to fight the pandemic first. Wearing mask and social distancing was still an unfamiliar site when I had just arrived in London. Local NGO workers, volunteers in London were seen distributing masks, sanitizers while restaurant people were also seen distributing free foods to ethnic minority people. Not everyone understood or followed the social distancing rules because this was totally new concept to everyone including those around them.

However, understanding when non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) can be lifted as vaccination builds up and how to update priority groups for vaccination in real-time remain key questions for policy makers. To address these questions, we built a data-driven model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission for China. We estimated that, to prevent local outbreaks to escalate to major widespread epidemics, stringent NPIs need to remain in place at least one year after the start of vaccination. Should NPIs be capable to keep the reproduction number (Rt) around 1.3, a vaccination program could reduce up to 99% of COVID-19 burden and bring Rt below the epidemic threshold in about 9 months. Maintaining strict NPIs throughout 2021 is of paramount importance to reduce COVID-19 burden while vaccines are distributed to the population, especially in large populations with little natural immunity.","output":"Can a COVID-19 vaccination program guarantee the return to a pre-pandemic lifestyle?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction From the first case of SARS-Co-2 in Wuhan, China, to the virus being declared as a pandemic in March 2020, the world has witnessed morbidity and mortality on a global scale. Scientists have worked at a record pace to deliver a vaccine for the prevention of this deadly disease. Tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 (IL-6) blocker, received an emergency use authorization (EUA) by the Federal Drug Agency (FDA) in June 2021. Methods This retrospective observational cohort study was conducted at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi, from March 8, 2020, to December 31, 2020. All patients with PCR confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia were included. Data were obtained from the medical records, and the admission registry was used to identify the patients, and both their electronic and paper-based files were retrieved from the medical records. Patient demographic data, medical history, baseline comorbidities, clinical characteristics, and outcome data were collected to study the infectious complications of Tocilizumab in patients affected by COVID-19 pneumonia. Results A total of 913 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 were included. The overall superinfection infection rate among the COVID-19 patients was 6%. Superinfection in patients who received the Tocilizumab was 17.2% and in the non-Tocilizumab group was 4.8%.

COVID 19 tends to have poorer prognosis in cancer patients. Additionally, we have no well-established guidelines for management of these patients during pandemic, in terms of treatment of 'cancer' and treatment of 'COVID 19'. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are given without any break in cancer patients to have better survival outcomes in daily routine. However, there is no well-established data to continue or delay ALK inhibitors in lung cancer patients infected with SARS-CoV2. Concomittant use of ALK inhibitors and COVID 19 antiviral treatment is a dilemma because of the lack of data in this area. CASE REPORT A 47-year old female metastatic ALK positive nonsquamous cell lung cancer patient on alectinib, a second generation ALK inhibitor was diagnosed with symptomatic COVID 19. She was given favipiravir for COVID 19 while continuing alectinib.Management and outcome: The patient continued alectinib during COVID 19 antiviral treatment without any break. She tolerated 'concomittant' alectinib & favipiravir. She had partial remission after three months of alectinib without any dose adjustment despite active COVID 19 medication. DISCUSSION To best of our knowledge, this is the first case who continued alectinib without dose adjustment during antiviral COVID-19 medication without clinically worsening. There is limited data about 'concomittant' use of TKIs and antiviral COVID 19 medication in the literature. There are some case reports, but they generally tended to delay or suspend TKIs during COVID 19 antiviral medication. Our case differs from them in terms of continuation of alectinib without any break or additional side effects during favipiravir for symptomatic COVID 19. We consider that our case might contribute to the literature in terms of management of cancer patients on targeted therapy during COVID 19 antiviral treatment. However, clinical trials are needed in this area.","output":"Alectinib continuation during COVID 19 'antiviral' treatment: Risk or benefit?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction/Objective The purpose of the current Echocardiographic Society of Serbia (ECHOS) survey was to assess echocardiography practice in Serbia during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic Methods An online survey consisting of 12 questions about the usa of echocardiography, the availability of portable ultrasound devices and personal protective equipment (PPE) was sent to all ECHOS members Results Overall, 126 ECHOS members (43%) answered the survey One-third of respondents (36%) were physicians from specialized COVID-19 centers During the pandemic, indications for echocardiographic examination were restricted in both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 centers In COVID-19 centers, 41% of respondents performed lung ultrasound to each patient versus 26% in non-COVID-19 centers Transesophageal echocardiography was not performed in suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases in any center Portable ultrasound devices were available to 66% of respondents from COVID-19 versus 44% of respondents from non-COVID-19 centers (p = 0 018) The respondents reported regular use of PPE, regardless of the patients COVID-19 status and found their personal knowledge about protective measures and use of PPE satisfactory Conclusion During the COVID-19 pandemic in Serbia, indications for echocardiography were restricted to clinical scenarios in which the results of examination were expected to alter patient management In both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 centers, the use of PPE was in line with national and international recommendations A wider availability of portable ultrasound devices and application of lung ultrasound could improve patient management in similar situations in the future ? 2020, Serbia Medical Society All rights reserved","output":"Echos survey on echocardiography in Serbia during the covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) affects 10C24% of patients with diabetes mellitus type 1 or 2 in the primary care (PC) sector.

The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the clinical characteristics of affected patients is limited. Objective: To describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of NCIP. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective, single-center case series of the 138 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, from January 1 to January 28, 2020; final date of follow-up was February 3, 2020. Exposures: Documented NCIP. Main Outcomes and Measures: Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients were compared. Presumed hospital-related transmission was suspected if a cluster of health professionals or hospitalized patients in the same wards became infected and a possible source of infection could be tracked. Results: Of 138 hospitalized patients with NCIP, the median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 75 (54.3%) were men. Hospital-associated transmission was suspected as the presumed mechanism of infection for affected health professionals (40 [29%]) and hospitalized patients (17 [12.3%]). Common symptoms included fever (136 [98.6%]), fatigue (96 [69.6%]), and dry cough (82 [59.4%]). Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 0.8  109/L [interquartile range {IQR}, 0.6-1.1]) occurred in 97 patients (70.3%), prolonged prothrombin time (13.0 seconds [IQR, 12.3-13.7]) in 80 patients (58%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (261 U/L [IQR, 182-403]) in 55 patients (39.9%). Chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. Most patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir, 124 [89.9%]), and many received antibacterial therapy (moxifloxacin, 89 [64.4%]; ceftriaxone, 34 [24.6%]; azithromycin, 25 [18.1%]) and glucocorticoid therapy (62 [44.9%]). Thirty-six patients (26.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (22 [61.1%]), arrhythmia (16 [44.4%]), and shock (11 [30.6%]). The median time from first symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to ARDS was 8.0 days. Patients treated in the ICU (n = 36), compared with patients not treated in the ICU (n = 102), were older (median age, 66 years vs 51 years), were more likely to have underlying comorbidities (26 [72.2%] vs 38 [37.3%]), and were more likely to have dyspnea (23 [63.9%] vs 20 [19.6%]), and anorexia (24 [66.7%] vs 31 [30.4%]). Of the 36 cases in the ICU, 4 (11.1%) received high-flow oxygen therapy, 15 (41.7%) received noninvasive ventilation, and 17 (47.2%) received invasive ventilation (4 were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation).

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to examine the content and characteristics of TikTok videos that are related to an important aspect of community mitigation-the use of masks as a method for interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: In total, 100 trending videos with the hashtag #WearAMask (ie, a campaign on TikTok), along with 32 videos that were posted by the World Health Organization (WHO) and involved masks in any way (ie, all related WHO videos at the time of this study), were included in our sample. We collected the metadata of each post, and created content categories based on fact sheets that were provided by the WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We used these fact sheets to code the characteristics of mask use. RESULTS: Videos that were posted on TikTok and had the hashtag #WearAMask garnered almost 500 million views, and videos that were posted by the WHO garnered almost 57 million views. Although the ratio of the number of trending #WearAMask videos to the number of WHO videos was around 3:1, the #WearAMask videos received almost 10 times as many cumulative views as the WHO videos. In total, 68% (68/100) of the trending #WearAMask videos involved humor and garnered over 355 million cumulative views. However, only 9% (3/32) of the WHO videos involved humor. Furthermore, 27% (27/100) of the trending #WearAMask videos involved dance and garnered over 130 million cumulative views, whereas none of the WHO videos involved dance.

We searched online databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, CDC library of COVID research, CINAHL, and COCHRANE. We included RCTs that compared the effect of corticosteroids to placebo or usual care in adult patients with ARDS, including patients with COVID-19. Three reviewers abstracted data independently and in duplicate using a pre-specified standardized form. We assessed individual study risk of bias using the revised Cochrane ROB-2 tool and rated certainty in outcomes using GRADE methodology. We pooled data using a random effects model. The main outcome for this review was 28-day-mortality. RESULTS: We included 18 RCTs enrolling 2826 patients. The use of corticosteroids probably reduced mortality in patients with ARDS of any etiology (2740 patients in 16 trials, RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72-0.95, ARR 8.0%, 95% CI 2.2-12.5%, moderate certainty).

This will inform future implementation. DESIGN: A mixed method study alongside a randomised controlled trial. SETTING: University hospital, rehabilitation centre and community health centre. PARTICIPANTS: 29 patients with a neuromuscular disease and chronic fatigue and 13 healthcare professionals participated in this mixed methods study. INTERVENTION: Multidisciplinary group programme, called Energetic, consisted of a 4 months intervention with weekly meetings and covered four modules: (1) individually tailored aerobic exercise training; (2) education about aerobic exercise; (3) self-management training in applying energy conservation strategies and (4) implementation and relapse prevention in daily life. MAIN MEASURES: Quantitative data were collected by a questionnaire measuring patients (n=25, all completed the programme) satisfaction with the perceived results, content and delivery of the programme. Qualitative data were collected by individual and focus group interviews to gain insight in the experiences of patients (n=18), next of kin (n=2) and healthcare professionals (n=13) with facilitators and barriers to programme implementation. RESULTS: Patients were satisfied with the number and length of the sessions, the different modules and the therapists. Analysis of the interviews led to five themes: (1) the combination of modules makes a complete picture, (2) the programme is physically and mentally intensive, (3) the group setting is valuable, (4) small variations in delivery occur in different settings, (5) therapists are coaches. Suggestions for programme improvement include a combination of face to face and e-health, enhancement of therapists skills in guiding group interventions and inclusion of more booster sessions to evaluate and maintain self-management competencies.

Samples (n = 9806) were collected over a month-long period (3 December 2020C6 January 2021) from donors aged 16C88 years. The sample population was geographically spread, covering 16 of 20 district health board regions. A series of Spike-based immunoassays were utilised, and the serological testing algorithm was optimised for specificity given New Zealand is a low prevalence setting. Eighteen samples were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, six of which were retrospectively matched to previously confirmed COVID-19 cases.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a two-phase, non-randomised feasibility mixed methods pragmatic study of a patient safety guide for primary care (PSG-PC). 8 general practices will recruit 120 patient and/or carer participants. All patient and/or carer participants will receive the PSG-PC. It will examine the feasibility and acceptability of the PSG-PC in primary care settings in patients aged 18 years or older who attend appointments at general practice with health professionals four or more times per year as either patients or carers. It will identify secondary outcomes for improving patient safety, health status and patient empowerment, and reducing health service utilisation over 6 months between baseline and 6-month follow-ups. The findings will inform whether a main effectiveness trial is feasible and, if so, how it should be designed, and how many patients and practices will be needed.

The glycoprotein complex (GPC) contains eleven N-linked glycans that play essential roles in GPC functionalities such as cleavage, transport, receptor recognition, epitope shielding, and immune response. We used three mutagenesis strategies (asparagine to glutamine, asparagine to alanine, and serine/tyrosine to alanine mutants) to abolish individual glycan chain on GPC and found that all the three strategies led to cleavage inefficiency on the 2nd (N89), 5th (N119), or 8th (N365) glycosylation motif. To evaluate N to Q mutagenesis for further research, it was found that deletion of the 2nd (N89Q) or 8th (N365Q) glycan completely inhibited the transduction efficiency of pseudotyped particles. We further investigated the role of individual glycan on GPC-mediated immune response by DNA immunization of mice. Deletion of the individual 1st (N79Q), 3rd (N99Q), 5th (N119Q), or 6th (N167Q) glycan significantly enhanced the proportion of effector CD4(+) cells, whereas deletion of the 1st (N79Q), 2nd (N89Q), 3rd (N99Q), 4th (N109Q), 5th (N119Q), 6th (N167Q), or 9th (N373Q) glycan enhanced the proportion of CD8(+) effector T cells. Deletion of specific glycan improves the Th1-type immune response, and abolishment of glycan on GPC generally increases the antibody titer to the glycan-deficient GPC. However, the antibodies from either the mutant or WT GPC-immunized mice show little neutralization effect on wild-type LASV. The glycan residues on GPC provide an immune shield for the virus, and thus represent a target for the design and development of a vaccine.

This is because such sampling measures the incidence of the disease, the key variable controlled by restrictive measures, and thus anticipates the load on the healthcare system due to progression of the disease. The frequent testing of non-symptomatic infectiousness will (i) significantly improve the predictability of the pandemic, (ii) allow informed and optimized decisions on how to modify restrictive measures, with shorter delay times than the present ones, and (iii) enable the real-time assessment of the efficiency of new means to reduce transmission rates. These advantages are quantified by considering a feedback and control model of mitigation where the feed-back is derived from the evolution of the daily measured prevalence.

Nonclinical evaluation of candidate drug combinations via the relapsing mouse model (RMM) is an important step in regimen development, through which candidate regimens that provide the greatest decrease in the probability of relapse following treatment in mice may be identified for further development. Although RMM studies are a critical tool to evaluate regimen efficacy, making comprehensive apples to apples comparisons of regimen performance in the RMM has been a challenge in large part due to the need to evaluate and adjust for variability across studies arising from differences in design and execution. To address this knowledge gap, we performed a model-based meta-analysis on data for 17 unique regimens obtained from a total of 1592 mice across 28 RMM studies. Specifically, a mixed-effects logistic regression model was developed that described the treatment duration-dependent probability of relapse for each regimen and identified relevant covariates contributing to interstudy variability. Using the model, covariate-normalized metrics of interest, namely, treatment duration required to reach 50% and 10% relapse probability, were derived and used to compare relative regimen performance. Overall, the model-based meta-analysis approach presented herein enabled cross-study comparison of efficacy in the RMM and provided a framework whereby data from emerging studies may be analyzed in the context of historical data to aid in selecting candidate drug combinations for clinical evaluation as TB drug regimens.","output":"Model-Based Meta-Analysis of Relapsing Mouse Model Studies from the Critical Path to Tuberculosis Drug Regimens Initiative Database"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As increasing amounts of data accumulate on the effects of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and the risk factors that lead to poor outcomes, it is possible to produce personalized estimates of the risks faced by groups of people with different characteristics.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study using TriNetX electronic health record data of subjects aged <18 years who were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, code U07.1). Pulmonary embolism was identified by using International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, code I26. We additionally collected data on age, sex, race, ethnicity, all diagnostic codes, medications, procedures, laboratory results, comorbidities, and outcomes. RESULTS: During the study period, 24 723 pediatric subjects were reported to have a COVID-19 infection diagnosis among 41 health care organizations, of which 693 (2.8%) were hospitalized. Eight subjects (0.03% overall and 1.2% of hospitalized patients) were diagnosed with pulmonary embolism. The median age (25th to 75th percentile) of patients diagnosed with pulmonary embolism was 16.5 years, and median (25th to 75th percentile) BMI was 22.1 (19.6-47.9).

Although evidence exists for the learning of musical scale structure from the statistical properties of sound events, little research has been able to observe how specific acoustic features contribute to statistical learning independent of the effects of long-term exposure. Here, using a new musical system, we show that spectral content is an important cue for acquiring musical scale structure. In two experiments, participants completed probe-tone ratings before and after a half-hour period of exposure to melodies in a novel musical scale with a predefined statistical structure. In Experiment 1, participants were randomly assigned to either a no-exposure control group, or to exposure groups who heard pure tone or complex tone sequences. In Experiment 2, participants were randomly assigned to exposure groups who heard complex tones constructed with odd harmonics or even harmonics. Learning outcome was assessed by correlating pre/post-exposure ratings and the statistical structure of tones within the exposure period. Spectral information significantly affected sensitivity to statistical structure: participants were able to learn after exposure to all tested timbres, but did best at learning with timbres with odd harmonics, which were congruent with scale structure. Results show that spectral amplitude distribution is a useful cue for statistical learning, and suggest that musical scale structure might be acquired through exposure to spectral distribution in sounds.","output":"New Music System Reveals Spectral Contribution to Statistical Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current study was carried out to determine the problems that preschool children experience during COVID-19 and also what could be done from perspectives of preschool prospective teachers The working group of the study was made up of 45 projects prepared by 15 preschool prospective teachers attending to the midterm exam of lecture of \\"Practices of social service\\" in Alanya Alaaddin Keykubat University, Faculty of Education, Department of Preschool Education As a data collection tool, the project preparation form (A unstructured survey form) that was prepared by the researcher was used The study was carried out by qualitative research methods and the projects comprising the working group of the study were analyzed with content analysis technique At the end of the study, the problems that preschool children might experience in the pandemic period, the purposes to decrease these problems to minimum, the concepts and values to be attained and recommendations for projects were determined Various recommendations were made in line with the findings obtained [This study was presented as an oral presentation in International Conference on Studies in Education and Social Sciences (ICSES)-2020, Istanbul, Turkey ]","output":"COVID-19 from the Perspective of Preschool Prospective Teachers: What Can We Do for Children?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effectiveness of resorbable mesh cranioplasty at reducing postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak and pseudomeningocele formation after translabyrinthine tumor resection. STUDY DESIGN Case series with chart review. SETTING Tertiary academic referral center. PATIENTS Fifty-three consecutive cases using a resorbable mesh cranioplasty after translabyrinthine tumor resection were reviewed. INTERVENTION Temporal bone defects were repaired with a dural substitute, layered fat graft, and a resorbable mesh plate secured with screws. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcome measures included the incidence of postoperative CSF wound leak or rhinorrhea, pseudomeningocele formation, and surgical site infection. RESULTS Fifty-three cases (average age, 54.0 yr; range, 19.3-75.1 yr) were analyzed. The average body mass index was 30.8 kg/m2 (range, 17.9-48.3 kg/m2), and the average tumor size was 18.8 mm (range, 8-38 mm). One patient (1.9%) experienced CSF rhinorrhea on postoperative Day 16, which resolved after transmastoid middle ear and eustachian tube packing. One patient (1.9%) experienced a surgical site infection requiring surgical debridement and mesh removal 4 months after surgery. Compared with 1,441 prior translabyrinthine surgeries analyzed from our institution using a traditional fat graft closure without mesh, the rate of postoperative CSF leak was significantly less using the resorbable mesh cranioplasty technique (p = 0.0483).

This study evaluates the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on HCWs in a national paediatric referral centre. METHODS This was a survey-based study that collected demographic, work environment and mental health data from paediatric HCWs in the emergency, intensive care and infectious disease units. Psychological impact was measured using the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale-21. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors associated with psychological distress. RESULTS The survey achieved a response rate of 93.9% (430 of 458). Of the 430 respondents, symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress were reported in 168 (39.1%), 205 (47.7%) and 106 (24.7%), respectively. Depression was reported in the mild (47, 10.9%), moderate (76, 17.7%), severe (23, 5.3%) and extremely severe (22, 5.1%) categories. Anxiety (205, 47.7%) and stress (106, 24.7%) were reported in the mild category only. Collectively, regression analysis identified female sex, a perceived lack of choice in work scope/environment, lack of protection from COVID-19, lack of access to physical activities and rest, the need to perform additional tasks, and the experience of stigma from the community as risk factors for poor psychological outcome. CONCLUSION A high prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress was reported among frontline paediatric HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS Risk of metachronous carcinogenesis was evaluated in 88 patients with intramucosal esophageal carcinoma (without history of metachronous esophageal or head and neck squamous cell carcinomas) who underwent endoscopic submucosal dissection from 2007 to 2008 and were endoscopically observed for > 3 years. Histologically, the papillary vessel is defined as the clock gear-like structure composed of capillaries directly penetrating the epithelium (starting from the lamina propria) and covering at least two-thirds of it, around which the tumor cells are arranged in a spiral pattern. RESULTS Median endoscopic follow-up period was 11.0 years. Cumulative 2-, 5-, and 10-year metachronous esophageal carcinoma rates were 11.4%, 20.6%, and 39.3%, respectively. Stepwise multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis identified multiple Lugol-voiding lesions (LVLs) as the single significant independent predictor. Cumulative 2-, 5-, and 10-year metachronous head and neck squamous cell carcinoma rates were 6.9%, 10.4%, and 19.6%, respectively. Stepwise multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis identified multiple LVLs, Brinkman index, papillary vessel, and younger age as significant predictive factors. Overall post-endoscopic submucosal dissection survival rates were 98.8% and 87.5% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. CONCLUSION Patients with a history of esophageal carcinoma remain at risk for metachronous carcinogenesis even > 5 years after endoscopic submucosal dissection.

Unlike the disease in adults, the vast majority of children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms and are largely spared from severe respiratory disease. However, there are children who have significant respiratory disease, and some may develop a hyperinflammatory response similar to that seen in adults with COVID-19 and in children with Kawasaki disease (KD), which has been termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Objective: The purpose of this report was to examine the current evidence that supports the etiopathogenesis of COVID-19 in children and the relationship of COVID-19 with KD and MIS-C as a basis for a better understanding of the clinical course, diagnosis, and management of these clinically perplexing conditions. Results: The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is carried out in two distinct but overlapping phases of COVID-19: the first triggered by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) itself and the second by the host immune response. Children with KD have fewer of the previously described COVID-19-associated KD features with less prominent acute respiratory distress syndrome and shock than children with MIS-C. Conclusion: COVID-19 in adults usually includes severe respiratory symptoms and pathology, with a high mortality. It has become apparent that children are infected as easily as adults but are more often asymptomatic and have milder disease because of their immature immune systems. Although children are largely spared from severe respiratory disease, they can present with a SARS-CoV-2-associated MIS-C similar to KD.","output":"COVID-19 in children: Pathogenesis and current status."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is limited knowledge regarding the process of deprescribing psychotropic drugs to people with dementia (PwD) conducted by general practitioners (GP). We investigated the impact of a multicomponent intervention, emphasizing medication reviews, on psychotropic drugs and behavioral and psychological symptoms (BPSD) in home-dwelling PwD and quantified change in patient-GP communication evaluated by their informal caregivers. METHODS: LIVE@Home.Path is a stepped-wedge closed-cohort cluster randomized controlled trial for people with mild to moderate dementia aged 65 and their informal caregivers (dyads) in Norway. Complementary to health care as usual (control condition), municipal coordinators implemented the multicomponent LIVE intervention: Learning, Innovation, Volunteer support, and Empowerment (including medication review by the PwDs regular GPs). Block-randomization was used to allocate dyads in three groups receiving the intervention sequentially in periods of 6 months duration. Prepandemic data from the first period is reported, resulting in a 1:2 intervention-to-control ratio. Primary outcome was change in psychotropic drug use. Secondary outcomes were changes in BPSD by Neuropsychiatric Inventory and Cornell Scale of Depression in Dementia and patient-GP communication by an adaption of the Clinical Global Impression of Change. RESULTS: Four hundred thirty-eight dyads were screened, 280 included, and 237 participated at 6 months (intervention group n=67; control condition n=170). At baseline, 63% used psychotropic medication regularly: antidementia drugs (47%), antidepressants (13%), hypnotics/sedatives (13%), antipsychotics (5%), and anxiolytics (2%). At 6 months, medication reviews were more frequently conducted in the intervention group compared to control (66% vs 42%, P=0.001). We found no differences regarding a change in drug use and BPSD. Patient-GP communication enhanced in the intervention group (mean score 0.95 [standard deviation 1.68] vs 0.41 [1.34], P=0.022). In the intervention group, control group, and overall sample, the informal caregivers of those who had their medications reviewed reported improved patient-GP communication compared to those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: Change in psychotropic drug use and BPSD did not differ, even though patient-GP communication improved with medication reviews. Restricted psychotropic drug use among PwD likely reflects more judicious prescribing practices in recent years. Nevertheless, medication reviews could be cultivated to optimize pharmacologic treatment for this complex population. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04043364; registered 15/03/2019.

Therefore, we developed the 12-item Individual Water InSecurity Experiences (IWISE) Scale to comparably measure individual experiences with access, use, and stability (reliability) of water. Here, we examine the reliability, cross-country equivalence, and cross-country and within-country validity of the scale in a cross-sectional sample. METHODS: IWISE items were implemented by the Gallup World Poll among nationally representative samples of 43 970 adults (>15 y) in 31 low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Internal consistency was assessed with Cronbachs alpha. Equivalence was tested using multigroup confirmatory factor analysis (MGCFA), the alignment method, and item response theory. Cross-country validity was assessed by regressing mean national IWISE scores on measures of economic, social, and water infrastructure development. Within-country validity was tested with logistic regression models of dissatisfaction with local water quality by IWISE score and regressing individual IWISE scores on per capita household income and difficulty getting by on current income. FINDINGS: Internal consistency was high; Cronbachs alpha was 0.89 in all countries. Goodness-of-fit statistics from MGCFA, the proportion of equivalent item thresholds and loadings in the alignment models, and Rasch output indicated equivalence across countries. Validity across countries was also established; country mean IWISE scores were negatively associated with gross domestic product and percentage of the population with access to basic water services, but positively associated with fertility rate. Validity within countries was also demonstrated; individuals IWISE scores were positively associated with greater odds of dissatisfaction with water quality and negatively associated with lower financial standing. CONCLUSIONS: The IWISE Scale provides an equivalent measure of individual experiences with water access and use across LMICs. It will be useful for establishing and tracking changes in the prevalence of water insecurity and identifying groups who have been left behind.","output":"The Individual Water Insecurity Experiences (IWISE) Scale: reliability, equivalence and validity of an individual-level measure of water security"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: First wave (March to May, 2020): negative consequences arising from a disconnect between official health communications, and unofficial Long Covid sufferers narratives online.

Our microfluidic guillotine consists of a fixed 3D micro-blade centered in a microchannel to bisect cells flowing through. We show that the Nanoscribe two-photon polymerization direct laser writing system is capable of fabricating complex 3D micro-blade geometries. However, structures made of the Nanoscribe IP-S resin have low adhesion to silicon, and they tend to peel off from the substrate after at most two times of replica molding in poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS).

SARS-CoV-2 triggers severe pneumonia, which leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death in severe cases. As reported, SARS-CoV-2 is 80% genetically identical to the 2003 SARS-CoV virus. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the main receptor for entry of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 into human cells. ACE2 is normally expressed in cardiovascular and lung type II alveolar epithelial cells, where it positively modulates the RAS system that regulates blood flow, pressure, and fluid homeostasis. Thus, virus-induced reduction of ACE2 gene expression is considered to make a significant contribution to severe acute respiratory failure. Chromatin remodeling plays a significant role in the regulation of ACE2 gene expression and the activity of regulatory elements within the genome. Methods Here, we integrated data on physical chromatin interactions within the genome organization (captured by Hi-C) with tissue-specific gene expression data to identify spatial expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and thus regulatory elements located within the ACE2 gene. Results We identified regulatory elements within ACE2 that control the expression of PIR, CA5B, and VPS13C in the lung. The gene products of these genes are involved in inflammatory responses, de novo pyrimidine and polyamine synthesis, and the endoplasmic reticulum, respectively. Conclusion Our study, although limited by the fact that the identification of the regulatory interactions is putative until proven by targeted experiments, supports the hypothesis that viral silencing of ACE2 alters the activity of gene regulatory regions and promotes an intra-cellular environment suitable for viral replication.","output":"A transcription regulatory network within the ACE2 locus may promote a pro-viral environment for SARS-CoV-2 by modulating expression of host factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper proposes a two-step approach to build portfolio models.

Atherosclerosis is referred as the thickening of the artery walls. Currently, there are two schools of thoughts for explaining the root of such phenomenon: thickening due to substance deposition and thickening as a result of inflammatory overgrowth. The hypothesis favored here is the second paradigm stating that the atherosclerosis is nothing else than the inflammatory response of of the wall tissues as a result of disruption in wall nourishment. It is known that a network of capillaries called vasa vasorum (VV) accounts for the nourishment of the wall in addition to the natural diffusion of nutrient from the blood passing through the lumen. Disruption of nutrient flow to the wall tissues may take place due to the occlusion of vasa vasorums with viruses, bacteria and very fine dust particles such as air pollutants referred to as PM 2.5. They can enter the body through the respiratory system at the first place and then reach the circulatory system. Hence in the new hypothesis, the root of atherosclerotic vessel is perceived as the malfunction of microvessels that nourish the vessel. A large number of clinical observation support this hypothesis. Recently and highly related to this work, and after the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the most prevalent disease in the lungs are attributed to the atherosclerotic pulmonary arteries, see Boyle and Haverich (Eur J Cardio Thorac Surg 58(6):1109C1110, 2020). In this work, a general framework is developed based on a multiphysics mathematical model to capture the wall deformation, nutrient availability and the inflammatory response. For the mechanical response an anisotropic constitutive relation is invoked in order to account for the presence of collagen fibers in the artery wall. A diffusionCreaction equation governs the transport of the nutrient within the wall. The inflammation (overgrowth) is described using a phase-field type equation with a double well potential which captures a sharp interface between two regions of the tissues, namely the healthy and the overgrowing part. The kinematics of the growth is treated by classical multiplicative decomposition of the gradient deformation. The inflammation is represented by means of a phase-field variable. A novel driving mechanism for the phase field is proposed for modeling the progression of the pathology. The model is 3D and fully based on the continuum description of the problem. The numerical implementation is carried out using FEM. Predictions of the model are compared with the clinical observations. The versatility and applicability of the model and the numerical tool allow.","output":"Mathematical Modeling and Numerical Simulation of Atherosclerosis Based on a Novel Surgeons View"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the understanding and perception of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) among the undergraduate preclinical and clinical dental students within Pakistan. Material and Methods: An online survey was developed by the researchers and conducted amongst the undergraduate students at various dental colleges of Pakistan. A pretested questionnaire was used and distributed using social media platforms. The questionnaire consisted of demographics, health status, perception related to general hygiene, understanding and learning attitudes of dental students. Knowledge scores and the attitude responses were compared with the demographics using independent t-test, one-way ANOVA and chi-square, as appropriate. Results: A total of 800 undergraduate dental students responded to the survey, out of which 304(38%) were males and 496(62%) were female students. Students in pre-clinical years were 600(75%), while 200(25%) students were in the clinical years. The knowledge of clinical students regarding COVID-19 was statistically higher (4.71/6), compared to the students in pre-clinical years (4.49/6) (p=0.004). Both groups showed adequate knowledge regarding the route of transmission, symptoms and origin of COVID-19, and COVID-19 being a threat to life. Clinical students did not want to re-use the face mask (75%), compared to the preclinical students (68%) (p-0.048). Students in clinical years reported more awareness regarding the recommended hand washing technique during COVID-19 (p-<0.001). Conclusion: It can be concluded that dental students in clinical years have adequate knowledge regarding the COVID-19 as compared to the preclinical students. The study identifies all areas where preclinical and clinical students lack basic knowledge. This should be compensated by arranging different webinars and online courses to increase the understanding of both clinical and preclinical students during the pandemic. ? 2021, Universidad de Concepcion.

That is the approximation of possibly low regular and noised functions from the knowledge of their approximate values given at some random points. Our proposed scheme is based on the use of the pseudo-inverse of a random projection matrix, combined with some specific properties of the Jacobi polynomials system, as well as some properties of positive definite random matrices. This scheme has the advantages to be stable, robust, accurate and fairly fast in terms of execution time. In particular, we provide an $L_2$ as well as an $L_2-$risk errors of our proposed nonparametric regression estimator. Moreover and unlike most of the existing nonparametric regression estimators, no extra regularization step is required by our proposed estimator. Although, this estimator is initially designed to work with random sampling set of uni-variate i.i.d. random variables following a Beta distribution, we show that it is still works for a wide range of sampling distribution laws. Moreover, we briefly describe how our estimator can be adapted in order to handle the multivariate case of random sampling sets. In the second part of this work, we extend the random pseudo-inverse scheme technique to build a stable and accurate estimator for solving linear functional regression (LFR) problems. A dyadic decomposition approach is used to construct this last stable estimator for the LFR problem. Alaso, we give an $L_2-$risk error of our proposed LFR estimator. Finally, the performance of the two proposed estimators are illustrated by various numerical simulations. In particular, a real dataset is used to illustrate the performance of our nonparametric regression estimator.","output":"Random matrices based schemes for stable and robust nonparametric and functional regression estimators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the study was to investigate the role of chronic kidney disease (CKD) on in-hospital mortality and on incident atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Multivariable regression models were used to assess the association between renal function groups (estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate, eGFR, >60 mL/min, 30C59 mL/min, <30 mL/min) and in-hospital all-cause mortality and incident AF and AKI. A cohort of 2816 patients admitted in one year for COVID-19 disease in two large hospitals was analyzed. The independent predictors of mortality were severe CKD [HR 1.732 (95%CI 1.264C2.373)], older age [HR 1.054 (95%CI 1.044C1.065)], cerebrovascular disease [HR 1.335 (95%CI (1.016C1.754)], lower platelet count [HR 0.997 (95%CI 0.996C0.999)], higher C-reactive protein [HR 1.047 (95%CI 1.035C1.058)], and higher plasma potassium value 1.374 (95%CI 1.139C1.658). When incident AKI was added to the final survival model, it was associated with higher mortality [HR 2.202 (1.728C2.807)]. Incident AF was more frequent in patients with CKD, but in the multivariable model only older age was significantly related with a higher incidence of AF [OR 1.036 (95%CI 1.022C1.050)]. Incident AF was strongly associated with the onset of AKI [HR 2.619 (95%CI 1.711C4.009)]. In this large population of COVID-19 patients, the presence of severe CKD was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality. In addition, patients who underwent AKI during hospitalization had a doubled risk of death.

This study aimed to describe the resource consumption and characteristics of long-stay patients in a PICU. METHODS: This was a single-center descriptive cohort study of 1309 patients admitted to a PICU in 2017. The main outcome was ICU length of stay (LOS). Patients were divided into prolonged LOS (PLS) and non-PLS groups if they had an LOS of  28 or < 28 days, respectively. Two groups were compared to characterize PLS. RESULTS: Thirty-two (2.4%) patients had a PLS and utilized 33% of PICU bed days. Factors associated with PLS with odds ratio [95% confidence interval (CI)] were being a neonate (7.8 [2.5C25.4], p = <0.001), being an infant (2.9 [1.0C9.0], p = 0.04), admission for a respiratory ailment (7.3 [1.6C44.2], p = 0.003), cardiovascular dysfunction (24.1 [4.8C152.1], p = <0.001), post-cardiac operation (8.0 [1.7C50.1], p = 0.003), post-cardiopulmonary arrest (22.8 [1.7C211.9], p = 0.01), and transfer from another facility (4.2 [1.8C10.7], p = 0.001).

We investigated the delay of IAT and factors associated with such delay. METHODS MR CLEAN was a randomized trial of IAT plus usual care versus usual care alone (n=500). With multivariable linear regression, we analyzed the effect of intravenous treatment, general anesthesia, off-hours and inter-hospital transfer on time to admission to the emergency department (ED) of the intervention center and time to treatment. Furthermore, we assessed compliance with a target of 75 min for time from ED to treatment, and calculated the potential absolute increase in the number of patients with a good outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 2) if this target had been achieved in all treated patients. RESULTS Inter-hospital transfer prolonged time to ED by 140 min (95% CI 129 to 150) but reduced time from ED to treatment by 77 min (95% CI 64 to 91). Time from ED to treatment was increased by 19 min by general anesthesia (95% CI 5 to 33) and total time was increased by 23 min during off-hours (95% CI 6 to 40). The in-hospital target was achieved in 11.5% (22/192) of patients.

Although only 3 of the 20 NTDs are endemic in Canada (i.e., echinococcosis, rabies, and scabies), the Canadian research community has contributed to advancing the knowledge base of all 20 NTDs. Previous research comprehensively detailed Canadian research on 11 NTDs between 1950 and 2010 using a network analysis approach. The specific objective of the present analysis was to update the publication record over the last decade (2010-2019) to include all 20 NTDs. MATERIALS AND METHODS A bibliometric analysis was conducted in Scopus and Web of Science databases (for English or French articles published between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2019) using appropriate search terms for each of the 20 NTDs and where at least 1 of the authors had a Canadian institution address. A 21st search was added to include publications including multiple NTDs or a discussion of NTDs in general. Following assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 2 reviewers independently screened all abstracts, with discordant observations rereviewed to arrive at an agreement. Duplicates were removed. RESULTS A total of 1,790 publications were retrieved (1,738 with a disease-specific NTD focus and 52 with a general NTD focus, resulting in 1,659 unique publications), giving an average of over 160 articles per year. Over 80% were classified as full-length research articles. The top 3 journals in terms of frequency were PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, PLOS ONE, and the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

Protoplast inoculation and whole-mount in situ hybridization revealed that both isolates can replicate in N. benthamiana; however, M2 was restricted to the initially infected cells. Genome shuffling between M1 and M2 revealed that two control modes are involved in CymMV host dependent movement. The M1 coat protein (CP) plays a dominant role in controlling CymMV movement between cells, because all chimeric CymMV viruses containing the M1 CP systemically infected N. benthamiana plants.

Blood supply was hindered by the reduction of public blood donation events, the reduced willingness to donate, and the difficult predictability of blood product demand as a result of the epidemiological regulations. The wider application of Patient Blood Management guidelines in the medical practice will promote optimal blood product utilization by avoiding transfusions where possible. OBJECTIVE AND METHOD: The aim of our study was to assess the changes in the usage of blood products in the first five months of 2020 at the Clinical Center of the University of Pcs, Janus Pannonius Clinical Building. RESULTS: In the period following the epidemiological measures, we found reduction in the number of hospitalized patients (34.08%), in the number of patients requiring transfusion (39.69%) and in the number of red blood cell products used (46.41%). The number of transfused red blood cell concentrates per patient was also significantly reduced (from 2.61 to 1.97) in this period. The number of transfused fresh frozen plasma units and platelet concentrates also decreased by approximately 30%. CONCLUSION: After the implementation of the strict restrictions, despite the difficulties, it was possible to provide patients with sufficient blood products. Due to the efforts of both the Regional Blood Transfusion Center of Pcs of the Hungarian National Blood Transfusion Service and of the clinicians, a new balance was established between the demand and the supply of blood products, which provided adequate care for the necessary transfusions.

The medical community has no standardized or widely followed criteria for telemedicine examinations, so a broad spectrum of approaches is used. Unfortunately, the need for telemedicine is outpacing physical examination validation research. Given that certain specialties have been using telemedicine longer than others, lessons from those specialties might aid in developing standardized protocols for telemedicine. Neurology has been at the forefront of telemedicine use, initially through stroke care and later in multiple subspecialties. We present a framework for optimizing the history taking and physical examination process via telemedicine based on our experience in neurology. This mainly includes remotely examining a patient unassisted or with an untrained assistant present on the patient side of the connection. We also discuss the need for trained, certified assistants to assist the off-site physician in history taking and physical examination. These certified assistants would be allied health professionals who perform high-quality cued patient examinations under direct physician supervision with no responsibility to diagnose or treat. This contrasts with the approach seen in advanced practice providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners who undergo years of training to diagnose and treat patients under supervision.

SUMMARY ANSWER Temporary ovarian suspension for 36-48 h following laparoscopic treatment of severe endometriosis does not result in a significant reduction of postoperative ovarian adhesions. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY Pelvic adhesions often develop following laparoscopic surgery for severe pelvic endometriosis. Adhesions can cause chronic pelvic pain and fertility problems compromising the success of treatment. Small observational studies suggested that temporary postoperative ovarian suspension to the abdominal wall may significantly reduce the prevalence of postoperative ovarian adhesions. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION This was a prospective within group comparison double-blind RCT. We recruited premenopausal women with severe pelvic endometriosis who required extensive laparoscopic surgery with preservation of the uterus and ovaries. Severity of the disease and eligibility for inclusion were determined at surgery. A total of 55 women were randomized to unilateral ovarian suspension for 36-48 h, 52 of which were included in the final analysis. Both ovaries were routinely suspended to the anterior abdominal wall during surgery. At the end of the operation, each woman was randomized to having only one ovary suspended postoperatively. The suture suspending the contralateral ovary was cut and a new transabdominal suture was inserted to act as a placebo. Both sutures were removed 36-48 h after surgery prior to discharge. Three months after surgery, all women attended for a detailed transvaginal ultrasound scan to assess ovarian mobility. Both the women and the ultrasound operators were blinded as to the side of postoperative ovarian suspension. The primary outcome was the prevalence of ovarian adhesions as described on ultrasound examination. Secondary outcomes were the severity of adhesions and the presence and intensity of postoperative pain. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS All 55 participants had severe pelvic endometriosis confirmed at laparoscopy. As each participant had only one of their ovaries suspended at the end of surgery, they acted as their own control. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE The median interval between ovarian suspension and postoperative scan was 99 days (interquartile range 68-114). There was no significant difference (P = 0.23) in the prevalence of postoperative ovarian adhesions between the suspended (20/52) and unsuspended (27/52) side (38.5 versus 51.9%) [odds ratio 0.56 (95% confidence interval 0.22-1.35)]. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION Ovaries were suspended postoperatively for 36-48 h. Longer suspension could result in lower prevalence of postoperative adhesions. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS The value of temporary ovarian suspension in women having surgery for mild-to-moderate endometriosis should be investigated further. The potential benefits of other adhesion prevention strategies, such as surgical barrier agents, in women undergoing surgical treatment for severe pelvic endometriosis should also be explored.

METHODS We identified acute ischemic stroke patients in the Get With the Guidelines-Stroke data set who were treated with IV tissue plasminogen activator between April 2003 and September 2009 and had complete data on lipid profiles and complications. Potential predictors of sICH were tested in univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS The analysis included 22 216 IV tissue plasminogen activator-treated acute ischemic stroke patients. Overall, 1104 (4.97%) experienced sICH (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke definition). In univariate analysis, patients with sICH were more often taking antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, and diabetes mellitus medications. There was no relationship between low density lipoprotein or total cholesterol and sICH in univariate analysis. However, the risk of sICH increased with higher high density lipoprotein, 6.1% in Q4 versus 4.7% in Q1, P=0.0013; and lower triglyceride levels, 5.9% in Q1 versus 4.2% in Q4, P<0.0001. In multivariable models, although the high density lipoprotein and triglyceride levels were modestly associated with sICH, low density lipoprotein and total cholesterol were not. Lipid-lowering medications were not independently associated with sICH.

RESULTS The sequence analysis and phylogenetic relationships indicated high sequence identity and closed clusters with many types of coronavirus. In our analysis, the full-genome of SARS-CoV-2 showed the highest sequence (nucleotide) identity with SARS-bat-ZC45 (87.7%). The overall sequence identity ranged from 74.3% to 87.7% with selected SARS viruses. The recombination analysis indicated the bat SARS virus is a potential recombinant and serves as a major and minor parent. We have predicted 442 siRNAs and finally selected only 19 functional, and potential siRNAs. CONCLUSIONS The siRNAs were predicted and selected based on their greater potency and specificity. The predicted siRNAs need to be validated experimentally for their effective binding and antiviral activity.","output":"In silico Prediction and Designing of Potential siRNAs to be Used as Antivirals Against SARS-CoV-2."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To determine whether quaternary ammonium (k21) binds to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein via computational molecular docking simulations, the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain complexed with ACE-2 (PDB ID: 6LZG) was downloaded from RCSB PD and prepared using Schrodinger 2019-4 The entry of SARS-CoV-2 inside humans is through lung tissues with a pH of 7 38-7 42 A two-dimensional structure of k-21 was drawn using the 2D-sketcher of Maestro 12 2 and trimmed of C18 alkyl chains from all four arms with the assumption that the core moiety k-21 was without C18 The immunogenic potential of k21/QA was conducted using the C-ImmSim server for a position-specific scoring matrix analyzing the human host immune system response Therapeutic probability was shown using prediction models with negative and positive control drugs Negative scores show that the binding of a quaternary ammonium compound with the spike protein's binding site is favorable The drug molecule has a large Root Mean Square Deviation fluctuation due to the less complex geometry of the drug molecule, which is suggestive of a profound impact on the regular geometry of a viral protein There is high concentration of Immunoglobulin M/Immunoglobulin G, which is concomitant of virus reduction The proposed drug formulation based on quaternary ammonium to characterize affinity to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using simulation and computational immunological methods has shown promising findings","output":"Molecular Dynamic Simulation Search for Possible Amphiphilic Drug Discovery for Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The architecture of fiscal federalism in the United States represents an obstacle for prompt and comprehensive policy responses to economic crises, especially by subnational levels of government.

By comparing the response to the COVID-19 crisis during the Trump administration with the response to the Great Recession during the Obama administration, we show that while the speed and magnitude of federal aid was unprecedented in 2020, it was nevertheless conditional in nature and beset by familiar political and institutional obstacles. Despite major fiscal pressures, state revenues rebounded earlier than expected, in part due to the relaxation of public health measures and the collection of taxes from online transactions; yet, state resources remained strained throughout the year, especially in states reliant on the hospitality and the oil sectors. And while local property taxes were buoyed by a surging housing market, cities and counties were confronted with declining revenue from other sources and intense emergency spending needs.

However, the comprehensive profile of suicidal ideation among the general population has not been systematically investigated in a large sample in the age of COVID-19. METHODS: A national online cross-sectional survey was conducted between February 28, 2020 and March 11, 2020 in a representative sample of Chinese adults aged 18 years and older. Suicidal ideation was assessed using item 9 of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. The prevalence of suicidal ideation and its risk factors was evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 56,679 participants (27,149 males and 29,530 females) were included. The overall prevalence of suicidal ideation was 16.4%, including 10.9% seldom, 4.1% often, and 1.4% always suicidal ideation. The prevalence of suicidal ideation was higher in males (19.1%) and individuals aged 18C24 years (24.7%) than in females (14.0%) and those aged 45 years and older (11.9%). Suicidal ideation was more prevalent in individuals with suspected or confirmed infection (63.0%), frontline workers (19.2%), and people with pre-existing mental disorders (41.6%). Experience of quarantine, unemployed, and increased psychological stress during the pandemic were associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation and its severity. However, paying more attention to and gaining a better understanding of COVID-19-related knowledge, especially information about psychological interventions, could reduce the risk. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated prevalence of suicidal ideation among the general population in China during COVID-19 was significant.

However, the optimal perineural dose of DEX is still uncertain. It is important to elucidate this characteristic because DEX may cause dose-dependent complications. The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the optimal dose of perineural DEX for prolonged analgesia after brachial plexus block (BPB) in adult patients undergoing upper limb surgery. METHOD: A search strategy was created to identify suitable randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in Embase, PubMed and The Cochrane Library from inception date to Jan, 2021. All adult patients undergoing upper limb surgery under BPB were eligible. The RCTs comparing DEX as an adjuvant to local anesthetic (LA) with LA alone for BPB were included. The primary outcome was duration of analgesia for perineural DEX. Secondary outcomes included visual analog scale (VAS) in 12 and 24 h, consumption of analgesics in 24 h, and adverse events. RESULTS: Fifty-seven RCTs, including 3332 patients, were identified. The subgroup analyses and regression analyses revealed that perineural DEX dose of 30-50 g is an appropriate dosage. With short-/intermediate-acting LAs, the mean difference (95% confidence interval [CI]) of analgesia duration with less than and more than 60 g doses was 220.31 (153.13-287.48) minutes and 68.01 (36.37-99.66) minutes, respectively. With long-acting LAs, the mean differences (95% CI) with less than and more than 60 g doses were 332.45 (288.43-376.48) minutes and 284.85 (220.31-349.39) minutes. CONCLUSION: 30-50 g DEX as adjuvant can provides a longer analgesic time compared to LA alone and it did not increase the risk of bradycardia and hypotension.","output":"Optimal dose of perineural dexmedetomidine to prolong analgesia after brachial plexus blockade: a systematic review and Meta-analysis of 57 randomized clinical trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Ferritin, the cellular protein storage for iron, has emerged as a key molecule in the immune system, orchestrating the cellular defense against inflammation At the end of 2019, the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) rapidly spread throughout China and other countries around the world, resulting in a viral pandemic OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the correlation between ferritin and disease severity in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we obtained clinical and laboratory data regarding 39 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 from two hospitals in Israel RESULTS: A significant increase in ferritin levels was demonstrated in patients with moderate and severe disease, compared to patients with mild disease (P = 0 006 and 0 005, respectively) Severe patients had significantly higher levels of ferritin (2817 6 ng/ml) than non-severe patients (708 6 ng/ml) P = 0 02 CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary cross-sectional study, elevated ferritin levels were shown to correlate with disease severity in 39 patients from Israel with confirmed COVID-19 infection Our results further strengthen the hypothesis that severe COVID-19 disease might be due to an underlying dysregulated hyperimmune response In order to identify these patients early and prioritized resources, we believe that all patients with COVID-19 should be screened for hyperferritinemia","output":"Ferritin as a Marker of Severity in COVID-19 Patients: A Fatal Correlation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In France, Health Promotion (HP) practitioners lack tools to document and share how their interventions work. To bridge this gap, a national committee of HP practitioners, policymakers and researchers designed a new method to Capitalize, i.e. collect, analyse and share through summaries, Experiential Knowledge (EK) in HP (CEKHP). A training program was created in 2020 to disseminate CEKHP process and tools. OBJECTIVES: After undertaking CEKHP training, participants shall be able to design and promote their own CEKHP projects. Each training session (30 hours in total) alternates short theoretical courses, workshops and the completion of a capitalization in real professional situation. Expert members of the committee designed the training following a skills-based approach. They sequentially identified: targeted occupations, competencies, how to assess them, then designed the curriculum. Two core competencies are built up: 1/ valuing EKHP, through advocacy and project design; 2/ guiding with CEKHP the collection of EK on HP interventions and its circulation. The training covers 11 competencies of the WHO-ASPHER Competency Framework. In 2021, 2 sessions were organised to test its relevance in an adult learning situation (group of 12 professionals) and in a master's degree program (group of 9 students). RESULTS: The learning-by-doing method was fruitful: all participants, in both settings, completed their capitalization. A few trainees chose to document interventions or organisational adaptations linked with the Covid-19 crisis, for which EK is especially valuable. They also reported added benefits: self-reinforcement, rare in-depth exchanges with fellow HP practitioners, etc. CONCLUSIONS: A training strategy combining adult learning and student teaching can be effective to disseminate CEKHP. All trainees are now invited to join a community of practice, which will provide them with additional tools and network resources, through a national EKHP resource center.

Indeed, most studies thus far have focused on the risk of increase and aggravation of other psychiatric disorders as a consequence of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Yet, risk of onset or aggravation of panic disorder, especially the subtype with prominent respiratory symptoms, which is characterized by a fear response conditioning to interoceptive sensations (e.g., respiratory), and hypervigilance to these interoceptive signals, could be expected in the current situation. Indeed, respiratory symptoms, such as coughs and dyspnea, are among the most commonly associated with the SARS-CoV-2 (59-82% and 31-55%, respectively), and respiratory symptoms are associated with a poor illness prognosis. Hence, given that some etiological and maintenance factors associated with panic disorder - i.e., fear conditioning to abnormal breathing patterns attributable or not to the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), as well as hypervigilance towards breathing abnormalities - are supposedly more prevalent, one could expect an increased risk of panic disorder onset or aggravation following the COVID-19 pandemic in people who were affected by the virus, but also those who were not. In people with the comorbidity (i.e., panic disorder or panic attacks and the COVID-19), it is particularly important to be aware of the risk of hypokalemia in specific at-risk situations or prescriptions. For instance, in the case of salbutamol prescription, which might be overly used in patients with anxiety disorders and COVID-19, or in patients presenting with diarrhea and vomiting. Hypokalemia is associated with an increased risk of torsade de pointe; thus, caution is required when prescribing specific psychotropic drugs, such as the antidepressants citalopram and escitalopram, which are first-line treatments for panic disorder, but also hydroxyzine, aiming at anxiety relief. The results reviewed here highlight the importance of considering and further investigating the impact of the current pandemic on the diagnosis and treatment of panic disorder (alone or comorbid with the COVID-19).","output":"Panic and pandemic: Narrative review of the literature on the links and risks of panic disorder as a consequence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The murine coronavirus surface glycoprotein gene was expressed as a fusion protein in bacteria, and the expressed protein was used to generate S protein-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs).

This study assessed the impact of a risk stratification guideline for empiric antimicrobial selection relative to acceptance rates and clinical outcomes. METHODS: In 2017, a guideline for inpatients with HCAP was launched. High risk (HR) of MDR GN was defined as patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), or with >1 risk factor including: receipt of any antimicrobial within 30 days or broad spectrum antimicrobials within 90 days, hemodialysis dependence, or immunocompromised. HR patients were recommended to receive antimicrobials covering MDR GN and low-risk patients to narrower CAP regimens. Patients treated for HCAP post guideline implementation were compared with a historic 2014 cohort for guideline concordance, antimicrobial selection, and clinical outcomes. AST interventions were also assessed. RESULTS: Overall, 105 patients in the post-implementation period were compared with 309 historic patients. Guideline-concordant risk-stratified therapy increased 13% [95% CI (3%, 24%)] overall. Clinical failure rates were similar with 11% vs 10% (P = 0.608) in the pre- and post-implementation periods, with an 84% AST acceptance rate (Figure 1).

To verify the derangement of acid-base disorders in COVID-19, we investigated the distribution and the impact of acid-base disorders on the survival of symptomatic patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19. METHOD: We retrospectively collected data from electronic charts of all COVID-19 patients hospitalized at the University Hospital of Modena from 4 March to 20 June 2020. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis was required to monitor pulmonary gas exchange and acid-base status. A pH of less than 7.37 was categorized as acidemia and a pH of more than 7.42 was categorized as alkalemia. 211 patients were included in the study population. In patients with multiple ABG analyses, we selected only the first measurement. RESULTS: The estimated mean age of the population was 64.7 15,3 years with a high predominance of males (71.6%). Half of the population referred dyspnea and 61.4% at physical examination. Most patients (82.6%) were on oxygen therapy when ABG analysis was performed. Overall, ABG analyses revealed acute respiratory compromise manifesting with a low arterial partial pressure of oxygen (P0(2), 70.225.1 mmHg), oxygen saturation (SO(2), 92%) and a mild reduction of PO(2)/FiO(2) ratio (231129). Acid-base disturbance was found in the 79.7% of the patients, and contrary to our expectation, metabolic alkalosis (33.6%) was the main alteration followed by respiratory alkalosis (30.3%), combined alkalosis (9.4%) respiratory acidosis (3.3%) metabolic acidosis (2.8%) and other compensated acid-base disturbances (3.6%). ANOVA with post hoc Tukey, revealed statistically significant differences in age, sex, serum level of K, Na, bicarbonate, creatinine of PCO(2), PO2/FiO(2) ratio, CKD, symptoms (caught, diarrhea) and fatality rate among groups.

The study aims to determine the accuracy and cost of the STANDARD Q COVID-19 AG test compared with RT-PCR. METHODS: Individuals 18 years or older with an appointment for a RT-PCR test on 26-31 December 2020 at a public test centre in Copenhagen, Denmark were invited to participate. An oropharyngeal swab was collected for RT-PCR analysis, followed by a nasopharyngeal swab examined by the AG test (SD Biosensor). The diagnostic accuracy of the AG test was calculated with RT-PCR as reference. Costs were evaluated for both tests. RESULTS: A total of 4,811 paired conclusive test results were collected (median age: 45 years, female: 53%). The RT-PCR test revealed 221 (4.6%) positive tests. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the AG test were 69.7% and 99.5%, respectively. Viral cycle threshold values were significantly higher in individuals with false negative AG tests than in individuals who were true positives. The RT-PCR test and AG test costs were 67.0 DKK (10.8 USD) and 35.0 DKK (5.7 USD), respectively, per positive case detected at 100,000 daily tests. CONCLUSIONS: The AG test enables mass testing and provides immediate results, which is important in SARS-CoV-2 screening. The AG test is a good and relevant supplement to RT-PCR testing in public SARS-CoV-2 screenings. FUNDING: This project received no external funding.

METHODS We investigated the effects of respiratory mechanics (normal, obstructive, restrictive, or mixed), inspiratory effort (-2, -8, or -15 cm H2O), flow cycle criteria (5-40% peak inspiratory flow), and duration of inspiratory muscle relaxation (0.18-0.3 s) on LIRAP during PSV using a lung simulator and 4 types of ventilators. RESULTS LIRAP occurred with all lung models when inspiratory effort was medium to high and duration of inspiratory muscle relaxation was short. The normal lung model was associated with the fastest LIRAP, whereas the obstructive lung model was associated with the slowest. Unless lung mechanics were normal or mixed, LIRAP was unlikely to occur when inspiratory effort was low. Different ventilators were also associated with differences in LIRAP speed. Except for within the restrictive lung model, changes in flow cycle level did not abolish LIRAP if inspiratory effort was medium to high. Increased duration of inspiratory relaxation also led to the elimination of LIRAP. Simulation of expiratory muscle contraction revealed that LIRAP occurred only when expiratory muscle contraction occurred sometime after the beginning of inspiration. CONCLUSIONS Our simulation study reveals that both respiratory resistance and compliance may affect LIRAP. Except for under restrictive lung conditions, LIRAP is unlikely to be abolished by simply lowering flow cycle criteria when inspiratory effort is strong and relaxation time is rapid. LIRAP may be caused by expiratory muscle contraction when it occurs during inspiration.","output":"Simulation of late inspiratory rise in airway pressure during pressure support ventilation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research aims to explore the reality of the soundscape preferences of Chinese urban residents in general public landscape in the post-pandemic era, and then to propose design recommendations to meet the practical needs of peoples preferences for landscapeespecially soundscapesin the post-pandemic era.

The remote healthcare methodologies have achieved significant development based on reliable and low-latency transmissions of 5G. In remote health monitoring, the Internet of Things (IoT)-based physical monitoring devices need to transmit collected physical data in a real time and highly reliable manner to ensure accurate monitoring of patients. However, due to the unreliability of wireless link and the latency of data queue, it is a challenging issue to achieve high reliability communication and low delay transmission at the same time. Meanwhile, the available bandwidth is limited and the cost of renting spectrum is not negligible. Thus, it is essential for the devices to reduce communication costs while ensuring the efficient data transmission. Toward this end, our goal is to minimize the total costs of leasing bandwidth by jointly optimizing the access link and backhaul transmission, subject to the delay and reliability constraints. Considering the requirements of access link and queue together, a cost minimization problem is formulated, which is non-linear and non-convex and is hard to solve straightforwardly. Through problem equivalent transforming, a gradient descent-based algorithm is proposed to find a suboptimal solution.

Despite benefits, telework can also cause workers' mental and physical health, and forced telework during the COVID-19 pandemic has promoted the onset of these problems. Objectives: The objective of the study was to analyze the management of ergonomics in teleworking workplaces and the association between pain longer than three days and preventive measures provided by employers in Latvia during the 1st emergency restrictions, which were in force between 12 March and 9 June 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Web-survey was used to gather information from respondents C workers. In total, 1006 workers fully filled in the questionnaire in October 2020. Four hundred eighty-three teleworkers of both genders were identified. Results: 35.7% of respondents reported pain longer than three days. The odds of pain were increased in case of lack of all analyzed preventive measures. For those who reported not being provided with a computer and other IT equipment OR for pain was 1.50 (CI 0.95-2.37). Even higher OR was observed in case of not receiving advice on how to arrange an ergonomic workstation (OR= 2.37, CI 1.32-4.25) and not having identified working conditions (OR= 2.61, CI 1.43-4.77). The highest risk was observed if the employer had not provided an office table and office chair (OR=5.46, CI 1.78-16.80). Conclusion: Teleworkers not receiving support from the employer on the arrangement of home offices have an increased risk of having pain for longer than three days.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the CAZS/hydrodebrider treatment on Staphylococcus aureus biofilms in the sheep model of CRS. METHODS Forty-two sheep frontal sinuses were inoculated with S. aureus, followed by 7 days of biofilm growth. Sinuses were randomized to one of nine treatment groups: control, hydrodebrider with saline or CAZS (killed on day 0 or day 7 posttreatment), CAZS, or saline flush (killed on day 0 or day 7 posttreatment). Confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) was used to confirm extent of biofilm reduction. Samples of each sinus were taken, assessing cilia morphology using electron microscopy. RESULTS A mean of 37.22  9.65% of control (no treatment) CSLM images taken showed biofilms.

An assay for metanephrines from dried blood spots (DBSs) would be of high clinical utility as it simplifies sample collection, enables remote sampling, and could increase compliance with the clinical recommendation for supine sampling. Moreover, DBS sampling facilitates the measurement of blood-derived metanephrines in pediatric patients C where DBSs are well-established C in order to diagnose neuroblastomas. Here, we adapted an established derivatization-based LC-MRM-MS assay for plasma catecholamines, and optimized the sample extraction, LC, and MS parameters to produce a fast, sensitive, and robust method for the measurement of metanephrines from DBSs, including 3-methoxytyramine.

The immediate animal origin of the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2, remains unknown, a notoriously challenging task for emerging disease investigations. Coevolution with hosts leads to specific evolutionary signatures within viral genomes that can inform likely animal origins. We obtained a set of 650 spike protein and 511 whole genome nucleotide sequences from 225 and 187 viruses belonging to the family Coronaviridae, respectively. We then trained random forest models independently on genome composition biases of spike protein and whole genome sequences, including dinucleotide and codon usage biases in order to predict animal host (of nine possible categories, including human). In hold-one-out cross-validation, predictive accuracy on unseen coronaviruses consistently reached 73%, indicating evolutionary signal in spike proteins to be just as informative as whole genome sequences. However, different composition biases were informative in each case. Applying optimised random forest models to classify human sequences of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV revealed evolutionary signatures consistent with their recognised intermediate hosts (camelids, carnivores), while human sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were predicted as having bat hosts (suborder Yinpterochiroptera), supporting bats as the suspected origins of the current pandemic. In addition to phylogeny, variation in genome composition can act as an informative approach to predict emerging virus traits as soon as sequences are available.

The diagnostic performance was then evaluated and compared to experienced radiologists on an independent testing dataset. Diagnostic performance metrics were calculated using Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis. Operating points with high positive (>10) and low negative (<0.01) likelihood ratios to stratify the risk of COVID-19 being present were identified and validated. RESULTS: The model achieved an overall accuracy of 0.956 (AUC) on an independent testing dataset of 90 patients. Both rule-in and rule out thresholds were identified and tested. At the rule-in operating point, sensitivity and specificity were 84.4 % and 93.3 % and did not differ from both radiologists (pa?>a?0.05).

We developed an in vitro lung model to evaluate sealants' efficacy and tested the widely used human thrombin-fibrinogen sponge, TachoSil as an example. MATERIALS AND METHODS The caudal lobe of freshly excised swine lung (n = 10) was intubated and ventilated. A focal superficial parenchymal defect (40  25 mm) was created in the inflated lung. AAL was assessed with increasing inspired tidal volume (TVi). After sealant application, AAL was assessed in the same way until burst failure, defined as an AAL exceeding 20 mL. To evaluate the elasticity of the sealant, the length of defect was recorded in the inflated lung. RESULTS Superficial parenchymal defects resulted in AAL increasing with ascending TVi. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed strong correlation between AAL and maximal inspiratory pressure, compliance and resistance. At TVi = 400, 500, and 600 mL, TachoSil achieved sealing in ten, eight, and seven tests, respectively. As TVi increased, superficial defects were still sealed in four, two, and two tests at TVi = 700, 800, and 900 mL, respectively. The burst pressure was 42  5 cmH2O. Adhesive failures were found at the burst pressure in all tests. Concerning elasticity, TachoSil allowed an expansion of the covered lung defect of 7  6 mm. CONCLUSIONS TachoSil demonstrated a strong sealing efficiency and marked elasticity in treating AAL.

SARS-CoV-2, a RNA single-stranded virus, has been detected in the amniotic fluid, in the cord blood and in the placentas of the infected women. In the light of these findings, the theoretical risk of intrauterine infection for fetuses, or of peripartum infection occurring during delivery for neonates, has a biological plausibility.

Small series have demonstrated the feasibility of single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). Our series adds to the literature by demonstrating a variety of ancillary techniques that may be employed to perform single incision LC safely, and compares our early experience with that of our standard LC. METHODS We performed a retrospective chart review of patients who underwent single incision LC between February 2008 and April 2009. These patients were compared with an equal number of randomly selected patients undergoing LC during the same period. We identified 25 attempted single incision LC, which were included in our analysis. RESULTS Single incision LC was successfully performed in 21 patients, with only 4 patients requiring conversion to LC. No patients in either group had acute cholecystitis. The critical view of safety was documented in 20 of 21 patients undergoing a successful single incision LC compared with all patients undergoing LC. Operative time was significantly longer in the single incision group. Complications were minor and comparable between the 2 groups. In 9 patients (43%), a suture passer helped to retract the gallbladder. In 8 patients (38%), 1 or 2 Prolene sutures placed by means of a Keith needle helped to retract the gallbladder over the liver and/or helped to retract the infundibulum.

End-point PCR primers were designed through conservation analysis based on kmer frequency in SARS-CoV-2 and human respiratory pathogen genomes. Highly conserved regions were identified for primer design, and the resulting PCR primers were used to amplify 871 nasopharyngeal human samples with a previous RT-qPCR based SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.

OnabotulinumtoxinA and topiramate have demonstrated efficacy (treatment benefit under ideal conditions) for the prevention of headaches in people with CM in clinical trials, but real-world studies suggest markedly different clinical effectiveness (treatment benefit based on a blend of efficacy and tolerability). This study sought to evaluate patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of onabotulinumtoxinA versus topiramate immediate release for people with CM. METHODS: FORWARD was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, open-label, phase 4 study comparing onabotulinumtoxinA 155 U every 12 weeks with topiramate 50 to 100 mg/day for &#8804;36 weeks in people with CM. PROs measured included the Headache Impact Test (HIT-6), 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire Quick Depression Assessment (PHQ-9), Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Specific Health Problem (WPAI:SHP), and Functional Impact of Migraine Questionnaire (FIMQ). RESULTS: A total of 282 patients were randomized and treated with onabotulinumtoxinA (n = 140) or topiramate (n = 142). From baseline to week 30, mean HIT-6 test scores improved significantly in patients taking onabotulinumtoxinA compared with topiramate (P < .001). Improvements in depression over time were observed via larger changes in PHQ-9 scores with onabotulinumtoxinA than topiramate (P < .001). Work productivity assessed via WPAI:SHP scores revealed significant improvements with onabotulinumtoxinA versus topiramate in Work Productivity Loss (P = .024) and Activity Impairment (P < .001) domains. Results from the FIMQ also revealed a larger reduction from baseline with onabotulinumtoxinA vs topiramate (P < .0001). CONCLUSION: OnabotulinumtoxinA treatment had more favorable real-world effectiveness than topiramate on depression, headache impact, functioning and daily living, activity, and work productivity. The overall study results suggest that the beneficial effects on a range of PROs are the result of improved effectiveness when onabotulinumtoxinA is used as preventive treatment for CM.

Given these concerns, we investigated whether the pandemic affected visits to family physicians differently across sociodemographic groups. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using electronic medical records from family physician practices within the University of Toronto Practice-Based Research Network. We evaluated primary care visits for a fixed cohort of patients who were active within the database as of Jan. 1, 2019, to estimate the number of patients who visited their family physician (visitor rate) and the number of distinct visits (visit volume) between Jan. 1, 2019, to June 30, 2020. We compared trends in visitor rate and visit volume during the pandemic (Mar. 14 to June 30, 2020) with the same period in the previous year (Mar. 14 to June 30, 2019) across sociodemographic factors, including age, sex, neighbourhood income, material deprivation and ethnic concentration. RESULTS: We included 365 family physicians and 372 272 patients. Compared with the previous year, visitor rates during the pandemic period dropped by 34.5%, from 357 visitors per 1000 people to 292 visitors per 1000 people. Declines in visit volume during the pandemic were less pronounced (21.8% fewer visits), as the mean number of visits per patient increased during the pandemic (from 1.64 to 1.96). The declines in visitor rate and visit volume varied based on patient age and sex, but not socioeconomic status. INTERPRETATION: Although the number of visits to family physicians dropped substantially during the first few weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario, patients from communities with low socioeconomic status did not appear to be disproportionately affected. In this primary care setting, the pandemic appears not to have worsened socioeconomic disparities in access to care.","output":"Changes in family medicine visits across sociodemographic groups after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario: a retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the delivery of primary care in the NHS.

Higher AB were associated with experiencing dyspnea during natural infection, as was the total number of symptoms reported during the COVID-19 disease course. Both local and systemic symptoms following 1st and 2nd dose of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines were predictive of higher AB after vaccination, as were the demographic factors of age and Hispanic ethnicity. Lastly, there was a significant temporal relationship between AB and days since infection or vaccination. Conclusion Vaccination in COVID+ individuals ensures a more robust immune response. Experiencing systemic and local symptoms post-vaccine is suggestive of higher AB, which may confer greater protection.

We aimed to develop an efficient, rapid and scalable surveillance strategy for detecting all remaining COVID-19 community transmission through exhaustive identification of every active transmission chain. We also identified measures to enable early detection and effective management of any reintroduction of transmission once containment measures are lifted to ensure strong containment measures do not need to be reinstated. Methods We compared efficiency and sensitivity to detect community transmission chains through testing of: hospital cases; primary care fever and cough patients; or asymptomatic community members, using surveillance evaluation methods and mathematical modelling, varying testing capacities and prevalence of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 fever and cough, and the reproduction number. System requirements for increasing testing to allow exhaustive identification of all transmission chains, and then enable complete follow-up of all cases and contacts within each chain, were assessed per million population. Findings Assuming 20% of cases are asymptomatic and all symptomatic COVID-19 cases present to primary care, with high transmission (R=2.2) there are a median of 13 unrecognised community cases (5 infectious) when a transmission chain is identified through hospital surveillance versus 3 unrecognised cases (1 infectious) through primary care surveillance. 3 unrecognised community upstream community cases themselves are estimated to generate a further 22-33 contacts requiring follow-up. The unrecognised community cases rise to 5 if only 50% of symptomatic cases present to primary care. Screening for asymptomatic disease in the community cannot exhaustively identify all transmission under any of the scenarios assessed. The additional capacity required to screen all fever and cough primary care patients would be approximately 2,000 tests/million population per week using 1/16 pooling of samples. Interpretation Screening all syndromic fever and cough primary care presentations, in combination with exhaustive and meticulous case and contact identification and management, enables appropriate early detection and elimination of community transmission of COVID-19. If testing capacity is limited, interventions such as pooling allow increased case detection, even given reduced test sensitivity. Wider identification and testing of all upstream contacts, (i.e. potential sources of infection for identified cases, and their related transmission chains) is critical, and to be done exhaustively requires more resources than downstream contact tracing. The most important factor in determining the performance of such a surveillance system is community participation in screening and follow up, and as such, appropriate community engagement, messaging and support to encourage presentation and compliance is essential. We provide operational guidance on implementing such a system.","output":"Exit strategies: optimising feasible surveillance for detection, elimination and ongoing prevention of COVID-19 community transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study was designed to determine if Resolvin D1 (RvD1), a pro-resolution metabolite of the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid, could decrease myocardial infarct size with delivered at the onset of ischemia.

Oral non-absorbable antibiotic prophylaxis (OAP) can be administered preoperatively to reduce the risk of SSIs. Its efficacy without simultaneous mechanical cleaning is unknown. METHODS: The Precaution trial was a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial conducted in six Dutch hospitals. Adult patients who underwent elective colorectal surgery were randomized to receive either a three-day course of preoperative OAP with tobramycin and colistin or placebo. The primary composite endpoint was the incidence of deep SSI or mortality within 30 days after surgery. Secondary endpoints included both infectious and non-infectious complications at 30 days and six months after surgery. RESULTS: The study was prematurely ended due to the loss of clinical equipoise. At that time, 39 patients had been randomized to active OAP and 39 to placebo, which reflected 8.1% of the initially pursued sample size. Nine (11.5%) patients developed the primary outcome, of whom four had been randomized to OAP (4/39; 10.3%) and five to placebo (5/39; 12.8%). This corresponds to a risk ratio in the intention-to-treat analysis of 0.80 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23C2.78). In the per-protocol analysis, the relative risk was 0.64 (95% CI 0.12C3.46). CONCLUSIONS: Observational data emerging during the study provided new evidence for the effectiveness of OAP that changed both the clinical and medical ethical landscape for infection prevention in colorectal surgery. We therefore consider it unethical to continue randomizing patients to placebo. We recommend the implementation of OAP in clinical practice and continuing monitoring of infection rates and antibiotic susceptibilities.

Advantages of a totally laparoscopic approach to distal gastrectomy, including small wound size, minimal invasiveness, and safe anastomosis, have been recently reported. Here, we introduce a new procedure for intracorporeal gastro-gastrostomy combined with totally laparoscopic pylorus-preserving gastrectomy (TLPPG). METHODS The stomach is transected after sufficient lymphadenectomy with preservation of infrapyloric vessels and vagal nerves. The proximal stomach is first transected near the Demel line, and the distal side is transected 4 to 5 cm from the pyloric ring. To create end-to-end gastro-gastrostomy, the posterior wall of the anastomosis is stapled with a linear stapler and the anterior wall is made by manual suturing intracorporeally. We retrospectively assessed the postoperative surgical outcomes via medical records. The primary endpoint in the present study is safety. RESULTS Sixteen patients underwent TLPPG with intracorporeal reconstruction. All procedures were successfully performed without any intraoperative complications. The mean operative time was 275 min, with mean blood loss of 21 g. With the exception of one patient who had gastric stasis, 15 patients were discharged uneventfully between postoperative days 8 and 11. CONCLUSIONS Our novel hybrid technique for totally intracorporeal end-to-end anastomosis was performed safely without mini-laparotomy.

The reproduction number has been found to respond to public health interventions changing throughout the pandemic waves. However, the actual global burden of SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown due to severe under-ascertainment of cases. The use of reported deaths has been pointed out as a more reliable source of information, likely less prone to under-reporting. Given that daily deaths occur from past infections weighted by their probability of death, one may infer the true number of infections accounting for their age distribution, using the data on reported deaths. We adopt this framework and assume that the transmission dynamics generating the total number of underlying infections can be described by a continuous time transmission model expressed through a system of non-linear ordinary differential equations, where the transmission rate and consequently the reproduction number are stochastic. We model the transmission rate as a diffusion process, with distinct volatility phases for each pandemic wave, allowing to reveal both the effect of control strategies and the changes in individuals behavior. We study the case of 6 European countries and estimate the time-varying reproduction number ($R_t$) as well as the true cumulative number of infected individuals using Stan's No-U-Turn sampler variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. As we estimate the true number of infections through deaths, we offer a more accurate estimate of $R_t$.

Cox proportional hazard regression model was applied to identify gendered effect on mortality of COVID\\\\19 after adjusting age, comorbidity and smoking history. Multiple linear regression method was used to explore the influence of sex on inflammation reaction. RESULTS: Males had higher mortality than females did (22.2% vs. 10.4%), with the HR of 1.923 (95% CI, 1.181\\\\3.130); elder age and comorbidity were significantly associated with decease of COVID\\\\19 patients.

The aim of our study was to estimate the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in HCWs in our hospital after the first and the second pandemic wave and also to characterize the distribution of this seroprevalence in relation to various criteria. MethodsAt the end of the two recruitment periods, a total of 4008 serological tests were performed in this single-center cross-sectional study. After completing a questionnaire including demographic and personal data, possible previous COVID-19 diagnostic test results and/or the presence of symptoms potentially related to COVID-19, the study participants underwent blood sampling and serological testing using DiaSorins LIAISON(R) SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG test for the first phase and LIAISON(R) SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG test for the second phase of this study. Results302 study participants (10,72%) in the first round of the study and 404 (33,92%) in the second round were positive for SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies. The prevalence of seropositivity observed after the second wave was 3,16 times higher than after the first wave. We confirmed that direct, prolonged and repeated contact with patients or their environment was a predominant seroconversion factor, but more unexpectedly, that this was the case for all HCWs and not only caregivers. Finally, the notion of high-risk contact seemed more readily identifiable in ones workplace than in ones private life. ConclusionOur study confirmed that HCWs are at a significantly higher risk of contracting COVID-19 than the general population, and suggest that repeated contacts with at-risk patients, regardless of the HCWs profession, represent the most important risk factor for seroconversion.

Our framework can provide us with all potential attack vectors, each representing a set of sensor measurements to be altered, for an SHS given a specific set of attack attributes, allowing us to realize the system's resiliency, thus the insight to enhance the robustness of the model. We implement SHChecker on a synthetic and a real dataset, which affirms that our framework can reveal potential attack vectors in an IoMT system. This is a novel effort to formally analyze supervised and unsupervised machine learning models for black-box SHS threat analysis.","output":"A Novel Framework for Threat Analysis of Machine Learning-based Smart Healthcare Systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The complement system is one of the body's major innate immune defense mechanisms in vertebrates. Its function is to detect foreign bodies and promote their elimination through opsonisation or lysis. Complement proteins play an important role in the immunopathogenesis of several disorders. However, excessive complement activation does not confer more protection but instead leads to several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. With inappropriate activation of the complement system, activated complement proteins and glycoproteins may damage both healthy and diseased tissues. Development of complement inhibitors represents an effective approach in controlling dysregulated complement activity and reducing disease severity, yet few studies have investigated the nature and role of novel complement inhibitory proteins of viral origin. Viral complement inhibitors have important implications in understanding the importance of complement inhibition and their role as a promising novel therapeutic approach in diseases caused by dysregulated complement function. In this review, we discuss the role and importance of complement inhibitors derived from several viruses in the scope of human inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.","output":"Viral-derived complement inhibitors: current status and potential role in immunomodulation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The 2019 novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is causing cases of severe pneumonia. Lung ultrasound (LUS) could be a useful tool for physicians detecting a bilateral heterogeneous patchy distribution of pathologic findings in a symptomatic suggestive context. The aim of this study was to focus on the implications of limiting LUS examinations to specific regions of the chest. METHODS: Patients were evaluated with a standard sequence of LUS scans in 14 anatomic areas. A scoring system of LUS findings was reported, ranging from 0 to 3 (worst score, 3). The scores reported on anterior, lateral, and posterior landmarks were analyzed separately and compared with each other and with the global findings. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients were enrolled. A higher prevalence of score 0 was observed in the anterior region (44.08%). On the contrary, 21.05% of posterior regions and 13.62% of lateral regions were evaluated as score 3, whereas only 5.92% of anterior regions were classified as score 3. Findings from chest computed tomography performed in 16 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 correlated with and matched the distribution of findings from LUS.

Here, we investigated Spike-specific memory B cells and humoral responses in 145 subjects, up to six months after the BNT162b2 vaccine (Comirnaty) administration. Spike-specific antibody titers peaked 7 days after the second dose and significant titers and neutralizing activity were still observed after six months, despite a progressive decline over time. Concomitant to antibody reduction, Spike-specific memory B cells, mostly IgG class-switched, increased in blood of vaccinees and persisted six months after vaccination. Following in vitro restimulation, circulating memory B cells reactivated and produced Spike-specific antibodies. A high frequency of Spike-specific IgG+ plasmablasts, identified by computational analysis 7 days after boost, positively correlated with the generation of IgG+ memory B cells at six months.

The aim of this study is to determine the safety of this vaccine. Methods In an ongoing cohort study, health professionals from Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires vaccinated with the first component of the Sputnik V vaccine (a rAd26 vector-based) were followed up. Safety at 72 hs was analysed from a self-report form. Local and systemic reactions were characterized as mild, moderate and severe. Incident rates were calculated per 1000 person-hours by age groups and gender. Adjusted hazard ratio and 95% Confidence Interval (HR; 95%CI) is obtained by Cox Regression Model. Results 707 health professionals (mean age 35, 67% female) were vaccinated, response rate was 96,6% and 71,3% reported at least one ESAVI. Rate was 6.3 per 1.000 person-hours. Among local reactions, 54% reported pain at the injection site, 11% redness and swelling. Among systemic reactions 40% reported fever, 5% diarrhea and 68% new or worsened muscle pain. Five percent had serious adverse events that required medical evaluation and one inpatient. ESAVI rate was higher among females (65.4% vs 50%; HR 1.38, 95%CI 1.13-5.38) and in younger than 55 years-old (72.8% vs 32%; HR 2.66, 95%CI 1.32-1.68). Conclusion Active surveillance on safety for vaccines with emergency approval is mandatory. This study shows high rates of local and systemic reactions however early serious events were rare. Short term safety is supported by these preliminary findings.

During infection, airway epithelial cells secrete proinflammatory mediators that participate in the recruitment of immune cells. Virulence factors expressed by bacterial pathogens can alter epithelial cell gene expression and modulate this response. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen, expresses numerous virulence factors to facilitate establishment of infection and evade the host immune response. This study focused on identifying the role of two major P. aeruginosa virulence factors, type III (T3SS) and type VI (T6SS) secretion systems, on the early transcriptome response of airway epithelial cells in vitro. RESULTS: We performed RNA-seq analysis of the transcriptome response of type II pneumocytes during infection with P. aeruginosa in vitro. We observed that P. aeruginosa differentially upregulates immediate-early response genes and transcription factors that induce proinflammatory responses in type II pneumocytes. P. aeruginosa infection of type II pneumocytes was characterized by up-regulation of proinflammatory networks, including MAPK, TNF, and IL-17 signaling pathways. We also identified early response genes and proinflammatory signaling pathways whose expression change in response to infection with P. aeruginosa T3SS and T6SS mutants in type II pneumocytes. We determined that T3SS and T6SS modulate the expression of EGR1, FOS, and numerous genes that are involved in proinflammatory responses in epithelial cells during infection. T3SS and T6SS were associated with two distinct transcriptomic signatures related to the activation of transcription factors such as AP1, STAT1, and SP1, and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, transcriptomic analysis of epithelial cells indicates that the expression of immediate-early response genes quickly changes upon infection with P. aeruginosa and this response varies depending on bacterial viability and injectosomes. These data shed light on how P. aeruginosa modulates host epithelial transcriptome response during infection using T3SS and T6SS.

However, it is unclear whether gist-like representations reflect a loss of detail through degradation or the blending of experiences into statistical averages, and whether the strength of these representations increases, decreases, or remains stable over time. We report three behavioral experiments that address these questions by examining distributional learning during spatial navigation. In Experiment 1, human subjects navigated a virtual maze to find hidden objects with locations varying according to spatial distributions. After 15 minutes, 1 day, 7 days, or 28 days, we tested their navigation performance and explicit memory. In Experiment 2, we created spatial distributions with no object at their mean locations, thereby disentangling learned object exemplars from statistical averages. In Experiment 3, we created only a single, bimodal distribution to avoid possible confusion between distributions and administered tests after 15 minutes or 28 days. Across all experiments, and for both navigation and explicit tests, representations of the spatial distributions were present soon after exposure, but then receded over time.

Of the disaster-specific triage methods developed to guide health care providers, the Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment (START) algorithm has become the most popular system world-wide. Despite its appeal and global application, the accuracy and effectiveness of the START protocol is not well-known. OBJECTIVES The purpose of this meta-analysis was two-fold: (1) to estimate overall accuracy, under-triage, and over-triage of the START method when used by providers across a variety of backgrounds; and (2) to obtain specific accuracy for each of the four START categories: red, yellow, green, and black. METHODS A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted that searched Medline (OVID), Embase (OVID), Global Health (OVID), CINAHL (EBSCO), Compendex (Engineering Village), SCOPUS, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global, Cochrane Library, and PROSPERO. The results were expanded by hand searching of journals, reference lists, and the grey literature. The search was executed in March 2020. The review considered the participants, interventions, context, and outcome (PICO) framework and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Accuracy outcomes are presented as means with 95% confidence intervals (CI) as calculated using the binomial method. Pooled meta-analyses of accuracy outcomes using fixed and random effects models were calculated and the heterogeneity was assessed using the Q statistic. RESULTS Thirty-two studies were included in the review, most of which utilized a non-randomized study design (84%). Proportion of victims correctly triaged using START ranged from 0.27 to 0.99 with an overall triage accuracy of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.67 to 0.78). Proportion of over-triage was 0.14 (95% CI, 0.11 to 0.17) while the proportion of under-triage was 0.10 (95% CI, 0.072 to 0.14). There was significant heterogeneity of the studies for all outcomes (P < .0001). CONCLUSION This meta-analysis suggests that START is not accurate enough to serve as a reliable disaster triage tool. Although the accuracy of START may be similar to other models of disaster triage, development of a more accurate triage method should be urgently pursued.","output":"METASTART: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Diagnostic Accuracy of the Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment (START) Algorithm for Disaster Triage."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: To compare the temporal changes of IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein, S1 subunit, and receptor binding domain and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with COVID-19.

Serum samples were acquired multiple times from 0 to 76 days after symptom onset. Using a fully automated CLIA analyzer, we measured the levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM against the SARS-CoV-2 N, S1, and RBD and NAbs against SARS-CoV-2. Results: The levels of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins increased over time in all cases but IgM and IgA levels against SARS-CoV-2 showed different increasing trends among individuals in the early stage. In particular, we observed IgA antibodies increasing before IgG and IgM in 3/5 cases.

Conclusions: During the COVID-19 (2020) pandemic, the incidence of DKA increased in Polish children with newly diagnosed T1D. The conclusions from the analysis of the functioning of health systems during the pandemic should be used in the future to prevent, in similar periods, an increase in severe complications of delayed diagnosis of T1D.","output":"Has the COVID-19 Pandemic Affected the Prevalence of Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Polish Children with Newly Diagnosed Type 1 Diabetes?

Methods From the database of the diabetes units of Piedmont-Italy we extracted records of T2DM patients, which were linked with the swab-testing-database, and the database of hospital discharges. Five outcomes (PCR testing, PCR testing positivity, hospitalization, Intensive Care Unit (ICU), death) were evaluated using robust Poisson models. Results Among 125,021 T2DM patients, 1,882 had a positive PCR test. Of these patients, 49.4% were hospitalized within 30 days, 11.8% were admitted to an ICU, and 27.1% died. Greater probability of death was associated with age, male sex, liver and renal impairment, Hba1c above 8%, and former smoking. Hospitalization and ICU admission were mainly affected by age, male sex, hypertension, and metabolic control. Notably, ICU admissions were reduced in very elderly people. No outcomes were associated with educational level. Conclusions Hospitalization and ICU admission are heavily affected by age and local triage policy. A key finding was that men who were >75 years old and poorly compensated were highly vulnerable patients. Renal and/or hepatic impairment are additional factors.

Eight patients were excluded and 38 were randomized to EA and 41 to IA. Pain was assessed with the Visual Analogue Scale and quality of life with the Overall Benefit of Analgesia Score daily until discharge. RESULTS Mean age was 57  14 years, 43% of patients were female, and mean BMI was 28.6  6 kg/m2. The 2 groups were similar in demographic characteristics and distribution of diagnoses and procedures.

We explored whether an embedded pediatric palliative oncology (PPO) clinic is associated with receipt and timing of PPC and hospital days in the last 90 days of life. METHODS: Oncology patients (ages 0C25) with a high-risk event (death, relapse/progression, and/or phase I/II clinical trial enrollment) between 07/01/2015 and 06/30/2018 were included. PPO clinic started July 2017. Two cohorts were defined: pre-PPO (high-risk event(s) occurring 07/01/2015C06/30/2017) and post-PPO (high-risk event(s) occurring 07/01/2017C06/30/2018). Descriptive statistics were performed; demographic, disease course, and outcomes variables across cohorts were compared. RESULTS: A total of 426 patients were included (pre-PPO n = 235; post-PPO n = 191). Forty-seven patients with events in both pre- and post-PPO cohorts were included in the post-PPO cohort. Mean age at diagnosis was 8 years. Diagnoses were evenly distributed among solid tumors, brain tumors, and leukemia/lymphoma. Post-PPO cohort patients received PPC more often (45.6% vs. 21.3%, p < 0.0001), for a longer time before death than the pre-PPO cohort (median 88 vs. 32 days, p = 0.027), and spent fewer days hospitalized in the last 90 days of life (median 3 vs. 8 days, p = 0.0084).

Unexpectedly, we have uncovered a previously undescribed pathway promoting mucous metaplasia that involves VEGFa and its receptor KDR. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis coupled with genetic mouse modeling demonstrates that loss of epithelial VEGFa, KDR, or MEK/ERK kinase promotes excessive club-to-goblet transdifferentiation during development and regeneration. Sox9 is required for goblet cell differentiation following Kdr inhibition in both mouse and human club cells. Significantly, airway mucous metaplasia in asthmatic and CF patients is also associated with reduced KDR signaling and increased SOX9 expression.

METHODS: The study included 133 patients with COVID-19 admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) at an urban academic quaternary-care center between March 10 and April 8, 2020. Patients were categorized based on the presence or absence of DM and early-onset hyperglycemia (EHG), defined as a blood glucose >180 mg/dL during the first 2 days after ICU admission. The primary outcome was 14-day all-cause in-hospital mortality; also examined were 60-day all-cause in-hospital mortality and the levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, procalcitonin, and lactate. RESULTS: Compared to non-DM patients without EHG, non-DM patients with EHG exhibited higher adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality at 14 days (HR 7.51, CI 1.70-33.24) and 60 days (HR 6.97, CI 1.86-26.13). Non-DM patients with EHG also featured higher levels of median C-reactive protein (306.3 mg/L, P = .036), procalcitonin (1.26 ng/mL, P = .028), and lactate (2.2 mmol/L, P = .023). CONCLUSION: Among critically ill COVID-19 patients, those without DM with EHG were at greatest risk of 14-day and 60-day in-hospital mortality. Our study was limited by its retrospective design and relatively small cohort.

We imputed BovineHD genotypes to whole genome sequence for 2703 Holsteins that were cases or controls for Bovine Respiratory Disease and sampled from either California or New Mexico to construct and compare genomic prediction models. The sequence variation reference dataset comprised variants called for 1578 animals from Run 5 of the 1000 Bull Genomes Project, including 450 Holsteins and 29 animals sequenced from this study population. Genotypes for 9,282,726 variants with minor allele frequencies 5% were imputed and used to obtain genomic predictions in GEMMA using a Bayesian Sparse Linear Mixed Model. RESULTS: Variation explained by markers increased from 13.6% using BovineHD data to 14.4% using imputed whole genome sequence data and the resolution of genomic regions detected as harbouring QTL substantially increased. Explained variation in the analysis of the combined California and New Mexico data was less than when data for each state were separately analysed and the estimated genetic correlation between risk of Bovine Respiratory Disease in California and New Mexico Holsteins was ? 0.36. Consequently, genomic predictions trained using the data from one state did not accurately predict disease risk in the other state. To determine if a prediction model could be developed with utility in both states, we selected variants within genomic regions harbouring: 1) genes involved in the normal immune response to infection by pathogens responsible for Bovine Respiratory Disease detected by RNA-Seq analysis, and/or 2) QTL identified in the association analysis of the imputed sequence variants. The model based on QTL selected variants is biased but when trained in one state generated BRD risk predictions with positive accuracies in the other state. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the utility of sequence-based and biology-driven model development for genomic selection. Disease phenotypes cannot be routinely recorded in most livestock species and the observed phenotypes may vary in their genomic architecture due to variation in the pathogen composition across environments.

There is a clear need to develop novel computer-assisted diagnosis tools to provide rapid and cost-effective screening in places where massive traditional testing is not feasible. Lung ultrasound is a portable, easy to disinfect, low cost and non-invasive tool that can be used to identify lung diseases. Computer-assisted analysis of lung ultrasound imagery is a relatively recent approach that has shown great potential for diagnosing pulmonary conditions, being a viable alternative for screening and diagnosing COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and compare the performance of deep-learning techniques for detecting COVID-19 infections from lung ultrasound imagery. METHODS: We adapted different pre-trained deep learning architectures, including VGG19, InceptionV3, Xception, and ResNet50. We used the publicly available POCUS dataset comprising 3326 lung ultrasound frames of healthy, COVID-19, and pneumonia patients for training and fine-tuning. We conducted two experiments considering three classes (COVID-19, pneumonia, and healthy) and two classes (COVID-19 versus pneumonia and COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19) of predictive models. The obtained results were also compared with the POCOVID-net model. For performance evaluation, we calculated per-class classification metrics (Precision, Recall, and F1-score) and overall metrics (Accuracy, Balanced Accuracy, and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve). Lastly, we performed a statistical analysis of performance results using ANOVA and Friedman tests followed by post-hoc analysis using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test with the Holms step-down correction. RESULTS: InceptionV3 network achieved the best average accuracy (89.1%), balanced accuracy (89.3%), and area under the receiver operating curve (97.1%) for COVID-19 detection from bacterial pneumonia and healthy lung ultrasound data. The ANOVA and Friedman tests found statistically significant performance differences between models for accuracy, balanced accuracy and area under the receiver operating curve. Post-hoc analysis showed statistically significant differences between the performance obtained with the InceptionV3-based model and POCOVID-net, VGG19-, and ResNet50-based models. No statistically significant differences were found in the performance obtained with InceptionV3- and Xception-based models. CONCLUSIONS: Deep learning techniques for computer-assisted analysis of lung ultrasound imagery provide a promising avenue for COVID-19 screening and diagnosis. Particularly, we found that the InceptionV3 network provides the most promising predictive results from all AI-based techniques evaluated in this work. InceptionV3- and Xception-based models can be used to further develop a viable computer-assisted screening tool for COVID-19 based on ultrasound imagery.","output":"Deep-learning based detection of COVID-19 using lung ultrasound imagery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is an analysis of clinical characteristics, images findings, laboratory variables and respiratory mechanics in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during the first month of the pandemic outbreak in Buenos Aires In this descriptive case study of a single-centre, we included all confirmed cases of COVID-19 hospitalized in intensive care unit (ICU) All cases were confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction A total of 7 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were referred to out ICU The median age was 71 years (interquartile range 52-75), including 4 men and 3 women Patients most common clinical manifestations were fever (7), cough (5), asthenia (4) and shortness of breath (3) Among the radiological findings, five of them showed interstitial opacities and one patient had bilateral pulmonary consolidation Five required invasive mechanical ventilation and multiple prone sessions None died during hospitalization, although three still remain in the ICU According to imaging examination, 71 4% showed interstitial opacities and one patient bilateral consolidation Five patients required invasive mechanical ventilation and multiple prone sessions None of them died during hospitalization, although three still remain in the ICU","output":"COVID-19 in the intensive care unit.

METHODS Between Apr. 9 and May 24, 2020, we screened for COVID-19 symptoms and tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection in all consecutive adult patients ( 18 yr) admitted via emergency department to 3 Alberta hospitals. We summarized the parameters of the epidemic curve and assessed the performance of symptom screening versus RT-PCR results on nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab samples. RESULTS The study period encompassed Alberta's initial epidemic curve, with peak active cases per 100 000 of 71.4 (0.07%) on Apr. 30, 2020, and 14.7 and 14.6 at the beginning (Apr. 9, 2020) and end (May 24, 2020), respectively. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection (64.9% throat and 35.1% nasopharyngeal swabs) was done on 3375 adults (mean age 51, standard deviation 21, yr; 51.5% men). None of the asymptomatic patients (n = 1814) tested positive, and 71 of those with symptoms tested positive (n = 1561; 4.5%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.6%-5.7%). Sensitivity of symptom screening (v. RT-PCR) was 100% (95% CI 95%-100%), and specificity was 55% (95% CI 53%-57%). Posttest probabilities for prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection ranging from 1.5 to 14 times the peak prevalence of active cases during the study did not change when we assumed lower sensitivity (92%). INTERPRETATION In a region with low disease prevalence where protocolized symptom assessment was in place during the admission process, we did not identify people admitted to hospital without COVID-19 symptoms who were RT-PCR positive.

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: All published articles of patients with CVT treated with DOAC were included. Studies without follow-up information were excluded. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two independent reviewers screened articles and extracted data. A risk of bias analysis was performed. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Safety data included mortality, intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) or other adverse events. Efficacy data included recurrent CVT, recanalisation rates and disability by modified Rankin Scales (mRS). RESULTS: 33 studies met inclusion criteria. One randomised controlled trial, 5 observational cohorts and 27 case series or studies reported 279 patients treated with DOAC for CVT: 41% dabigatran, 47% rivaroxaban, 10% apixaban and 2% edoxaban, in addition to 315 patients treated with standard therapy. The observational cohorts showed a similar risk of death in DOAC and standard therapy arms (RR 2.12, 95% CI 0.29 to 15.59). New ICH was reported in 2 (0.7%) DOAC-treated patients and recurrent CVT occurred in 4 (1.5%).

Other viruses in the same phylogenetic group have been responsible for previous regional outbreaks, including SARS and MERS. SARS-CoV-2 has a zoonotic origin, similar to the causative viruses of these previous outbreaks. The repetitive introduction of animal viruses into human populations resulting in disease outbreaks suggests that similar future epidemics are inevitable. Therefore, understanding the molecular origin and ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 will provide critical insights for preparing for and preventing future outbreaks. A key feature of SARS-CoV-2 is its propensity for genetic recombination across host species boundaries. Consequently, the genome of SARS-CoV-2 harbors signatures of multiple recombination events, likely encompassing multiple species and broad geographic regions. Other regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome show the impact of purifying selection. The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, which enables the virus to enter host cells, exhibits signatures of both purifying selection and ancestral recombination events, leading to an effective S protein capable of infecting human and many other mammalian cells. The global spread and explosive growth of the SARS-CoV-2 population (within human hosts) has contributed additional mutational variability into this genome, increasing opportunities for future recombination.","output":"On the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION First line pharmacological treatments for bipolar disorder (BD) can leave shortfalls in recovery leading to patients seeking alternative and adjunctive treatments such as nutraceuticals.

Methods: An interdisciplinary Task Force was constructed to develop innovative strategies for management of a novel disease. A single-institution prospective non-randomized cohort study was then conducted on patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure who underwent tracheostomy using an induced bedside apneic technique at a tertiary care academic institution between April 27th, 2020, and June 30th, 2020. Results: 28 patients underwent tracheostomy with induced apnea. The median lowest procedural oxygen saturation was 95%. The median number of ventilated days following tracheostomy was 11. There were 3 mortalities (11%) due to sepsis and multiorgan failure; of 25 surviving patients, 100% were successfully discharged from the hospital and 76% are decannulated, with a median time of 26 days from tracheostomy to decannulation (range 12 - 57). There was no symptomatic disease transmission to healthcare personnel on the COVID-19 Tracheostomy Team. Conclusions: Patients with respiratory failure from COVID-19 disease may benefit from tracheostomy. This can be completed effectively and safely, without viral transmission to healthcare personnel.

The pandemic that originated from Wuhan, China in late 2019 has affected all the nations of the world and triggered a global economic crisis whose impact will be felt for years to come. This necessitates the need to monitor and predict COVID-19 prevalence for adequate control. The linear regression models are prominent tools in predicting the impact of certain factors on COVID-19 outbreak and taking the necessary measures to respond to this crisis. The data was extracted from the NCDC website and spanned from March 31, 2020 to May 29, 2020. In this study, we adopted the ordinary least squares estimator to measure the impact of travelling history and contacts on the spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria and made a prediction. The model was conducted before and after travel restriction was enforced by the Federal government of Nigeria. The fitted model fitted well to the dataset and was free of any violation based on the diagnostic checks conducted. The results show that the government made a right decision in enforcing travelling restriction because we observed that travelling history and contacts made increases the chances of people being infected with COVID-19 by 85% and 88% respectively. This prediction of COVID-19 shows that the government should ensure that most travelling agency should have better precautions and preparations in place before re-opening.","output":"Predictive modelling of COVID-19 confirmed cases in Nigeria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following a number of epidemics in the 21st century, including Ebola and Middle East respiratory syndrome, the SARS-COV-2 virus, causing COVID-19 disease, was declared a pandemic health emergency of international concern in January 2020.","output":"Time for a culture change: understanding and reducing risk, morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 in those of black and minority ethnicity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Serology tests for viral antibodies provide an important tool to support nucleic acid testing for diagnosis of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and is useful for documenting previous exposures to SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19.

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. STUDY SETTING AND STUDY SAMPLE: The study sample included nine hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Ventilation characteristics and air samples were collected from 86 healthcare spaces during October 2020 to February 2021. PRIMARY OUTCOME: Risk of cumulative SARS-CoV-2 infection by type of healthcare area. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Ventilation rates by healthcare space; risk of airborne detection of SARS-CoV-2 across healthcare spaces; impact of room characteristics on absolute ventilation; SARS-CoV-2 detection by naturally ventilated versus mechanically ventilated spaces. RESULTS: The majority (78.7%) of naturally ventilated patient care rooms had ventilation rates that fell short of the recommended ventilation rate of 60 L/s/p. Using a modified Wells-Riley equation and local COVID-19 case numbers, we found that over a 40-hour exposure period, outpatient departments posed the highest median risk for infection (7.7%). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was most frequently detected in air samples from non-COVID wards (50.0%) followed by outpatient departments (42.9%). Naturally ventilated spaces (22.6%) had higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 detection compared with mechanically ventilated spaces (8.3%), though the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.128). In multivariable linear regression with calculated elasticity, open door area and cross-ventilation were found to have a significant impact on ventilation. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide evidence that naturally ventilated healthcare settings may pose a high risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2, particularly among non-COVID-designated spaces, but improving parameters of ventilation can mitigate this risk.","output":"Assessing impact of ventilation on airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2: a cross-sectional analysis of naturally ventilated healthcare settings in Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW The burden of severe and disabling neurologic injury on survivors, families, and society can be profound. Neurologic outcome prediction, or neuroprognostication, is a complex undertaking with many important ramifications. It allows patients with good prognoses to be supported aggressively, survive, and recover; conversely, it avoids inappropriate prolonged and costly care in those with devastating injuries. RECENT FINDINGS Striving to maintain a high prediction performance during prognostic assessments encompasses acknowledging the shortcomings of this task and the challenges created by advances in medicine, which constantly shift the natural history of neurologic conditions. Embracing the unknowns of outcome prediction and the boundaries of knowledge surrounding neurologic recovery and plasticity is a necessary step toward refining neuroprognostication practices and improving the accuracy of prognostic impressions. The pillars of modern neuroprognostication include comprehensive characterization of neurologic injury burden (primary and secondary injuries), gauging cerebral resilience and estimated neurologic reserve, and tying it all together with individual values surrounding the acceptable extent of disability and the difficulties of an arduous convalescence journey.

The first was disseminated by the Italian National Institute of Health (ISS) and the second, which is more usable due to the lower difficulty of calculation and the availability of data, was adopted by various regional and local institutions.The rationale for the Rt index refers to that for the R0 index, the basic reproduction number, which is used by infectivologists as a measure of contagiousness of a given infectious agent in a completely susceptible population. The RDt index, on the other hand, is borrowed from the techniques of time series analysis for the trend of an event measurement that develops as a function of time. The RDt index does not take into account the time of infection, but the date of the diagnosis of positivity and for this reason it is defined as diagnostic replication index, as it aims to describe the intensity of the development of frequency for cases recognized as positive in the population.The comparison between different possible applications of the methods and the use of different types of monitoring data was limited to four areas for which complete individual data were available in March and April 2020. The main problems in the use of Rt, which is based on the date of symptoms onset, arise from the lack of completeness of this information due both to the difficulty in the recording and to the absence in asymptomatic subjects.The general trend of RDt, at least at an intermediate lag of 6 or 7 days, is very similar to that of Rt, as confirmed by the very high value of the correlation index between the two indices. The maximum correlation between Rt and RDt is reached at lag 7 with a value of R exceeding 0.97 (R2=0.944).The two indices, albeit formally distinct, are both valid; they show specific aspects of the phenomenon, but provide basically similar information to the public health decision-maker. Their distinction lies not so much in the method of calculation, rather in the use of different information, i.e., the beginning of symptoms and the swabs outcome.Therefore, it is not appropriate to make a judgment of preference for one of the two indices, but only to invite people to understand their different potentials so that they can choose the one they consider the most appropriate for the purpose they want to use it for.","output":"[Rt or RDt, that is the question!]/ Rt or RDt, that is the question!"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic currently.

Variation information in 125,748 exomes were collected for racial differences analyses. The expression level of pharmaco-genes in single cell resolution was evaluated from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of 17 healthy adults. Results: Pharmacogenes, including CYP3A4, ABCB1, SLCO1B1, ALB, CYP3A5, were involved in the process of more than multi DCTs. 224 potential drug-drug interactions (DDI) of DCTs were predicted, while 112 of them have been reported.

METHODS We used 6 Ontario or Canadian population administrative sources to obtain data covering part or all of the period between Jan. 1, 2017, and June 13, 2020, on historical volumes and operating room throughput distributions by surgery type and region, and lengths of stay in ward and intensive care unit (ICU) beds. We used time series forecasting, queuing models and probabilistic sensitivity analysis to estimate the size of the backlog and clearance time for a +10% (+1 day per week at 50% capacity) surge scenario. RESULTS Between Mar. 15 and June 13, 2020, the estimated backlog in Ontario was 148 364 surgeries (95% prediction interval 124 508-174 589), an average weekly increase of 11 413 surgeries.

RESULTS: Twenty patients (18 women, 35.6  18.3 years) who met the HLH-2004 criteria also fulfilled the 2016 EULAR/ACR/PRINTO classification criteria for MAS, and HScore was higher than 169 (mean, 241.1). Fourteen patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and 6 patients with adult-onset Stills disease were included. All patients were treated initially with corticosteroids, and 16 patients required additional immunosuppressants. The overall survival at 3 and 6 months was 75.2% and 64.3%. In survivors, renal impairment was less common (7.7% versus 71.4%, p = 0.007), the levels of AST (364.0 versus 81.0 IU/L, p = 0.019) and LDH (1346.0 versus 343.0IU/L, p = 0.014), and platelet count (90.0 versus 43.0  10(9)/L, p = 0.02) were higher in compared to non-survivors. Nine patients had opportunistic infections, five of whom died during admission. CONCLUSION: The mortality of patients with MAS associated with rheumatic disease remains high. Renal impairment, levels of AST and LDH, and platelet count might be associated with prognosis.","output":"Macrophage activation syndrome in rheumatic disease: Clinical characteristics and prognosis of 20 adult patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Japan's population as of March 1, 2021was 125,480,00, according to an estimate by the Statistics Bureau, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications;a decrease of approximately 480,000 or minus 0.38%, compared to the previous year.

Large cohort study suggested a protective potential of lipid-lowering drugs in COVID-19 outcomes, but the nature of observational study precludes it to draw a causal inference. Objectives: To assess the causal effect of lipid-lowering drugs (HMGCR inhibitors, PCSK9 inhibitors and NPC1L1 inhibitors) on COVID-19 outcomes using 2-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) study. Methods: We used two kinds of genetic instruments to proxy the exposure of lipid-lowering drugs, including expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) of drugs target genes, and genetic variants within or nearby drugs target genes associated with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol from genome-wide association study (GWAS). GWASs of COVID-19 outcomes (susceptibility, hospitalization and very severe disease) were obtained from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. Summary-data-based MR (SMR) and inverse-variance weighted MR (IVW-MR) were used to calculate the effect estimates. Results: SMR analysis found that a higher expression of HMGCR was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 hospitalization (OR=1.38, 95%CI=1.06-1.81; P=0.019). Similarly, IVW-MR analysis observed a positive association between HMGCR-mediated LDL cholesterol and COVID-19 hospitalization (OR=1.32, 95%CI=1.00-1.74; P=0.049). No consistent evidence from both SMR and IVW-MR analyses was found for the association of HMGCR inhibitors with COVID-19 susceptibility or very severe disease, or for the association of PCSK9 inhibitors and NPC1L1 inhibitor with COVID-19 outcomes. Conclusions: In this 2-sample MR study, we found potential causal evidence that HMGCR inhibitors could reduce the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization.

As outcome variables, we used expectations (e.g., economic outlook, labour market situation, recovery), fear (e.g., scenario of new outburst, economic depression, restriction to individual rights and freedom), and behavioural change across the following dimensions: savings, cultural consumption, social capital, and risky behaviour. We provide descriptive evidence that is representative of the population of interest, and we estimate the impact of exposure to shock occurred during the crisis on the same outcome variables, using matching techniques. Our main findings are the following: we detected systematically negative expectations regarding the future and the recovery, majoritarian fears of an economic depression, a new outbreak, and a permanent restriction on freedom, a reduction in saving and in social capital. Exposure to shocks decreased expected job prospects, increased withdrawal from accumulated savings, and reduced contacts with the network relevant to job advancement, whereas it had inconclusive effects over fears.

To expedite drug discovery, a computational approach is widely employed for the initial screening of anti-SARS-CoV-2 candidates. This study aimed to investigate the potential of peptides from quinoa seed proteins as multi-target antagonists against SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain, main protease, and papain-like protease. Five quinoa proteins were hydrolyzed in silico by papain and subtilisin. Among the 1465 peptides generated, seven could interact stably with the key binding residues and catalytic residues of the viral targets, mainly via hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. The seven peptides were comparable or superior to previously reported anti-SARS-CoV-2 peptides based on docking scores. Key residues in the seven peptides contributing to binding to viral targets were determined by computational alanine scanning. The seven peptides were predicted in silico to be non-toxic and non-allergenic. The peptides ranged between 546.66 and 3974.87 g/mol in molecular mass, besides exhibiting basic and cationic properties (isoelectric points: 8.26-12.10; net charges: 0.1-4.0). Among the seven peptides, VEDKGMMHQQRMMEKAMNIPRMCGTMQRKCRMS was found to bind the largest number of key residues on the targets. In conclusion, seven putative non-toxic, non-allergenic, multi-target anti-SARS-CoV-2 peptides were identified from quinoa seed proteins.

The Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic and the COVID-19 pandemic were chosen as observational periods to investigate the effect of respiratory virus diseases on these outcomes in a metropolitan area with an established STEMI network. We analyzed data on incidence and care during the COVID-19 pandemic, Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic and corresponding seasonal control periods. Three comparisons were performed: (1) COVID-19 pandemic group versus pandemic control group, (2) COVID-19 pandemic group versus Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic group and (3) Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic group versus epidemic control group. We used Students t-test, Fishers exact test and Chi square test for statistical analysis. 1455 patients were eligible. The daily STEMI incidence was 1.49 during the COVID-19 pandemic, 1.40 for the pandemic season control period, 1.22 during the Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic and 1.28 during the epidemic season control group. Median symptom-to-contact time was 180 min during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the pandemic season control group it was 90 min (p = 0.183), and in the Influenza 2017/2018 cohort it was 90 min, too (p = 0.216). Interval in the epidemic control group was 79 min (p = 0.733).

However, the cardiorespiratory physiology of these infants on each mode is unknown. METHODS: Prospective, randomized crossover study in infants with birth weight 1250 g undergoing their first extubation attempt. NCPAP and HFNC were applied randomly for 45 min each, while ribcage and abdominal movements, electrocardiogram, oxygen saturation, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) were recorded. Respiratory signals were analyzed using an automated method, and differences between NCPAP and HFNC features and changes in FiO(2) were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 30 infants with median [interquartile range] gestational age of 27 weeks [25.7, 27.9] and birth weight of 930 g [780, 1090] were studied. Infants were extubated at 5 days [2, 13] of life with 973 g [880, 1170] and three failed (10%). No differences in cardiorespiratory behavior were noted, except for longer respiratory pauses (9.2 s [5.0, 11.5] vs. 7.3 s [4.6, 9.3]; p = 0.04) and higher FiO(2) levels (p = 0.02) during HFNC compared to NCPAP.

Typically, such responses have been reported as means and standard deviations, however, investigation into the responses of individuals is insufficient. Therefore, the present study retrospectively assessed individual variation in the hematological responses to severe inactivity (bed rest) and hypoxia. The data were derived from three-bed rest projects: two 10-d (LunHab project: 8 males; FemHab project: 12 females), and one 21-d (PlanHab project: 11 males). Each project comprised a normoxic bed rest (NBR; P(I)O(2)=133mmHg) and hypoxic bed rest (HBR; P(I)O(2)=91mmHg) intervention, where the subjects were confined in the Planica facility (Rate?e, Slovenia). During the HBR intervention, subjects were exposed to normobaric hypoxia equivalent to an altitude of 4,000m. NBR and HBR interventions were conducted in a random order and separated by a washout period. Blood was drawn prior to (Pre), during, and post bed rest (R1, R2, R4) to analyze the individual variation in the responses of red blood cells (RBC), erythropoietin (EPO), and reticulocytes (Rct) to bed rest and hypoxia. No significant differences were found in the mean ?(Pre-Post) values of EPO across projects (LunHab, FemHab, and PlanHab; p>0.05), however, female EPO responses to NBR (Range - 17.39, IQR C 12.97 mIU(.)ml(?1)) and HBR (Range C 49.00, IQR C 10.91 mIU(.)ml(?1)) were larger than males (LunHab NBR Range C 4.60, IQR C 2.03; HBR Range C 7.10, IQR C 2.78; PlanHab NBR Range C 7.23, IQR C 1.37; HBR Range C 9.72, IQR C 4.91 mIU(.)ml(?1)). Bed rest duration had no impact on the heterogeneity of EPO, Rct, and RBC responses (10-d v 21-d). The resultant hematological changes that occur during NBR and HBR are not proportional to the acute EPO response. The following cascade of hematological responses to NBR and HBR suggests that the source of variability in the present data is due to mechanisms related to hypoxia as opposed to inactivity alone. Studies investigating hematological changes should structure their study design to explore these mechanistic responses and elucidate the discord between the EPO response and hematological cascade to fully assess heterogeneity.","output":"Heterogeneity of Hematological Response to Hypoxia and Short-Term or Medium-Term Bed Rest"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Multiple studies have shown that antibiotic utilization increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the impact of this increased utilization has not been well established. The aim of this study is to describe the trends in minimum inhibitory concentrations for various antibiotics against common gram-negative pathogens observed since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to previous years. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at the Memphis VA. All respiratory, urine, and blood culture MicroScan results run from October 2017-March 2021 were analyzed. Only inpatient and emergency department data was included. The MIC50 and MIC90 of seven antibiotics for four of the most common pathogens were trended by quarterly intervals. RESULTS: MIC50 and MIC90 were compared using standardized breakpoints. As compared to previous years, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was noted to have the most sustained increase in MIC90 across various antibiotics. In the last 3 quarters of the study time frame, piperacillin-tazobactam mean MIC90 increased from 32 to 64, cefepime from 8 to > 16, and meropenem from 4 to > 8. Escherichia coli had a sustained increase in ceftriaxone MIC90 from < 1 to > 8 in the final quarter of 2020 and beginning of 2021. Klebsiella pneumonia was also found to have a sustained increase in cefepime mean MIC90 from < 1 to > 16 during the year of 2020, with return to previous MIC90 the following quarters. CONCLUSION: Previous studies have clearly demonstrated a widespread increase in antibiotic utilization during the COVID era. Our study demonstrates how even short-term increases in antibiotic use can lead to shifts in MIC, if not outright resistance. This was demonstrated across multiple common gram-negative pathogens and to various broad-spectrum antibiotics which were commonly used more frequently during COVID-19. Further analysis will be needed to determine whether these trends continue or whether the decrease in antibiotic utilization in the recent months will lead to similar decrease in MIC.

In order to address this, we interrogate the evolutionary history of the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome to identify evolutionarily conserved functional sites that can inform the search for treatments with broader coverage across the coronavirus family. Combining this information with the mutations observed in the current COVID-19 outbreak, we systematically and comprehensively define evolutionarily stable sites that may provide useful drug and vaccine targets and which are less likely to be compromised by the emergence of new virus strains. Several experimentally-validated effective drugs interact with these proposed target sites. In addition, the same evolutionary information can prioritize cross reactive antigens that are useful in directing multi-epitope vaccine strategies to illicit broadly neutralizing immune responses to the betacoronavirus family.

Moreover, we tested if leisure crafting (i.e., the proactive pursuit and enactment of leisure activities targeted at goal setting, socializing, growth and development) is negatively related to emotional exhaustion. We expected that proactive personality would be positively related to leisure crafting. Finally, emotional exhaustion was predicted to relate negatively to job performance. METHODS: We tested our assumptions using a daily diary study on seven consecutive days with 178 employees (964 observations in total). RESULTS: Multilevel path analysis supports the assumptions that daily job demands as well as daily home demands during telework are positively related to emotional exhaustion. As predicted, we found leisure crafting to be negatively related to emotional exhaustion, and proactive personality to be positively related to leisure crafting.

Here, we report the results of a natural experiment where 29 ferrets in one home had prolonged, direct contact and constant environmental exposure to two humans with symptomatic disease, one of whom was confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2. We observed no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from humans to ferrets based on viral and antibody assays. To better understand this discrepancy in experimental and natural infection in ferrets, we compared SARS-CoV-2 sequences from natural and experimental mustelid infections and identified two surface glycoprotein Spike (S) mutations associated with mustelids. While we found evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme II provides a weak host barrier, one mutation only seen in ferrets is located in the novel S1/S2 cleavage site and is computationally predicted to decrease furin cleavage efficiency. These data support the idea that host factors interacting with the novel S1/S2 cleavage site may be a barrier in ferret SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and that domestic ferrets are at low risk of natural infection from currently circulating SARS-CoV-2. We propose two mechanistically grounded hypotheses for mustelid host adaptation of SARS-CoV-2, with possible effects that require additional investigation.","output":"Host barriers to SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated by ferrets in a high-exposure domestic setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and SARS-COV2 are among the most dangerous respiratory viruses. Zinc is one of the essential micronutrients and is very important in the immune system. The aim of this narrative review is to review the most interesting findings about the importance of zinc in the anti-viral immune response in the respiratory tract and defense against influenza, RSV, and SARS-COV2 infections. The most interesting findings on the role of zinc in regulating immunity in the respiratory tract and the relationship between zinc and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are reviewed, as well. Besides, current findings regarding the relationship between zinc and the effectiveness of respiratory viruses vaccines are reviewed. The results of reviewed studies have shown that zinc and some zinc-dependent proteins are involved in anti-viral defense and immune regulation in the respiratory tract. It seems that zinc can reduce the viral titer following influenza infection. Zinc may reduce RSV burden in the lungs. Zinc can be effective in reducing the duration of viral pneumonia symptoms. Zinc may enhance the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine in reducing mortality rate in COVID-19 patients. Besides, zinc has a positive effect in preventing ARDS and ventilator-induced lung damage. The relationship between zinc levels and the effectiveness of respiratory viruses vaccines, especially influenza vaccines, is still unclear, and the findings are somewhat contradictory.

Hence, we evaluated the latter associations of chemosensory dysfunction, in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Information on chemosensory dysfunction and history of chronic systemic comorbidities, if any, was obtained from 149 COVID-19 patients in an infectious disease hospital in UAE, using their medical records, as well as from a face-to-face questionnaire survey. Additionally, a modified SNOT-22 questionnaire that measures disease-specific quality of life in patients with upper respiratory tract affections was also administered. RESULTS: Chemosensory dysfunction was reported by 94.6% of the cohort, and anosmia with dysgeusia was significantly more in males than females with severe COVID-19. Males with moderate COVID-19 and systemic comorbidities were more likely to present with chemosensory dysfunction in comparison with females. SNOT-22 questionnaire revealed that nasal blockage and runny nose were more prevalent in mild/moderate, than in the severe, state of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Our data confirm the commonality of chemosensory dysfunction during COVID-19 progression, and the significantly more pronounced combined dysfunction in males with severe COVID-19, and comorbidities.","output":"Attributes of dysgeusia and anosmia of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in hospitalized patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article, we analyze images from the book Our Friend the Atom, written by the astrophysicist Heinz Haber in 1957 and developed in the Disney Science Department.

A priori inclusion and exclusion criteria were instituted. Quality was evaluated with the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. A priori criteria were instituted to select studies suitable for comparison. Results A total of 254 identified studies led to 16 for full-text review, including 14 for cidofovir and 2 for bevacizumab. Disease severity outcomes were reported in all studies, including remission rate, Derkay scores, time interval between operations, and/or lesion volume reduction. Remission rate was the most commonly reported (14 studies). Functional outcomes were reported in 5 studies (36%), including quality-of-life questionnaires, acoustic/aerodynamic analysis, and perceptual voice analysis. Voice-related quality of life was the most commonly reported (2 studies). Of 16 studies, 12 (75%) were rated poor quality. Reports almost invariably showed improved disease severity and functional outcomes following treatment; however, variable outcome measures and inadequate follow-up disallowed direct comparison of adjuncts. Conclusion Remission rate was the most commonly reported disease severity outcome, and voice-related quality of life was the most commonly reported functional outcome.

MATERIALS AND METHODS From January 2012 to July 2014, local excision was performed using a TEO system in 46 consecutive patients with rectal tumors. Patient and tumor characteristics and perioperative outcomes were prospectively assessed. RESULTS The median patient age was 56 years for 15 women and 31 men. The mean tumor size was 1.8 cm, and the mean distance from the anal verge was 7.8 cm. The mean operative time was 85 minutes, and the mean postoperative hospital stay was 4.5 days. The postoperative pathologic diagnosis was adenocarcinoma for 17 patients (37%), adenoma for 4 patients (9%), carcinoid tumor for 23 patients (50%), and leiomyoma and lipoma for the 2 remaining patients (2%). A positive resection margin was documented for 4 patients (9%). No mortality was associated with the procedure although postoperative bleeding, leakage, perianal fistula, fecal incontinence, and voiding difficulty developed in 8 patients. According to the cumulative sum (CUSUM) analysis, the operation time and hospital stay significantly decreased after 17 case experiences. CONCLUSIONS TEO is a feasible and safe treatment option for local excision of rectal tumors. TEO has the advantage of being a precise surgical procedure with a stable and magnifying endoscopic view.

However, besides claims of broad immune activation, the mode of action is still a matter of debate. The lysates, formulated with the main bacterial species involved in respiratory infections, are commonly prepared by chemical or mechanical disruption of bacterial cells, what is believed influences the biological activity of the product. Here, we prepared two polyvalent lysates with the same composition but different method of bacterial cell disruption and evaluated their biological activity in a comparative fashion. We found that both bacterial lysates induce NF-kB activation in a MyD88 dependent manner, suggesting they work as TLR agonists. Further, we found that a single intranasal dose of any of the two lysates, is sufficient to protect against pneumococcal pneumonia, suggesting that they exert similar biological activity. We have previously shown that protection against pneumococcal pneumonia can also be induced by prior S. pneumoniae sub lethal infection or therapeutic treatment with a TLR5 agonist. Protection in those cases depends on neutrophil recruitment to the lungs, and can be associated with increased local expression of IL-17A. Here, we show that bacterial lysates exert protection against pneumococcal pneumonia independently of neutrophils, IL-17A or Caspase-1/11 activation, suggesting the existence of redundant mechanisms of protection. Trypsin-treated lysates afford protection to the same extent, suggesting that just small peptides suffice to exert the protective effect or that the molecules responsible for the protective effect are not proteins.

STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional study. SETTING Tertiary medical center. SUBJECTS AND METHODS During total tonsillectomy exclusively performed with EC, air was sampled with a surgeon-worn portable particle counter. The airborne mean and maximum particle concentrations were compared for tonsillectomy performed with EC at 12 W vs 20 W, with smoke evacuation system (SES) and no smoke evacuation (NS). RESULTS A total of 36 children were included in this analysis: 9 cases with EC at 12 W and SES (12SES), 9 cases with EC at 20 W and SES (20SES), 9 cases with EC at 12 W without SES (12NS), and 9 cases with EC at 20 W without SES (20NS). Mean particle number concentration in the breathing zone during tonsillectomy was 1661 particles/cm3 for 12SES, 5515 particles/cm3 for 20SES, 8208 particles/cm3 for 12NS, and 78,506 particles/cm3 for 20NS. There was a statistically significant difference in the particle number concentrations among the 4 groups. The correlation between the particle number concentration and EC time was either moderate (for 12SES) or negative (for remaining groups). CONCLUSION Airborne particle concentrations during tonsillectomy are over 9.5 times higher when EC is set at 20 W vs 12 W with NS, which is mitigated to 3.3 times with SES.

Nevertheless, data on this novel infection in patients with a diagnosis of cancer receiving active treatment are scarce and it is unknown if these recommendations could have repercussions on future progress of the disease. The main objective of this study is to learn the COVID-19 incidence rate in outpatients with cancer receiving active treatment. Methods: This work is a retrospective cohort study that included all patients with a diagnosis of cancer who received active cancer treatment in two Andalusian hospitals between February 26 and May 13, 2020. Variables regarding the patient, tumor, and development of COVID-19 were collected. A descriptive analysis was performed and the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in these patients was evaluated. Results: A total of 673 patients were included. The median age was 62 years. There was a low rate of comorbidity and 12.1% had an ECOG >2. Breast cancer was the most common cancer (41%), followed by colorectal and lung cancer. Stage IV cancer was reported in 52.7% of patients. The most common treatment was chemotherapy (53.9%).

METHODS: COVID-19 related mortality and population statistics from seven European countries were extracted: England and Wales, Italy, Germany, Spain, France, Portugal and Netherlands. Available data spanned 14C16 weeks since the first recorded deaths in each country, except Spain, where only comparable stratified data over an 8-week time period was available. The Global Burden of Disease database provided data on all deaths and those from pneumonia, cardiovascular disease combining ischaemic heart disease and stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, road traffic accidents and dementia in 2017. RESULTS: Deaths related to COVID-19, while modest overall, varied considerably by age. Deaths as a percentage of all cause deaths during the time period under study ranged from <0.01% in children in Germany, Portugal and Netherlands, to as high as 41.65% for men aged over 80 years in England and Wales. The percentage of the population who died from COVID-19 was less than 0.2% in every age group under the age of 80. In each country, over the age of 80, these proportions were: England and Wales 1.27% males, 0.87% females; Italy 0.6% males, 0.38% females; Germany 0.13% males, 0.09% females; France 0.39% males, 0.2% females; Portugal 0.2% males, 0.15% females; and Netherlands 0.6% males, 0.4% females. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality rates from COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic were low including when compared to other common causes of death and are likely to decline further while control measures are maintained, treatments improve and vaccination is instituted. These data may help people to contextualise their risk and for decision-making by policymakers.","output":"Population perspective comparing COVID-19 to all and common causes of death during the first wave of the pandemic in seven European countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has created an unprecedented global crisis for the infrastructure sectors, including economic, political, healthcare, education, and research systems. Although over 90% of infected individuals are asymptomatic or manifest noncritical symptoms and will recover from the infection, those individuals presenting with critical symptoms are in urgent need of effective treatment options. Emerging data related to mechanism of severity and potential therapies for patients presenting with severe symptoms are scattered and therefore require a comprehensive analysis to focus research on developing effective therapeutics. A critical literature review suggests that the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with dysregulation of inflammatory immune responses, which in turn inhibits the development of protective immunity to the infection. Therefore, the use of therapeutics that modulate inflammation without compromising the adaptive immune response could be the most effective therapeutic strategy.","output":"COVID-19 as an Acute Inflammatory Disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes a disease called COVID-19.

We developed recommendations for monitoring outside the ICU on the basis of available evidence and expert opinion. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature search for studies addressing the utility of cardiorespiratory and pulse oximetry monitoring in common pediatric conditions and drafted candidate monitoring recommendations based on our findings. We convened a panel of nominees from national professional organizations with diverse expertise: nursing, medicine, respiratory therapy, biomedical engineering, and family advocacy. Using the RAND/University of California, Los Angeles Appropriateness Method, panelists rated recommendations for appropriateness and necessity in 3 sequential rating sessions and a moderated meeting. RESULTS: The panel evaluated 56 recommendations for intermittent and continuous monitoring for children hospitalized outside the ICU with 7 common conditions (eg, asthma, croup) and/or receiving common therapies (eg, supplemental oxygen, intravenous opioids). The panel reached agreement on the appropriateness of monitoring recommendations for 55 of 56 indications and on necessity of monitoring for 52. For mild or moderate asthma, croup, pneumonia, and bronchiolitis, the panel recommended intermittent vital sign or oximetry measurement only. The panel recommended continuous monitoring for severe disease in each respiratory condition as well as for a new or increased dose of intravenous opiate or benzodiazepine.

We describe characteristics and outcome of encephalitis in COVID-19 (COV-ENC) patients in one of the most affected regions by COVID-19 of the world, Lombardia, during the first pandemic wave. Methods: A multi-center observational study on neurological complications in COVID-19 patients was conducted by the Italian society of Hospital Neuroscience (SNO). Adult patients admitted to 20 Neurological Departments in Lombardia between February-April 2020 with COV-ENC have been included. Results: 30 COV-ENC patients had a mean age of 66.5 years and male frequency of 56.6%. Altered consciousness was characterized by confusion in 86%, coma in 30%, delirium in 37.9% and alteration of personality traits in 27.6%. Epileptic seizures occurred in 74% of cases. One third of cases had hyperproteinorrachia, one third pleocytosis/hyperproteinorrachia, and remaining third had a normal CSF. PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was negative in all tested patients.

Here, we add to existing evidence by estimating inequalities for 16 minority ethnic groups, examining ethnic inequalities within population subgroups, and comparing the magnitudes of ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 vaccine uptake to those for routine seasonal influenza vaccine uptake. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Greater Manchester Care Record, which contains de-identified electronic health record data for the population of Greater Manchester, England. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate ethnic inequalities in time to COVID-19 vaccination amongst people eligible for vaccination on health or age (50+ years) criteria between 1 December 2020 and 18 April 2021 (138 days of follow-up). We included vaccination with any approved COVID-19 vaccine, and analysed first-dose vaccination only. We compared inequalities between COVID-19 and influenza vaccine uptake adjusting by age group and clinical risk, and used subgroup analysis to identify populations where inequalities were widest. The majority of individuals (871,231; 79.24%) were White British. The largest minority ethnic groups were Pakistani (50,268; 4.75%), other White background (43,195; 3.93%), other ethnic group (34,568; 3.14%), and Black African (18,802; 1.71%). In total, 83.64% (919,636/1,099,503) of eligible individuals received a COVID-19 vaccine. Uptake was lower compared to the White British group for 15 of 16 minority ethnic groups, with particularly wide inequalities amongst the groups other Black background (hazard ratio [HR] 0.42, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.44), Black African (HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.44), Arab (HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.48), and Black Caribbean (HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.45). In total, 55.71% (419,314/752,715) of eligible individuals took up influenza vaccination. Compared to the White British group, inequalities in influenza vaccine uptake were widest amongst the groups White and Black Caribbean (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.68) and White and Black African (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.72). In contrast, uptake was slightly higher than the White British group amongst the groups other ethnic group (HR 1.11, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.12) and Bangladeshi (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.11). Overall, ethnic inequalities in vaccine uptake were wider for COVID-19 than influenza vaccination for 15 of 16 minority ethnic groups. COVID-19 vaccine uptake inequalities also existed amongst individuals who previously took up influenza vaccination. Ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 vaccine uptake were concentrated amongst older and extremely clinically vulnerable adults, and the most income-deprived. A limitation of this study is the focus on uptake of the first dose of COVID-19 vaccination, rather than full COVID-19 vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 vaccine uptake exceeded those for influenza vaccine uptake, existed amongst those recently vaccinated against influenza, and were widest amongst those with greatest COVID-19 risk. This suggests the COVID-19 vaccination programme has created additional and different inequalities beyond pre-existing health inequalities. We suggest that further research and policy action is needed to understand and remove barriers to vaccine uptake, and to build trust and confidence amongst minority ethnic communities.","output":"Ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 vaccine uptake and comparison to seasonal influenza vaccine uptake in Greater Manchester, UK: A cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Heart failure symptoms, in particular dyspnea, may be difficult to frame in a patient with cancer.

However, these places had reported new cases and experienced a second wave since June 11, 2020. Here we develop a stochastic discrete-Time epidemic model to evaluate the risk of COVID-19 resurgence by analyzing the data from the beginning of the outbreak to the second wave in these three places. In the model, we use an input parameter to represent a few potential risks that may cause a second wave, including asymptomatic infection, imported cases from other places, and virus from the environment such as frozen food packages. The e_ect of physical distancing restrictions imposed at di_erent stages of the outbreak is also included in the model. Model simulations show that the magnitude of the input and the time between the initial entry and subsequent case confirmation significantly a_ect the probability of the second wave occurrence. Although the susceptible population size does not change the probability of resurgence, it can influence the severity of the outbreak when a second wave occurs. Therefore, to prevent the occurrence of a future wave, timely screening and detection are needed to identify infected cases in the early stage of infection. When infected cases appear, various measures such as contact tracing and quarantine should be followed to reduce the size of susceptible population in order to mitigate the COVID-19 outbreak. ? 2021 American Institute of Mathematical Sciences.

The goal of this study is to examine whether and how youth care workers utilize social media communications for reaching out to detached adolescents and providing them emotional support. Qualitative in-depth interviews (N=17) were conducted with counselors, social workers, and clinical psychologists who work with youth at risk. A thematic analysis of the interviews revealed three principal psychosocial usages of social media: (1) Reaching out and maintaining reciprocal and meaningful therapeutic relationships with youth at risk over time; (2) Identifying risks and emotional distress; and (3) stepping in and providing psychosocial assistance, when needed. These beneficial practices are made possible through the high accessibility and the sense of secured mediation that characterize social media communication and that complement the psychosocial needs of youth at risk. Alongside these advantages, the analysis yielded several significant challenges in social media therapeutic relationships, including privacy dilemmas and blurring of authority and boundaries. Given that social media communication is a relatively new phenomenon, the applied psychosocial practices are shaped through a process of trial and error, intuitive decisions, and peer learning. Although the main conclusion from this study supports the notion that the advantages of social media therapeutic relationships with youth at risk outweigh their problematic aspects, future research is recommended to establish clear guidelines for youth caregivers who wish to integrate the new media in their daily psychosocial work.","output":"OMG, R U OK?

DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional analysis of survey data collected via a multimodal observational study. PARTICIPANTS: Senegalese adults aged 18 years or older (n=1452). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measures were COVID-19 prevention behaviours. Secondary outcome measures included COVID-19 knowledge and beliefs. Univariate, bivariate and multivariate statistics were generated to describe the sample and explore potential correlations. SETTING: Participants from Senegal were recruited online and telephonically between June and August 2020. RESULTS: Mask wearing, hand washing and use of hand sanitiser were most frequently reported. Social distancing and staying at home were also reported although to a lower degree. Knowledge and perceived risk of COVID-19 were very high in general, but risk was a stronger and more influential predictor of COVID-19 prevention behaviours. Men, compared with women, had lower odds (adjusted OR (aOR)=0.59, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.75, p<0.001) of reporting prevention behaviours. Rural residents (vs urban; aOR=1.49, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.98, p=0.001) and participants with at least a high school education (vs less than high school education; aOR=1.33, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.76, p=0.006) were more likely to report COVID-19 prevention behaviours. CONCLUSIONS: In Senegal, we observed high compliance with recommended COVID-19 prevention behaviours among our sample of respondents, in particular for masking and personal hygiene practice. We also identified a range of psychosocial and demographic predictors for COVID-19 prevention behaviours such as knowledge and perceived risk. Stakeholders and decision makers in Senegal and across Africa can use place-based evidence like ours to address COVID-19 risk factors and intervene effectively with policies and programming.

If a traveler carrying dengue virus visits open green space and is bitten by mosquitoes, a local outbreak can ensue. In the present study, we aimed to understand the movement patterns of international travelers in Tokyo using mobile phone data, with the goal of identifying geographical foci of dengue transmission. We analyzed datasets based on mobile phone access to WiFi systems and measured the spatial distribution of international visitors in Tokyo on two specific dates (one weekday in July 2017 and another weekday in August 2017). Mobile phone users were classified by nationality into three groups according to risk of dengue transmission. Sixteen national parks were selected based on their involvement in a 2014 dengue outbreak and abundance of Aedes mosquitoes. We found that not all national parks were visited by international travelers and that visits to cemeteries were very infrequent. We also found that travelers from countries with high dengue prevalence were less likely to visit national parks compared with travelers from dengue-free countries. Travelers from countries with sporadic dengue cases and countries with regional transmission tended to visit common destinations. By contrast, the travel footprints of visitors from countries with continuous dengue transmission were focused on non-green spaces. Entomological surveillance in Tokyo has been restricted to national parks since the 2014 dengue outbreak.

Tumours were subdivided as follows: colorectal metastases (n=21) and no colorectal metastases (n=10). All procedures were performed percutaneously under ultrasound (US) guidance. Follow-up was performed with computed tomography (CT) scan at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment; mean follow-up period was 12.04 (range, 3-36) months. Technical success, mean disease-free survival, effectiveness and safety were evaluated. RESULTS Technical success was obtained in all cases. Mean disease-free survival was of 20.5 months.

Given that mucins are critical components of innate immunity, unraveling their expression profiles that dictate the course of disease could greatly enhance our understanding and management of COVID-19. METHODS: Using validated RT-PCR assays, we assessed mucin mRNA expression in the blood of patients with symptomatic COVID-19 compared with symptomatic patients without COVID-19 and healthy controls and correlated the data with clinical outcome parameters. Additionally, we analyzed mucin expression in mucus and lung tissue from patients with COVID-19 and investigated the effect of drugs for COVID-19 treatment on SARS-CoV-2Cinduced mucin expression in pulmonary epithelial cells. RESULTS: We identified a dynamic blood mucin mRNA signature that clearly distinguished patients with symptomatic COVID-19 from patients without COVID-19 based on expression of MUC1, MUC2, MUC4, MUC6, MUC13, MUC16, and MUC20 (AUC(ROC) of 91.8%; sensitivity and specificity of 90.6% and 93.3%, respectively) and that discriminated between mild and critical COVID-19 based on the expression of MUC16, MUC20, and MUC21 (AUC(ROC) of 89.1%; sensitivity and specificity of 90.0% and 85.7%, respectively). Differences in the transcriptional landscape of mucins in critical cases compared with mild cases identified associations with COVID-19 symptoms, respiratory support, organ failure, secondary infections, and mortality. Furthermore, we identified different mucins in the mucus and lung tissue of critically ill COVID-19 patients and showed the ability of baricitinib, tocilizumab, favipiravir, and remdesivir to suppress expression of SARS-CoV-2Cinduced mucins.

We estimated the accuracy of five risk-stratification tools recommended to predict severe illness and compare accuracy to existing clinical decision-making in a pre-hospital setting. MethodsAn observational cohort study using linked ambulance service data for patients attended by EMS crews in the Yorkshire and Humber region of England between 18th March 2020 and 29th June 2020 was conducted to assess performance of the PRIEST tool, NEWS2, the WHO algorithm, CRB-65 and PMEWS in patients with suspected COVID-19 infection. The primary outcome was death or need for organ support. ResultsOf 7549 patients in our cohort, 17.6% (95% CI:16.8% to 18.5%) experienced the primary outcome. The NEWS2, PMEWS, PRIEST tool and WHO algorithm identified patients at risk of adverse outcomes with a high sensitivity (>0.95) and specificity ranging from 0.3 (NEWS2) to 0.41 (PRIEST tool). The high sensitivity of NEWS2 and PMEWS was achieved by using lower thresholds than previously recommended. On index assessment, 65% of patients were transported to hospital and EMS decision to transfer patients achieved a sensitivity of 0.84 (95% CI 0.83 to 0.85) and specificity of 0.39 (95% CI 0.39 to 0.40).

The objectives of this study can be highlighted through classifying the information sources for identifying protective practices, death probability, genderCdeath associations probability and education level. METHODOLOGY: This is a descriptive design study conducted among the Kurdistan Region/Iraq population via an online application between 1 March and 1 May 2020. Three hundred twenty people participated in this questionnaire study. The data were collected through an online form, relying upon a self-report questionnaire. The questionnaire had three main parts. The first part is related to the socio-demographic characteristics of the sample, including gender, age, family status, address status and education level. The second part involves the items related to precautionary measures using none, sometimes, and always. The last part contains items related to death probability owing to other causes and this includes five categories: extremely low, low, intermediate, high and extremely high. The validity and reliability of this questionnaire were revised by the panel of experts before the data collection. RESULTS: The outcomes of the study revealed that the majority, ca. 73%, of the Kurdistan Region/Iraq population depended on TV to obtain information about COVID-19. Also, this investigation showed that there is a substantial association between participants with infection prevention and control practices relevant to COVID-19. Moreover, according to this study, there is a significant relationship between the death probability and COVID-19. Concurrently, there is not any significant association between other causes, namely cancer, heart diseases, diabetes and road traffic accidents, and the death probability. CONCLUSION: This study showed that for the majority of the Kurdistan Region/Iraq population the most reliable source of information for any COVID-19 related updates is the TV broadcast. This study also indicated that there is strong association for the majority of individuals regarding their practices for prevention from COVID-19 and death probability with COVID-19.

ReninCangiotensinCaldosterone system (RAAS) blockers enhance the expression of ACE2, the binding receptor of SARS-CoV-2, and can enhance viral infectivity. We aim to provide a pooled estimate of the effect of RAAS blockers on COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: A literature search was performed using MEDLINE/PubMed, Google Scholar and preprint servers. All clinical studies analyzing the effect of RAAS blockers on clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients were included in this study. NewcastleCOttawa scale was used for quality assessment of studies. MOOSE checklist was followed. Mortality and severity outcomes were recorded as pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and level of heterogeneity (I(2)). Odds of mortality was the primary outcome. Odds of severity, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation (MV), steroid use and acute kidney injury were the secondary outcomes. Severity outcomes were chosen depending upon the definition used by respective authors. Country-specific variations and effects of individual class of RAAS blockers were also explored. RESULTS: In total 47 published studies were included in the final analysis, with a total of 26,432 patients from 31 studies in mortality analysis and 20,127 patients from 23 studies in severity analysis. No increased risk of mortality [Pooled OR 0.91 (0.65C1.26), I(2) = 89%] or severity [Pooled OR 1.08 (0.79C1.46), I(2) = 88%] was seen with RAAS blockers. The drug class was protective in hypertension [pooled OR 0.63 (0.46C0.86), I(2) = 58%]. Severity of COVID-19 outcomes was high for Europeans [Pooled OR 2.08 (1.52C2.85), I(2) = 77%] and US patients [Pooled OR 1.87 (1.62C2.17)]. Nearly 4 times higher risk of hospitalization and 2 times higher risk of ICU admission and MV were observed in US patients. Class-wise, angiotensin receptor blocker use was associated with 1.6 times higher odds of severity, mainly in Europeans. CONCLUSION: RAAS blockers are not associated with increased mortality in COVID-19 patients and should be continued in hypertensives. US and European patients are at higher risk of severe outcomes. Pharmacogenetic differences may explain the ethnicity-related variations. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Effect of RAAS-blocking medicines on COVID-19 Background and aims: Higher deaths have been observed in COVID-19 patients who have other long-term diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure. Many of these patients are prescribed a class of medicines called RAAS blockers (ramipril, telmisartan, etc). We studied whether the use of these medicines worsens the course of COVID-19 disease in these patients or causes excess deaths. Methods: We conducted a pooled analysis of 47 observational studies on the use of RAAS blocker drugs in COVID-19 patients. Results: We found that RAAS blockers do not cause excess deaths in patients with COVID-19. On the contrary, they have benefits if prescribed to those with high blood pressure. We also found that whereas European and US patients of COVID-19 taking these medicines had higher disease severity, this was not the case for Chinese patients. Conclusion: Theremay be some genetic and other factors responsible for differences by ethnicity.","output":"ReninCangiotensinCaldosterone system blockers and region-specific variations in COVID-19 outcomes: findings from a systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to evaluate the mixed and homogeneous application of the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine CoronaVac (CV) and the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 (BNT).

To effectively mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic among Japanese children, it is necessary to increase understanding of the culturally specific psychological effects on Japanese children, including age and gender differences, as well as related risk and protective factors. However, no previous research has quantitatively evaluated changes in Japanese children's emotional functioning before and after the pandemic began. The present study examined changes in Japanese children's emotional functioning with pre- and mid-pandemic questionnaires, particularly focusing on age and gender differences. The present study also explored the effects of school adjustment, social interactions, and lifestyle activities on children's emotional and behavioral functioning during the pandemic. Data were analyzed from 293 children from the southwestern region in Japan. The pre-pandemic questionnaire assessed emotional and behavioral functioning and school adjustment, while the mid-pandemic questionnaire assessed emotional and behavioral functioning, social interactions, and lifestyle activities. The results indicated that the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the emotional functioning of Japanese children, especially younger boys. Pre-pandemic school adjustment negatively influenced emotional functioning. Spending time alone, spending little time with one's mother, poor sleep regulation, a lack of exercise, and a high frequency of playing video games were related to poor emotional and behavioral functioning. The findings imply that Japanese children, especially younger boys, may benefit from psychological interventions that promote social interactions, especially with their mothers, regulated sleep patterns, adequate exercise, and that support children in managing video game engagement, to mitigate the pandemic's negative psychological impact.","output":"The impact of gender differences, school adjustment, social interactions, and social activities on emotional and behavioral reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic among Japanese school children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The goal of this research was to compare clinical signs, symptoms and laboratory findings in children diagnosed with Kawasaki disease and those with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).We reviewed medical records of children diagnosed with Kawasaki disease or MIS-C hospitalised in the University Hospital for Infectious Diseases Dr. Fran Mihaljevi? in the period from February 25th 2020 to February 24th 2021. We defined MIS-C using World Health Organisation criteria.There were 13 children diagnosed with Kawasaki disease and 23 children diagnosed with MIS-C hospitalised in this period. The average duration of hospitalisation was similar in both groups, approximately 8 days. Boys were overall more affected (66%) than girls. Children with MIS-C were older and more often gastrointestinal symptoms were present. When comparing laboratory results, children in the MIS-C group had higher C-reactive protein levels and lower platelet count. Also, they required intensive care treatment more frequently. The first therapy of choice for all children with Kawasaki disease was monotherapy with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG). Monotherapy with IVIG was used in 15 patients with MIS-C, while 8 of them were initially treated with the combination of IVIG and corticosteroids. One death case occured in the MIS-C group, and none in the Kawasaki group.Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children associated with COVID-19 is a new pediatric disease that is dangerous and potentially lethal.

I explore via simulations the dynamic properties of the co-evolutionary process dynamically linking disease diffusion and network properties.

DESIGN: A prospective study of COVID-19 patients. PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS: Consecutive adults admitted to Queen Mary Hospital for confirmed COVID-19 from July to December 2020 were prospectively recruited. SARS-CoV-2 viral load was represented by cycle threshold (Ct) values from real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of the respiratory specimen on admission. Serum TSH, free thyroxine and free T3 were measured on admission. The outcome was deterioration in clinical severity, defined as worsening in &#8805;1 category of clinical severity according to the Chinese National Health Commission guideline. RESULTS: We recruited 367 patients. At baseline, 75.2% had mild disease, and 27 patients (7.4%) had NTIS. Fifty-three patients (14.4%) had clinical deterioration. Patients with NTIS were older, had more comorbidities, worse symptomatology, higher SARS-CoV-2 viral loads and worse profiles of inflammatory and tissue injury markers.

This systematic review synthesized evidence on the correlates of outdoor play and outdoor time among children aged 3-12 years. METHODS: A total of 12 electronic databases in five different languages (Chinese, English, Korean, Spanish, Portuguese) were searched between October 28, 2019 and July 27, 2020. Covidence software was used for screening and Microsoft Excel with a predesigned coding form was used for data extraction. Evidence was synthesized and correlates were categorized using the socioecological model framework. RESULTS: Based on 107 studies representing 188,498 participants and 422 childcare centers from 29 countries, 85 studies examined potential correlates of outdoor play while 23 studies examined that of outdoor time (one examined both). The duration of outdoor play and outdoor time ranged between 60 and 165 min/d and 42-240 min/d, respectively. Out of 287 (outdoor play) and 61 (outdoor time) potential correlates examined, 111 correlates for outdoor play and 33 correlates for outdoor time were identified as significant correlates. Thirty-three variables were identified as key/common correlates of outdoor play/time, including eight correlates at the individual level (e.g., sex/gender, race/ethnicity, physical activity), 10 correlates at the parental level (e.g., parental attitude/support/behavior, parenting practice), nine at the microsystem level (e.g., proximal home/social environment such as residence type, peer influence), three at the macrosystem/community level (e.g., availability of space children can play), and three at the physical ecology/pressure for macrosystem change level (e.g., seasonality, rurality). No key correlates were found at the institutional level. CONCLUSIONS: Individual, parental, and proximal physical (home) and social environments appear to play a role in childrens outdoor play and time. Ecological factors (i.e., seasonality, rurality) also appear to be related to outdoor play/time. Evidence was either inconsistent or lacking at institutional and macrosystem/community levels.

With the emergence of fake news at a very rapid rate, a serious concern has produced in our society because of enormous fake content dissemination. The quality of the news content is questionable and there exists a necessity for an automated tool for the detection. Existing studies primarily focus on utilizing information extracted from the news content. We suggest that user-based engagements and the context related group of people (echo-chamber) sharing the same opinions can play a vital role in the fake news detection. Hence, in this paper, we have focused on both the content of the news article and the existence of echo chambers in the social network for fake news detection. Standard factorization methods for fake news detection have limited effectiveness due to their unsupervised nature and primarily employed with traditional machine learning models. To design an effective deep learning model with tensor factorization approach is the priority. In our approach, the news content is fused with the tensor following a coupled matrixCtensor factorization method to get a latent representation of both news content as well as social context. We have designed our model with a different number of filters across each dense layer along with dropout. To classify on news content and social context-based information individually as well as in combination, a deep neural network (our proposed model) was employed with optimal hyper-parameters. The performance of our proposed approach has been validated on a real-world fake news dataset: BuzzFeed and PolitiFact. Classification results have demonstrated that our proposed model (EchoFakeD) outperforms existing and appropriate baselines for fake news detection and achieved a validation accuracy of 92.30%.

Herein, we sought to explore the anti-cancer mechanisms of ISL loaded nanoliposomes (ISL-NLs) on AMP-activated protein kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin (AMPK/mTOR) pathways mediated glycolysis. Also, the key targets such as caveolin 1 (CAV1), glucose transporters and Akt/mTOR that promote glycolysis, and are activated via the induction of -enolase (ENO1), fructose bisphosphate aldolase A (ALDOA) and monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) expressions were also investigated. It was shown that ISL-NLs significantly suppressed the proliferation and glucose uptake of CRC cell by potentially regulating the glycolysis and lactate targets as well as pathways that formed the basis of the anti-CRC effects of ISL-NLs. The mechanism underlying this effect was further validated via the regulation of some key targets such as ENO1, ALDOA, lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) and MCT4 in glycolysis coupled with cellular myelocytomatosis oncogene (c-myc), hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1) in protein kinase B/mTOR (Akt/mTOR) pathways. Moreover, the AMPK proteins were identified to be up-regulated while the lactic acid production was suppressed by ISL-NLs in the CRC cells, indicating that ISL-NLs had an inhibitory effect on AMPK mediated glycolysis and lactate production.

The MERS-CoV epidemic started in 2012 and is still ongoing, with a mortality rate of approximately 35%. No vaccine is available against MERS-CoV and therapeutic options for MERS-CoV infections are limited to palliative and supportive care. A search for specific antiviral treatments is urgently needed. Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses, with the spike proteins present on their surface responsible for virus entry into the target cell. Lectins are attractive anti-coronavirus candidates because of the highly glycosylated nature of the spike protein. We tested the antiviral effect of griffithsin (GRFT), a lectin isolated from the red marine alga Griffithsia sp. against MERS-CoV infection. Our results demonstrate that while displaying no significant cytotoxicity, griffithsin is a potent inhibitor of MERS-CoV infection. Griffithsin also inhibits entry into host cells of particles pseudotyped with the MERS-CoV spike protein, suggesting that griffithsin inhibits spike protein function during entry.

The few empirical studies that have examined pandemic related changes in rates of child maltreatment have relied predominantly on reports of suspected maltreatment. OBJECTIVE: This study examines rates of documented, substantiated child maltreatment resulting in foster care placement, as well as demographic correlates of child maltreatment within the foster care system, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Data were available for all youth in the FL foster care system from January 1, 2001 through June 30, 2020 (i.e., > 304,000 youth; > 1.1 million total placements). METHODS: This study utilizes data from the Florida State Automated Child Welfare Information System (SACWIS). RESULTS: Results revealed a decrease in the number of youths placed in the FL foster care system during the COVID-19 pandemic with the greatest reduction in April, 2020 during the Safer-at-Home Order (24 % fewer youth in 2020 than 2019). In contrast, the percentage of placements into foster care due to maltreatment increased by 3.34 %. Demographic-linked differences were observed in placement rates and exposure to maltreatment. CONCLUSIONS: While prior work suggests that reports of child maltreatment have decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study demonstrates that overall rates of substantiated maltreatment resulting in foster care placement have increased for White youth, while rates of placement of due to inadequate supervision, emotional neglect, and/or parental substance use have decreased for Black youth.

An optimized analogue (VIR-576) was effective in a phase I/II clinical trial and initial studies showed that HIV-1 resistance to VIRIP-based inhibitors has a high genetic barrier. Partially resistant CXCR4 (X4)-tropic HIV-1 NL4-3 variants could be obtained, however, after more than 15 months of passaging in MT-4 cells in the presence of another derivative (VIR-353). Sequence analyses identified the accumulation of seven mutations across the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein but outside the gp41 fusion peptide. The authors suggested that the three initial alterations conferred resistance, while subsequent changes restored viral fitness. Here, we introduced these mutations individually and in combination into X4- and CCR5 (R5)-tropic HIV-1 constructs and determined their impact on VIR-353 and VIR-576 susceptibility, viral infectivity, replication fitness, and fusogenicity. We found that essentially all seven mutations contribute to reduced susceptibility to VIRIP-based inhibitors. HIV-1 constructs containing 4 changes were substantially more resistant to both VIRIP-based inhibitors and the VRC34.01 antibody targeting the fusion peptide. However, they were also much less infectious and fusogenic than those harboring only the three initial alterations. Furthermore, the additional changes attenuated rather than rescued HIV-1 replication in primary human cells. Thus, the genetic barrier to HIV-1 resistance against VIRIP-based inhibitors is higher than previously suggested, and mutations reducing viral susceptibility come at a severe fitness cost that was not rescued during long-term cell culture passage.IMPORTANCE Many viral pathogens are critically dependent on fusion peptides (FPs) that are inserted into the cellular membrane for infection. Initially, it was thought that FPs cannot be targeted for therapy because they are hardly accessible. However, an optimized derivative (VIR-576) of an endogenous fragment of 1-antitrypsin, named VIRIP, targeting the gp41 FP reduced viral loads in HIV-1-infected individuals. Characterization of HIV-1 variants selected during long-term cell-culture passage in the presence of a VIRIP derivative suggested that just three mutations in the HIV-1 Env protein might be sufficient for VIRIP resistance and that four subsequent changes restored viral fitness. Here, we show that all seven mutations contribute to reduced viral susceptibility to VIRIP-based inhibitors and demonstrate that the additional changes strongly impair rather than rescue HIV-1 infectivity, fusogenicity, and replication fitness. High genetic barrier to resistance and severe fitness cost support further clinical development of this class of antiviral agents.","output":"Reduced Susceptibility to VIRIP-Based HIV-1 Entry Inhibitors Has a High Genetic Barrier and Severe Fitness Costs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rsum Sur la base dun travail clinique auprs de quatre patientes adultes souffrant de troubles du comportement alimentaire, nous dcrivons deux modalits articules de lhabitat : la tanire et le territoire.

Objectives Clinical and phenomenological exploration of the manner in which patients with eating disorders inhabit their dwellings. Methods Discussion of a series of four adult patients treated in long-term psychotherapy. Results We describe two distinct, interrelated modes of dwelling: the den and the territory. The territory is the parental home, where the patients grew up;the den is the current place of living. The territory is an arena of rivalry and conflicts with parents and siblings. Patients have a strong attachment to the territory, exerting a sharp surveillance through frequent inspection visits, with violent reactions to changes happening in the house. Even in their absence, they haunt the territory. In contrast, the den is a place where they disappear, severing all links with the outside world and abandoning themselves to binge eating. The den is an escape from the demands of social relationships, painfully experienced as intrusions or the threat of desertion. Conclusions Eating disorders, because they are related to fundamental difficulties in the processes of emancipation, result in specific, altered modes of dwelling. These alterations are mutually reinforcing, and can be understood as pathological solutions developed in response to difficulties in the emancipation process. Systematic, empirical studies would help to shed more light on modes of dwelling in eating disorders. These aspects of the patients experience should be included in clinical care.","output":"La tanire et le territoire : esquisse dune topo-analyse des troubles du comportement alimentaire"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), also known in China as Infectious Atypical Pneumonia (IAP), is the 21st centurys first infectious disease to severely threaten the public health of the human population (WHO, 2003a). A respiratory transmitted disease caused by a virus, SARS is highly infectious and is rapidly transmitted, inflicting severe complications and a high case fatality rate. The first round of the SARS pandemic led to global panic and billions of dollars economic losses, for due to lack of effective SARS drugs, governments throughout the world had to take rigid steps toward prevention and treatment of the disease. The SARS epidemic began with the first reported case in Guangzhou, China (Wang et al., 2004), on 16 November 2002. Eight months later, the disease had spread to 26 countries in Asia, America, and Europe, resulting in a reported 8,096 cases and 774 deaths (WHO, 2004).

The disease is caused by a virus of the Coronaviridae family and is closely related to the virus responsible for the severe acute respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Since December 2019, the virus has continued to spread way beyond the location of the first recorded cases (Wuhan, China). As of now, over 5 million cases have been diagnosed with the disease worldwide and over 300 thousand have died. COVID-19 patients suffer from respiratory symptoms that can rapidly turn into potentially fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a portion of patients. Although many drugs and vaccines are currently under clinical trials, there is no currently approved treatment or vaccine. It is therefore critical to correctly identify risk factors that lead to the exacerbation of symptoms in highly susceptible groups. Groups that are at high risk include those aged 55 or older especially those with underlying conditions such as cardiovascular diseases. Certain ethnicities such as African-Americans have been found to be at a higher risk and males seem to be higher both in numbers as well as severity of cases. It is hypothesized that these groups are at risk as their molecular landscape is more permissive of viral infection and growth. Different occupations, especially those related to health-care as well as populations that do not cultivate a mask-wearing culture are at higher risk due to environmental exposure. In this article, we examine the evidence regarding different groups that are more sensitive to the disease and review hypotheses pertaining to COVID-19 infection and prognosis.

Several patients with COVID-19 infection report prolonged complaints after recovery and many of them suffer from persistent cough, dyspnea, chest pain and shortness of breath regardless of whether the coronavirus caused mild or more severe symptoms. They complain of severe fatigue and weakness while others grizzle about gastrointestinal complaints, headache, depression, loss of sense of smell and taste. Numerous studies describe that the infection can affect lung function even in months and coronavirus infection can be detectable in previously healthy lungs by taking a control chest CT scan three months after recovery. Therefore, chest follow-up is required after the infection if the patient has prolonged complaints or if the disease has caused pneumonia. In addition to the currently operating inpatient respiratory rehabilitation, there is also a need for an outpatient extension of treatment to achieve complete recovery in patients without further hospitalization. For those patients who have had the COVID-19 infection complex rehabilitation can improve their workload, quality of life, improves their respiratory function values, reduces their complaints and also improves their physical and mental condition. The aim of our summary research is to review what COVID-19 outpatient rehabilitation programs have been initiated for patients who went through coronavirus infection on international and domestic scenes.

AREAS COVERED This review concentrates on new therapeutics - excluding cell and gene therapies - under investigation for PD with 'disease-modifying' potential. This is a global, comprehensive picture of the current innovative drug pipeline, where the main preclinical and clinical data available are provided. Drug candidates presented include -synuclein modulating agents, neuroprotective agents and neuroinflammation modulators, kinase modulators, neurotrophic factors, and drugs acting on emerging targets. EXPERT OPINION There is excitement for agents with 'disease-modifying' properties and the authors found more than 130 assets, not including cell and gene therapies under investigation - most of them still in preclinical development - meaning that the science is progressing multiple, diverse new opportunities. Many limitations hamper the successful development of these drug candidates such as the translational accuracy of preclinical models, the current clinical development paradigm as well as the lack of biomarkers to be used in diagnosis and therapy management.","output":"Therapeutic innovation in Parkinson's disease: a 2020 update on disease-modifying approaches."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to elucidate the cellular immune response against Toxoplasma gondii in chronically infected mice reinfected with different strains of the parasite to elucidate the immunological basis for chronicity or virulence and to uncover the involvement of genes that encode virulence proteins and modulate the immune response.

The large amount of data generated produces an opportunity to detect species even at very low levels, provided that computational tools can effectively profile the relevant metagenomic communities. Data interpretation is complicated by the fact that short sequencing reads can match multiple organisms and by the lack of completeness of existing databases, in particular for viral pathogens. Here we present metaMix, a Bayesian mixture model framework for resolving complex metagenomic mixtures. We show that the use of parallel Monte Carlo Markov chains for the exploration of the species space enables the identification of the set of species most likely to contribute to the mixture. Results: We demonstrate the greater accuracy of metaMix compared with relevant methods, particularly for profiling complex communities consisting of several related species. We designed metaMix specifically for the analysis of deep transcriptome sequencing datasets, with a focus on viral pathogen detection; however, the principles are generally applicable to all types of metagenomic mixtures.

The contract service aimed to convert village doctors, who had privately practiced for decades, into general practitioners under the government management, and better control the rampant chronic diseases. This study made a rare attempt to assess the effectiveness of public health services delivered under the contract service policy, explore the influencing mechanism and draw the implications for the policy extension in the future. METHODS: Three pilot counties and a non-pilot one with heterogeneity in economic and health development from east to west of China were selected by a purposive sampling method. The case study methods by document collection, non-participant observation and interviews (including key informant interview and focus group interview) with 84 health providers and 20 demanders in multiple level were applied in this study. A thematic approach was used to compare diverse outcomes and analyze mechanism in the complex adaptive systems framework. RESULTS: Without sufficient incentives, the public health services were not conducted effectively, regardless of the implementation of the contract policy. To appropriately increase the funding for public health by local finance and properly allocate subsidy to village doctors was one of the most effective approaches to stimulate health providers and demanders positivity and promote the policy implementation. County health bureaus acted as the most crucial agents among the complex public health systems. Their mental models influenced by the compound and various environments around them led to the diverse outcomes. If they could provide extra incentives and make the contexts of the systems ripe enough for change, the health providers and demanders would be receptive to the transition of the policy. CONCLUSIONS: The innovative fund raising measures could be taken by relatively developed counties of China to conduct public health services. Policymakers could take systems thinking as a useful tool to design plans and predict the unintended outcomes during the process of public health reforms.","output":"Evaluation and mechanism for outcomes exploration of providing public health care in contract service in Rural China: a multiple-case study with complex adaptive systems design"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The compounding challenges of low signal, high background, and uncertain targets plague many sequencing efforts, including monitoring potential zoonotic resevoirs.

METHODS: A non-toxic gravity steam reprocessing method has been developed for the reuse of N95 respirators consisting of 30 minutes of steam treatment at 121C followed by 30 minutes of heat drying. Samples of model number 1860, 1860s, 1870+, and 9105 N95 respirators were either collected from hospitals (for microbiology testing) or purchased new (for functionality testing), with all functionality tests (i.e. filter efficiency, fit evaluation, and strap integrity) performed at the Centers for Disease Control using standard procedures established by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. FINDINGS: All tested models passed the minimum filter efficiency of 95% after three cycles of gravity steam reprocessing. The 1870+ N95 respirator model is the most promising model for reprocessing based on its efficient bacterial inactivation coupled with the maintenance of all other key functional respirator properties after multiple reprocessing steps.

We investigated the contribution of protein denaturation to the effect of surfactants on barrier function. METHODS The Transmission Index method, which evaluates the actual effect of surfactants on barrier function, was combined with a microplate assay measuring protein denaturation activity. The correlation between the TI value and the reciprocal of the median effect concentration (1/EC50) was analyzed for 19 surfactants. The contribution of protein denaturation to the effect of surfactants was discussed based on the 1/EC50 per TI value. RESULTS A few surfactants showed high TI value. Nonionic surfactants had no effect. The EC50 varied without certain trend. For amino acid-based surfactants, there was a gradual inverse correlation between the TI value and the 1/EC50. CONCLUSION The difference in the alkyl structure and the ion source affected the skin barrier function. Protein denaturing activity of the surfactant was not a critical factor. This suggests that the effect on intercellular lipids was the major factor. However, the magnitude of the contribution of protein denaturation activity varied depending on the surfactant, suggesting that each surfactant has a different mechanism of influence on skin barrier function.","output":"The involvement of protein denaturing activity in the effect of surfactants on skin barrier function."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose a prognostic dynamic risk stratification for 48-hour in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19, using demographics and routinely-collected observations and laboratory tests: age, Clinical Frailty Scale score, heart rate, respiratory rate, SpO2/FiO2 ratio, white cell count, acidosis (pH < 7.35) and Interleukin-6.

This means that just as calorie intake restriction could help mitigate the deleterious impacts of a bout of physical inactivity, overeating under conditions of home confinement is very likely to exacerbate these consequences. Moreover, hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease have been identified as potential risk factors for more severely ill patients with COVID-19.

The strategic significance of the supply chain has been thrust into the forefront for businesses, economies, and society at large. It has become recognized by researchers and industry that there is a need for higher efficiency within the supply chain while remaining responsive to consumer needs. However, the fragmented and diverse nature of supply chain management, coupled with the complex accountancy and financial outputs of the supply chain, has resulted in limited development of a theoretical foundation specific to supply chain management. The aim of this investigation was to develop a new model (the Supply Chain Efficiency Ratio) that measures supply chain efficiency using financial ratios and by extending the Efficiency Model. Data for this investigation were obtained from U.S.-based public discount stores in the United States. The results of the multiple regression performed indicated that the Supply Chain Efficiency Ratio holds predictive value of an organization's supply chain efficiency p<0005.

Over the course of 53 days, the floodwaters of Harvey delivered 14  109 m3 of freshwater to Galveston Bay. This resulted in record flooding of Houston bayous and waterways, all of which drained into the San Jacinto Estuary (SJE,) with its main tributaries being Buffalo Bayou and the San Jacinto River. The lower SJE and lower Buffalo Bayou has experienced up to 3 m of land subsidence in the past 100 years and, as a result, prior to Hurricane Harvey, up to 2 m of sediment within the upper seabed contained an archive of high concentrations of Total Hg (HgT) and other particle-bound and porewater contaminants. Within the SJE, Harvey eroded at least 48 cm of the sediment column, resulting in the transport of an estimated 16.4  106 tons of sediment and at least 2 tons of Hg into Galveston Bay. This eroded sediment was replaced by a Harvey storm deposit of 7.73  106 tons of sediment and 0.96 tons within the SJE, mostly sourced from Buffalo Bayou. Considering that the frequency of slow-moving tropical cyclones capable of delivering devastating rainfall may be increasing, then one can expect that delivery of Hg and other contaminants from the archived sediment within urbanized estuaries will increase and that what happened during Harvey is a harbinger of what is to come.","output":"How tropical cyclone flooding caused erosion and dispersal of mercury-contaminated sediment in an urban estuary: The impact of Hurricane Harvey on Buffalo Bayou and the San Jacinto Estuary, Galveston Bay, USA."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SJL mouse strain is resistant to infection by some strains of the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), such as JHM and A59. The block to virus infection has been variously attributed to defects in virus receptors or virus spread. Since the cellular receptors for MHV, mmCGM1 and mmCGM2, have recently been identified as members of the carcinoembryonic antigen family, we reexamined the possible defectiveness of the MHV receptors in SJL mouse strain. Cloning and sequencing of the cDNAs of both mmCGMs RNAs from SJL mice revealed that they were identical in size to those of the susceptible C57BL/6 (B6) mouse. There was some sequence divergence in the N terminus of the mmCGM molecules between the two mouse strains, resulting in a different number of potential glycosylation sites. This was confirmed by in vitro translation of the mmCGM RNAs, which showed that the glycosylated mmCGM2 of SJL was smaller than that of B6 mice. However, transfection of either mmCGM1 or mmCGM2 from SJL mice into MHV-resistant Cos 7 cells rendered the cells susceptible to MHV infection. The ability of the SJL mmCGM molecules to serve as MHV receptors was comparable to that of those from B6. These molecules are expressed in SJL mouse brain and liver in a similar ratio and in amounts equivalent to those in the B6 mouse. Furthermore, we demonstrated that an SJL-derived cell line was susceptible to A59 but resistant to JHM infection. We concluded that the MHV receptor molecules in the SJL mouse are functional and that the resistance of SJL mice to infection by some MHV strains most likely results from some other factor(s) required for virus entry or some other step(s) in virus replication.","output":"The receptor for mouse hepatitis virus in the resistant mouse strain SJL is functional: implications for the requirement of a second factor for viral infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It has recently been hypothesised that Vitamin K could play a role in COVID-19.

In a cohort of 138 COVID-19 patients and 140 population controls, we measured plasma dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated Matrix Gla Protein (dp-ucMGP), which reflects the functional Vitamin K status in peripheral tissue. Fourty-three patients died within 90-days from admission. In patients, levels of dp-ucMGP differed significantly between survivors (mean 877; 95% CI: 778; 995) and non-survivors (mean 1445; 95% CI: 1148; 1820).

However, comorbidity burden is often represented by a simple count of few conditions that may not fully capture patients complexity. PurposeTo evaluate the performance of a comprehensive index of the comorbidity burden (Queralt DxS), which includes all chronic conditions present on admission, as an adjustment variable in models for predicting critical illness in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and compare it with two broadly used measures of comorbidity. Patients and methodsWe analyzed data from all COVID-19 hospitalizations reported in eight public hospitals of Catalonia (North-East Spain) between June 15 and December 8 2020. The primary outcome was a composite of critical illness that included the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, transfer to ICU, or in-hospital death. Predictors included age, sex, and comorbidities present on admission measured using three indices: the Charlson index, the Elixhauser index, and the Queralt DxS index for comorbidities on admission. The performance of different fitted models was compared using various indicators, including the area under the receiving operating characteristics curve (AUC). ResultsOur analysis included 4,607 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Of them, 1,315 experienced critical illness. Comorbidities significantly contributed to predicting the outcome in all summary indices used. The AUC for prediction of critical illness was 0.641 (95% CI 0.624-0.660) for the Charlson index, 0.665 (0.645-0.681) for the Elixhauser index, and 0.787 (0.773-0.801) for Queralt DxS. Other metrics of model performance also showed Queralt DxS being consistently superior to the other indices. ConclusionIn our analysis, the ability of comorbidity indices to predict hospital outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients increased with their exhaustivity. The comprehensive Queralt DxS index may improve the accuracy of predictive models for resource allocation and clinical decision-making in the hospital setting.","output":"Comorbidity accounts for severe COVID-19 risk, but how do we measure it?

This study aimed to investigate the role of lipid rafts in the early stage of EV71 Infection. METHODS The effect of cholesterol depletion or addition of exogenous cholesterol was detected by immunofluorescence assays and quantitative real-time PCR. Effects of cholesterol depletion on the association of EV71 with lipid rafts were determined by flow cytometry and co-immunoprecipitation assays. Localization and internalization of EV71 and its receptor were assayed by confocal microscpoy and sucrose gradient analysis. The impact of cholesterol on the activation of phosphoinositide 3'-kinase/Akt signaling pathway during initial virus infection was analyzed by Western-blotting. RESULTS Disruption of membrane cholesterol by a pharmacological agent resulted in a significant reduction in the infectivity of EV71. The inhibitory effect could be reversed by the addition of exogenous cholesterol. Cholesterol depletion post-infection did not affect EV71 infection. While virus bound equally to cholesterol-depleted cells, EV71 particles failed to be internalized by cholesterol-depleted cells. EV71 capsid protein co-localized with cholera toxin B, a lipid-raft-dependent internalization marker.

We aimed to assess the sociodemographic characteristics and hospital support measures associated with the immediate psychological impact on HWs at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan during COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: We conducted a single-center, cross-sectional survey of HWs via online questionnaires between February 8th and 10th, 2020. We evaluated stress, depression and anxiety by IES-R, PHQ-9, and GAD-7, respectively. We also designed a questionnaire to assess the perceptions of threat of COVID-19, and the satisfactions of the hospital's support measures. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify associated variables of acute stress, depression, and anxiety. Findings: We received 5062 completed questionnaires (response rate, 77.1%). 29.8%, 13.5% and 24.1% HWs reported stress, depression and anxiety symptoms. Women (odds ratio [OR], 1.31; 95% CI, 0.47-0.97; p = 0.032), years of working >10 years (OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.47-2.79; p<0.001), concomitant chronic diseases (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.27-1.80; p<0.001), history of mental disorders (OR, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.77-6.05; p<0.001), family members or relatives confirmed or suspected (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.02-1.48; p = 0.03), hospital-based and department-based care (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.60-0.97; p = 0.024) and full coverage of all departments for avoiding nosocomial infection (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.53-0.89; p = 0.004) were associated with stress. Interpretation: Women and those who have more than 10 years of working, concomitant chronic diseases, history of mental disorders, and family members or relatives confirmed or suspected are susceptible to stress, depression and anxiety among HWs during the pandemic. In addition, since HWs often have a greater stigma against mental problems than the general public, it is worthwhile to address the needs of the HWs during this pandemic and to provide appropriate psychological supports for those people at high risk of mental problems.","output":"COVID-19 in Wuhan: Sociodemographic characteristics and hospital support measures associated with the immediate psychological impact on healthcare workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we considered a mathematical model of the spread of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Past research on whether hyperchoice deteriorates decision experience is mixed. The present study hypothesizes the experience in the scenario of hyperchoice may be moderated by individual characteristics, including numeracy and age differences. A total of 116 older adults and 112 younger adults were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk. Along with the Rasch-based numeracy scale, each participant completed a consumer and a gamble choice task. In both tasks, the number of options being presented to participants was manipulated to create a hyperchoice condition (sixteen options) and a simple-choice condition (four options). Dependent variables were post-choice difficulty and satisfaction. Multiple regressions were performed with SPSS 24.0 to test the hypothesis. As a result, hyperchoice was related to greater decision difficulty in both choice tasks. Moreover, there was an interaction between numeracy and hyperchoice in the gamble task. Specifically, whereas higher numerate participants experienced difficulty and satisfaction were relatively stable between the two choice conditions, lower numerate participants experienced more difficulty and dissatisfaction in the hyperchoice condition than in the simple-choice condition. Additionally, compared to younger adults, older adults reported greater decision difficulty and lower decision satisfaction, regardless of choice condition.

To combat the pandemic, many governments have implemented social distancing, quarantine, and stay-at-home orders. There is limited research on the impact of such extreme measures on mental health. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to examine whether stay-at-home orders produced differential changes in mental health symptoms using internet search queries on a national scale. METHODS: In the United States, individual states vary in their adoption of measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19; as of March 23, 2020, 11 of the 50 states had issued stay-at-home orders. The staggered rollout of stay-at-home measures across the United States allows us to investigate whether these measures impact mental health by exploring variations in mental health search queries across the states. This paper examines the changes in mental health search queries on Google between March 16-23, 2020, across each state and Washington, DC. Specifically, this paper examines differential changes in mental health searches based on patterns of search activity following issuance of stay-at-home orders in these states compared to all other states. The participants were all the people who searched mental health terms in Google between March 16-23. Between March 16-23, 11 states underwent stay-at-home orders to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. Outcomes included search terms measuring anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive, negative thoughts, irritability, fatigue, anhedonia, concentration, insomnia, and suicidal ideation. RESULTS: Analyzing over 10 million search queries using generalized additive mixed models, the results suggested that the implementation of stay-at-home orders are associated with a significant flattening of the curve for searches for suicidal ideation, anxiety, negative thoughts, and sleep disturbances, with the most prominent flattening associated with suicidal ideation and anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that, despite decreased social contact, mental health search queries increased rapidly prior to the issuance of stay-at-home orders, and these changes dissipated following the announcement and enactment of these orders. Although more research is needed to examine sustained effects, these results suggest mental health symptoms were associated with an immediate leveling off following the issuance of stay-at-home orders.","output":"Flattening the Mental Health Curve: COVID-19 Stay-at-Home Orders Are Associated With Alterations in Mental Health Search Behavior in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study we conduct a least-likely case study in order to assess the analytical power of the ideational approach to populism.

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of sexual health counseling and contraception use in the oncology setting, and to identify patient factors associated with these outcomes. Design Retrospective chart review. Setting Yale New Haven Hospital from 2013-2018. Participants Female patients ages 15-25 receiving cancer treatment, excluding those treated with only surgery. Interventions None Main Outcome Measures Outcomes of documented sexual health counseling and contraception use were assessed for frequency. Associations between patient factors and these outcomes were assessed using Pearson 2 and Fishers exact tests, and multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of these outcomes. Results In this cohort (n=157), the median age was 20.5, and the most common diagnoses were hematologic (40.8%) and thyroid (31.2%) malignancies. 33.1% were documented as receiving sexual health counseling and 48.4% used contraception. Younger patients (ages 15-20) were less likely to receive counseling (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.14-0.70, P=.005). Receiving counseling (OR 3.36, 95% CI 1.35-8.34, P=.009) and sexual activity (OR 4.18, 95% CI 1.80-9.68, P=.001) were significantly associated with contraception use. Conclusions Sexual health counseling was documented infrequently during oncologic care for AYA women, especially for younger patients. However, such conversations were associated with a higher likelihood of contraception use. There is a need to improve rates of counseling in this high-risk setting, in which adolescents may be more vulnerable with regards to sexual health.","output":"Contraception Counseling and Use Among Adolescent and Young Adult Female Patients Undergoing Cancer Treatment: A Retrospective Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We developed a flexible port for NOTES which allows the use of conventional forceps for laparoscope-assisted surgery without change. The port is not affected by the location of the through hole in the gastrointestinal tract or vagina which elicits a problem in conventional NOTES, and its length can be adjusted during surgery by cutting the port itself. The port is made of polymer resin with a low friction coefficient. Furthermore, the port walls have a square wave structure which contributes to (1) the prevention of devices, for example, endoscope, from getting stuck at the time of insertion and retrieval, (2) the prevention of port slippage in the surgical opening for port insertion, (3) the prevention of unexpected port removal, (4) the prevention of port bore deformation, and (5) the improvement of port flexibility in the longitudinal direction. We validated the insertion and retrieval capacities of commercially available forceps for laparoscope-assisted surgery and power devices. Furthermore, we used the flexible port to conduct cholecystectomy and partial gastrectomy. We could confirm that the selection of the flexible port diameter according to the device type allowed the smooth insertion and retrieval of the device and that the port produced no air leakage. We affirmed that it is possible to conduct surgery by the cross or parallel method similarly to single port surgery.

We evaluated a surgical coaching program by analyzing quantitative and qualitative data on surgeons' intraoperative performance. METHODS In the 2018-2019 Surgical Coaching for Operative Performance Enhancement (SCOPE) program, 46 practicing surgeons in multiple specialties at four academic medical centers were recruited to complete three peer coaching sessions, each comprising preoperative goal-setting, intraoperative observation, and postoperative debriefing. Coach and coachee rated the coachee's performance using modified Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS, range 1-5) and Non-Technical Skills for Surgeons (NOTSS, range 4-16). We used generalized estimating equations to evaluate trends in skill ratings over time, adjusting for case difficulty, clinical experience, and coaching role. Upon program completion, we analyzed semi-structured interviews with individual participants regarding the perceived impact of coaching on their practice. RESULTS Eleven of 23 coachees (48%) completed three coaching sessions, three (13%) completed two sessions, and six (26%) completed one session. Adjusted mean OSATS ratings did not vary over three coaching sessions (4.39 vs 4.52 vs 4.44, respectively; P = 0.655). Adjusted mean total NOTSS ratings also did not vary over three coaching sessions (15.05 vs 15.50 vs 15.08, respectively; P = 0.529). Regarding patient care, participants self-reported improved teamwork skills, communication skills, and awareness in and outside the operating room. Participants acknowledged the potential for coaching to improve burnout due to reduced intraoperative stress and enhanced peer support but also the potential to worsen burnout by adding to chronic work overload. CONCLUSIONS Surgeons reported high perceived impact of peer coaching on patient care and surgeon well-being, although changes in coachees' technical and non-technical skills were not detected over three coaching sessions. While quantitative skill measurement warrants further study, longitudinal peer surgical coaching should be considered a meaningful strategy for surgeons' professional development.","output":"Surgical Coaching for Operative Performance Enhancement (SCOPE): skill ratings and impact on surgeons' practice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals worldwide have reported large volumes of patients with refractory symptoms and a large number of deaths attributable to COVID-19. This has led to an increase in the demand for palliative care beyond what can be provided by most existing programs. We developed a scalable model to enable continued provision of high-quality palliative care during a pandemic for hospitals without a palliative care unit or existing dedicated palliative care beds. METHODS: A COVID-19 consultation service working group (CWG) was convened with stakeholders from palliative care, emergency medicine, critical care, and general internal medicine. The CWG connected with local palliative care teams to ensure a coordinated response, and developed a model to ensure high-quality palliative care provision. RESULTS: Our 3-step scalable model included: (1) consultant model enhanced by virtual care; (2) embedded model; and (3) cohorted end-of-life unit for COVID-19 positive patients. This approach was enabled through tools and resources to ensure specialist palliative care capacity and rapid upskilling of all clinicians to deliver basic palliative care. Enabling tools and resources included a triage tool for in-person versus virtual care, new medication order sets and guidelines to facilitate prescribing for common symptoms, and lead advance care planning and goals of care discussions. A redeployment plan of generalist physicians and psychiatrists was created to ensure seamless provision of serious illness care. CONCLUSION: This 3-step, scalable approach enables rapid upscaling of palliative care in collaboration with generalist physicians, and may be adapted for future pandemics or natural disasters.","output":"Scalable Model for Delivery of Inpatient Palliative Care During a Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dr. Jennifer Li is the focus of our second in a planned series of interviews in Cardiology in the Young entitled, \\"Global Leadership in Paediatric and Congenital Cardiac Care\\".

Interestingly, while undertaking RHDV surveillance of rabbits that were found dead we observed that approximately 40% of samples were negative for RHDV. To investigate whether other infectious agents are responsible for killing rabbits in Australia we subjected a subset of these RHDV-negative liver samples to metatranscriptomic sequencing. In addition, we investigated whether the host transcriptome data could provide additional differentiation between likely infectious versus non-infectious causes of death. We identified transcripts from several Clostridia species, Pasteurella multocida, Pseudomonas, and Eimeria stiedae in liver samples of several rabbits that had died suddenly, all of which are known to infect rabbits and are capable of causing fulminant disease. In addition, we identified Hepatitis E virus and Cyniclomyces yeast in some samples, both of which are not usually associated with severe disease. In one third of the sequenced liver samples, no infectious agent could be identified. While metatranscriptomic sequencing cannot provide definitive evidence of causation, additional host transcriptome analysis provided further insights to distinguish between pathogenic microbes and commensals or environmental contaminants. Interestingly, three samples where no pathogen could be identified showed evidence of upregulated host immune responses, while immune response pathways were not upregulated when E. stiedae, Pseudomonas, or yeast were detected. In summary, although no new putative rabbit pathogens were identified, this study provides a robust workflow for future investigations into rabbit mortality events. Importance We have observed that approximately 40% of rabbit liver samples submitted for RHDV testing (from rabbits that had died suddenly without obvious cause) are RHDV-negative. Interestingly, a similar finding was reported in pet rabbits in the United Kingdom. This raises the intriguing question of what else is killing rabbits, both in Australia and internationally? Using a metatranscriptomic sequencing approach, we found that Clostridiaceae, Pasteurella multocida, and Eimeria are frequently detected in cases of sudden rabbit death in Australia. While we did not identify any potential new pathogens that could be explored in the context of wild rabbit management, we have validated an approach to explore future mortality events of lagomorphs that may identify candidate novel biocontrols. Furthermore, our findings reaffirm the recommendation to follow good hygiene practices when handling rabbits, since domestic rabbits harboured several pathogens of potential public health significance, including Escherichia, Pasteurella multocida, and Hepatitis E virus.","output":"Pathogen profiling of Australian rabbits by metatranscriptomic sequencing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Recent advances in representation learning have enabled large strides in natural language understanding; However, verbal reasoning remains a challenge for state-of-the-art systems. External sources of structured, expert-curated verb-related knowledge have been shown to boost model performance in different Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks where accurate handling of verb meaning and behaviour is critical. The costliness and time required for manual lexicon construction has been a major obstacle to porting the benefits of such resources to NLP in specialised domains, such as biomedicine. To address this issue, we combine a neural classification method with expert annotation to create BioVerbNet. This new resource comprises 693 verbs assigned to 22 top-level and 117 fine-grained semantic-syntactic verb classes. We make this resource available complete with semantic roles and VerbNet-style syntactic frames. RESULTS: We demonstrate the utility of the new resource in boosting model performance in document- and sentence-level classification in biomedicine. We apply an established retrofitting method to harness the verb class membership knowledge from BioVerbNet and transform a pretrained word embedding space by pulling together verbs belonging to the same semantic-syntactic class. The BioVerbNet knowledge-aware embeddings surpass the non-specialised baseline by a significant margin on both tasks. CONCLUSION: This work introduces the first large, annotated semantic-syntactic classification of biomedical verbs, providing a detailed account of the annotation process, the key differences in verb behaviour between the general and biomedical domain, and the design choices made to accurately capture the meaning and properties of verbs used in biomedical texts.

HIV-exposure seems to affect immunology, early growth and development, and is associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates. Currently, there is a lack of information regarding the clinical effects of HIV-exposure during the neonatal period. OBJECTIVES: To identify a possible difference in mortality and common neonatal morbidities in HEU neonates compared to HIV-unexposed neonates. METHODS: This was a retrospective, descriptive study of all neonates admitted to the neonatal unit at Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2018. HEU neonates were compared to HIV-unexposed neonates. RESULTS: There were 3236 neonates included, where 855 neonates were HEU. The HEU neonates had significantly lower birth weight and gestational age. The HEU neonates had higher rates of neonatal sepsis (19.8% vs 14.2%, OR 1.49, p < 0.001), specifically for late onset sepsis, and required more respiratory support. NCPAP and invasive ventilation was more common in the HEU group (36.3% vs 31.3% required NCPAP, p = 0.008, and 20.1% vs 15,0% required invasive ventilation, p < 0.001). Chronic lung disease was more common among HIV-exposed neonates (12.2% vs 8.7%, OR 1.46, p = 0.003). The difference in mortality rates between the study groups was not significant (10.8% of HEU neonates and 13.3% of HIV-unexposed).

SETTING: We studied 21 countries in LAC using data from Demographic and Health Surveys and Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey carried out from 2011 to 2016 PARTICIPANTS: The surveys collect nationally representative data on women and children using multistage sampling. In total, 288 207 women and 195 092 children made part of the surveys in the 21 countries. OUTCOME MEASURES: Five health intervention indicators were studied, related to reproductive and maternal health, along with adolescent fertility and neonatal and under-five mortality rates. Inequalities in these indicators were assessed through absolute and relative measures. RESULTS: In most countries, subnational geographical health gradients were observed for nearly all women, child, and adolescent (WCA) indicators. Coverage of key interventions was higher in urban areas and among the richest, compared with rural areas and poorer quintiles. Analyses by womans age showed that coverage was lower in adolescent girls than older women for family planning indicators. Pro-urban and pro-rich inequalities were also seen for mortality in most countries.

Therapeutic targets have not been well characterized for auto-inflammatory syndromes, although the E3 ligase Synoviolin was previously shown to be a novel therapeutic target for RA. Here, we show that Synoviolin loss has little impact on a model of auto-inflammatory diseases. We previously established such a model, the hIL-1 cTg mouse, in which IL-1 signaling was constitutively activated, and animals exhibit symptoms recapitulating auto-inflammatory syndromes such as major joint dominant arthritis.

Synoviolin gene expression was ablated in adult hIL-1 cTg/Synoviolin cKO mice by injection of pIpC to activate Mx1 promoter-driven Cre recombinase. However, symptoms seen in hIL-1 cTg mice such as arthritis and joint destruction were not alleviated by targeting Synoviolin, ruling out Synoviolin as a therapeutic target for auto-inflammatory disease.

Genetic or individual differences in immune response may be an explanation. Moreover, hyperinflammation and dysregulated immune response are involved in the etiology of severe forms of COVID-19. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to analyze serum alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) levels, as an acute-phase plasma protein with immunomodulatory effect and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as a marker of inflammation response in severe COVID-19 illness. Methods: In this retrospective observational cohort study, 64 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive COVID-19 hospitalized patients were studied for AAT, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), troponin, complete blood count (CBC), random blood sugar, serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), and arterial oxygen saturation (O2sat) at admission and during hospitalization. Results: The results showed that hospitalized patients with COVID-19 had low serum levels of AAT and high CRP levels at the first days of hospitalization. In particular, the percentages of individuals with low, normal, and high AAT levels were 7.80%, 82.80%, and 9.40%, respectively, while high and low values of CRP accounted for 86.70% and 13.30% of patients. Most of the patients had an upward neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) trend, with a higher mortality rate (p < 0.05) and troponin levels (p < 0.05). However, comorbidities, CRP alterations, ESR alterations, nonfasting blood sugar, SGOT, SGPT, O2sat, RBC, and PLT values were not significantly different between the NLR downward and upward trend groups. Conclusions: The current study revealed that severe COVID-19 patients had low serum AAT levels related to CRP values. Therefore, AAT response may be considered as a new mechanism by which some COVID-19 patients show immune dysregulation and more severe symptoms.","output":"Correlation of Low Levels of -1 Antitrypsin and Elevation of Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio with Higher Mortality in Severe COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE This paper explores transnational tobacco companies' (TTCs) long-term policy influence strategies using two case studies, harm reduction and illicit tobacco, to identify lessons for the tobacco control movement and wider efforts to address the commercial determinants of health. METHODS Evidence from a broad combination of sources including leaked documents and findings from over two decades of TTC monitoring were reviewed for each case study and categorised using the Policy Dystopia Model, focusing on the primary discursive strategy and key instrumental (action-based) strategies used. RESULTS In both case studies, TTCs seek to advance their interests by engaging primarily in reputation management, coalition management and information management strategies over the long-term to propagate their over-riding discursive strategy-'we've changed, we are part of the solution'-despite clear evidence from both case studies that this is not the case. These strategies are globally coordinated and attempt primarily to reshape norms towards TTC involvement in tobacco control policy and delivery. Findings also suggest that industry denormalisation and the advent of Article 5.3 have led to the TTCs growing use of increasingly complex and opaque 'webs of influence'. CONCLUSIONS The tobacco control community must develop its own proactive long-term strategies which should include industry denormalisation, new ways to fund research that reduce industry control, and improved transparency measures for research and policy. These findings, including TTC adaptations to Article 5.3, also indicate the need for more structural solutions, addressing corporate power and the underlying political and economic system.

Here, we mined published datasets to determine the effects of hundreds of clinically approved drugs on ACE2 expression. We find that ACEIs are enriched for ACE2-upregulating drugs, while antineoplastic agents are enriched for ACE2-downregulating drugs. Vorinostat and isotretinoin are the top ACE2 up/downregulators, respectively, in cell lines. Dexamethasone, a corticosteroid used in treating severe acute respiratory syndrome and COVID-19, significantly upregulates ACE2 both in vitro and in vivo.

The prevalence of both hyponatremia and hypernatremia has been reported to be higher in patients with CKD than in the general population. Certain features of the studies analyzed, such as variation in the cut-off values of serum sodium concentration ([Na]) that define hyponatremia or hypernatremia, create comparison difficulties. Dysnatremias in patients with CKD are associated with adverse clinical conditions and mortality. Currently, investigation and treatment of dysnatremias in patients with CKD should follow clinical judgment and the guidelines for the general population. Whether azotemia allows different rates of correction of [Na] in patients with hyponatremic CKD and the methodology and outcomes of treatment of dysnatremias by renal replacement methods require further investigation.

This study evaluated the association between the detection of multiple viruses by RT\\\\PCR and disease severity in children with bronchiolitis. METHODS: Children less than 2 years of age with clinical symptoms of bronchiolitis were prospectively included during three winter seasons. Patients were categorized in three groups based on disease severity; mild (no supportive treatment), moderate (supplemental oxygen and/or nasogastric feeding), and severe (mechanical ventilation). Multiplex RT\\\\PCR of 15 respiratory viruses was performed on nasopharyngeal aspirates. RESULTS: In total, 142 samples were obtained. Respiratory Syncytial virus (RSV) was the most commonly detected virus (73%) followed by rhinovirus (RV) (30%). In 58 samples (41%) more than one virus was detected, of which 41% was a dual infection with RSV and RV. In RSV infected children younger than 3 months, disease severity was not associated with the number of detected viruses. Remarkably, in children older than 3 months we found an association between more severe disease and RSV mono\\\\infections.

METHODS In a single-blind, randomized, controlled trial among women undergoing outpatient laparoscopic hysterectomy, patients were randomly assigned to a backfill-assisted void trial or a trial of spontaneous voiding. The primary outcome was time to discharge assessed by length of time spent in the postanesthesia care unit. Secondary outcomes included time to first spontaneous void, urinary retention rates, and postoperative complications within 8 weeks. We estimated that 152 patients (76/group) would provide greater than 80% power to identify a 30-minute difference in the primary outcome with a SD of 56 minutes and a two-sided  of 0.05. RESULTS Between June 2017 to May 2018, 202 women were screened, 162 women were randomized, and results were analyzed for 153 women. Seventy-five patients (group A) who had a backfill-assisted voiding trial and 78 patients (group B) who had a spontaneous voiding trial were included in the analysis. The mean time to discharge was 273.4 minutes for group A vs 283.2 minutes for group B, which was not found to be significant (P=.45). The mean time to first spontaneous void was 181.1 minutes in group A vs 206.0 minutes in group B.

Despite between-study discrepancies, an overall consensus has emerged whereby blood group O appears associated with a lower risk of COVID-19, while non-O blood types appear detrimental. Two major hypotheses may explain these findings: First, natural anti-A and anti-B antibodies could be partially protective against SARS-CoV-2 virions carrying blood group antigens originating from non-O individuals. Second, O individuals are less prone to thrombosis and vascular dysfunction than non-O individuals and therefore could be at a lesser risk in case of severe lung dysfunction. Here, we review the literature on the topic in light of these hypotheses. We find that between-study variation may be explained by differences in study settings and that both mechanisms are likely at play. Moreover, as frequencies of ABO phenotypes are highly variable between populations or geographical areas, the ABO coefficient of variation, rather than the frequency of each individual phenotype is expected to determine impact of the ABO system on virus transmission. Accordingly, the ABO coefficient of variation correlates with COVID-19 prevalence. Overall, despite modest apparent risk differences between ABO subtypes, the ABO blood group system might play a major role in the COVID-19 pandemic when considered at the population level.","output":"ABO Blood Types and COVID-19: Spurious, Anecdotal, or Truly Important Relationships?

In our model for trauma-informed education and administration (M-TIEA), SAMHSA's four key organizational assumptions are foundational, including a realization about trauma and its wide-ranging effects; a recognition of the basic signs and symptoms of trauma; a response that involves fully integrating knowledge into programs, policies, and practices; and an active process for resisting retraumatization. Since educators during the pandemic must follow new restrictions regarding how they teach, we have expanded the practice of teaching in M-TIEA to include both academic administrators' decision making about teaching, and educators' planning and implementation of teaching. In M-TIEA, SAMHSA's six guiding principles for a trauma-informed approach are infused into these two interrelated teaching processes, and include the following: safety; trustworthiness and transparency; peer support; collaboration and mutuality; empowerment, voice, and choice; and cultural, historical, and gender issues. M-TIEA's organizational assumptions, processes, and principles are situated within an outer context that acknowledges the potential influences of four types of intersectional traumas and stressors that may occur at multiple socioecological levels: pandemic-related trauma and stressors; other forms of individual, group, community, or mass trauma and stressors; historical trauma; and current general life stressors.

Using microfluidic diffusional sizing, we determined the dissociation constant (KD) for the interaction between receptor binding domains (RBDs) of SARS-CoV-2 in its original version (WT) as well as alpha and beta variants with the host-cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). For RBD-alpha, the ACE2-binding affinity was increased by a factor of ten when compared with RBD-WT, while ACE2-binding of RBD-beta was largely unaffected. However, when challenged with a neutralizing antibody that binds to both RBD-WT and RBD-alpha with low nanomolar KD values, RBD-beta displayed no binding, suggesting a substantial epitope change. In SARS-CoV-2 convalescent sera, RBD-binding antibodies showed low nanomolar affinities to both wild-type and variant RBD proteinsstrikingly, the concentration of antibodies binding to RBD-beta was half that of RBD-WT and RBD-alpha, again indicating considerable epitope changes in the beta variant. Our data therefore suggests that one factor contributing to the higher transmissibility and antibody evasion of SARS-CoV-2 alpha and beta is a larger fraction of viruses that can form a complex with ACE2. However, the two variants employ different mechanisms to achieve this goal. While SARS-CoV-2 alpha RBD binds with greater affinity to ACE2 and is thus more difficult to displace from the receptor by neutralizing antibodies, RBD-beta is less accessible to antibodies due to epitope changes which increases the chances of ACE2-binding and infection.","output":"Mutations in two SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern reflect two distinct strategies of antibody escape"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As the relentless coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to spread across Africa, Botswana could face challenges maintaining the pathway towards control of its HIV epidemic. OBJECTIVE: Utilising the Spectrum GOALS module (GOALS-2021), the 5-year outcomes from the implementation of the Treat All strategy were analysed and compared with the original 2016 Investment Case (2016-IC) projections. Future impact of adopting the new Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) Global AIDS Strategy (2021C2026) targets and macroeconomic analysis estimating how the financial constraints from the COVID-19 pandemic could impact the available resources for Botswanas National HIV Response through 2030 were also considered. METHOD: Programmatic costs, population demographics, prevention and treatment outputs were determined. Previous 2016-IC data were uploaded for comparison, and inputs for the GOALS, AIM, DemProj, Resource Needs and Family Planning modules were derived from published reports, strategic plans, programmatic data and expert opinion. The economic projections were recalibrated with consideration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Decreases in HIV infections, incidence and mortality rates were achieved. Increases in laboratory costs were offset by estimated decreases in the population of people living with HIV (PLWH). Moving forward, young women and others at high risk must be targeted in HIV prevention efforts, as Botswana transitions from a generalised to a more concentrated epidemic. CONCLUSION: The Treat All strategy contributed positively to decreases in new HIV infections, mortality and costs. If significant improvements in differentiated service delivery, increases in human resources and HIV prevention can be realised, Botswana could become one of the first countries with a previously high-burdened generalised HIV epidemic to gain epidemic control, despite the demands of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Five years after Treat All implementation: Botswanas HIV response and future directions in the era of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Relato de caso Paciente de 70 anos, sexo masculino, branco, hipertenso, diabtico e portador de insuficincia cardaca sistlica e doen?a renal cr?nica em tratamento por hemodilise.

We seek to understand and explain country level reaction in the initial period of the pandemic. We explore socio-economic and socio-political country characteristics as determinants of deaths per day and we examine whether country characteristics act as moderating factors for different growth patterns of deaths per day over time. The country characteristics include variables about economy, globalization, health care and demography. We examine data published by the European Center of Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) in combination with World Bank data and a webscraping approach. Using a conditional growth model specified as a multilevel regression model with deaths by COVID-19 per day as the outcome variable, we show that economic variables are not significantly associated with decrease or increase of deaths by COVID-19. In contrast, variables about national health care mitigate the impact of the pandemic. Demography shows expected effects with an increase of growth of deaths in countries with a higher percentage of people older than 65 years. Globalization predicts the death toll as well: Social interaction between people is deadly on a short-term scale (in the form of tourism).

Risk factors for AKI requiring dialysis (AKI-D) are not fully understood. We aimed to identify risk factors associated with AKI-D and AKI not requiring dialysis (AKI-ND). Methods We reviewed electronic health records of 3186 patients aged 18 years old who were hospitalized with COVID-19 across six hospitals. Patient characteristics, urinalysis findings, and inflammatory markers were analyzed for association with in-hospital AKI status (AKI-D, AKI-ND, or no AKI), and we subsequently evaluated mortality. Results After adjustment for multiple covariates, higher baseline eGFR was associated with 30% lower odds of AKI-D and 11% lower odds of AKI-ND (for AKI-D, OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.77; for AKI-ND, OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.85 to 0.92). Patients with obesity and those who were Latino had increased odds of AKI-D, whereas patients with congestive heart failure or diabetes with complications had increased odds of AKI-ND. Females had lower odds of in-hospital AKI (for AKI-D, OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.46; for AKI-ND, OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.99). After adjustment for covariates and baseline eGFR, 1-4+ protein on initial urinalysis was associated with a nine-fold increase in odds of AKI-D (OR, 9.00; 95% CI, 2.16 to 37.38) and more than two-fold higher odds of AKI-ND (OR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.66 to 3.13). Findings of 1-3+ blood and trace glucose on initial urinalysis were also associated with increased odds of both AKI-D and AKI-ND. AKI-D and AKI-ND were associated with in-hospital death (for AKI-D, OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.13 to 6.17; for AKI-ND, OR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.77 to 3.35). Conclusions Active urine sediments, even after adjustment for baseline kidney function, and reduced baseline eGFR are significantly associated with increased odds of AKI-D and AKI-ND.

Personality traits were assessed using measures of the Big Five personality traits and greed. They also responded to measures of tendencies to hoard essential and countermeasure products during the COVID-19 pandemic. Correlation analysis revealed that Extraversion, Neuroticism, Openness, and dispositional greed were positively associated with hoarding behavior. Multiple regression analysis revealed that individuals with high Agreeableness, Neuroticism, Openness, and dispositional greed tended to hoard products. The present findings suggest that personality traits account for behavioral responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan.

OBJECTIVE To assess the time-outcome relationship within reperfusion grades in the North American Solitaire Acute Stroke registry. METHODS We identified patients given ET for anterior circulation ischemic stroke within 8 h from onset and in whom reperfusion was achieved. Together with clinical and outcome data, site-adjudicated modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Ischemia (TICI) was recorded. We assessed the impact of time to reperfusion (onset to procedure completion time) on good outcome (modified Rankin Scale 0-2 at 3 months) in patients who achieved TICI 2 or higher reperfusion in multivariable models. We further assessed this relationship within strata of reperfusion grades. A p<0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS Independent predictors of good outcome at 3 months among those achieving TICI 2a reperfusion (n=188) were initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (adjusted OR=0.90, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.95), symptomatic hemorrhage (adj.

Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement flourished in the summer of 2020 as protests against police brutality and racial injustice. However, the extent to which individuals discrimination experiences and associated mental health outcomes change amid a global pandemic and a dramatic societal movement in American society remains unknown. This study examines the dynamic relationship of racism and/or Covid-19-related discrimination with changes in mental health in the context of BLM and Covid-19. Data were from U.S. adults (age 18) who completed the online Understanding Coronavirus in America survey in June and September of 2020 (n=3,502). Respondents were asked to attribute their discrimination experience to 8 main reasons: (1) Covid-19; (2) national origin/race/skin color; (3) gender/sexual orientation; (4) age; (5) physical feature; (6) education/income; (7) health condition; and (8) religion/other. Quasi-Poisson regression models examined the associations between discrimination and anxiety/depression/stress. Results indicated about 33% of respondents reported discrimination in June compared to 21% in September. Racism was significantly associated with more anxiety/depression/stress in June, but not in September or in the longitudinal trend. Covid-19-related discrimination was associated with elevated levels of anxiety/depression/stress in September and in the longitudinal trend, but not in June 2020. We concluded that individuals discrimination experiences are shaped by societal contexts. Specifically, racism was the dominant discrimination attribution in June 2020 when BLM was at its peak.

Methods: this was a comparative cross-sectional study, using data obtained through an online survey of 1,345 Cameroonians amongst which were 828 urban and 517 rural dwellers. The survey questionnaire consisted of; demographic characteristics, 10 questions on Knowledge, 4 on attitudes and 3 on practices. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 25. Results: overall, about two-thirds of participants had correct knowledge of COVID-19. The mean knowledge score for urban dwellers was about twice that of rural dwellers (15.77  5.25 vs 8.86  7.24 respectively, p < 0.001). Furthermore, when compared to people who live in urban areas, rural inhabitants are less optimistic about COVID-19 pandemic in Cameroon (OR = 3.43, P<0.001), less likely to accept a trial vaccine for COVID-19 (OR = 1.14, P<0.05), less likely to avoid going to crowded places (OR = 7.42, P<0.01), less likely to wear face mask outdoor (OR = 11.84, P<0,001), and less likely to practice hand hygiene (OR = 1.13, P<0.05).

Segmentation approaches partition the population based on demographics, long-term conditions (LTCs) or healthcare utilisation but have mostly been applied to adults. Our study uses segmentation methods to distinguish patterns of healthcare utilisation in children and young people (CYP) and to explore predictors of segment membership. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Routinely collected primary and secondary healthcare data in Northwest London from the Discover database. PARTICIPANTS: 378 309 CYP aged 0C15 years registered to a general practice in Northwest London with 1 full year of follow-up. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Assignment of each participant to a segment defined by seven healthcare variables representing primary and secondary care attendances, and description of utilisation patterns by segment. Predictors of segment membership described by age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation and LTCs. RESULTS: Participants were grouped into six segments based on healthcare utilisation. Three segments predominantly used primary care, two moderate utilisation segments differed in use of emergency or elective care, and a high utilisation segment, representing 16 632 (4.4%) children accounted for the highest mean presentations across all service types. The two smallest segments, representing 13.3% of the population, accounted for 62.5% of total costs. Younger age, residence in areas of higher deprivation and the presence of one or more LTCs were associated with membership of higher utilisation segments, but 75.0% of those in the highest utilisation segment had no LTC. CONCLUSIONS: This article identifies six segments of healthcare utilisation in CYP and predictors of segment membership. Demographics and LTCs may not explain utilisation patterns as strongly as in adults, which may limit the use of routine data in predicting utilisation and suggest children have less well-defined trajectories of service use than adults.","output":"Patterns of healthcare utilisation in children and young people: a retrospective cohort study using routinely collected healthcare data in Northwest London"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A significant knowledge gap exists for the management of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

METHODS: We examined CPGs and UpToDate point-of-care resources on the management of critically ill COVID-19 patients that had been published as of 30 April 2020 and compared them against the CPG by the WHO. The main outcome was the rate of consistency among CPGs for the management of critically ill COVID-19 patients. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by excluding recommendation statements that were described as insufficient evidence and by excluding single CPGs one at a time. RESULTS: Thirteen reference recommendations derived from the CPG of the WHO were generated using discrete and unambiguous specifications of the population, intervention, and comparison states. Across CPGs, the rate of consistency in direction with the WHO is 7.7%. When insufficient evidence codings were excluded, the rate of consistency increased substantially to 61.5%. The results of a leave-one-out sensitivity analysis suggested that the UpToDate recommendation source could explain the inconsistency. Consistency in direction rates changed by an absolute 23.1% (from 1/13 (7.7%) to 4/13 (30.8%)) if UpToDate was removed.

Methods: This paper evaluates the manufacturing approach of the nodule, exploring several iterations of the nodule prototype. Experiments were performed on nodule prototypes of varying wall thicknesses in order to evaluate its effect on stiffness and deformation. Results and Conclusions: Experimental results showed that nodule top and bottom wall thickness had a significant effect on the stiffness and deformation of the nodule. The higher the thickness of the top hemisphere and the lower the thickness of the bottom hemisphere, the greater the stiffness the nodule can achieve. Similarly, the display shape of the nodule can be maintained with minimal or no deformation if the nodule top hemisphere thickness is optimally higher than bottom hemisphere thickness.","output":"Feasibility Study and Experimental Evaluation of the Design of Nodule Prototype Developed for Palpation Display Apparatus: A Novel Device for Contactless Primary Tactile Diagnosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In November 2021, Omicron, discovered in Botswana1 and classified as the fifth variant of concern (VOC)2, 3 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on November 26, 2021, the most mutated variant of SARS-CoV-2, has now circulated in 150 countries/territories until January 8, 2022, with 552,191 confirmed cases and causing 115 deaths4.

Interventions had the aim of reducing close proximity interactions, which drive the spread of the disease. A deeper knowledge of human physical interactions has revealed necessary, especially in all settings involving children, whose education and gathering activities should be preserved. Despite their relevance, almost no data are available on close proximity contacts among children in schools or other educational settings during the pandemic. Contact data are usually gathered via Bluetooth, which nonetheless offers a low temporal and spatial resolution. Recently, ultra-wideband (UWB) radios emerged as a more accurate alternative that nonetheless exhibits a significantly higher energy consumption, limiting in-field studies. In this paper, we leverage a novel approach, embodied by the Janus system that combines these radios by exploiting their complementary benefits. The very accurate proximity data gathered in-field by Janus, once augmented with several metadata, unlocks unprecedented levels of information, enabling the development of novel multi-level risk analyses. By means of this technology, we have collected real contact data of children and educators in three summer camps during summer 2020 in the province of Trento, Italy.

The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence and incidence of viral genome detection by qPCR in the equine airways, and their association with respiratory clinical signs. METHODS: Both NS and tracheal washes (TW) were collected monthly on 52 Standardbred racehorses at training, over 27 consecutive months (581 samples). Equid herpesviruses (EHV)-1, ?4, ?2 and ?5, equine rhinitis virus-A and -B (ERBV), equine adenovirus-1 and ?2, equine coronavirus and equine influenza virus were systematically investigated in both NS and TW. Nasal discharge, coughing, tracheal mucus score and TW neutrophil proportions were simultaneously recorded. RESULTS: Genome for 7/10 viruses were detected at least once throughout the study; up to 4 different viruses being also concomitantly detected. Monthly incidence in TW was respectively 27.9% (EHV-5), 24.8% (EHV-2), 7.1% (ERBV), 3.8% (EHV-4), 1.9% (EAdV1) and 0.2% (EHV-1; ERAV). Neither agreement nor correlation between NS and TW was found for respectively genome detection and viral loads. Detection of viral genome in NS was not associated with any clinical sign. Coughing was significantly associated with TW detection of EHV-2 DNA (OR 3.1; P = 0.01) and ERBV RNA (OR 5.3; P < 0.001). Detection of EHV-2 DNA in TW was also significantly associated with excess tracheal mucus (OR 2.1; P = 0.02).

However, the literature on the attitudes of nursing staff regarding person-centered care is limited. The objective of this study is to explore the association between staff characteristics (age, education level, years of work experience and function, i.e., care or welfare) and staff attitudes toward perceived person-centered care provision and including informal caregivers in the caregiving process in residential care facilities. METHODS: A convenience sample of 68 care staff - nurses and nurse assistants - welfare staff members - activity counselors, hostesses, and living room caretakers - of two residential care facilities filled out a questionnaire. Staff attitudes regarding perceived person-centered care were measured with the Person-centered Care Assessment Tool (P-CAT). Staff attitudes regarding informal care provision were measured with the Attitudes Toward Families Checklist (AFC). Multiple linear regression analysis explored the association between variables age, work experience, education, and function (care or welfare). RESULTS: A higher age of staff was associated with a more negative attitude toward perceived person-centered care and informal care provision. Welfare staff had a more negative attitude toward the inclusion of informal caregivers than care staff. The perceived person-centered care provision of the care and welfare staff was both positive. Work experience and education were not associated with perceived person-centered care provision or informal care provision. CONCLUSION: This study is one of the first to provide insight into the association between staff characteristics and their attitude toward their perceived person-centered care provision and informal care provision. A higher age of both the care and welfare staff was associated with a more negative attitude toward their perceived person-centered care and informal care provision. Welfare staff had a less positive attitude toward informal care provision. Additionally, future studies, also observational studies and interview studies, are necessary to collect evidence on the reasons for negative attitudes of older staff members towards PCC and informal care giving, to be able to adequately target these reasons by implementing interventions that eliminate or reduce these negative attitudes.","output":"How staff characteristics influence residential care facility staff's attitude toward person-centered care and informal care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Under-5 mortality remains high in developing nations despite decades of multilateral cooperation to reduce it. Diarrhoea contributes up to 15% of all mortality in this age group. Frequently reported barriers include poor hygiene, lack of sanitation facilities, and negligible public health education on the issue. Interventions such as Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) could complement modern public health approaches with renewed vigour in wake of SARS-CoV-II (COVID-19). Aims: We sought to assess maternal hand hygiene and ability to prepare oral rehydration solution at home. Methods: In addition to the ability to prepare oral rehydration solution at home, this cross-sectional study, carried out at the Sughra Shafi Medical Complex, Narowal during 2017, compared knowledge, attitudes and behaviours of mothers of children with diarrhoea to those shoes children did not have diarrhoea. Results: 511 (48%) children < 5 years were diagnosed with diarrhoea irrespective of household location.

Intravenous administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator given within 4.5 hours is now standard treatment for this condition. Percutaneous vascular interventions use an intra-arterial, mechanical approach for thrombus disruption or removal (thrombectomy). Recent randomised trials indicate that percutaneous vascular interventions are superior to usual care (usual care usually included intravenous thrombolysis). However, intravenous thrombolysis was usually given in both arms of the trial and there was a lack of direct comparison of percutaneous vascular interventions with intravenous thrombolysis. OBJECTIVES To assess the effectiveness and safety of percutaneous vascular interventions compared with intravenous thrombolytic treatment for acute ischaemic stroke. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last search: August 2018). In addition, in September 2017, we searched the following electronic databases: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and Science Citation Index; and Stroke Trials Registry, and US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that directly compared a percutaneous vascular intervention with intravenous thrombolytic treatment in people with acute ischaemic stroke. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors applied the inclusion criteria, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We obtained both published and unpublished data. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS We included four trials with 450 participants. Data on functional outcome and death at end of follow-up were available for 443 participants from three trials. Compared with intravenous thrombolytic therapy, percutaneous vascular intervention did not improve the proportion of participants with good functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0 to 2, risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 1.25, P = 0.92). The quality of evidence was low (outcome assessment was blinded, but not the treating physician or participants). At the end of follow-up, there was a non-significant increase in the proportion of participants who died in the percutaneous vascular intervention group (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.84 to 2.14, P = 0.21). The quality of evidence was low (wide confidence interval). There was no difference in the proportion of participants with symptomatic intracranial haemorrhages between the intervention and control groups (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.95, P = 0.97). The quality of evidence was low (wide confidence interval). Data on vascular status (recanalisation rate) were only available for seven participants from one trial; we considered this inadequate for statistical analyses. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS The present review directly compared intravenous thrombolytic treatment with percutaneous vascular interventions for ischaemic stroke. We found no evidence from RCTs that percutaneous vascular interventions are superior to intravenous thrombolytic treatment with respect to functional outcome. Quality of evidence was low (outcome assessment was blinded, but not the treating physician or participants). New trials with adequate sample sizes are warranted because of the rapid development of new techniques and devices for such interventions.","output":"Percutaneous vascular interventions versus intravenous thrombolytic treatment for acute ischaemic stroke."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The past year has shown that obesity is a risk factor for severe complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Excess fat mass during obesity is known to be a risk factor for chronic diseases but also for severe infections and infectious complications. We have focused here on the elements responsible for this particular susceptibility to infections and more specifically to COVID-19. Excess fat is, in itself, responsible for alterations of the immune system by disrupting the production and function of immune cells. Indeed, hypertrophic adipocytes produce more pro-inflammatory adipokines (including cytokines). The increase in their apoptosis induces a release of pro-inflammatory compounds into the circulation and a recruitment of pro-inflammatory macrophages into the adipose tissue. A chronic systemic inflammatory state is then observed. In addition, diet, apart from its role in the development of adipose tissue, can also affect the immune system, with excess simple sugars and saturated fats exerting pro-inflammatory effects. This inflammation, the adipokines released by the adipocytes, and the infiltration of lipids into the lymphoid organs affects the production of immune cells and, directly, the functions of these cells. The alteration of the immune system increases the risk of infection as well as complications, including secondary bacterial infections and septic states, and increases infection-related mortality. During COVID-19, the chronic inflammatory state promotes the cytokine shock, characteristic of severe forms, caused in particular by excessive activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Furthermore, in obese subjects, the already present endothelial dysfunction will render endothelial inflammation (endotheliitis) due to viral infiltration all the more severe. Added to this is a state of hypercoagulability and a decrease in respiratory capacity, leading to a risk of severe COVID-19 with cardiovascular complications, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and disseminated intravascular coagulation, which can lead to multiple organ failure and even death.","output":"Obesity, Nutrients and the Immune System in the Era of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epidemiology models are central in understanding and controlling large scale pandemics.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study, using a self-administrative questionnaire adapted from the Thai Health and Welfare Survey (HWS), was conducted in 2019. URAS were randomly selected from the register of the Bangkok Refugee Center. One hundred and eighty-one URAS participated in the survey. The data were combined with 2941 Thai records from the HWS. The population scope was confined to Bangkok. Bivariate analysis by Chi-square, Fishers exact, and MannCWhitney U-tests was conducted to examine difference in demographic and access to NCD services between URAS and Thais. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with access to NCD services. RESULTS: Overall, URAS were young, less educated, and poorer than Thais. The trend of NCDs was similar to the Thai population, except mental health disorders appeared to be more prevalent in URAS. Almost half of the URAS did not receive any formal treatment. Being insured, abiding with Buddhism, and living in more affluent households were factors associated with better access to NCD services. URAS from Asian countries had greater access to NCD care than those from non-Asian countries.

However, the powerful spectral representation in the field of image processing is rarely considered in these models. METHODS: In this work, we propose to introduce frequency representation into convolution neural networks (CNNs) and design a novel model, tKFC-Net, to combine powerful feature representation in both frequency and spatial domains. Through the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operation, frequency representation is employed on pooling, upsampling, and convolution without any adjustments to the network architecture. Furthermore, we replace original convolution with twin-Kernel Fourier Convolution (t-KFC), a new designed convolution layer, to specify the convolution kernels for particular functions and extract features from different frequency components. RESULTS: We experimentally show that our method has an edge over other models in the task of medical image segmentation. Evaluated on four datasets-skin lesion segmentation (ISIC 2018), retinal blood vessel segmentation (DRIVE), lung segmentation (COVID-19-CT-Seg), and brain tumor segmentation (BraTS 2019), the proposed model achieves outstanding results: the metric F1-Score is 0.878 for ISIC 2018, 0.8185 for DRIVE, 0.9830 for COVID-19-CT-Seg, and 0.8457 for BraTS 2019.

Visual hypnotic hallucinations differ in many ways from regular mental images. For example, they are usually experienced as automatic, vivid, and real images, typically compromising the sense of reality. While both hypnotic hallucination and mental imagery are believed to mainly rely on the activation of the visual cortex via top-down mechanisms, it is unknown how they differ in the neural processes they engage. Here we used an adaptation paradigm to test and compare top-down processing between hypnotic hallucination, mental imagery, and visual perception in very highly hypnotisable individuals whose ability to hallucinate was assessed. By measuring the N170/VPP event-related complex and using multivariate decoding analysis, we found that hypnotic hallucination of faces involves greater top-down activation of sensory processing through lateralised neural mechanisms in the right hemisphere compared to mental imagery. Our findings suggest that the neural signatures that distinguish hypnotically hallucinated faces from imagined faces lie in the right brain hemisphere.","output":"Beyond imagination: Hypnotic visual hallucination induces greater lateralised brain activity than visual mental imagery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, COVID-19 pandemic is still severe, and the major challenge in the fight against this pandemic is how to early find pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals and to eliminate silent transmission.

MethodsSerological responses were compared after BNT162b2 and AZD1222 vaccination with varying intervals in uninfected and previously-infected adults aged 50-89 years. These findings are evaluated against real-world national vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates against COVID-19 in England. ResultsWe recruited 750 participants aged 50-89 years, including 126 (16.8%) with evidence of previous infection; 421 received BNT162b2 and 329 and AZD1222. For both vaccines, over 95% had seroconverted 35-55 days after dose one, and 100% seroconverted 7+ days after dose 2. Following a 65-84 day interval between two doses, geometric mean titres (GMTs) at 14-34 days were 6-fold higher for BNT162b2 (6703; 95%CI, 5887-7633) than AZD1222 (1093; 806-1483), which in turn were higher than those receiving BNT162b2 19-29 days apart (694; 540 - 893). For both vaccines, VE was higher across all age-groups from 14 days after dose two compared to one dose, but the magnitude varied with interval between doses.

It is unclear how educators can best prepare trainees for this professional obligation. We sought to assess medical students attitudes toward advocacy, including activities and issues of interest, and to determine congruence with professional obligations. METHODS: A cross-sectional, web-based survey probed U.S. medical students attitudes around 7 medical issues (e.g. nutrition/obesity, addiction) and 11 determinants of health (e.g. housing, transportation). Descriptive statistics, Kruskal-Wallis tests, and regression analysis investigated associations with demographic characteristics. RESULTS: Of 240 students completing the survey, 53% were female; most were white (62%) or Asian (28%). Most agreed it is very important that physicians encourage medical organizations to advocate for public health (76%) and provide health-related expertise to the community (57%). More participants rated advocacy for medical issues as very important, compared to issues with indirect connections to health (p < 0.001). Generally, liberals and non-whites were likelier than others to value advocacy. CONCLUSIONS: Medical students reported strong interest in advocacy, particularly around health issues, consistent with professional standards. Many attitudes were associated with political affiliation and race. To optimize future physician advocacy, educators should provide opportunities for learning and engagement in issues of interest.

We defined poor outcome as a score on the modified Rankin Scale score of 3. The association between collateral score and clinical outcome at 3 months was analyzed with Poisson regression. The prognostic value of collateral scoring with dynamic CTA and single-phase CTA in addition to age, stroke severity, and noncontrast CT was assessed with logistic regression and summarized with the area under the curve. RESULTS Seventy patients were included, with a mean age of 68 years. We observed an increased risk of poor outcome in patients with poor collaterals on single-phase CTA (risk ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-3.1) and on dynamic CTA (risk ratio, 2.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-2.7).

One such change is the alteration of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism and formation of eicosanoids. This study explores the changes in AA metabolites formed through the cytochrome P450 mediated pathway to epoxyeicosatrienoic (EET), dihydroxyeicosatrienoic (DHET), and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic (HETE) acids which have been implicated in blood pressure regulation and inflammatory responses that are important for a healthy pregnancy. MAIN METHODS: The study determines circulating levels of EETs, DHETs and HETEs extracted from erythrocyte membranes and measured by mass spectroscopy during the progression of a normal pregnancy. Blood samples, from 25 women, were collected at three time points including 25-28a?weeks gestation, 28-32a?weeks gestation, and the non-pregnant control at 3-4a?months postpartum. KEY FINDINGS: Results demonstrate that healthy pregnancy is associated with significant increases in 8,9-DHET, 11,12-DHET and 14,15-DHET and a decrease in trans 8,9-EET during 28-32a?weeks gestation compared to 3-4a?months postpartum. These differences are likely due to several mechanisms including an increase in soluble epoxide hydrolase activity, a decrease in glutathione conjugation, and altered cytochrome P450 enzyme expression and/or activity that occurs during pregnancy. SIGNIFICANCE: Metabolism of AA through the cytochrome P450 pathway generates physiologically important eicosanoids that could play an important role in the progression of a healthy pregnancy.

The aim of this study was to determine the extent of disagreement between the Bispectral Index (BIS) and the WAVCNS index during propofol-based and sevoflurane-based maintenance of general anesthesia in a routine surgical population. METHODS Patients undergoing elective surgery were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to receive either propofol or sevoflurane for the maintenance of anesthesia and remifentanil in both groups. Anesthesiologists were blinded to monitors in both groups. Discordance between the 2 monitors was assessed by the count of discrepancy in recommendation (DR) (type 1 defined as one parameter <40 and the other >60, or type 2 defined as BIS and WAVCNS values on different sides of a threshold [40 or 60]) and also by the proportion of agreement (P0) between WAVCNS and BIS, obtained every 5 seconds, in 3 categories of index (<40, 40-60, and >60). RESULTS The analyzed data set consisted of 22 patients (36,872 data pairs) in the propofol group and 24 patients (32,826 data pairs) in the sevoflurane group. The type 1 DR rarely occurred in both the groups (<1%); however, the median (interquartile range) type 2 DR was significantly more frequent in the propofol group (20.6% [7.0-36.9] vs 4.5% [2.3-12.4]; P = 0.0005).

Based on both a shift-share analysis and a simulation analysis, the paper shows that the reallocation towards higher value-added sectors in Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries could in fact lead to higher regional inequalities.

However, current understanding of treatment outcomes in patients with isolated proximal ureteral stones is limited. Therefore, we performed a prospective, multi-institutional study of ureteroscopic management of proximal ureteral stones smaller than 2 cm to better define clinical outcomes associated with this approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS Adult patients with proximal ureteral calculi smaller than 2 cm were prospectively identified. Patients with concomitant ipsilateral renal calculi or prior ureteral stenting were excluded from study. Flexible ureteroscopy, holmium laser lithotripsy and ureteral stent placement was performed. Ureteral access sheath use, laser settings and other details of perioperative and postoperative management were based on individual surgeon preference. Stone clearance was determined by the results of renal ultrasound and plain x-ray of the kidneys, ureters and bladder 4 to 6 weeks postoperatively. RESULTS Of 71 patients 44 (62%) were male and 27 (38%) were female. Mean age was 48.2 years. ASA(?) score was 1 in 12 cases (16%), 2 in 41 (58%), 3 in 16 (23%) and 4 in 2 (3%). Mean body mass index was 31.8 kg/m(2), mean stone size was 7.4 mm (range 5 to 15) and mean operative time was 60.3 minutes (range 15 to 148). Intraoperative complications occurred in 2 patients (2.8%), including mild ureteral trauma. Postoperative complications developed in 6 patients (8.7%), including urinary tract infection in 3, urinary retention in 2 and flash pulmonary edema in 1. The stone-free rate was 95% and for stones smaller than 1 cm it was 100%.

SETTING: Data were obtained from the Influenza Epidemiological Surveillance System in Mexico database. PARTICIPANTS: 32 663 cases of influenza in people aged 20 years with a confirmed case of influenza-like illness, severe respiratory infection and/or influenza death were investigated. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Influenza deaths, hospitalisation frequency and the impact on hospitalisation and/or death due to influenza by the SAH variate alone and in combination with diabetes, obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease and/or smoking, and by vaccination status were assessed. RESULTS: The hospitalisation frequency increased with age.

Careful antigen selection during development is always of utmost importance for the production of effective vaccines that do not compromise recipient safety. This holds especially true for SARS-CoV vaccines, as several immunopathological disorders are associated with the activity of structural and nonstructural proteins encoded in the virus's genetic material. Whole viral protein and RNA-encoding full-length proteins contain both protective and \\"dangerous\\" sequences, unless pathological fragments are deleted. In light of recent advances, peptide vaccines may present a very safe and effective alternative. Peptide vaccines can avoid immunopathological pro-inflammatory sequences, focus immune responses on neutralizing immunogenic epitopes, avoid off-target antigen loss, combine antigens with different protective roles or mechanisms, even from different viral proteins, and avoid mutant escape by employing highly conserved cryptic epitopes. In this review, an attempt is made to exploit the similarities between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in vaccine antigen screening, with particular attention to the pathological and immunogenic properties of SARS proteins.","output":"Key Considerations for the Development of Safe and Effective SARS-CoV-2 Subunit Vaccine: A Peptide-Based Vaccine Alternative"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic profoundly impacted health care utilization.

We classified the patients according to the presence and number of damaged organs (heart, liver, and kidney). RESULTS: The percentage of patients with no, one, two, or three organs affected was 59.75%, 30.46%, 8.07%, and 1.72%, respectively. With the increasing number of OI, there is a tendency of gradual increase regarding the white blood cell counts, neutrophil counts, levels of C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, and fibrinogen as well as the incidence of most complications. In a Cox regression model, individuals with OI, old age, and an abnormal level of C-reactive protein were at a higher risk of death compared with those without.

Prior work focused on predicting the immediate future of a story, such as one to a few sentences ahead. However, when novelists write long stories, generating a few sentences is not enough to help them gain high-level insight to develop the follow-up story. In this paper, we formulate a long story as a sequence of\\"story blocks,\\"where each block contains a fixed number of sentences (e.g., 10, 100, or 200). This formulation allows us to predict the follow-up story arc beyond the scope of a few sentences. We represent a story block using the term frequencies (TF) of semantic frames in it, normalized by each frame's inverse document frequency (IDF). We conduct semantic frame forecast experiments on 4,794 books from the Bookcorpus and 7,962 scientific abstracts from CODA-19, with block sizes ranging from 5 to 1,000 sentences. The results show that automated models can forecast the follow-up story blocks better than the random, prior, and replay baselines, indicating the task's feasibility. We also learn that the models using the frame representation as features outperform all the existing approaches when the block size is over 150 sentences.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Willing respondents, who are working in the institute, were administered the questionnaire asking their views on knowledge, beliefs, and reasons for hesitancy regarding Covid-19 immunization. A Likert scale was used to quantify the responses regarding participants knowledge, beliefs, and hesitancies regarding immunization with the available vaccines. Data were analyzed using MS office Excel sheets and JASP software was used to analyze the data thus obtained. RESULTS: Out of 122 complete responses, we had 73 (60%) doctors, while 30 (24%) were nursing staff, the rest comprised of other health care workers, such as housekeeping staff, janitorial, etc., 66 (54%) respondents were unaware, while 25 (20%) respondents had hesitancy and 23 (18%) were having extremely negative views regarding vaccination.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Initially, all SOAIC was performed with intention to treat using a standard selective OA (microcatheter) infusion technique (sSOAIC). Temporary balloon occlusion (TBO) of the external carotid artery (ECA), a balloon-assisted SOAIC (bSOAIC) technique, was performed only if OA angiography did not show robust and sustained anterograde OA flow. In our more recent experience, all SOAIC was performed with intention to treat by bSOAIC. Verapamil infusion into the OA and internal carotid artery was performed in selected cases. Technical success was defined as delivery of chemotherapeutic agent(s) into the OA with robust and sustained anterograde perfusion. sSOAIC was considered to have failed if converted to bSOAIC. RESULTS 19 eyes were treated in 17 patients (age 5 months to 16 years) between December 2008 and May 2013. Eighty-three procedures were undertaken and the OA was successfully catheterized in all. Technical success was achieved in 35/41 (85%) sSOAIC cases and 42/42 (100%) bSOAIC cases. TBO of the ECA augmented anterograde OA flow and converted all cases of retrograde OA flow to anterograde. Verapamil further augmented anterograde ocular perfusion during SOAIC. There were no access site complications, strokes, or deaths. CONCLUSIONS TBO of the ECA is a safe, effective, and reproducible method for optimizing ocular hemodynamics during SOAIC regardless of baseline OA flow pattern.

This CTB-SAP model allows us to study the impact of motor neuron death on the output of surviving phrenic motor neurons. After 7(d) days of CTB-SAP, phrenic long-term facilitation (pLTF, a form of respiratory plasticity) is enhanced, but returns towards control levels at 28d. However, the mechanism responsible for this difference in magnitude of pLTF is unknown. In na?ve rats, pLTF predominately requires 5-HT2 receptors, the new synthesis of BDNF, and MEK/ERK signaling; however, pLTF can alternatively be induced via A2A receptors, the new synthesis of TrkB, and PI3K/Akt signaling. Since A2A receptor-dependent pLTF is enhanced in na?ve rats, we suggest that 7d CTB-SAP treated rats utilize the alternative mechanism for pLTF. Here, we tested the hypothesis that pLTF following CTB-SAP is: 1) TrkB and PI3K/Akt, not BDNF and MEK/ERK, dependent at 7d; and 2) BDNF and MEK/ERK, not TrkB and PI3K/Akt, dependent at 28d. Adult Sprague Dawley male rats were anesthetized, paralyzed, ventilated, and were exposed to acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH; 3, 5a?min bouts of 10.5% O2) following bilateral, intrapleural injections at 7d and 28d of: 1) CTB-SAP (25a?g), or 2) un-conjugated CTB and SAP (control).

RECENT FINDINGS: A systematic review of the literature using the PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases for the following keywords, Covid-19, SARS-CoV-2, anosmia, olfactory, treatment, and management was performed. While most cases of post-COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction resolve spontaneously within 2 weeks of symptom onset, patients with symptoms that persist past 2 weeks require medical management. The intervention with the greatest degree of supporting evidence is olfactory training, wherein patients are repeatedly exposed to potent olfactory stimuli. To date, no large-scale randomized clinical trials exist that examine the efficacy of pharmacologic therapies for PCOD. Limited clinical trials and prospective controlled trials suggest intranasal corticosteroids and oral corticosteroids may alleviate symptoms. SUMMARY: Olfactory training should be initiated as soon as possible for patients with PCOD. Patients may benefit from a limited intranasal or oral corticosteroid course.

This study aimed to describe genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 by next-generation sequencing (NGS) in a patient with longitudinal follow-up for SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Sequential samples collected between January 29th and February 4th, 2020, from a patient infected by SARS-CoV-2 were used to perform amplification of two genome fragments-including genes encoding spike, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid proteins-and NGS was carried out with Illumina? technology. Phylogenetic analysis was performed with PhyML and viral variant identification with VarScan. RESULTS: Majority consensus sequences were identical in most of the samples (5/7) and differed in one synonymous mutation from the Wuhan reference sequence. We identified 233 variants; each sample harboured in median 38 different minority variants, and only four were shared by different samples. The frequency of mutation was similar between genes and correlated with the length of the gene (r = 0.93, p = 0.0002). Most of mutations were substitution variations (n = 217, 93.1%) and about 50% had moderate or high impact on gene expression. Viral variants also differed between lower and upper respiratory tract samples collected on the same day, suggesting independent sites of replication of SARS-CoV-2.

There is a limited availability of hospital resources in this or any pandemic, and appropriately gauging severity would allow for some patients to safely recover in home quarantine, while ensuring that sicker patients get needed care. Methods We here developed a blood-based generalizable host-gene-expression-based classifier for the severity of viral infections and validated it in multiple viral infection settings including COVID-19. We used training data (N=705) from 21 retrospective transcriptomic clinical studies of influenza and other viral illnesses looking at a preselected panel of host immune mRNAs. Results We selected 6 host mRNAs and trained a logistic regression classifier with a training cross-validation AUROC of 0.90 for predicting 30-day mortality in viral illnesses. Next, in 1,417 samples across 21 independent retrospective validation cohorts the locked 6-mRNA classifier had an AUROC of 0.91 for discriminating patients with severe vs. non-severe infection. Next, in an independent cohort of prospectively enrolled patients with confirmed COVID-19 (N=97) in Athens, Greece, the 6-mRNA locked classifier had an AUROC of 0.89 for identifying patients with severe respiratory failure or 30-day mortality. Finally, we developed an isothermal qRT-LAMP (loop-mediated isothermal gene expression) assay for the 6-mRNA panel to facilitate implementation as a rapid assay. Conclusions With further study, the classifier could assist in the risk assessment of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 to determine severity and level of care, thereby improving patient management and healthcare burden.","output":"A 6-mRNA host response whole-blood classifier trained using patients with non-COVID-19 viral infections accurately predicts severity of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with chronic lung disease are vulnerable to getting severe diseases associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Although two vaccines are available, the vaccination coverage of the equine population is largely insufficient to prevent new EAV outbreaks around the world. In this study, we present a high-throughput in vitro assay suitable for testing candidate antiviral molecules on equine dermal cells infected by EAV. Using this assay, we identified three molecules that impair EAV infection in equine cells: the broad-spectrum antiviral and nucleoside analog ribavirin, and two compounds previously described as inhibitors of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), the fourth enzyme of the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway. These molecules effectively suppressed cytopathic effects associated to EAV infection, and strongly inhibited viral replication and production of infectious particles. Since ribavirin is already approved in human and small animal, and that several DHODH inhibitors are in advanced clinical trials, our results open new perspectives for the management of EAV outbreaks.","output":"Replication of Equine arteritis virus is efficiently suppressed by purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe a stochastic virus evolution model representing genomic diversification and within-host selection during experimental serial passages under cell culture or live-host conditions. The model incorporates realistic descriptions of the virus genotypes in nucleotide and amino acid sequence spaces, as well as their diversification from error-prone replications. It quantitatively considers factors such as target cell number, bottleneck size, passage period, infection and cell death rates, and the replication rate of different genotypes, allowing for systematic examinations of how their changes affect the evolutionary dynamics of viruses during passages. The relative probability for a viral population to achieve adaptation under a new host environment, quantified by the rate with which a target sequence frequency rises above 50%, was found to be most sensitive to factors related to sequence structure (distance from the wild type to the target) and selection strength (host cell number and bottleneck size). For parameter values representative of RNA viruses, the likelihood of observing adaptations during passages became negligible as the required number of mutations rose above two amino acid sites. We modeled the specific adaptation process of influenza A H5N1 viruses in mammalian hosts by simulating the evolutionary dynamics of H5 strains under the fitness landscape inferred from multiple sequence alignments of H3 proteins. In light of comparisons with experimental findings, we observed that the evolutionary dynamics of adaptation is strongly affected not only by the tendency toward increasing fitness values but also by the accessibility of pathways between genotypes constrained by the genetic code.","output":"Quantitative modeling of virus evolutionary dynamics and adaptation in serial passages using empirically inferred fitness landscapes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To study propensity of aerosol and droplet generation during phacoemulsification using high-speed shadowgraphy and quantify its spread amid COVID-19 pandemic.

Standard settings for sculpt and quadrant removal mode were used on Visalis 100 (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG). Microincision and standard phacoemulsification were performed using titanium straight tips (2.2 mm and 2.8 mm in diameter).

The role of CMA in kidney diseases is context-dependent and appears reciprocally with macroautophagy. Among the renal resident cells, the proximal tubule exhibits a high basal level of CMA activity, and restoration of CMA alleviates the aging-related tubular alternations. The level of CMA is up-regulated under conditions of oxidative stress, such as in acute kidney injury, while it is declined in chronic kidney disease and aging-related kidney diseases, leading to the accumulation of oxidized substrates. Suppressed CMA leads to the kidney hypertrophy in diabetes mellitus, and the increase of CMA contributes to the progress and chemoresistance in renal cell carcinoma.

We aimed to evaluate serological response to BNT162b2 vaccine in patients with haematological malignancies by type of treatment. METHODS: Our national prospective cohort study was done in Lithuania and assessed serological response to one and two BNT162b2 (Comirnaty, Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine doses in healthy health-care workers and in patients with haematological malignancies. Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older, had received both vaccine doses, and had available biobanked blood samples from before vaccination and after the second dose. Biobanked samples and health data were obtained from Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos Biobank. Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG Quant II chemiluminescent microparticle assay was used to quantify serum anti-SARS-CoV-2-S1 IgG antibody (anti-S1 IgG antibody) concentrations 0C10 days before the first BNT162b2 vaccine, on the day of second immunisation (around day 21), and 7 to 21 days after the second immunisation. Adverse events were assessed by a standardised questionnaire. Breakthrough infections were characterised clinically and by SARS-CoV-2 genotyping whenever possible. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04871165. FINDINGS: Between Jan 8 and April 21, 2021, 885 participants with haematological malignancies were included in the study. 857 patients were anti-S1 IgG seronegative at timepoint 0 and constituted the main analysis cohort. The age-matched comparison was made between 315 patients with haematological malignancies who were aged 18C60 years and 67 healthy health-care workers in the same age group. Patients aged 18C60 years with haematological malignancies had lower median anti-S1 IgG antibody responses after two BNT162b2 vaccine doses than did health-care workers of the same age group (median 6961 AU/mL [IQR 1292C20 672] vs 21 395 AU/mL [14 831C33 553]; p<00001). Compared with untreated patients with haematological malignancies (n=53; median 5761 AU/mL [629C16 141]), patients actively treated with Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKIs; n=44; 0 AU/mL [0C7]; p<00001), ruxolitinib (n=16; 10 AU/mL [0C45]; p<00001), venetoclax (n=10; 4 AU/mL [0C1218]; p=00005), or anti-CD20 antibody therapy (n=87; 17 AU/mL [1C2319]; p<00001) showed particularly poor anti-S1 IgG antibody responses following two BNT162b2 doses. Patients being treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (n=41; 10 537 AU/mL [IQR 2335C19 388]) or patients who received autologous haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT; n=192; 6203 AU/mL [1451C16 834]) or allogeneic HSCT (n=122; 6304 AU/mL [1120C16 913]) were among the subgroups with the highest numerical responses. Nine SARS-CoV-2 infections and three COVID-19 deaths were observed among fully vaccinated patients with haematological malignancies. INTERPRETATION: Patients with haematological malignancies mount blunted and heterogeneous antibody responses to the full course of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination. Patients who are actively treated with BTKIs, ruxolitinib, venetoclax, or anti-CD20 antibody therapies seem to be the most negatively affected and might be left unprotected from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Breakthrough severe SARS-CoV-2 infections in fully vaccinated patients with haematological malignancies emphasise the importance of ongoing strict adherence to non-pharmacological interventions and household vaccination while SARS-CoV-2 is circulating in the community.

Until August 17, COVID 19 has hit more than 22 million individuals all over the globe. So, it is urged to get clear information about the prevalence of the virus. Therefore, one can manipulate easily a suitable mathematical model to fit these published data. METHODS: We propose a mathematical model that considers the total population, in 25 countries, either infected by COVID 19 or confined (safe) during the period from November 17, 2019, to August 17, 2020. The model considers the total population as a complex number; the imaginary part is the number of infected individuals and the real part is the number of confined individuals. This classification combined with mathematical treatments leads to a transmission dynamics of the virus to be as wave-like motion. The virus can hit any country either by one wave or by successive waves (up to 11 waves). FINDINGS: We find net discrimination between the 25 countries investigated in this report. The immediate response to the first attack is a substantial parameter to determine whether the epidemic attack will be in one wave or it can be in successive waves. For example, the best case was such as individuals in China hit by one wave while the individuals in the USA were attacked by nine waves; it is the worst case all over the globe. In addition, the model differentiates between the daily reproduction numbers (R(d0)) and the median reproduction number (R(0)). We have found that R(d0) decreases exponentially with time from high values down to zero at the wave maximum point; and R(0) varies from a country to another. For example, the virus hit individuals in Germany in R(0) = 1.39 (96% CI 1.01C3.87) and in the USA R(0) = 3.81 (91% CI 1.71C5.15). We have found that twice the virus has hit both the USA and Iran. The great protestation of black matter lives in the USA and the great assemblage of the new Iranian year, on March 21, 2020, have been the cause of the second epidemic attack in both countries. INTERPRETATION: Our results show that COVID 19 transmission depends on the prompt reaction against the first viral-wave. The reaction depends on both the social behaviour of individuals and on the swift system-decision by the governmental decision-maker(s). The Chinese strictly follow the decision-maker and therefore the virus hit by only one wave; while in the USA, the system-decision was different and the American-responses were different, therefore ten waves followed the first wave.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Retrospective cohort study. The coding of all those causes of death by diseases of the respiratory system were regrouped. A descriptive analysis of all deaths and by gender, age, and the 17 Autonomous Communities (CC.AA.) was performed. Also, odds ratios of death in crude and multivariate analysis by logistic regression were estimated. RESULTS In Spain in 2020, 60,358 deaths were attributed to \\"COVID-19 virus identified\\" and another 14,481 to \\"COVID-19 virus not identified (suspicious)\\". Regrouping the specific causes of death, in 2020 the diseases of the respiratory system caused a total of 139,880 deaths, which corresponds to 28.3% of all deaths in Spain. Compared to 2019, an increase of 68.5% was observed. By gender, deaths by diseases of the respiratory system were higher in men (32.0%) than in women (24.6%), although in specific causes the percentage was higher in women with suspected COVID-19, asthma, respiratory insufficiency and other diseases of the respiratory system. Finally, the variables associated with death from COVID-19 in the multivariate analysis were being male, increasing age (maximum at 80 years), completed studies up to secondary level, employed, and single or widowed marital status, although with a marked variation by CC.AA.

Various studies have revealed the negative impact of the pandemic on the education and mental health of medical students and residents. In this study, we aimed to explore the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical interns educational experience, clinical practice, and mental health. We also engage in a discussion on the compensatory methods that have been adopted to improve medical interns learning processes during the ongoing pandemic. Methods This cross-sectional survey-based study was conducted at the King Saud University Medical City (KSUMC) in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) from March to October 2020. The participants consisted of medical interns. The survey collected information on participants demographics, training, and the educational and psychological impact of the pandemic. Results The survey was distributed to 480 medical interns, of whom 345 (71.8%) participated. Most of our sample (75.6%) believed that the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted their cumulative experience. Regarding the pandemics impact on training and education, it was found that the emergency department rotation was the most affected rotation (60.3%). The majority of the participants (55.9%) believed that all tracks have received equal education and the volume of patients seen by interns decreased by 91.9%. As for the compensatory methods, 73.3% reported the utilization of remote platforms. Regarding the pandemics mental health impact, 36% believed that it has affected their mental health, where increased stress levels were noticed in 47.8% of participants. Statistical significance was found in both Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scores, which indicated that during the pandemic, 20.6% of the participants suffered from depression, and 13.9% had moderate to severe anxiety. Conclusions This study highlights the negative educational and psychological impact of COVID-19 on medical interns.

(OM-85, Vifor Pharma; CH) was able to downregulate the expression of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) on epithelial cells. This downregulation was also associated with a reduced infectivity of cells, resulting in a reduced viral titre. We evaluated whether another bacterial lysate (Lantigen B, Bruschettini Ltd; Italy) may have similar activities. However, while OM-85 is given per os and has a systemic effect after absorption at the gut level, Lantigen B is given locoregionally. Thus, the concentration that the bacterial lysate can reach at the mucosal level seems to be promising. MethodsOropharyngeal cells were collected from healthy donors. After 24 hours of treatment in vitro with doses of Lantigen B comparable to those that are reached in vivo, the expression of ACE2 was evaluated by direct fluorescence and flow cytometry. ResultsA reduction in the number of ACE2-positive cells was observed in 80% of treated samples. Only a few donors had poor expression of ACE2, and in these donors, the downregulation was less evident or absent.

PRRs typically recognize microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) that are usually widely conserved, some even across kingdoms. Here, we report an oomycete-specific family of small secreted cysteine-rich (SCR) proteins that displays divergent patterns of sequence variation in the Irish potato famine pathogen Phytophthora infestans A subclass that includes the conserved effector PcF from Phytophthora cactorum activates immunity in a wide range of plant species. In contrast, the more diverse SCR74 subclass is specific to P. infestans and tends to trigger immune responses only in a limited number of wild potato genotypes. The SCR74 response was recently mapped to a G-type lectin receptor kinase (G-LecRK) locus in the wild potato Solanum microdontum subsp. gigantophyllum. The G-LecRK locus displays a high diversity in Solanum host species compared to other solanaceous plants. We propose that the diversification of the SCR74 proteins in P. infestans is driven by a fast coevolutionary arms race with cell surface immune receptors in wild potato, which contrasts the presumed slower dynamics between conserved apoplastic effectors and PRRs. Understanding the molecular determinants of plant immune responses to these divergent molecular patterns in oomycetes is expected to contribute to deploying multiple layers of disease resistance in crop plants.IMPORTANCE Immune receptors at the plant cell surface can recognize invading microbes. The perceived microbial molecules are typically widely conserved and therefore the matching surface receptors can detect a broad spectrum of pathogens. Here we describe a family of Phytophthora small extracellular proteins that consists of conserved subfamilies that are widely recognized by solanaceous plants. Remarkably, one subclass of SCR74 proteins is highly diverse, restricted to the late blight pathogen Phytophthora infestans and is specifically detected in wild potato plants. The diversification of this subfamily exhibits signatures of a coevolutionary arms race with surface receptors in potato. Insights into the molecular interaction between these potato-specific receptors and the recognized Phytophthora proteins are expected to contribute to disease resistance breeding in potato.","output":"Divergent Evolution of PcF/SCR74 Effectors in Oomycetes Is Associated with Distinct Recognition Patterns in Solanaceous Plants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Tuft cells residing in the intestinal epithelium have diverse functions. In the small intestine, they provide protection against inflammation, combat against helminth and protist infections, and serve as entry portals for enteroviruses. In the colon, they had been implicated in tumourigenesis. Commitment of intestinal progenitor cells to the tuft cell lineage requires Rho GTPase Cell Division Cycle 42 (CDC42), a Rho GTPase that acts downstream of the epidermal growth factor receptor and wingless-related integration site signalling cascades, and the master transcription factor POU class 2 homeobox 3 (POU2F3). This study investigates how this pathway is regulated by the DEAD box containing RNA binding protein DDX5 in vivo. DESIGN: We assessed the role of DDX5 in tuft cell specification and function in control and epithelial cell-specific Ddx5 knockout mice (DDX5IEC) using transcriptomic approaches. RESULTS: DDX5IEC mice harboured a loss of intestinal tuft cell populations, modified microbial repertoire, and altered susceptibilities to ileal inflammation and colonic tumourigenesis. Mechanistically, DDX5 promotes CDC42 protein synthesis through a post-transcriptional mechanism to license tuft cell specification. Importantly, the DDX5-CDC42 axis is parallel but distinct from the known interleukin-13 circuit implicated in tuft cell hyperplasia, and both pathways augment Pou2f3 expression in secretory lineage progenitors. In mature tuft cells, DDX5 not only promotes integrin signalling and microbial responses, it also represses gene programmes involved in membrane transport and lipid metabolism. CONCLUSION: RNA binding protein DDX5 directs tuft cell specification and function to regulate microbial repertoire and disease susceptibility in the intestine.","output":"RNA binding protein DDX5 directs tuft cell specification and function to regulate microbial repertoire and disease susceptibility in the intestine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: COVID-19, the new pandemic faced by the world, is a novel betacoronavirus causing severe respiratory coronavirus syndrome. Elderly patients, people with underlying chronic illnesses, cancer patients, and those who are immunocompromised are at higher risk and account for higher mortality rate. Unfortunately, there is no approved medication for treatment, till date, thereby supporting triage management and difficult decision-making. Thus, there should be a substantial increase in the palliative care in times of pandemic. There should be an increase in the availability of palliative care services in different care settings. Due to a surge in the number of cases of COVID-19, it has been reported on how palliative care is being delayed, discontinued, or deprioritized. Aim: The aim of this study is to evaluate the barriers occurring in providing the palliative care to the patients with nonmalignant illness. Methodology: A questionnaire was designed after studying previous work over palliative care and pandemic crisis and was distributed among the physicians, surgeons, and the residents; a total of 95 health-care workers were involved. The survey was done through mails. The response then was evaluated and analyzed. Results: As seen by the responses we got from the health-care workers, the main issue is the nonavailability of the personal protective equipment during this pandemic. Keeping the current scenario in mind, regarding COVID-19, the patients are at fear of coming to the hospital at first place, and even if they come then the fear of being alone haunts them. One of the biggest fears of the patient is dying alone, without being in contact with their loved ones. Conclusion: Palliative care should be an essential part of any health-care service in any humanitarian crisis, including the COVID-19 pandemic.

In this study, we proposed a way to classify the CT scan images by using the more efficient classifier, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), for images that are processed using a combination of these feature extraction methods, Haralick, histogram, and local binary pattern (LBP). Genetic algorithm is also used for feature selection. The results showed that the proposed method was able to improve KNN performance, with the best accuracy of 93.30% for the combination of Haralick and local binary pattern feature extraction, and the best area under the curve (AUC) for the combination of Haralick, histogram, and local binary pattern with a value of 0.948.

The mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) rate was 20 percent. Women represented 8 percent of all HIV cases in the US compared with 29 percent in New Haven. We had a six times greater proportion of children living with HIV. The mean number of HIV-exposed babies rose annually from 26 (1985-87) to 37 (1988-90). Our first team of caregivers comprised a nurse practitioner, a social worker, and me. We were, in time, joined by a growing number of colleagues. Enlightened and generous hospital administrators provided us with outpatient space and the promise of continued funding to support additional staff and in 1987, an independent Pediatric AIDS Care Program.

Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the characteristics of coagulation function indices in COVID-19 patients to investigate possible mechanisms through the comparison of non-severe and severe COVID-19 patients. METHODS We included 143 patients whose clinical characteristics, coagulation function, and other indices such as inflammatory factors were collected and compared based on disease severity. RESULTS Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), D-dimer, and fibrinogen levels were evidently higher in the severe group than in the non-severe group. Among non-severe COVID-19 patients, the aforementioned indicators depicted increasing trends, but the fibrinogen level alone was higher than normal. However, in severe COVID-19 patients, values of all three indices were higher than normal. In severe COVID-19 patients, fibrinogen and D-dimer were correlated with several inflammation indices during the early stage of the disease. However, no correlation between fibrinogen and inflammatory factors was observed in non-severe COVID-19 patients at any time point. DISCUSSION Results revealed that the hypercoagulability tendency of severe COVID-19 patients was more evident. The relationship between coagulation function and inflammatory factors showed that changes in coagulation function in severe COVID-19 patients may be related to abnormal increase in inflammatory factors at an early stage; however, in non-severe COVID-19 patients, there might be other factors leading to abnormal coagulation.

Methods: We analysed transmission data from a UK Health Security Agency household study. By fitting a mathematical transmission model to the data, we estimated the generation times for the Alpha and Delta variants. Results: The mean intrinsic generation time (the generation time if there had been a constant supply of susceptibles throughout infection) was shorter for the Delta variant (4.6 days, 95% CrI 4.0-5.4 days) than the Alpha variant (5.5 days, 95% CrI 4.6-6.4 days), although within uncertainty ranges. However, there was a larger difference in the realised mean household generation time between the Delta (3.2 days, 95% CrI 2.4-4.2 days) and Alpha (4.5 days, 95% CrI 3.7-5.4 days) variants. This is because higher transmissibility led to faster susceptible depletion in households, in addition to the reduced intrinsic generation time. Conclusions: The Delta variant transmits more quickly than previously circulating variants. This has implications for interventions such as contact tracing, testing and isolation, which are less effective if the virus is transmitted quickly. Epidemiological models of interventions should be updated to include the shorter generation time of the Delta variant.","output":"Generation time of the Alpha and Delta SARS-CoV-2 variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corona kadha includes the ingredients such as elaichi,turmeric,cloves,black peppercorns,honey, jaggery,munakka,tulsi,cinnamon,etc which act as immunity boosters which boosts the immunity.Immunity helps to fight against the covid-19.Mechanism of kadha is immunity boosting.Arsenium album proved to be a immuno booster pill and reduces inflammation in lungs and restlessness during cold.

METHODS We searched Medline and the Cochrane Library for RCTs assessing PtDAs in people with Type 2 diabetes. PtDAs were defined as tools designed to help people engage in decision-making about healthcare options, such as making treatment choices or setting therapeutic goals. The study selection process was facilitated by an automated screening tool to identify RCTs. We classified outcomes into seven domains and conducted meta-analyses using random effects models. RESULTS We included a total of 15 studies, nine of which were cluster RCTs, that evaluated 10 PtDAs. Thirteen trials compared a PtDA with usual care or usual care plus educational material, whereas two RCTs compared individually tailored vs. non-tailored PtDAs. Meta-analyses showed a favourable effect of PtDAs compared with usual care in reducing decisional conflict [weighted mean difference (WMD) -4.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) -7.93 to -1.39] and in improving knowledge (WMD 20.46, 95% CI 9.13 to 3.77). Use of PtDAs resulted in more active involvement in decision-making during the consultation, although no effect was evident in terms of glycaemic control or self-reported medication adherence. CONCLUSIONS PtDAs for people with Type 2 diabetes can improve the quality of decision-making and increase knowledge transfer.

With a return to conventional practice, we now must create a research and policy agenda using the changes wrought by COVID-19 to help create a better health care system in its aftermath. The purpose of this study was to assess satisfaction of otolaryngology outpatient visits during the pandemic. METHODS: A prospective survey study was performed on caregivers of all patients ages 0C26 years old seen in the Division of Pediatric Otolaryngology at our large tertiary care children's hospital from FebruaryCApril 2020. The three study groups were those seen in-person 6 weeks before telemedicine was implemented (IBTM), those seen in telemedicine during the first 6 weeks (TM) it was implemented at our hospital, and those seen in-person during the telemedicine period (IDTM) in the same timeframe. The survey consisted of satisfaction questions related to their visit, if their child was recommended surgery at the time of the visit, and if the caregiver agreed with the recommendation. A medical record review was also performed. RESULTS: A total of 176 caregivers completed the survey with 113(64.2%) completing the survey for an IBTM appointment, 59(33.5%) for a TM appointment, and 4(2.3%) for an IDTM appointment. There were 100(56.8%) male patients and 167(94.9%) were white. Families gave a higher response for the statement The ability to communicate with the physician (p = .012) and The overall outpatient experience (p = .004) in the IBTM cohort compared to the TM group. There were no significant differences for the other statements regarding the ability to understand recommendations, courtesy, and knowledge of the physician. Regardless of group, 98.6% of caregivers agreed with surgical recommendation when surgery was recommended. However, when surgery was not recommended at the appointment, caregivers were 11x more likely to disagree with the surgical recommendations, OR:11.49,95%CI:1.44C91.38,p = .005. CONCLUSION: We conclude that telemedicine was equally well received by patients as compared to traditional live assessments suggesting that virtual care is a viable post-pandemic paradigm change. Satisfaction was rated as Good or Excellent, however, messaging when surgery is not recommended was less acceptable and must be improved to obtain increased caregivers agreement in an era of shared decision making.","output":"Pediatric otolaryngology telemedicine amid a pandemic C And beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic that has hit the world in general and Indonesia in particular has paralyzed the economies of all countries in the world, including Indonesia.

Parkinson disease (PD) affects facial musculature leading to hypomimia or masked facies. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine whether modern computer vision techniques can be applied to detect masked facies and quantify drug states in PD. METHODS: We trained a convolutional neural network on images extracted from videos of 107 self-identified people with PD, along with 1595 videos of controls, in order to detect PD hypomimia cues. This trained model was applied to clinical interviews of 35 PD patients in their on and off drug motor states, and seven journalist interviews of the actor Alan Alda obtained before and after he was diagnosed with PD. RESULTS: The algorithm achieved a test set area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.71 on 54 subjects to detect PD hypomimia, compared to a value of 0.75 for trained neurologists using the United Parkinson Disease Rating Scale-III Facial Expression score. Additionally, the model accuracy to classify the on and off drug states in the clinical samples was 63% (22/35), in contrast to an accuracy of 46% (16/35) when using clinical rater scores. Finally, each of Alan Aldas seven interviews were successfully classified as occurring before (versus after) his diagnosis, with 100% accuracy (7/7).

The temporal information buried in EHRs are often underutilized in developing computational phenotypic definitions. The objective of this study is to develop a high-throughput phenotyping method, leveraging temporal sequential patterns of discrete events from electronic health records. Materials and Methods We develop a representation mining algorithm to extract five classes of representations from EHR diagnosis and medication records: the aggregated vector of the records (AVR), the traditional immediate sequential patterns (SPM), the transitive sequential patterns (tSPM), as well as two hybrid classes of SPM+AVR and tSPM+AVR. A final small set of representations were selected from each class using the MSMR dimensionality reduction algorithm. Using EHR data on 10 phenotypes from Mass General Brigham Biobank, we trained regularized logistic regression algorithms, which we validated using labeled data. Results Phenotyping with temporal sequences resulted in a superior classification performance across all 10 phenotypes compared with the AVR representations that are conventionally used in electronic phenotyping. Although this study only utilizes the diagnosis and medication records, the high-throughput algorithms classification performance was superior or similar to the performance of previously published electronic phenotyping algorithms. We characterize and evaluate the top transitive sequences of diagnosis records paired with the records of risk factors, symptoms, complications, medications, or vaccinations. Discussion The proposed high-throughput phenotyping approach enables seamless discovery of sequential record combinations that may be difficult to assume from raw EHR data. A transitive sequence can offer a more accurate characterization of the phenotype, compared with its individual components. Additionally, the identified transitive sequences of a given phenotype reflect the actual lived experiences of the patients with that particular disease.

However, immunologic mechanism(s) of protection, as well as how boosting alters immunity to wildtype and newly emerging strains, remain incompletely understood. Here we deeply profiled the humoral immune response in a cohort of non-human primates immunized with a stable recombinant full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein (NVX-CoV2373) at two dose levels, administered as a single or two-dose regimen with a saponin-based adjuvant Matrix-M?. While antigen dose had some effect on Fc-effector profiles, both antigen dose and boosting significantly altered overall titers, neutralization and Fc-effector profiles, driving unique vaccine-induced antibody fingerprints. Combined differences in antibody effector functions and neutralization were strongly associated with distinct levels of protection in the upper and lower respiratory tract, pointing to the presence of combined, but distinct, compartment-specific neutralization and Fc-mechanisms as key determinants of protective immunity against infection. Moreover, NVX-CoV2373 elicited antibodies functionally target emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, collectively pointing to the critical collaborative role for Fab and Fc in driving maximal protection against SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, the data presented here suggest that a single dose may prevent disease, but that two doses may be essential to block further transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants.","output":"Collaboration between the Fab and Fc contribute to maximal protection against SARS-CoV-2 following NVX-CoV2373 subunit vaccine with Matrix-M? vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Parasites regularly switch into new host species, representing a disease burden and conservation risk to the hosts. The distribution of these parasites also gives insight into characteristics of ecological networks and genetic mechanisms of host-parasite interactions. Some parasites are shared across many species, whereas others tend to be restricted to hosts from a single species. Understanding the mechanisms producing this distribution of host specificity can enable more effective interventions and potentially identify genetic targets for vaccines or therapies. As ecological connections between human and local animal populations increase, the risk to human and wildlife health from novel parasites also increases. Which of these parasites will fizzle out and which have the potential to become widespread in humans? We consider the case of primate malarias, caused by Plasmodium parasites, to investigate the interacting ecological and evolutionary mechanisms that put human and nonhuman primates at risk for infection. Plasmodium host switching from nonhuman primates to humans led to ancient introductions of the most common malaria-causing agents in humans today, and new parasite switching is a growing threat, especially in Asia and South America. Based on a wild host-Plasmodium occurrence database, we highlight geographic areas of concern and potential areas to target further sampling.

Accordingly, we employ a simple extension to models currently used in the literature to estimate the reproduction number and present a case-study of the progression of COVID-19 in Austria. Our models demonstrate that the estimation uncertainty of the reproduction number increases with superspreading and that this improves the performance of prediction intervals.

We also show in vitro that EVs from different temporal phases trigger distinct metabolic and transcriptional responses in recipient cells, including in alveolar epithelial cells, which denote the primary site of infection, and liver hepatocytes, which represent a distal secondary site. In comparison to the hyperinflammatory phase, EVs from the resolution phase induce opposing effects on eukaryotic translation and Notch signalling.

Protective ileostomy (PI) during anterior resection (AR) for rectal cancer decreases the incidence of anastomotic leakage (AL) and its subsequent complications, but it may itself be the cause of morbidity. The aim is to report our protocol in the management of selected patients with borderline risk to develop AL after laparoscopic AR and ghost ileostomy (GI) creation. Methods. Patients who underwent AR were stratified based on the risk to develop AL. Steps to avoid PI were splenic flexure mobilization, reduced pelvic bleeding, to employ different stapler charge if neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy is performed, to perform a horizontal section of the rectum, to evaluate the anastomotic vascularization with a fluorescence angiography, to perform a side-to-end anastomosis, intraoperative methylene blue test, pelvic and transanal drainage tubes placement, and the GI creation. After surgery, inflammatory blood markers were monitored to detect potential leakages. Results. Twelve patients were included. In one case, the specimen proximal section was changed after fluorescence angiography. There were no conversions in this group of patients. One postoperative AL occurred and was treated with radiological drainage placement, not being necessary to convert the GI. PI was avoided in 100% of cases. Conclusions. Patients' characteristics cannot be changed, but several steps were used to avoid routine PI creation. The present protocol could be a valuable option to avoid PI in selected patients. Further studies with a wider sample size, and defined criteria to stratify the patients based on the risk to develop AL, are required.","output":"A Decalogue to Avoid Routine Ileostomy in Selected Patients With Border Line Risk to Develop Anastomotic Leakage After Minimally Invasive Low-Anterior Resection: A Pilot Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Humanized mice are crucial tools for studying human pathogens in systemic situations.

At a recreational level, regular physical activity is an effective non-pharmacological therapy in the treatment of many endocrine conditions. However, the impact of physical exercise on endocrine function and how best to incorporate exercise therapy into clinical care are not well understood. Beyond the pursuit of an Olympic medal, elite athletes may therefore serve as role models for showcasing how exercise can help in the management of endocrine disorders and improve metabolic dysfunction. This review summarises research evidence for clinicians who wish to understand endocrine changes in athletes who already perform high levels of activity as well as to encourage patients to exercise more safely. Herein, we detail the upper limits of athleticism to showcase the adaptability of human endocrine-metabolic-physiological systems. Then, we describe the growing research base that advocates the importance of understanding maladaptation to physical training and nutrition in males and females; especially the young.

A number of explanations have been suggested, but there is no clear evidence about how apparent fatality rates may be expected to vary with the different testing regimes, admission policies and other variables. An individual patient simulation model was developed to address this question. Parameters and sensitivity analysis based upon recent international data sources for Covid-19 and results were averaged over 100 iterations for a simulated cohort of over 500,000 patients. Different testing regimes for Covid-19 were considered; testing admitted patients only, various rates of community testing of symptomatic cases and active contact-tracing and screening. In the base case analysis, apparent mortality ranged from 10.5% under a policy of testing only admitted patients to 0.4% with intensive contact tracing and community testing. These findings were sensitive to assumptions regarding admission rates and the rate of spread, with more selective admission policies and suppression of spread increasing the apparent mortality and the potential for apparent mortality rates to exceed 18% under some circumstances. Under all scenarios the proportion of patients tested in the community had the greatest impact on apparent mortality. Whilst differences in mortality due to health service and demographic factors cannot be excluded, the current international differences in reported mortality are all consistent with differences in practice regarding screening, community testing and admission policies.","output":"Explaining national differences in the mortality of Covid-19: individual patient simulation model to investigate the effects of testing policy and other factors on apparent mortality."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Related Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global health emergency.

The logic of POZE underpins five books that appear at Palgrave/Springer in 2020/21. It is based on the understanding that human existence results from four dimensions, soul, heart, mind, and body, which find their expression in aspirations, emotions, thoughts, and sensations. Through their four-dimensionality individuals are symmetrical to the four dimensions that shape the society, which they are part of. Individuals are the micro entity of a four-dimensional collective reality that encompasses communities and institutions in the meso-dimension, and countries and economies in the macro-dimension. Altogether micro, meso and macro are integral parts of the meta dimension, Planet Earth; the latter also includes non-anthropocentric aspects such as Nature. POZE provides insights about the multiple dynamics that shape our individual and collective experience. Moreover, it provides practical guidance to optimize the interplay between them. As a result of this understanding, it posits that change is possible. Moving towards a fair inclusive world, characterized by a life of quality for everyone 1) is at reach; 2) is achievable; 3) involves everyone as both a right-holder and duty-bearer; and 4) is to the benefit of everyone. POZE has four meanings: it i) translates as inner peace from Haitian Creole, country where the dynamic began in 2017; ii) is an acronym that encompasses the four core concepts of the paradigm (Purpose, Om, Zoom, Expression); iii) is a representation of the four outcomes of the logic (Perspective, Optimization, Zenith, Exposure); finally it iv) stands for an exercise to nurture inner peace daily (Pause, Observe, Zoom in, Experience).

In response, the authors created the COMVC-19 program. The program offered preventive actions and mental health treatment for the 22,000 workers of The Hospital das Clinicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de S?o Paulo (HCFMUSP). This paper aims to describe its implementation and share what we have learned from this experience. METHODS: Workers were able to easily access the program through a 24/7 hotline. Additionally, a mobile phone app that screened for signs and symptoms of emotional distress and offered psychoeducation and/or referral to treatment was made available. Data from both these sources as well as any subsequent psychiatric evaluations were collected. RESULTS: The first 20 weeks of our project revealed that most participants were female, and part of the nursing staff working directly with COVID-19 patients. The most frequently reported symptoms were: anxiety, depression and sleep disturbances. The most common diagnoses were Adjustment, Anxiety, and Mood disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing a mental health program in a multimodal intervention was feasible in a major quaternary public hospital.

During the COVID-19 pandemic many countries implemented a furlough scheme to prevent job loss. We examine how furlough was associated with respondents' substance use behaviours in the initial stages of the pandemic in the UK. Data were from over 27,000 participants in eight adult longitudinal surveys. Participants self-reported economic activity (furlough or job loss vs stable employment) and smoking (any current), vaping (any current) and drinking alcohol (>4 days/week or 5+ drinks per typical occasion) both before and during the initial stages of the pandemic. Changes in frequency/quantity of substance use were also examined. Risk ratios were estimated within each study using modified Poisson regression, adjusting for a range of potential confounders, including pre-pandemic behaviour (though this was excluded in analyses of behaviour change). Findings were synthesised using a random effects meta-analysis. Compared to stable employment, participation in the furlough scheme was associated with smoking (risk ratio: 1.24 [95% CI: 1.08-1.42]; I2=0%) while job loss was associated with vaping (1.72 [1.10-2.71]; I2=25%) and heavier drinking (1.21 [1.02-1.43]; I2=2%), but these associations were largely accounted for by confounders (adjusted risk ratios: smoking: 1.06 [0.96-1.16]; I2=8%; vaping: 1.55 [0.93-2.56]; I2=42%; and drinking: 1.03 [0.89-1.20]; I2=35%). Furlough was associated with drinking more than before the pandemic (adjusted risk ratio: 1.15 [1.00-1.33]; I2=70%), and with increases in vaping behaviour (1.54 [1.14-2.07]; I2=0%).

All described NDV vector vaccines grow to high titers in embryonated chicken eggs. In a proof of principle mouse study, the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of these NDV-based vaccines were investigated. FINDINGS: We report that the NDV vector vaccines elicit high levels of antibodies that are neutralizing when the vaccine is given intramuscularly in mice. Importantly, these COVID-19 vaccine candidates protect mice from a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 challenge with no detectable viral titer and viral antigen in the lungs.

Monolayers of human retinal pigment epithelial cells (multiple primary cell isolates and the ARPE-19 cell line) were inoculated with six DENV strains, at multiplicity of infection of 10; uninfected and recombinant strain-infected controls were included where relevant.

The results of the comparison test showed that Daan, Sansure, and Hybribio NAATs could detect the samples with a specificity of 100% (30/30) and a sensitivity of 100% (16/16), whereas Bioperfectus NAAT detected the samples with a specificity of 100% (30/30) and a sensitivity of 81.25% (13/16). However, no significant difference in sensitivity was found between Bioperfectus NAAT and the three other NAATs (p > 0.05).

We used descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression models to assess cross-sectionally risk perceptions for severe Covid-19 symptoms and their health behaviour correlates among 2206 UK adults from the HEBECO study. The great majority (89C99%) classified age 70+, having comorbidities, being a key worker, overweight, and from an ethnic minority as increasing the risk. People were less sure about alcohol drinking, vaping, and nicotine replacement therapy use (17.4C29.5% responding don't know). Relative to those who did not, those who engaged in the following behaviours had higher odds of classifying these behaviours as (i) decreasing the risk: smoking cigarettes (adjusted odds ratios, aORs, 95% CI = 2.26, 1.39C3.37), and using e-cigarettes (aORs = 5.80, 3.25C10.34); (ii) having no impact: smoking cigarettes (1.98; 1.42C2.76), using e-cigarettes (aORs = 2.63, 1.96C3.50), drinking alcohol (aORs = 1.75, 1.31C2.33); and lower odds of classifying these as increasing the risk: smoking cigarettes (aORs: 0.43, 0.32C0.56), using e-cigarettes (aORs = 0.25, 0.18C0.35). Similarly, eating more fruit and vegetables was associated with classifying unhealthy diet as increasing risk (aOR = 1.37, 1.12C1.69), and exercising more with classifying regular physical activity as decreasing risk (aOR = 2.42, 1.75C3.34). Risk perceptions for severe Covid-19 among UK adults were lower for their own health behaviours, evidencing optimism bias. These risk perceptions may form barriers to changing people's own unhealthy behaviours, make one less responsive to interventions that refer to the risk of Covid-19 as a motivating factor, and exacerbate inequalities in health behaviours and outcomes.","output":"Perceived risk factors for severe Covid-19 symptoms and their association with health behaviours: Findings from the HEBECO study()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Parents managing their home environments during government-ordered stay-at-home periods are likely to need new skills for occupying their children's time with activities that promote health and emotional well-being.

During the COVID-19 pandemic patient care was affected. Access to non-urgent follow up visits, screening and diagnostic procedures was limited, and in some cases, delays in care resulted in adverse outcomes. Case descriptionA 68-year-old man with 33-pack-year smoking history presented to the hospital for evaluation after a mechanical fall. He reported progressive left-sided neck pain and weakness of the left upper extremity for 6 months, and during an initial visit with PCP, he was diagnosed with arthritis. A follow-up visit was rescheduled due to rise of COVID 19 cases and decrease of non-urgent in-person office visits. Of note, the patient had undergone lung cancer screening with low dose chest CT 2 years prior without significant findings.At the time of his visit to the hospital, his physical exam was notable for a thin, cachectic, frail male with left-sided neck contracture and 3/5 left upper extremity strength. Blood work was unremarkable except for normocytic, normochromic anemia of 13 gr/L. CT of the neck showed a soft tissue mass eroding the left C6 to T1 vertebral bodies without fracture (Image 1A). A subsequent CT chest with contrast revealed a heterogeneous centrally necrotic mass at the left lung apex encasing and narrowing the lumen of the left subclavian artery (Image 1B). Multiple poorly differentiated lesions were also seen on the liver. Biopsy of the lung mass was consistent with poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Palliative radiation and comfort care were started, and ultimately patient expired. DiscussionLung cancer is the second most common cause of malignancy in the United States. Pancoast tumors account for up to 5% of all lung cancers. Data published for 2020 suggest a decrease in more than 50% of cancer screening visits, translating in the delay of care and ultimately treatment. Our patient is one of the many examples of how the COVID-19 pandemic affected patient care. Decreased access for non-urgent medical issues negatively impacted the clinical course of our patient. Although changes that allowed for the expansion of telehealth services were significant, we should continue developing evidence-based approaches to deliver care during medical emergencies. Increasing access for vulnerable populations by broadening telehealth programs or deploying physicians along with resources could significantly impact early diagnosis and provide relief to a system that may be underprepared for another pandemic.","output":"A Tale of a Lung Mass in the Midst of COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 has caused over 2 million deaths worldwide, with over 412,000 deaths reported in Unites States.

However, training a deep learning model requires a considerable amount of labelled images, which can be expensive to obtain as time and effort from clinical practitioners are required. To address this, a number of publicly available datasets have been built with data from different hospitals and clinics, which can be used to pre-train the model. However, using models trained on these datasets for later transfer learning and model fine-tuning with images sampled from a different hospital or clinic might result in lower performance. This is due to the distribution mismatch of the datasets, which include different patient populations and image acquisition protocols. In this work, a real-world scenario is evaluated where a novel target dataset sampled from a private Costa Rican clinic is used, with few labels and heavily imbalanced data. The use of two popular and publicly available datasets (INbreast and CBIS-DDSM) as source data, to train and test the models on the novel target dataset, is evaluated. A common approach to further improve the models performance under such small labelled target dataset setting is data augmentation. However, often cheaper unlabelled data is available from the target clinic. Therefore, semi-supervised deep learning, which leverages both labelled and unlabelled data, can be used in such conditions. In this work, we evaluate the semi-supervised deep learning approach known as MixMatch, to take advantage of unlabelled data from the target dataset, for whole mammogram image classification. We compare the usage of semi-supervised learning on its own, and combined with transfer learning (from a source mammogram dataset) with data augmentation, as also against regular supervised learning with transfer learning and data augmentation from source datasets. It is shown that the use of a semi-supervised deep learning combined with transfer learning and data augmentation can provide a meaningful advantage when using scarce labelled observations. Also, we found a strong influence of the source dataset, which suggests a more data-centric approach needed to tackle the challenge of scarcely labelled data. We used several different metrics to assess the performance gain of using semi-supervised learning, when dealing with very imbalanced test datasets (such as the G-mean and the F2-score), as mammogram datasets are often very imbalanced.

They were asked to complete an online survey assessing the anxiety and depression, obstetric characteristics, and sociodemographic variables. The women were grouped into the following categories in accordance with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9): (a) CAD, (b) anxiety only, (c) depression only, and (d) no depression or anxiety. After estimating the prevalence of CAD, anxiety only, and depression only, we carried out chi-squared tests and multiple logistic regression analysis to examine the related factors between these groups of pregnant and postpartum Chinese women. Results: Comorbid anxiety and depression, anxiety only, and depression only, occurred in 6.3, 5.8, and 3.9% of participants, respectively. The prevalence rates of CAD during the first, second, and third trimesters of pregnancy and the postpartum period were found to be 7.4, 6.5, 5.7, and 8.2%, respectively. The factors that differed among the groups were age (p < 0.05), marital status (p < 0.001), level of education (p < 0.05), family support (p < 0.001), and total live births (p < 0.001).

However, ACE-2 also converts angiotensin II into angiotensin-(1-7) and counterbalances the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, with resultant protective effects in the cardiovascular system. Some data suggest that two common antihypertension medications (angiotensin II receptor blockers, ARBs;and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, AECi) may increase ACE-2 expression in heart and kidney cells, fueling debate about how these widely used medications may modulate SARS-CoV2 infectivity and risk of COVID-19. Aim: Determine whether exposure of bronchial AECs to the ARB losartan or the ACEi captopril modulate expression of ACE-2 by AECs and/or SARS CoV2 replication. Methods: Primary bronchial AECs from children and adults (n=18;ages 8-75 yrs.) were differentiated ex vivo at an air-liquid interface to generate organotypic cultures. Cultures were treated with captopril (1M) or losartan (2M) added to basolateral media with each culture media change starting 72 hrs. before infection with SARS-CoV-2. In a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facility, cultures were infected with SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5. At 96 hrs. following infection, RNA and protein were isolated from cultures. SARS-CoV-2 replication in cultures was assessed with quantitative PCR, and quantified as viral copy number/ng RNA. ACE-2 expression was assessed by qPCR. Results: Neither captopril nor losartan treatment significantly changed AEC-2 expression by AECs as compared to untreated AEC cultures or SARS-CoV-2 infected AEC cultures without captopril or losartan treatment. At 96 hrs. following infection, SARS-CoV-2 copy number/ng RNA was not significantly different between untreated AEC cultures (median 1752, 95% CI 213 - 8599), cultures treated with captopril (median 448.6, 95% CI 160 - 3051), or cultures treated with lorsartan (median 640, 95% CI 127 - 1610;Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA p=0.4). Conclusion: These findings suggest that at the level of the airway epithelium neither the ACEi captopril or ARB losartan significantly modify expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry factor ACE-2, nor does either medication effect the replication of SARS-CoV-2.

OBJECTIVE To identify the safety and efficacy of SVAT in a large multicenter patient cohort and evaluate prognostic markers of clinical outcome following SVAT. METHODS This study retrospectively enrolled 50 consecutive patients undergoing SVAT at 11 different centers. We analyzed Hunt and Hess and Fisher grades, aneurysm location, angiographic vasospasm grade, Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) at discharge, and 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores. RESULTS A total of 50 patients undergoing SVAT between the years 2003 and 2009 were identified. Patients presented, on average, 6.484.45 days after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Hunt and Hess and Fisher grades were 1 (n=7), 2 (n=12), 3 (n=14), 4 (n=15), 5 (n=2), and 3 and 4 (n=33), respectively. Aneurysm location was distributed as follows: anterior (n=32), posterior (n=16), anterior and posterior (n=2). Patients with good clinical condition (Hunt and Hess score 1-3) had significantly higher odds of surviving (OR=17.5, 95% CI 1.9 to 161.5), favorable GOS (OR=4.2, 95% CI 1.2 to 14.8), and favorable 90-day mRS (OR=4.2, 95% CI 1.2 to 14.8). CONCLUSIONS SVAT is safe, with the majority of patients achieving good clinical outcome.

In this study, we present the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 cases during the second wave of the pandemic in patients admitted to the only primary care hospital in the district of Rohrbach between October 2020 and February 2021. In total, 260 patients were hospitalized with a mean age of 72 years and a mortality rate of 14.6% and 13 patients (5%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Critically ill patients (22.7%) were of older age and often lived in retirement and nursing facilities as compared to mild or moderately ill patients. Patients with a severe disease course showed significantly longer hospitalization, a worse peripheral oxygen saturation on admission and significantly higher levels of C?reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), troponin I and D?dimer as compared to mild or moderate COVID-19 cases. These laboratory parameters might help to identify COVID-19 patients with a severe disease course. In conclusion, we could show that older, frail individuals are the most vulnerable group affected by COVID-19. Whether this trend in hospitalized patients continues with the persistence of the pandemic, the emergence of novel virus mutations, and the availability of several different vaccines is presently unclear and remains to be determined.","output":"Clinical characterization of hospitalized COVID-19 patients during the second wave of pandemic in the district of Rohrbach, Upper Austria: A single center retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human hearing adapts to background noise, as evidenced by the fact that listeners recognize more isolated words when words are presented later rather than earlier in noise. This adaptation is likely due to the leading noise shifting ('adapting') the dynamic range of auditory neurons, which can improve the neural encoding of speech spectral and temporal cues. Because neural dynamic range adaptation depends on stimulus level statistics, here we investigated the importance of 'statistical' adaptation for improving speech recognition in noisy backgrounds. We compared the recognition of noised-masked words in the presence and in the absence of adapting noise precursors whose level was either constant or was changing every 50 ms according to different statistical distributions. Adaptation was measured for 28 listeners (9 men) and was quantified as the recognition improvement in the precursor relative to the no-precursor condition. Adaptation was largest for constant-level precursors and did not occur for highly fluctuating precursors, even when the two types of precursors had the same mean level and both activated the medial olivocochlear reflex. Instantaneous amplitude compression of the highly fluctuating precursor produced as much adaptation as the constant-level precursor did without compression. Altogether, results suggest that noise adaptation in speech recognition is probably mediated by neural dynamic range adaptation to the most frequent sound level. Further, they suggest that auditory peripheral compression per se, rather than the medial olivocochlear reflex, could facilitate noise adaptation by reducing the level fluctuations in the noise.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTRecognizing speech in noise is challenging but can be facilitated by noise adaptation. The neural mechanisms underlying this adaptation remain unclear. Here, we report some benefits of adaptation for word-in-noise recognition and show that (1) adaptation occurs for stationary but not for highly fluctuating precursors with equal mean level; (2) both stationary and highly fluctuating noises activate the medial olivocochlear reflex; and (3) adaptation occurs even in highly fluctuating noise when the stimulus is passed through a fast amplitude compressor. These findings suggest that noise adaptation reflects neural dynamic range adaptation to the most frequent noise level and that auditory peripheral compression rather than the medial olivocochlear reflex could facilitate noise adaptation.","output":"Adaptation to noise in human speech recognition depends on noise-level statistics and fast dynamic-range compression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is currently spreading widely around the world, causing huge threats to public safety and global society. This study analyzes the spatiotemporal pattern of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, reveals Chinas epicenters of the pandemic through spatial clustering, and delineates the substantial effect of distance to Wuhan on the pandemic spread. The results show that the daily new COVID-19 cases mostly occurred in and around Wuhan before March 6, and then moved to the Grand Bay Area (Shenzhen, Hong Kong and Macau). The total COVID-19 cases in China were mainly distributed in the east of the Huhuanyong Line, where the epicenters accounted for more than 60% of the countrys total in/on 24 January and 7 February, half in/on 31 January, and more than 70% from 14 February. The total cases finally stabilized at approximately 84,000, and the inflection point for Wuhan was on 14 February, one week later than those of Hubei (outside Wuhan) and China (outside Hubei). The generalized additive model-based analysis shows that population density and distance to provincial cities were significantly associated with the total number of the cases, while distances to prefecture cities and intercity traffic stations, and population inflow from Wuhan after 24 January, had no strong relationships with the total number of cases. The results and findings should provide valuable insights for understanding the changes in the COVID-19 transmission as well as implications for controlling the global COVID-19 pandemic spread.","output":"Spatiotemporal spread pattern of the COVID-19 cases in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) which is caused by SARS-COV2 has become a pandemic. This disease is highly infectious and potentially fatal, causing a global public health concern. To contain the spread of COVID-19, governments are adopting nationwide interventions, like lockdown, containment and quarantine, restrictions on travel, cancelling social events and extensive testing. To understand the effects of these measures on the control of the epidemic in a data-driven manner, we propose a probabilistic cellular automata (PCA) based modified SEIQR model. The transitions associated with the model is driven by data available on chronology, symptoms, pathogenesis and transmissivity of the virus. By arguing that the lattice-based model captures the features of the dynamics along with the existing fluctuations, we perform rigorous computational analyses of the model to take into account of the spatial dynamics of social distancing measures imposed on the people. Considering the probabilistic behavioural aspects associated with mitigation strategies, we study the model considering factors like population density and testing efficiency. Using the model, we focus on the variability of epidemic dynamics data for different countries and point out the reasons behind these contrasting observations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to model COVID-19 spread using PCA that gives us both spatial and temporal variations of the infection spread with the insight about the contributions of different infection parameters.","output":"Computational model on COVID-19 Pandemic using Probabilistic Cellular Automata"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose We sought to gain an understanding of cancer prevention and screening perspectives among patients exposed to a clinical decision support (CDS) tool because they were due or overdue for certain cancer screenings or prevention. Methods Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 37 adult patients due or overdue for cancer prevention services in 10 primary care clinics within the same health system. Data were thematically segmented and coded using qualitative content analysis. Results We identified three themes: 1) The CDS tool had more strengths than weaknesses, with areas for improvement; 2) Many facilitators and barriers to cancer prevention and screening exist; and 3) Discussions and decision-making varied by type of cancer prevention and screening. Almost all participants made positive comments regarding the CDS. Some participants learned new information, reporting the CDS helped them make a decision they otherwise would not have made. Participants who used the tool with their provider had higher self-reported rates of deciding to be screened than those who did not. Conclusions Learning about patients' perceptions of a CDS tool may increase understanding of how patient-tailored CDS impacts cancer screening and prevention rates. Participants found a personalized CDS tool for cancer screening and prevention in primary care useful and a welcome addition to their visit.

A main difficulty for the prediction of peptide-protein interactions is the flexibility of peptides and their tendency to undergo conformational changes upon binding. Motivated by this, we developed reciprocal attention to simultaneously update the encodings of peptide and protein residues while enforcing symmetry, allowing for information flow between the two inputs. PepNN integrates this module with modern graph neural network layers and a series of transfer learning steps are used during training to compensate for the scarcity of peptide-protein complex information. We show that PepNN-Struct achieves consistently high performance across different benchmark datasets.

The aim of this technical note is to propose a reliable, fast-adaptable and easy-to-use matrix that accurately classifies risk for contact tracing of healthcare workers with COVID-19 patients. The researchers have created a matrix with the support of the literature and their experience within the university hospital surveillance team. This matrix enables a detailed High / Medium / Low Risk classification of contacts of healthcare workers with COVID-19 cases, covering many different contact situations encountered in a university hospital. The distinction between different contact risk categories implies different preventive measures: High-risk contacts are isolated at home for 7 days and return to work if they test PCR-negative on day 7;while medium and low risk contacts continue to work using masks, with medium-risk contacts tested on day 7, so it is important to standardize the classification among different interviewers. Three main headings have come to the fore in health worker contact risk classification: 1. Differences caused by the ventilation of the environment: Indoors, well ventilated indoors, outdoors. 2. Direct contact or material sharing. 3. Aerosol generating procedure (AGP). The matrix has been used effectively in 1169 risky contact interviews over a two-month period (24 August - 23 October 2020).

Objectives: To determine the pattern of injuries amongst tennis players in Accra. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted, involving 142 male and female participants selected from tennis clubs in Accra and the Accra sports stadium. A standardised tennis injury report form was used to obtain data from participants. Data on the parts of the body mostly injured and the types of injury mostly sustained by the players were summarised and presented appropriately with the use of graphs and pie charts. Assessment of the causes underlying the prevailing injuries to tennis players was also tabulated and comparisons made. Results: Out of a total of 170 injuries recorded, knee (39 [27.5%]) and shoulder (31 [21.1%]) injuries were the most commonly sustained. Most (80 [56.3%]) tennis injuries occurred during training. Other injuries (26 [18.3%]) occurred during competitions or tournaments whilst 26 (18.3%) occurred during social play. About 10 (7.0%) participants were not certain of the type of activity at the time of injury. The majority (35 [24.65%]) of the players received no treatment for their injuries. However, few of the injuries (20 [14.08%], 14 [9.86%], 6 [4.23%]) sustained were treated by medical personnel, physiotherapists or nurses respectively. There was no association between warm-up before play and cause of injury (p = 0.375). There was also no association between shoe type and cause of injury (p = 0.253).

However, the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease (AD) is complex, and it remains unclear. Over the past decades, all efforts made in the treatments of AD, with targeting the pathogenic amyloid  (A), neurofibrillary tangles, and misfolded tau protein, were failed. Recently, many studies have hinted that infection, and chronic inflammation that caused by infection are crucial risk factors for AD development and progress. In the review, we analyzed the role of infections caused by bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens in the pathogenesis of AD and its animal models, and explored the therapeutic possibility with anti-infections for AD. However, based on the published data, it is still difficult to determine their causal relationship between infection and AD due to contradictory results. We think that the role of infection in the pathogenesis of AD should not be ignored, even though infection does not necessarily cause AD, it may act as an accelerator in AD at least. It is essential to conduct the longitudinal studies and randomized controlled trials in humans, which can determine the role of infection in AD and clarify the links between infection and the pathological features of AD. Finding targeting infection drugs and identifying the time window for applying antibacterial or antiviral intervention may be more promising for future clinical therapeutic strategies in AD.","output":"Can Control Infections Slow Down the Progression of Alzheimers Disease?

Basically, a system consists of a number of parts that are connected to each other. Systems differ depending on the nature of their connectedness. Simple systems have one-to-one relationships and their behaviour is precisely predictable. Complicated systems have one-to-many relationships with mostly predictable behaviours. This book deals with complex adaptive systems with many-to-many relationships. Their many-to-many relationships make their behaviour emergent, hence their outcomes are unpredictable. Complex adaptive systems have a special characteristic, the members of the system can learn from feedback and experiences. The relationships in complex adaptive systems change constantly allowing the system to evolve over time in light of changing demands. However, a systems overall behaviour, despite its adaptation to changing circumstances, remains relatively stable within boundaries, but occasionally, its behaviour may change abruptly and dramatically for no apparent reason. Another important characteristic of complex adaptive systems is its nonlinear behaviour to change, i.e. the magnitude of change in one member of the system shows a disproportional change in that of others. As experience shows, small changes in the behaviour of a system member often show dramatic changes in the behaviour of the whole system, whereas a major change in the behaviour of that member typically results in little or no change. Studying complex adaptive systems aims to understand the relationships and the dynamics between the members of the systems. This understanding allows for better responses when the system as a whole is challenged by constraints and/or unfamiliar challenges. A special characteristic of social systems is their goal-delivering nature.

METHODS: Data from the National Intensive Care Evaluation (NICE)-registry of all COVID-19 patients admitted to an ICU in the Netherlands were used. Patient characteristics and indicators of quality of care during the first two upsurges (N = 4215: October 5, 2020CJanuary 31, 2021) and the final upsurge of the second wave, called the third wave (N = 4602: February 1, 2021CJune 30, 2021) were compared with those during the first wave (N = 2733, FebruaryCMay 24, 2020). RESULTS: During the second and third wave, there were less patients treated with mechanical ventilation (58.1 and 58.2%) and vasoactive drugs (48.0 and 44.7%) compared to the first wave (79.1% and 67.2%, respectively). The occupancy rates as fraction of occupancy in 2019 (1.68 and 1.55 vs. 1.83), the numbers of ICU relocations (23.8 and 27.6 vs. 32.3%) and the mean length of stay at the ICU (HRs of ICU discharge = 1.26 and 1.42) were lower during the second and third wave.

The pattern and impact of dysbiosis on prognosis has not been thoroughly investigated in the ICU setting. AIMS: We aimed to evaluate changes in the gut microbiota of ICU patients via 16S rRNA gene deep sequencing, assess the association of the changes with antibiotics use or disease severity, and explore the association of gut microbiota changes with ICU patient prognosis. METHODS: Seventy-one mechanically ventilated patients were included. Fecal samples were collected serially on days 1C2, 3C4, 5C7, 8C14, and thereafter when suitable. Microorganisms of the fecal samples were profiled by 16S rRNA gene deep sequencing. RESULTS: Proportions of the five major phyla in the feces were diverse in each patient at admission. Those of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes especially converged and stabilized within the first week from admission with a reduction in -diversity (p < 0.001). Significant differences occurred in the proportional change of Actinobacteria between the carbapenem and non-carbapenem groups (p = 0.030) and that of Actinobacteria according to initial SOFA score and changes in the SOFA score (p < 0.001).

The goal of this study was to create a \\"simulated\\" daily readout (SDR) to restore the educational value of the daily readout. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To create the SDR the following tasks were performed; selection of cases for a daily worklist for each resident rotation, comprising a combination of normal and abnormal cases; determination of the correct number of cases and the appropriate mix of imaging modalities for each worklist; development of an \\"educational\\" environment consisting of separate \\"instances\\" of both our Picture Archive Communication System and reporting systems; and the anonymization of all of the cases on the worklists. Surveys of both residents and faculty involved in the SDR were performed to assess its effectiveness. RESULTS: Thirty-two residents participated in the SDR. The daily worklists for the first 20 days of the SDR included 3682 cases. An average of 480 cases per day was dictated by the residents. Surveys of the residents and the faculty involved in the SDR demonstrated that both agreed that the SDR effectively mimics a resident's daily work on rotations and preserves resident education during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 crisis. CONCLUSION: The development of the SDR provided an effective method of preserving the educational value of the daily readout experience of radiology residents, despite severe decreases in imaging exam volume and case mix diversity during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic.","output":"Preserving Radiology Resident Education During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Simulated Daily Readout"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2) pandemic that has engulfed the globe has had incredible effects on health care systems and economic activity.

Research has been recently devoted to the development of sample size criteria that guarantee agreement of posterior information in terms of credible intervals when multiple priors are available. In these articles, the goals of reaching consensus and evidence are typically kept separated. Adopting a Bayesian performance-based approach, the present article proposes new sample size criteria for superiority trials that jointly control the achievement of both minimal evidence and consensus, measured by appropriate functions of the posterior distributions.

To date, no antiviral drug has been approved to treat EV71 infection. Due to the essential role that EV71 3 C protease (3C(pro)) plays in the viral life cycle, it is generally considered as a highly appealing target for antiviral drug development. In this study, we present a transgene-encoded biosensor that can accurately, sensitively and quantitatively report the proteolytic activity of EV71 3C(pro). This biosensor is based on the catalyzed activity of a proCinterleukin (IL)-1-enterovirus 3C(pro) cleavage site-Gaussia Luciferase (GLuc) fusion protein that we named i-3CS-GLuc. GLuc enzyme is inactive in the fusion protein because of aggregation caused by proCIL-1. However, the 3C(pro) of EV71 and other enteroviruses, such as coxsackievirus A9 (CVA9), coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), and poliovirus can recognize and process the canonical enterovirus 3C(pro) cleavage site between proCIL-1 and GLuc, thereby releasing and activating GLuc and resulting in increased luciferase activity. The high sensitivity, ease of use, and applicability as a transgene in cell-based assays of i-3CS-GLuc biosensor make it a powerful tool for studying viral protease proteolytic events in living cells and for achieving high-throughput screening of antiviral agents.","output":"Development of a luciferase-based biosensor to assess enterovirus 71 3C protease activity in living cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) are speculated to have originated in bats. The mechanisms by which these viruses are maintained in individuals or populations of reservoir bats remain an enigma. Mathematical models have predicted long-term persistent infection with low levels of periodic shedding as a likely route for virus maintenance and spillover from bats. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that bat cells and MERS coronavirus (CoV) can co-exist in vitro. To test our hypothesis, we established a long-term coronavirus infection model of bat cells that are persistently infected with MERS-CoV. We infected cells from Eptesicus fuscus with MERS-CoV and maintained them in culture for at least 126 days. We characterized the persistently infected cells by detecting virus particles, protein and transcripts. Basal levels of type I interferon in the long-term infected bat cells were higher, relative to uninfected cells, and disrupting the interferon response in persistently infected bat cells increased virus replication. By sequencing the whole genome of MERS-CoV from persistently infected bat cells, we identified that bat cells repeatedly selected for viral variants that contained mutations in the viral open reading frame 5 (ORF5) protein. Furthermore, bat cells that were persistently infected with &#916;ORF5 MERS-CoV were resistant to superinfection by wildtype virus, likely due to reduced levels of the virus receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) and higher basal levels of interferon in these cells. In summary, our study provides evidence for a model of coronavirus persistence in bats, along with the establishment of a unique persistently infected cell culture model to study MERS-CoV-bat interactions.","output":"Selection of viral variants during persistent infection of insectivorous bat cells with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of some anti-hypertensive drugs in the current COVID-19 pandemic has become controversial. This study investigated possible relationships between anti-hypertensive medications use and COVID-19 infection risk in the ambulatory hypertensive population. This is a population-based retrospective cohort study involving 34 936 hypertensive adults >50 years in Tarragona (Southern Catalonia, Spain) who were retrospectively followed through pandemic period (from 01/03/2020 to 30/04/2020). Two data sets including demographic/clinical characteristics (comorbidities and cardiovascular medications use) and laboratory PCR codes for COVID-19 were linked to construct an anonymized research database. Cox regression was used to calculate multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) and estimate the risk of suffering COVID-19 infection. Across study period, 205 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases were observed, which means an overall incidence of 586.8 cases per 100 000 persons-period. In multivariable analyses, only age (HR: 1.03; 95% CI: 1.02-1.05; P < .001) and nursing home residence (HR: 19.60; 95% CI: 13.80-27.84; P < .001) appeared significantly associated with increased risk of COVID-19.

By tuning sporulation rates we generate spore-yield and spore-quality strategists that compete with each other in a microscopic life-cycle assay. The quality (yield) strategist is favored when spore revival is triggered by poor (rich) nutrients. We also show that natural isolates from the gut and soil employ different life-cycle strategies that result from genomic variations in the number of rap-phr signaling systems.

Perceived immune fitness before the pandemic (2019) and during the first lockdown period (15 MarchC11 May 2020) and the number and severity of COVID-19 symptoms were assessed. The COTEST study, conducted between December 2020 and June 2021, replicated the CLOFIT study in n = 925 participants who were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Dutch commercial test locations. The CLOFIT study revealed that immune fitness before the pandemic was the greatest predictor of the number and severity of COVID-19 symptoms (20.1% and 19.8%, respectively). Other significant predictors included immune fitness during the lockdown (5.5% and 7.1%, respectively), and having underlying diseases (0.4% and 0.5%, respectively). In the COTEST study, for those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, immune fitness before the pandemic was the single predictor of the number (27.2%) and severity (33.1%) of COVID-19 symptoms during the pandemic. In conclusion, for those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, immune fitness before the pandemic was the strongest predictor of the number and severity of COVID-19 symptoms during the pandemic.

METHODS: A cross-sectional web survey of 11009 adults in China was conducted between 7 May and 3 August 2020. Attitudes towards smoking and COVID-19 were compared among non-smokers (n=8837), ex-smokers (n=399) and current smokers (n=1773), and changes in smoking behaviors before and after the outbreak of COVID-19 were assessed among current smokers. RESULTS: Fewer current smokers (26.2%) agreed with the statement that Current smokers are more likely than ex-smokers or non-smokers to contract COVID-19 compared with non-smokers (53%) or ex-smokers (41.4%); fewer current smokers (55.9%) agreed with the statement If contracted, current smokers are more likely than ex-smokers or non-smokers to risk disease progression compared with non-smokers (75.5%) or ex-smokers (68.7%).

Changing maladaptive hygiene habits has the potential to improve public health. Parents and teachers can play an important role in disinfecting surface areas and in helping children develop healthful handwashing habits. The current study aims to inform a future intervention that will help parents and teachers take up this role using a theoretically and empirically informed behaviour change model called the Capabilities-Opportunities-Motivations-Behaviour (COM-B) model. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was designed to measure participants capabilities, opportunities, and motivations to [1] increase their childrens handwashing with soap and [2] increase their cleaning of surface areas. Additional items captured how often participants believed their children washed their hands. The final survey was administered early in the coronavirus pandemic (May and June 2020) to 3975 participants from Australia, China, India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. Participants self-identified as mums, dads, or teachers of children 5 to 10 years old. ANOVAs analyses were used to compare participant capabilities, opportunities, and motivations across countries for handwashing and surface disinfecting. Multiple regressions analyses were conducted for each country to assess the predictive relationship between the COM-B components and childrens handwashing. RESULTS: The ANOVA analyses revealed that India had the lowest levels of capability, opportunity, and motivation, for both hand hygiene and surface cleaning. The regression analyses revealed that for Australia, Indonesia, and South Africa, the capability component was the only significant predictor of childrens handwashing. For India, capability and opportunity were significant. For the United Kingdom, capability and motivation were significant. Lastly, for Saudi Arabia all components were significant.

In early and mid-1970s Japans elevation to the developed North club position was established with the its becoming a founder member of Group of Seven. Policy domain-wise, Japans good footing in the International Labor Organization and General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade cannot be underestimated. While the four Asian tigers (South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong) dramatically and nimbly solidified their economic position in the 1970s through 1990s, China evolved through waves of upward leaps: first, by opening to Japan and the United States through the 1970s, second through lifting economic sanctions by Japan followed by the rest of the West in the early 1990s after the massacre of the Tiananmen square protesters, and finally with the joining and acquiring privileged status in the World Trade Organization in the early 2000s.

However, data comparing the efficacy of different platinum agents are limited. OBJECTIVE This review aimed to assess the efficacy of carboplatin as a first-line treatment for AMUC using phase 3 randomized trial data. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION Multiple databases were searched for articles published until August 2021. Studies that compared overall survival (OS), complete response (CR), and objective response rates (ORRs) in chemotherapy-eligible patients with AMUC were deemed eligible. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS Four studies were included. Compared with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) monotherapy, neither cisplatin- nor carboplatin-based chemotherapy was associated with significant OS (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.97, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85-1.11, p = 0.64 and HR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.78-1.04, p = 0.16, respectively) and CR (odds ratio [OR]: 1.16, 95% CI: 0.70-1.92, p = 0.57 and OR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.52-1.53, p = 0.67, respectively benefits, while both were associated with a favorable ORR (OR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.40-0.74, p < 0.001 and OR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.42-0.80, p < 0.001, respectively). A network meta-analysis (NMA)-based indirect comparison between carboplatin and cisplatin revealed that while cisplatin was slightly better than carboplatin in terms of OS, CR, and ORR, no significant difference was noted. CONCLUSIONS Cisplatin- and carboplatin-based chemotherapies offer similar OS/CR benefits to ICI monotherapy and elicit a greater ORR than ICI monotherapy. Moreover, our NMA demonstrated that both cisplatin- and carboplatin-based chemotherapy have a similar efficacy in terms of OS, CR, and ORR. Given that carboplatin-based chemotherapy is shown to be more effective in contemporary series than in historical controls, it is strongly recommended that carboplatin be re-examined for its value in the era of ICIs and beyond.

In addition, we describe the real motivations for banks to explore Blockchain, and problems they face. In order to have a good understanding of the industry, a qualitative method was adopted, and sixteen experts were interviewed. It was identified that knowledge hiding in Blockchain was common and the rationale behind was analyzed using the TPB (Theory of Planned Behavior) approach. The analysis results suggested that knowledge hiding was due to affective, behavioral and cognitive evaluations. The interviewees also provided several recommendations and success factors to overcome current issues in Blockchain adoption. Therefore, four important propositions have been developed. Finally, this article suggests how financial services should respond to this new technology and how to manage knowledge sharing in a more structured way.

The intravascular innate immune system (IIIS), including the complement, contact, coagulation, and fibrinolysis systems, which is crucial for recognizing and eliminating microorganisms and debris in the body, is likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 ARDS. Biomarkers for IIIS activation were studied in the first 66 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU in Uppsala University Hospital, both cross-sectionally on day 1 and in 19 patients longitudinally for up to a month, in a prospective study. IIIS analyses were compared with biochemical parameters and clinical outcome and survival. Blood cascade systems activation leading to an overreactive conjunct thromboinflammation was demonstrated, reflected in consumption of individual cascade system components, e.g., FXII, prekallikrein, and high molecular weight kininogen and in increased levels of activation products, e.g., C4d, C3a, C3d,g, sC5b-9, TAT, and D-dimer. Strong associations were found between the blood cascade systems and organ damage, illness severity scores, and survival. We show that critically ill COVID-19 patients display a conjunct activation of the IIIS that is linked to organ damage of the lung, heart, kidneys, and death. We present evidence that the complement and in particular the kallikrein/kinin system is strongly activated and that both systems are prognostic markers of the outcome of the patients suggesting their role in driving the inflammation.

Access to laboratory confirmation is limited and thus most reported figures are based on clinical diagnosis alone, the accuracy of which is uncertain. This systematic review assesses the diagnostic accuracy of the traditional (1997) and revised (2009) WHO clinical case definitions for dengue fever, the basis for most national guidelines. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, OpenGrey, and the annual Dengue Bulletin were searched for studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of the unmodified clinical criteria. Two reviewers (NR/SL) independently assessed eligibility, extracted data, and evaluated risk of bias using a modified QUADAS-2. Additional records were found by citation network analysis. A meta-analysis was done using a bivariate mixed-effects regression model. Studies that modified criteria were analysed separately. This systematic review protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020165998). We identified 11 and 12 datasets assessing the 1997 and 2009 definition, respectively, and 6 using modified criteria. Sensitivity was 93% (95% CI: 77C98) and 93% (95% CI: 86C96) for the 1997 and 2009 definitions, respectively. Specificity was 29% (95% CI: 8C65) and 31% (95% CI: 18C48) for the 1997 and 2009 definitions, respectively. Diagnostic performance suffered at the extremes of age. No modification significantly improved accuracy.

Hence, to collect high-quality data on the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 should be the immediate priority. METHODS: A comprehensive search of Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases was conducted from January 1, 2020 to December 26, 2020 for eligible studies reporting on the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms in patients with COVID-19. Studies meeting the following criteria were included in the analysis: (1) included patients with COVD-19; (2) recorded the prevalence of depression, anxiety, or insomnia symptom; (3) sample size 30; (4) with validated screening tools; and (5) passed through the international peer-review process. Data extraction and quality assessment was independently performed by two reviewers. The quality effects meta-analysis was conducted further to calculate the pooled prevalence. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies were included for analysis with a total of 4318 patients. The pooled prevalence of depression, anxiety and insomnia symptoms was 38% (95% CI = 25C51), 38% (95% CI = 24C52), and 48% (95% CI = 11C85), respectively. Neither subgroup analysis nor sensitivity analysis can explain the source of high heterogeneity. In addition, the prevalence estimates of depression, anxiety and insomnia symptoms varied based on different screening tools. CONCLUSIONS: The present systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that depression, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms are prevalent in a considerable proportion of patients with COVID-19. Thus, early detection and properly intervention for mental illness in this population are of great significance.

The bottleneck will get worse by a factor of 20 (or more) once LSST comes on line. We need to fundamentally rethink the purpose of surveys for transients. Here, after undertaking a detailed investigation of this issue I offer some solutions. Going forward, astronomers will employ two different methodologies: (1) multi-band photometric method which is well suited to the study of very large, many tens of thousands, samples of faint transients; (2) spectral classifications of thousands of bright transients found in shallow and nightly cadenced wide-field photometry surveys and transients associated with galaxies in the local Universe. The latter program, in addition to unearthing new types of transients and offering astronomers opportunities to undertake extensive follow up of interesting transients, is needed to set the stage for the former. Specifically, I suggest a globally coordinated effort to spectrally classify a complete sample of bright supernovae (<~19.5 mag) and transients within the local Universe (<200 Mpc) The proposed program is within reach -- thanks to the on-going wide-field surveys, the development of novel spectrographs tuned for classification, great improvements in throughput of spectrographs and the increasing availability of robotic telescopes.","output":"Towards An Integrated Optical Transient Utility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During COVID-19, supply chain (SC) mapping has appeared as one of the critical supply chain capabilities that could make a striking difference in organisations' supply chain performance.

Predicting them requires multi-class classifiers whose training and desired reliable performance can be affected by a combination of factors, such as, dataset size, data source, distribution, and the loss function used to train deep neural networks. Currently, the cross-entropy loss remains the de-facto loss function for training deep learning classifiers. This loss function, however, asserts equal learning from all classes, leading to a bias toward the majority class. Although the choice of the loss function impacts model performance, to the best of our knowledge, we observed that no literature exists that performs a comprehensive analysis and selection of an appropriate loss function toward the classification task under study. In this work, we benchmark various state-of-the-art loss functions, critically analyze model performance, and propose improved loss functions for a multi-class classification task. We select a pediatric chest X-ray (CXR) dataset that includes images with no abnormality (normal), and those exhibiting manifestations consistent with bacterial and viral pneumonia.

Patients and Methods We conducted a systematic literature search in MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science from inception to August 2020. References and abstracts were screened independently by two authors. Included studies were case reports and case series reporting endogenous TB endophthalmitis and panophthalmitis secondary to Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC). Available-case analysis was employed to handle missing data. Results A total of 1343 articles were found using the search strategy. Following abstract screening, 51 articles were selected for full text-review, from which 26 were deemed eligible for inclusion in the study. Forty-four cases from 26 articles were included in the quantitative analysis. The median age of presentation was 29.5 (range: 1 to 81), and 11/44 patients (25.0%) were pediatric. Immunosuppression was seen in 9/36 cases (25.0%). Most patients (24/38, 63.2%) had no prior history of tuberculosis. Systemic symptoms were absent in half of the patients (16/32, 50.0%). Visual acuity was poor, with 23/27 cases (85.2%) being 20/200 or worse at presentation. Poor organ and visual outcomes were reported: 36/43 cases (83.7%) resulted in enucleation/evisceration or exenteration. Intraocular tumors were suspected in 5/34 cases (14.7%). Pulmonary tuberculosis was seen in 15/35 cases (42.8%), and miliary tuberculosis was seen in 7/35 cases (20.0%).

Conclusion TB endophthalmitis is a rare and sight-threatening manifestation of ocular tuberculosis. It can occur in apparently healthy individuals and can mimic intraocular tumors and other infectious etiologies. Diagnosis remains a significant challenge, which, often delayed, leads to profound visual loss.

Pediatric severe asthma is a heterogeneous disease, and a multidisciplinary approach can improve the diagnosis and management of these children. METHODS We reviewed the electronic health records for patients seen in the Severe Asthma Clinic (SAC) at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh between August 2012 and October 2019. RESULTS Of the 110 patients in whom we extracted data, 46% were female, 48% were Black/African American, and 41% had 1 admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for asthma. Compared to patients without a PICU admission, those with 1 PICU admission were more likely to be non-White (64.4% vs 41.5%, P=0.031) and more atopic (eosinophil count geometric mean= 673 vs 319 cells/mm3 , P=0.002; total IgE geometric mean=754 vs 303 KU/L, P=0.003), and to have lower pre-bronchodilator FEV1 (58.6% [18.1%] vs 69.9% [18.7%], P=0.002) and elevated FeNO (60% vs 22%, P=0.02). In this cohort, 84% of patients were prescribed high-dose ICS/LABA and 36% were on biologics. Following enrollment in the SAC, severe exacerbations decreased from 3.2/year to 2.2/year (P<0.0001); compared to the year prior to joining the SAC, in the following year the group had 106 fewer severe exacerbations. CONCLUSIONS This large cohort of children with severe asthma had a high level of morbidity and healthcare utilization.

This was followed by pre-randomized twice daily use of one of three topical interventions on one half of the face. TEWL, pH, and hydration were assessed on each quadrant of the face at all visits. Additionally, photographs were subjectively graded by three blinded trained observers. RESULTS Thirty subjects were enrolled, and had an average 27.1 (SD 11.8, range: 13-62) palpable AKs at baseline. Average resolution of baseline AK count was 98.1% by week 4.

During this ongoing situation children of parents, who already were mentally stressed, seem particularly at risk. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the role of maternal daily perceived stress on childrens mental health during the SARS-CoV-2-pandemic. METHODS: An online SARS-CoV-2-pandemic survey was developed to assess childrens mental health since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. To describe maternal perceived everyday stress, data from a longitudinal survey was utilized. Our survey includes elements and versions of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and the Perceived Stress Scale. We furthermore collected socio-demographic data. Due to our limited dependent variables we applied Tobit models for estimation. RESULTS: We found a positive and significant effect of the maternal perceived everyday stress on childrens emotional problems during the pandemic. Furthermore, results provide empirical evidence for an increase of the children's hyperactivity level dependent on the mothers perceived stress before the SARS-COV-2 crisis. We could not find significant effects for the relationship between mothers perceived everyday stress and the children's behavioral problems.

We inserted blood collection catheters into the jejunal and portal veins, suprahepatic inferior vena cava, and carotid artery of 4 female pigs aged 8 weeks. Then, within 2 min we infused 500 ml of either H2-rich or H2-free glucose solution into the jejunum via a percutaneous gastrostomy tube and measured changes in H2 concentration in venous and arterial blood over 120 min. After infusion of the H2-rich glucose solution, H2 concentration in the portal vein peaked at 0.05 mg/L and remained at more than 0.016 mg/L (H2 saturation level, 1%) after 1 h; it also increased after infusion of H2-free glucose solution but remained below 0.001 mg/L (H2 saturation level, 0.06%). We assume that H2 was subsequently metabolized in the liver or eliminated via the lungs because it was not detected in the carotid artery. In conclusion, drinking highly concentrated H2-rich solution within a short time is a good way to increase H2 concentration in portal blood and supply H2 to the liver.","output":"Pharmacokinetics of hydrogen after ingesting a hydrogen-rich solution: A study in pigs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Recent studies have shown a decline in theatre efficiency and productivity coinciding with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic In this study, we evaluate trauma theatre task efficiency in three different Lime periods (April 2019, April 2020, and November 2020), and analyse if productivity has altered since the start of the pandemic Methods The records of a total of 320 patients who underwent orthopaedic trauma surgery at a large district general hospital in April 2019, April 2020 (during the first wave of the pandemic) and November 2020 (during the second wave of the pandemic) were analysed Primary outcomes measured include time to get to the theatre, anaesthetic preparation time, the sum of time of anaesthesia and surgical preparation time, duration of surgery and time to transfer to recovery Patient demographics as well as the type of surgery were also analysed Results The time to gel to the theatre and anaesthetic preparation time significantly increased in April 2020 (p0 05) The duration of surgery and time to transfer to recovery significantly increased in April 2020 (p&lt;0 05) and though reduced in November 2020, was still significantly greater in comparison to April 2019 (p&lt;0 05) In April 2020, the proportion of patients aged 18-65 was just 26% as compared to 35% in April 2019 This figure rose again to 45% in November 2020 The number of hip fracture procedures remained similar during the three time periods, with 32, 32 and 36 hip fracture operations in April 2019, April 2020 and November 2020, respectively Conclusion While operating theatres' efficiency decreased during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, it increased again in the second wave, coming close to the 'normal' levels before the pandemic struck","output":"Orthopaedic Trauma Theatre Efficiency in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Are We Returning to Normality?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ability of coronaviruses to infect humans is invariably associated with their binding strengths to human receptor proteins.

Although high-resolution structural snapshots of viral fusion proteins in their prefusion and postfusion conformations are available, it has been difficult to define intermediate structures of the fusion pathway because of their transient nature. Flaviviruses possess a class II viral fusion protein (E) mediating fusion at acidic pH that is converted from a dimer to a trimer with a hairpin-like structure during the fusion process. Here we show for tick-borne encephalitis virus that exposure of virions to alkaline instead of acidic pH traps the particles in an intermediate conformation in which the E dimers dissociate and interact with target membranes via the fusion peptide without proceeding to the merger of the membranes. Further treatment to low pH, however, leads to fusion, suggesting that these monomers correspond to an as-yet-elusive intermediate required to convert the prefusion dimer into the postfusion trimer. Thus, the use of nonphysiological conditions allows a dissection of the flavivirus fusion process and the identification of two separate steps, in which membrane insertion of multiple copies of E monomers precedes the formation of hairpin-like trimers. This sequence of events provides important new insights for understanding the dynamic process of viral membrane fusion.","output":"Characterization of a Structural Intermediate of Flavivirus Membrane Fusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Emergency department personnel routinely bear witness to traumatic experiences and critical incidents that can affect their own well-being. Peer support through debriefing has demonstrated positive impacts on clinicians well-being following critical incidents. This study explored community hospital emergency department staffs perceptions of critical incidents, assessed openness to debriefing and measured baseline well-being. Our analysis provides a baseline of provider well-being immediately prior to the local onset of COVID-19. The potential need for additional resources to support frontline providers during the pandemic can be evaluated. METHOD: We conducted a cross-sectional study for 4-weeks prior to the first COVID-19 case in Connecticut using a survey offered to an interprofessional group of emergency department clinical staff. The main outcome measures were the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Professional Quality of Life (ProQOL) scale. Pearsons chi-square test was used to identify significant differences in perceptions of critical incidents and debriefings between professional categories. One-way ANOVA and Tukeys test were used to analyze significant differences in well-being between professional categories. RESULTS: Thirty-nine clinical personnel from St. Vincents Emergency Department responded to the survey. Events frequently selected as critical incidents were caring for critically ill children (89.7%), mass casualty events (84.6%), and death of a patient (69.2%). Critical incidents were commonly reported (81.6%) as occurring once per week. Additionally, 76.2% of participants reported wanting to discuss a critical incident with their team. Across all respondents, 45.7% scored borderline or abnormal for anxiety, 55.9% scored moderate for burnout, and 55.8% scored moderate to high for secondary traumatic stress. CONCLUSIONS: At baseline, providers reported caring for critically ill children, mass casualty events, and death of a patient as critical incidents, which typically occurred once per week. Death of a patient occurs at increased frequency during the protracted mass casualty experience of COVID-19 and threatens provider well-being. Receptiveness to post-event debriefing is high but the method is still underutilized. With nearly half of staff scoring borderline or abnormal for anxiety, burnout, and secondary traumatic stress at baseline, peer support measures should be implemented to protect frontline providers well-being during and after the pandemic.","output":"Baseline well-being, perceptions of critical incidents, and openness to debriefing in community hospital emergency department clinical staff before COVID-19, a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In a Jan. 26 open letter to President Biden, the National Association of Addiction Treatment Providers (NAATP) called for COVID\\\\19 vaccines to be prioritized for people with substance use disorders and their treatment providers, to ensure that treatment providers are identified as front\\\\line health workers with access to personal protective equipment; require data collection of all COVID\\\\19 testing, cases and deaths by race, ethnicity, disability status, gender identity, sexual orientation and age; and revise the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' definition of telehealth in the Medicare program to authorize and allow reimbursement of audio\\\\only service delivery.

METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted using EMBASE, PubMed/Medline, and Google Scholar from January 2020 to 7 January 2021 to identify all studies describing clinical profile, outcome and mortality rates regarding DKA, HHS, DKA/HHS and EDKA cases in COVID-19 patients. The appropriate Joanna Briggs Institute tools were used for quality assessment; quality of evidence was approached using GRADE. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess correlations between clinical characteristics and outcome based on case reports. Combined mortality rates (CMR) were estimated from data reported in case report series, cross-sectional studies, and meta-analyses. The protocol was submitted to PROSPERO (ID: 229356/230737). RESULTS: From 312 identified publications, 44 were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed. Critical COVID-19 necessitating ICU (P = 3  10(C8)), DKA/HHS presence (P = 0.021), and AKI (P = 0.037) were independently correlated with death. Increased COVID-19 severity (P = 0.003), elevated lactates (P < 0.001), augmented anion gap (P < 0.001), and AKI (P = 0.002) were associated with DKA/HHS.

METHODS: We recruited 55 patients with HBV-related liver failure, 48 patients with chronic hepatitis B and 40 healthy controls (HCs) from Nantong Third People's Hospital Affiliated to Nantong University. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated, and the percentage and number of circulating MAIT cells were detected by flow cytometry. Plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-7, IL-12p70, IL-18 and interferon-&#945; were measured by Luminex assay. RESULTS: Circulating MAIT cells were significantly decreased in HBV-related liver failure patients (percentage: 2.00  1.22 vs 5.19  1.27%, P < 0.0001; number: 5.47  4.93 vs 84.43  19.59, P < 0.0001) compared with HCs. More importantly, there was a significant reduction of MAIT cells in patients with middle/late-stage compared with early-stage liver failure. Circulating MAIT cells partially recovered after disease improvement, both in percentage (4.01  1.21 vs 2.04  0.95%, P < 0.0001) and in cell count (17.24  8.56 vs 7.41  4.99, P < 0.0001).

Patients were categorized into three groups based on disease severity. Patients demographic and clinical characteristics, mortality rates, and mortality-associated factors were analyzed. RESULTS: The overall mortality rate was 4.3% (23/540). Disease severity was mild in 40.9% (n = 221), severe in 53.7% (n = 290), and critical in 5.4% (n = 29) of the patients. There were significant differences among groups in terms of median white blood cell (WBC), hemoglobin, neutrophil, lymphocyte, and thrombocyte counts, as well as C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatinine, albumin, D-dimer, ferritin, troponin, and fibrinogen levels. Furthermore, there were significant differences between surviving and non-surviving patient groups in terms of median WBC, hemoglobin, neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts, as well as CRP, procalcitonin, LDH, creatinine, albumin, D-dimer, and ferritin levels.

The clinical characteristics and imaging/laboratory findings including chest computed tomography (CT), initial blood count, C-reactive protein [CRP]), procalcitonin (PCT) and serum total IgE were captured and analysed. Results (1) The first symptoms of all age groups were primarily fever (76%), followed by cough (12%) and dyspnoea (5%). Beside fever, the most common initial symptom of elderly patients was fatigue (13%). (2) Fever was the most common clinical manifestation (80%), with moderate fever being the most common (40%), followed by low fever in patients above 40 years old and high fever in those under 40 years (35%). Cough was the second most common clinical manifestation and was most common (80%) in the middle-aged. Diarrhoea was more common in the middle-aged (21%) and the older (19%). Muscle ache was more common in the middle-aged (15%). Chest pain was more common in the youth (13%), and 13% of the youth had no symptoms. (3) The proportion of patients with comorbidities increased with age. (4) Seventy-one per cent of the patients had positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction results and 29% had positive chest CT scans before admission to the hospital.

Departing from a dataset containing the Euclidean positions of all players during 60 matches of the Spanish national league (30 from LaLiga Santander and 30 from LaLiga Smartbank, respectively, the first and second divisions), we analysed 1,670 participations of elite soccer players.

Furthermore, when the player position is taken into account, we observe that goalkeepers are the players with the lowest exposure (lower than 1 min), while forwards are the players with the highest values of the accumulated time (~21 min). In this regard, defender-forward interactions are the most frequent. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest dataset describing the proximity between soccer players.

However, important differences exist between commonly used experimental models of endotoxemia and clinical sepsis. Animal models of endotoxemia frequently produce hypodynamic shock in contrast to clinical hyperdynamic shock. This difference may exaggerate the importance of hypoperfusion as a causative factor in organ dysfunction. This study sought to develop an ovine model of hyperdynamic endotoxemia and assess if there is evidence of impaired oxidative metabolism in the vital organs. METHODS Eight sheep had microdialysis catheters implanted into the brain, heart, liver, kidney, and arterial circulation. Shock was induced with a 4 h escalating dose infusion of endotoxin. After 3 h vasopressor support was initiated with noradrenaline and vasopressin. Animals were monitored for 12 h after endotoxemia. Blood samples were recovered for hemoglobin, white blood cell count, creatinine, and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1Beta, IL-6, and IL-8). RESULTS The endotoxin infusion was successful in producing distributive shock with the mean arterial pressure decreasing from 84.5  12.8 mm Hg to 49  8.03 mm Hg (P < 0.001).

Indeed, extant research has revealed interesting findings in this regard. However, the literature on the impact of these biases on millennials' trading activity, particularly during a health crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the equity recommendation intentions of such investors, is limited. The present study addressed these gaps by investigating the influence of eight behavioral biases: overconfidence and self-attribution, over-optimism, hindsight, representativeness, anchoring, loss aversion, mental accounting, and herding on the trading activity and recommendation intentions of millennials during the pandemic. An artificial neural network approach was used to analyze the data collected from 351 millennial men in Finland. The results revealed that herding, hindsight, overconfidence and self-attribution, representativeness, and anchoring influence both trading activity and recommendation intentions, albeit to varying extents. Notably, loss aversion and mental accounting influence only the recommendation intentions. Furthermore, the relationship of the two endogenous variables is nonlinear with herding, representativeness, and anchoring but is linear with other biases. In addition to the quantitative study, we also conducted a post hoc qualitative study with 19 millennials to evaluate the persistence of behavioral biases among them through the pandemic.

They can effectively obliterate bacterial biofilms and have great potential in medical treatment, the food industry, and pollution control. There are intricate mechanisms of interaction between phages and biofilms. Biofilms may prevent the invasion of phages, and phages can kill bacteria for biofilm control purposes or influence the formation of biofilms. At present, there are various measures for the prevention and control of biofilms through phages, including the combined use of drugs and the application of phage cocktails.

The capacity of these private network interconnects is provisioned to match the volume of the real content demand by the users. Unfortunately, in case of a surge in traffic demand, for example due to a content trending in a certain country, the capacity of the private interconnect may deplete and the content provider/distributor would have to reroute the excess traffic through transit providers. Although, such overflow events are rare, they have significant negative impacts on content providers, Internet service providers, and end-users. These include unexpected delays and disruptions reducing the user experience quality, as well as direct costs paid by the Internet service provider to the transit providers. If the traffic overflow events could be predicted, the Internet service providers would be able to influence the routes chosen for the excess traffic to reduce the costs and increase user experience quality. In this article we propose a method based on an ensemble of deep learning models to predict overflow events over a short term horizon of 2-6 hours and predict the specific interconnections that will ingress the overflow traffic. The method was evaluated with 2.5 years' traffic measurement data from a large European Internet service provider resulting in a true-positive rate of 0.8 while maintaining a 0.05 false-positive rate.

The integrated perspective that Agenda 2030 calls for is ever more important for understanding the vulnerability of our eco-socio-economic systems and for designing policies for enhanced resilience. Since the emergence of COVID-19, countries and international institutions have strengthened their monitoring systems to produce timely data on infections, fostering data-driven decision-making often without the support of systemic-based simulation models. Evidence from the initial phases of the pandemic indicates that countries that were able to implement effective policies before the number of cases grew large (e.g. Australia) managed to contain COVID-19 to a much greater extent than others. We argue that prior systemic knowledge of a phenomenon provides the essential information to correctly interpret data, develop a better understanding of the emerging behavioural patterns and potentially develop early qualitative awareness of how to react promptly in the early phases of destructive phenomena, eventually providing the ground for building more effective simulation models capable of better anticipating the effects of policies. This is even more important as, on its path to 2030, humanity will face other challenges of similar dynamic nature. Chief among these is Climate Change. In this paper, we show how a Systems Thinking and System Dynamics modelling approach is useful for developing a better understanding of these and other issues, and how systemic lessons learned from the COVID-19 case can help decision makers anticipate the destructive dynamics of Climate Change by improving perceptions of the potential impacts of reinforcing feedback and delays, ultimately leading to more timely interventions to achieve the SDGs and mitigate Climate Change risks.","output":"Anticipating human resilience and vulnerability on the path to 2030: what can we learn from COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Past literature has illustrated that language models do not fully understand the context and sensitivity of text and can sometimes memorize phrases or sentences present in their training sets.

Due to this heterogeneous presentation and the resultant clinical dilemma in the early detection, acute thrombolysis even now remains as a very rarely tried therapeutic option in children.

RESULTS: The percentage of referrals due to primary RRD during the first year of pandemic (March 2020CFebruary 2021) was 16.5% (p=0.179) lower than a year earlier. The percentage of referrals during the first, second and third wave of the pandemic was 48.4%, 18.5% and 26.1% (p=0.029, 0.475, 0.343) lower than in the corresponding months of 2019. A rebound effect was observed only after the first wave. The numbers of referrals in April and May 2021 were similar as in the corresponding months of 2019.

The reliability of biochemical data derived from these measurements is dependent on the quality of the sample collection and exact preparation and analysis protocols. Here, we describe systematically, the impact of variations in sample collection and preparation on information recovery from quantitative proton ((1)H) NMR spectroscopy of human blood plasma and serum. The effects of variation of blood collection tube sizes and preservatives, successive freezeCthaw cycles, sample storage at ?80 C, and short-term storage at 4 and 20 C on the quantitative lipoprotein and metabolite patterns were investigated. Storage of plasma samples at 4 C for up to 48 h, freezing at ?80 C and blood sample collection tube choice have few and minor effects on quantitative lipoprotein profiles, and even storage at 4 C for up to 168 h caused little information loss. In contrast, the impact of heat-treatment (56 C for 30 min), which has been used for inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses, that may be required prior to analytical measurements in low level biosecurity facilities induced marked changes in both lipoprotein and low molecular weight metabolite profiles. It was conclusively demonstrated that this heat inactivation procedure degrades lipoproteins and changes metabolic information in complex ways. Plasma from control individuals and SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are differentially altered resulting in the creation of artifactual pseudo-biomarkers and destruction of real biomarkers to the extent that data from heat-treated samples are largely uninterpretable. We also present several simple blood sample handling recommendations for optimal NMR-based biomarker discovery investigations in SARS CoV-2 studies and general clinical biomarker research.","output":"Quantitative In-Vitro Diagnostic NMR Spectroscopy for Lipoprotein and Metabolite Measurements in Plasma and Serum: Recommendations for Analytical Artifact Minimization with Special Reference to COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 Samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Determine the early impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on emergency department (ED) encounters for suicide attempt and intentional self-harm at a regional tertiary academic medical centre in Washtenaw County, Michigan, which is one of the wealthier and more diverse counties in the state.

Recent developments in Web-based and smartphone technologies have offered government and nongovernment organizations a new system to disseminate and acquire information. However, research into this area is still lacking. The current study focuses largely on how new social networking websites and, in particular, smartphone technologies could have helped in the acquisition of crucial research data from the general population during the recent 2013 Southeast Asian Haze. This crisis lasted only for 1 week, and is unlike other crisis where there are large-scale consequential after-effects. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether respondents will make use of Internet, social media, and smartphone technologies to provide feedback regarding their physical and psychological wellbeing during a crisis, and if so, will these new mechanisms be as effective as conventional, technological, Internet-based website technologies. METHODS: A Web-based database and a smartphone application were developed. Participants were recruited by snowball sampling. The participants were recruited either via a self-sponsored Facebook post featuring a direct link to the questionnaire on physical and psychological wellbeing and also a smartphone Web-based application; or via dissemination of the questionnaire link by emails, directed to the same group of participants. Information pertaining to physical and psychological wellbeing was collated. RESULTS: A total of 298 respondents took part in the survey. Most of them were between the ages of 20 to 29 years and had a university education. More individuals preferred the option of accessing and providing feedback to a survey on physical and psychological wellbeing via direct access to a Web-based questionnaire. Statistical analysis showed that demographic variables like age, gender, and educational levels did not influence the mechanism of access. In addition, the participants reported a mean number of 4.03 physical symptoms (SD 2.6). The total Impact of Event ScaleCRevised (IES-R) score was 18.47 (SD 11.69), which indicated that the study population did experience psychological stress but not post-traumatic stress disorder. The perceived dangerous Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) level and the number of physical symptoms were associated with higher IES-R Score (P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first few studies demonstrating the use of Internet in data collection during an air-pollution crisis. Our results demonstrated that the newer technological modalities have the potential to acquire data, similar to that of conventional technologies. Demographic variables did not influence the mechanism of usage.

Rhein is a major component of the medicinal Rhubarb. The aim of this study was to investigate whether Rhein protects against renal injury and explore its underlying mechanism. METHODS: 5/6 nephrectomization (5/6 Nx) was operated on Sprague-Dawley rats. Human kidney tubular epithelial (HK-2) cells were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The level of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (SCr) was examined. Kidney tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin to check the morphology. The cell viability was examined. The levels of cytokines and chemokines were measured by ELISA kit. The protein expression was determined by western blot. RESULTS: Rhein significantly decreased SCr and BUN levels in 5/6 Nx rat. The morphologic findings indicated noteworthy amelioration of the damaged renal tissue in Rhein-treated rats. Rhein significantly protects HK-2 cells from LPS-mediated apoptosis. The productions of inflammatory signaling molecules (TNF-&#945;, IL-6 and MCP-1) were inhibited by Rhein.

Magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate (MgIG), a novel glycyrrhizin extracted from the traditional Chinese medicine licorice, has a significant protective effect against concanavalin A (ConA)-induced liver injury, but its underlying therapeutic mechanism is unclear. Hence, this study aims to explore the potential therapeutic mechanism of MgIG against ConA-induced immune liver injury. Methods: ConA (20 mg/kg, i. v.) was administered for 12 h to construct an immune liver injury model, and the treatment group was given MgIG (30 mg/kg, i. p.) injection 1 h in advance. Lethality, liver injury, cytokine levels, and hepatocyte death were evaluated. The level of autophagy was evaluated by electron microscopy, RT-PCR and western blotting, and hepatocyte death was assessed in vitro by flow cytometry. Results: MgIG significantly increased the survival rate of mice and ameliorated severe liver injury mediated by ConA. The decrease in the number of autophagosomes, downregulation of LC3b expression and upregulation of p62 expression indicated that MgIG significantly inhibited ConA-induced autophagy in the liver. Reactivation of autophagy by rapamycin (RAPA) reversed the protective effect of MgIG against ConA-induced liver injury. Compared with MgIG treatment, activation of autophagy by RAPA also promoted the expression of liver inflammation markers (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-, CXCL-1, CXCL-2, CXCL-10, etc.) and hepatocyte death. In vitro experiments also showed that MgIG reduced ConA-induced hepatocyte death but did not decrease hepatocyte apoptosis by inhibiting autophagy. Conclusion: MgIG significantly ameliorated ConA-induced immune liver injury in mice by inhibiting autophagy. This study provides theoretical support for the ability of MgIG to protect against liver injury in clinical practice.","output":"Magnesium Isoglycyrrhizinate Ameliorates Concanavalin A-Induced Liver Injury by Inhibiting Autophagy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: To describe (i) self\\\\reported changes in drug use and (ii) trends in price, perceived availability, and perceived purity of illicit drugs, among people who regularly use ecstasy/ 3,4\\\\methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and other illicit stimulants in Australia following COVID\\\\19 and associated restrictions. DESIGN: Annual interviews with cross\\\\sectional sentinel samples conducted face\\\\to\\\\face in 2016C19 and via video conferencing or telephone in 2020.

PARTICIPANTS: Australians aged 16 years or older who used ecstasy/MDMA and other illicit stimulants on a monthly or more frequent basis and resided in a capital city, recruited via social media and word\\\\of\\\\mouth (n ~ 800 each year). MEASUREMENTS: Key outcome measures were self\\\\reported illicit drug market indicators (price, purity and availability) and, in 2020 only, perceived change in drug use (including alcohol and tobacco) since March 2020 and reasons for this change. FINDINGS: For most drugs, participants reported either no change or a reduction in their use since COVID\\\\19 restrictions were introduced. Ecstasy/MDMA was the drug most frequently cited as reduced in use (n = 552, 70% of those reporting recent use), mainly due to reduced opportunities for socialization. While market indicators were largely stable across most drugs, the odds of perceiving MDMA capsules as high in purity decreased compared with 2016C19 [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.53C0.99], as did perceiving them as easy to obtain (aOR = 0.42, CI = 0.26C0.67).

Our study describes the impact of the first COVID-19 wave and the associated national lockdown in England and Wales on the referrals from general practice to the Identification and Referral to Improve Safety (IRIS) DVA programme. We compare this to the change in referrals in the same months in the previous year, during the school holidays in the 3 years preceding the pandemic and the period just after the first COVID-19 wave. School holiday periods were chosen as a comparator, since families, including the perpetrator, are together, affecting access to services. METHODS: We used anonymised data on daily referrals received by the IRIS DVA service in 33 areas from general practices over the period April 2017CSeptember 2020. Interrupted-time series and non-linear regression were used to quantify the impact of the first national lockdown in MarchCJune 2020 comparing analogous months the year before, and the impact of school holidays (01/04/2017C30/09/2020) on number of referrals, reporting Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR), 95% confidence intervals and p-values. RESULTS: The first national lockdown in 2020 led to reduced number of referrals to DVA services (27%, 95%CI = (21,34%)) compared to the period before and after, and 19% fewer referrals compared to the same period in the year before. A reduction in the number of referrals was also evident during the school holidays with the highest reduction in referrals during the winter 2019 pre-pandemic school holiday (44%, 95%CI = (32,54%)) followed by the effect from the summer of 2020 school holidays (20%, 95%CI = (10,30%)). There was also a smaller reduction (13C15%) in referrals during the longer summer holidays 2017C2019; and some reduction (5C16%) during the shorter spring holidays 2017C2019. CONCLUSIONS: We show that the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 led to decline in referrals to DVA services. Our findings suggest an association between decline in referrals to DVA services for women experiencing DVA and prolonged periods of systemic closure proxied here by both the first COVID-19 national lockdown or school holidays.

Given the significant demand for nasopharyngeal swabs, a large number of previously untrained and unfamiliar staff are now performing this test. It was noted that there was significant heterogeneity in instructions for performing nasopharyngeal swabs in Canada, in contrast to the guidance provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). The objective of this study was to review the instructions provided across Canada and contrast them to those of the CDC and PAHO. METHODS: A standard series of steps for nasopharyngeal swab performance was outlined based on the CDC, PAHO, and New England Journal of Medicine instructions. A comprehensive search was performed in August 2020 to identify nasopharyngeal swab guidelines provided by public health in the provinces and territories of Canada. Regional health authority guidance was also collected. Instructions provided were contrasted against the standardized steps. RESULTS: Instructions were identified for all provinces and territories, and for 81 regional health authorities. From the provincial and territorial guidelines, 10/13 (77%) cleared the nasal passages before swab insertion, 11/13 (85%) tilted the patients head back slightly, 12/13 (92%) inserted the swab parallel to the palate, but only 3/13 (23%) inserted the swab to at least a depth of two-thirds the distance between the patients nose and ear. A clear majority (81%) of regional health authority guidelines followed their respective provincial guidelines. For depth of insertion, Quebec provided a pictogram but no distance or technique for estimation. Six provinces and territories - Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Ontario, Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island and Alberta - recommended 4 cm or one-half the distance from nostrils to ear. British Columbia and Manitoba recommended a 7 cm depth of insertion. Nova Scotia recommended one-half to two-thirds the distance from nose to ear. Lastly, Newfoundland, New Brunswick and the Yukon recommended an insertion from nose to the external ear canal.

Recently, a new type of viral infection emerged in Wuhan City, China, and initial genomic sequencing data of this virus do not match with previously sequenced CoVs, suggesting a novel CoV strain (2019-nCoV), which has now been termed severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is suspected to originate from an animal host (zoonotic origin) followed by human-to-human transmission, the possibility of other routes should not be ruled out. Compared to diseases caused by previously known human CoVs, COVID-19 shows less severe pathogenesis but higher transmission competence, as is evident from the continuously increasing number of confirmed cases globally. Compared to other emerging viruses, such as Ebola virus, avian H7N9, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 has shown relatively low pathogenicity and moderate transmissibility. Codon usage studies suggest that this novel virus has been transferred from an animal source, such as bats. Early diagnosis by real-time PCR and next-generation sequencing has facilitated the identification of the pathogen at an early stage. Since no antiviral drug or vaccine exists to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2, potential therapeutic strategies that are currently being evaluated predominantly stem from previous experience with treating SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other emerging viral diseases. In this review, we address epidemiological, diagnostic, clinical, and therapeutic aspects, including perspectives of vaccines and preventive measures that have already been globally recommended to counter this pandemic virus.","output":"Coronavirus Disease 2019-COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction LUNG INJURY COVID-19 (clinicaltrials.gov NCT 21/399-E) is a registry-based prospective observational cohort study to evaluate long-term outcomes and recovery 12 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection according to severity.

At the onset of the virus detection in the State of Qatar, a free-testing system was rapidly established to invite individuals who had recently returned from countries with a COVID-19 disease travel warning to avoid putting other people at risk. The testing site needed to be accessible to individuals without requiring them to enter the hospital and congregate in a waiting area. The aim of this article is to share our experience with the early implementation of a drive-through testing clinic using the invited person's vehicle as an isolation compartment during screening to minimize person-to-person contamination. Methods: A Hamad Medical Corporation site was selected to stage a drive-through testing facility to avoid congestion and offer space to facilitate the process. A process was rapidly agreed upon, and staff received the required training regarding infection control measures and documentation. At the testing site, individuals were subjected to the following steps: registration and history taking, temperature measurement, swabbing, and receipt of a sick leave certificate and a flyer about self-quarantine. Results: Over the first six days of implementation, the relevant authorities determined that 687 individuals had to be contacted, 103 attended their testing appointment in that period, and an additional 327 people (close relations of the individuals contacted or individuals contacted but without a health card) also subjected themselves to the testing process, which took a median time of 11 minutes 39 seconds. No individual exhibited symptoms that warranted immediate isolation while they were at the drive-through testing clinic. However, four individuals were diagnosed with COVID-19 following laboratory analysis of the swab taken and followed up. The median time between swab collection and laboratory testing was 13 hours 41 minutes 59 seconds. Conclusions: Collaboration among various key health, governmental, and travel industry partners was essential to the successful and rapid implementation of a COVID-19 drive-through testing clinic in the early days of the pandemic in Qatar. The general public reacted well to this process. Communication, coordination, and planning were identified as critical factors at every step of the process. It started from the initial call to the travelers who had recently returned from a country with a newly instituted travel warning and concluded by them leaving with their sick leave certificate and an information flyer with reminders about preventative infection control measures and encouraging them to self-quarantine after having been swabbed.","output":"Implementation of a drive-through testing clinic in Qatar for residents having recently returned from a country with a COVID-19 travel warning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Impaired immune response has been described to be the cause of the development of COVID-19 related respiratory failure. Further studies are needed to understand the immunopathogenesis and to enable an improved stratification of patients that are at risk for critical illness. METHODS: 32 severely ill hospitalized COVID19 patients were recruited in our center at the University Hospital Heidelberg. We performed a comprehensive analysis of immune phenotype, cytokine and chemokine profiling and leukocyte transcripts in severe COVID-19 patients comparing critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation and high flow oxygen therapy and non-critically ill patient receiving low flow oxygen therapy. RESULTS: Critically ill patients exhibited low levels of CD8 T cells and myeloid dendritic cells. We noted a pronounced CCR6 (+) TH17 phenotype in CD4 central memory cells and elevated circulating levels of IL-17 in the critical group. Gene expression of leukocytes derived from critically ill patients was characterized by an upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and reduction of IFN-responsive genes upon stimulation with toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist. When correlating clinical improvement and immune kinetics, we found that CD8 T cell subsets and myeloid dendritic cells significantly increased after disconnection from the ventilator. CONCLUSION: Critical illness was characterized by a TH17-mediated response and dysfunctional IFN-associated response, indicating an impaired capacity to mount antiviral responses during SARS-CoV-2 severe infection.","output":"Dysregulated host response in SARS-CoV-2 induced critical illness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Laboratory testing for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) consists of two pillars: the detection of viral RNA via rt-PCR as the diagnostic gold standard in acute cases, and the detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. However, concerning the latter, questions remain about their diagnostic and prognostic value and it is not clear whether all patients develop detectable antibodies. We examined sera from 347 Spanish COVID-19 patients, collected during the peak of the epidemic outbreak in Spain, for the presence of IgA and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and evaluated possible associations with age, sex and disease severity (as measured by duration of hospitalization, kind of respiratory support, treatment in ICU and death). The presence and to some degree the levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies depended mainly on the amount of time between onset of symptoms and the collection of serum. A subgroup of patients did not develop antibodies at the time of sample collection. Compared to the patients that did, no differences were found. The presence and level of antibodies was not associated with age, sex, duration of hospitalization, treatment in the ICU or death. The case-fatality rate increased exponentially with older age. Neither the presence, nor the levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies served as prognostic markers in our cohort. This is discussed as a possible consequence of the timing of the sample collection. Age is the most important risk factor for an adverse outcome in our cohort. Some patients appear not to develop antibodies within a reasonable time frame. It is unclear, however, why that is, as these patients differ in no respect examined by us from those who developed antibodies.","output":"Clinical correlates of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody profiles in Spanish COVID-19 patients from a high incidence region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many academics are critical of the current publishing system, but it is difficult to create a better alternative This review relates to the Sciences and Social Sciences, and discusses the primary purpose of academic journals as providing a seal of approval for perceived quality, impact, significance, and importance The key issues considered include the role of anonymous refereeing, continuous rather than discrete frequency of publications, avoidance of time wasting, and seeking adventure Here we give recommendations about the organization of journal articles, the roles of associate editors and referees, measuring the time frame for refereeing submitted articles in days and weeks rather than months and years, encouraging open access internet publishing, emphasizing the continuity of publishing online, academic publishing as a continuous dynamic process, and how to improve research after publication Citations and functions thereof, such as the journal impact factor and h-index, are the benchmark for evaluating the importance and impact of academic journals and published articles Even in the very top journals, a high proportion of published articles are never cited, not even by the authors themselves Top journal publications do not guarantee that published articles will make significant contributions, or that they will ever be highly cited The COVID-19 world should encourage academics worldwide not only to rethink academic teaching, but also to re-evaluate key issues associated with academic journal publishing in the future","output":"The Future of Academic Journals in a COVID-19 World"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This case report demonstrates bilateral adrenal hemorrhage in a fifty-year old man with severe Covid-19 pneumonia.

METHODS: Nationwide survey addressing the impact of COVID-19 on resources, procedures and physicians of Gastroenterology and Hepatology departments in 81 hospitals representative of the Spanish National Health Service. RESULTS: Overall, 41.8% of hospital beds and 40.7% of Gastroenterology and Hepatology beds were allocated to COVID-19 patient care, as well as 24.8% of gastroenterologists and 58.3% of residents. Outpatient visits, abdominal ultrasounds and endoscopies were reduced by 81.8-91.9%. Nine large university hospitals had 75% and 89% reductions in therapeutic endoscopies and hepatocellular carcinoma surgery, respectively, with cancellation of elective liver transplant and TIPS. Prevalence of infected physicians was 10.6% and was dependent on regional population incidence (r = 0.74, P = 0.001), with 11% hospitalized and one physician dying. Up to 63.4% of physicians may have been infected before or shortly after Spain entered lockdown, 57% of them having recently performed endoscopies. Adequate protection was acknowledged in >80% hospitals but only 2.9% performed regular SARS-CoV-2 testing. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare delivery has been massive. A wave of Gastroenterology-related complications is expected due to resource diversion.

The greatest threat that is disrupting the normal functioning of society is the exceptionally high species independent transmission. Drug repurposing is understood to be the best strategy to immediately deploy well-characterized agents against new pathogens. Several repurposable drugs are already in evaluation for determining suitability to treat COVID-19. One such promising compound includes heparin, which is widely used in reducing thrombotic events associated with COVID-19 induced pathology. As part of identifying target-specific antiviral compounds among FDA and world-approved libraries using high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS), we previously evaluated top hits for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Here, we report results of highly efficacious viral entry blocking properties of heparin (IC(50) = 12.3 nM) in the complete virus assay, and further, propose ways to use it as a potential transmission blocker. Exploring further, our in-silico analysis indicated that the heparin interacts with post-translational glycoconjugates present on spike proteins. The patterns of accessible spike-glycoconjugates in open and closed states are completely contrasted by one another. Heparin-binding to the open conformation of spike structurally supports the state and may aid ACE2 binding as reported with cell surface-bound heparan sulfate. We also studied spike protein mutant variants' heparin interactions for possible resistance. Based on available data and optimal absorption properties by the skin, heparin could potentially be used to block SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

There is great diversity among HCWs in degree of exposure based on intensity and duration of patient contact. The use of personal protective equipment and other infection prevention measures would be expected to significantly modify the risk of acquiring COVID-19. We hypothesized that patient-facing HCWs (PF) are more likely to acquire COVID-19 illness over time than non-patient facing HCWs (non-PF). Methods: All HCWs who were either employed or part of the medical staff at six acute-care hospitals in Phoenix, Arizona in June 2019 were invited to participate. A cohort of 1358 HCWs provided informed consent, filled out a questionnaire regarding their healthcare role, and had blood drawn between June 15th and August 15th, 2020 (Draw 1). The questionnaire and blood draws were repeated in October 2020 (Draw 2), January 2021 (Draw 3), and April 2021 (Draw 4). 881 physicians/APPs and nurses with direct patient care responsibilities, respiratory therapists, phlebotomists, and patient care technicians were categorized as PF, 477 other participants considered non-PF. SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid IgG was measured using the Abbott Architect platform, using a cut-off of greater than 1.4 arbitrary units as a positive result. This assay does not detect anti- spike IgG and is therefore insensitive to Covid vaccination status. Because previous studies suggest that anti- nucleocapsid IgG levels decay over time, participants were treated as seropositive for all draws following their first positive draw regardless of the index result. Participants who missed a draw were treated as negative on that draw. Differences in seroprevalence were tested with a Z-score test for differences in proportion. Proportions were expressed as percentages +/- 95% confidence intervals. Results: Overall seroprevalence increased from 8.8% +/- 1.5% on Draw 1 to 11.3% +/- 1.7% on Draw 2, 19.9% +/- 2.1% on Draw 3, and 20.8% +/- 2.2% on Draw 4.

To perform numerous functions within infected cells, the M protein needs to recruit cellular partners. To better understand the role of M during VSV replication, we looked for interacting partners by using the two-hybrid system. The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, subunit i (eIF3i) was identified to be an M-binding partner, and this interaction was validated by GST pull-down and laser confocal assays. Through a mutagenesis analysis, we found that some mutants of M between amino acids 122 and 181 impaired but did not completely abolish the MCeIF3i interaction. Furthermore, the knockdown of eIF3i by RNA interference decreased viral replication and transcription in the early stages but led to increase in later stages. VSV transcription was increased at 4 h post-infection but was not changed at 8 and 12 h post-infection after the over-expression of eIF3i. Finally, we also demonstrated that VSV could inhibit the activity of Akt1 and that the knockdown of eIF3i inhibited the expression of the ISGs regulated by phospho-Akt1. These results indicated that eIF3i may affect VSV growth by regulating the host antiviral response in HeLa cells.","output":"EIF3i affects vesicular stomatitis virus growth by interacting with matrix protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the study was to analyze the most significant studies representing the basic principles of diagnosis and treatment of patients with breast cancer (BC) during the CO VID -19 pandemic.

It plays central roles in a wide variety of applications in Alibaba Group. However, existing structure learning algorithms suffer from considerable limitations in real world applications due to their low efficiency and poor scalability. To resolve this, we propose a new structure learning algorithm LEAST, which comprehensively fulfills our business requirements as it attains high accuracy, efficiency and scalability at the same time. The core idea of LEAST is to formulate the structure learning into a continuous constrained optimization problem, with a novel differentiable constraint function measuring the acyclicity of the resulting graph. Unlike with existing work, our constraint function is built on the spectral radius of the graph and could be evaluated in near linear time w.r.t. the graph node size. Based on it, LEAST can be efficiently implemented with low storage overhead. According to our benchmark evaluation, LEAST runs 1 to 2 orders of magnitude faster than state of the art method with comparable accuracy, and it is able to scale on BNs with up to hundreds of thousands of variables. In our production environment, LEAST is deployed and serves for more than 20 applications with thousands of executions per day. We describe a concrete scenario in a ticket booking service in Alibaba, where LEAST is applied to build a near real-time automatic anomaly detection and root error cause analysis system. We also show that LEAST unlocks the possibility of applying BN structure learning in new areas, such as large-scale gene expression data analysis and explainable recommendation system.","output":"Efficient and Scalable Structure Learning for Bayesian Networks: Algorithms and Applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. Administration of convalescent plasma may be of clinical benefit for treatment of severe acute viral respiratory infections. However, no clear evidence exists to support or oppose convalescent plasma use in clinical practice. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the evidence of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the convalescent plasma for the treatment of severe influenza. Methods. Healthcare databases were searched in February 2020. All records were screened against the eligibility criteria. Data extraction and risk of bias assessments were undertaken. The primary outcome was case fatality rates by influenza. Results. We identified 5 RCTs of severe influenza. The pooled analyses showed no evidence for a reduction in mortality (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.06; p = 0.87; I2 = 35%). We also found non significant reductions in days in ICU and hospital, and days on mechanical ventilation. There seemed to have a biological benefit of increasing HAI titer levels and decreasing influenza B virus loads and cytokines after convalescent plasma treatment. No serious adverse events was reported between two groups. Studies were commonly of low risk of bias with high quality. Conclusions.

However, less is known about the changes in LUS findings after a hospitalization for COVID-19. METHODS: In a prospective, longitudinal study in patients with COVID-19 enrolled from non-ICU hospital units, adult patients underwent 8-zone LUS and blood sampling both during the hospitalization and 2C3 months after discharge. LUS images were analyzed blinded to clinical variables and outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 71 patients with interpretable LUS at baseline and follow up (mean age 64 years, 61% male, 24% with ARDS) were included. The follow-up LUS was performed a median of 72 days after the initial LUS performed during hospitalization. At baseline, 87% had pathologic LUS findings in 1 zone (e.g. 3 B-lines, confluent B-lines or subpleural or lobar consolidation), whereas 30% had pathologic findings at follow-up (p < 0.001). The total number of B-lines and LUS score decreased significantly from hospitalization to follow-up (median 17 vs. 4, p < 0.001 and 4 vs. 0, p < 0.001, respectively). On the follow-up LUS, 28% of all patients had 3 B-lines in 1 zone, whereas in those with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during the baseline hospitalization (n = 17), 47% had 3 B-lines in 1 zone. CONCLUSION: LUS findings improved significantly from hospitalization to follow-up 2C3 months after discharge in COVID-19 survivors. However, persistent B-lines were frequent at follow-up, especially among those who initially had ARDS. LUS seems to be a promising method to monitor COVID-19 lung changes over time.

However, concerns have been raised regarding the global shortage of medical grade masks and the limited evidence on the efficacy of fabric masks. This study used a standard mask testing method (ASTM F2101-14) and a model virus (bacteriophage MS2) to test the viral filtration efficiency (VFE) of fabric masks compared with commercially available disposable, surgical, and N95 masks. Five different types of fabric masks were purchased from the ecommerce website Etsy to represent a range of different fabric mask designs and materials currently available. One mask included a pocket for a filter; which was tested without a filter, with a dried baby wipe, and a section of a vacuum cleaner bag. A sixth fabric mask was also made according to the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) guidelines (Australia). Three masks of each type were tested. This study found that all the fabric masks had a VFE of at least 50% when tested against aerosols with an average size of 6.0 m (VFE((6.0 m))). The minimum VFE of fabric masks improved (to 63%) when the larger aerosols were excluded to give and average aerosol size of 2.6 m (VFE((2.6 m))), which better represents inhaled aerosols that can reach the lower respiratory system. The best performing fabric masks were the cotton mask with a section of vacuum cleaner bag (VFE((6.0 m)) = 99.5%, VFE((2.6 m)) = 98.8%) or a dried baby wipe (VFE((6.0 m)) = 98.5%, VFE((2.6 m)) = 97.6%) in the pocket designed for a disposable filter, the mask made using the Victorian DHHS design (VFE((6.0 m)) = 98.6%, VFE((2.6 m)) =99.1%) and one made from a layer of 100% hemp, a layer of poly membrane, and a layer of cheesecloth (VFE((6.0 m)) = 93.6%, VFE((2.6 m)) = 89.0%). The VFE of two surgical masks (VFE((6.0 m)) = 99.9% and 99.6%, VFE((2.6 m)) = 99.5% and 98.5%) and a N95 masks (VFE((6.0 m)) = 99.9%, VFE((2.6 m)) = 99.3%) were comparable to their advertised bacterial filtration efficacy. This research supports the use of fabric masks in the community to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2; however, future research is needed to explore the optimum design in ensuring proper fit.

Research Question Is the HOME-CoV rule reliable for identifying a subgroup of COVID-19 patients with a low risk of adverse outcomes who can be safely treated at home? Study Design and Methods We aimed to validate the HOME-CoV rule in a prospective multicenter study before and after trial on patients with probable or confirmed COVID-19 who presented at the emergency departments (ED) of 34 hospitals. The main outcome was an adverse evolution, i.e., invasive ventilation or death, occurred within the 7 days following the patients admission. The performance of the rule was assessed by the false negative rate. The impact of the rule implementation was assessed by the absolute differences in the rate of patients who required invasive ventilation or who died and in the rate of patients treated at home, between an observational and an interventional period after implementation of the HOME-CoV rule, with propensity score adjustment. Results Among 3000 prospectively enrolled patients, 1239 (41.3%) had a negative HOME-CoV rule. The false negative rate of the HOME-CoV rule and its AUC were 4/1239: 0.32% (95%CI: 0.13 to 0.84%) and 80.9 (95%CI: 76.5 to 85.2), respectively.

In this study we set out to determine the relative likelihood of death following COVID-19 infection in people with T2DM when compared to those without T2DM. This was conducted as an urban population study and based in the UK. METHODS: Analysis of electronic health record data was performed relating to people living in the Greater Manchester conurbation (population 2.82 million) who had a recorded diagnosis of T2DM and subsequent COVID-19 confirmed infection. Each individual with T2DM (n = 13,807) was matched with three COVID-19-infected non-diabetes controls (n = 39,583). Data were extracted from the Greater Manchester Care Record (GMCR) database for the period 1 January 2020 to 30 June 2021. Social disadvantage was assessed through Townsend scores. Death rates were compared in people with T2DM to their respective non-diabetes controls; potential predictive factors influencing the relative likelihood of admission were ascertained using univariable and multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: For individuals with T2DM, their mortality rate after a COVID-19 positive test was 7.7% vs 6.0% in matched controls; the relative risk (RR) of death was 1.28. From univariate analysis performed within the group of individuals with T2DM, the likelihood of death following a COVID-19 recorded infection was lower in people taking metformin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) or a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonist. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and hypertension were associated with increased mortality and had odds ratios of 0.96 (95% confidence interval 0.96C0.97) and 1.92 (95% confidence interval 1.68C2.20), respectively. Likelihood of death following a COVID-19 infection was also higher in those people with a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or severe enduring mental illness but not with asthma, and in people taking aspirin/clopidogrel/insulin. Smoking in people with T2DM significantly increased mortality rate (odds ratio of 1.46; 95% confidence interval 1.29C1.65). In a combined analysis of patients with T2DM and controls, multiple regression modelling indicated that the factors independently relating to a higher likelihood of death (accounting for 26% of variance) were T2DM, age, male gender and social deprivation (higher Townsend score). CONCLUSION: Following confirmed infection with COVID-19 a number of factors are associated with mortality in individuals with T2DM. Prescription of metformin, SGLT2is or GLP-1 agonists and non-smoking status appeared to be associated with a reduced the risk of death for people with T2DM. Age, male sex and social disadvantage are associated with an increased risk of death.","output":"Mortality in People with Type 2 Diabetes Following SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Population Level Analysis of Potential Risk Factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of telemedicine has rapidly accelerated.

No direct treatments are available as yet, highlighting the importance of prevention through suitable vaccination regimes. The viral spike (S) protein has been characterized as a key target antigen for vaccines. In particular, S protein domains have been utilized to produce high titers of neutralizing antibodies. Areas covered: Since the first report of MERS-CoV infection, a limited number of MERS-CoV-specific patents have been filed. Patents related to MERS-CoV are categorized into three areas: treatments, antibodies, and vaccines (receptor-related). This review mainly focuses on the types and efficacies of vaccines, briefly covering treatments and antibodies against the virus. MERS-CoV vaccine forms and delivery systems, together with comparable development strategies against SARS-CoV are additionally addressed. Expert opinion: Vaccines must be combined with delivery systems, administration routes, and adjuvants to maximize T-cell responses as well as neutralizing antibody production. High immune responses require further study in animal models, such as human receptor-expressing mice, non-human primates, and camels. Such a consideration of integrated actions should contribute to the rapid development of vaccines against MERS-CoV and related coronaviruses.","output":"Progress of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus vaccines: a patent review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic caused by novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infecting millions of populations worldwide and counting, has demanded quick and potential therapeutic strategies.

The structural information of recently released crystal structures of main protease (M(pro)) in APO and complex with inhibitors, N3, and 13b molecules was utilized to explore the binding site architecture through Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The stable state of M(pro) was used to conduct extensive virtual screening of the aforementioned drug pool. Considering the recent success of HIV protease molecules, we also used anti-protease molecules for drug repurposing purposes. The identified top hits were further evaluated through MD simulations followed by the binding free energy calculations using MM-GBSA. Interestingly, in our screening, several promising drugs stand out as potential inhibitors of M(pro). However, based on control (N3 and 13b), we have identified six potential molecules, Leupeptin Hemisulphate, Pepstatin A, Nelfinavir, Birinapant, Lypression and Octreotide which have shown the reasonably significant MM-GBSA score. Further insight shows that the molecules form stable interactions with hot-spot residues, that are mainly conserved and can be targeted for structure- and pharmacophore-based designing.

METHODS We examined the evidence for a vaccine-driven COVID-19 exit strategy including academic papers, governmental reports and epidemiological data, and discuss the shift from the current pandemic footing to an endemic approach similar to influenza and other respiratory infectious diseases. RESULTS A desired endemic state is characterised by a baseline prevalence of infections with a generally mild disease profile that can be sustainably managed by the healthcare system, together with the resumption of near normalcy in human activities. Such an endemic state is attainable for COVID-19 given the promising data around vaccine efficacy, although uncertainty remains around vaccine immunity escape in emergent variants of concern. Maintenance of non-pharmaceutical interventions remains crucial until high vaccination coverage is attained to avoid runaway outbreaks. It may also be worthwhile to de-escalate measures in phases, before standing down most measures for an endemic state.

Therefore, the knowledge, attitude, and perceptions (KAPs) of the general population are critical for the development and effective implementation of standard operating procedures (SOP) to contain the contagion and minimize the losses. Therefore, the current study was conducted to understand and evaluate the KAPs of Pakistani populations toward the COVID-19. Methods: An online cross-sectional study was carried out among participants from 1 May to 30 July 2020 in different areas of Pakistan. The respondents of the study were the general population with age  18 years. The poll URL was posted on several channels after a call for participation. Other social media platforms such as WeChat, WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Messenger, and LinkedIn were engaged to maximize general population engagement. The questionnaire included details about sociodemographic, knowledge about COVID-19, perceptions toward universal safety precautions of COVID-19, and beliefs attitude toward the COVID-19. The obtained data were exported into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and SPSS software version 21 for windows. The descriptive statistics values were presented in frequencies and percentages. Binary logistic regression, Chi-square test, and one-way ANOVA were applied to analyze the participants' socio-demographic characteristics and variables related to KAPs. P-value < 0.05 was recorded as significant. Results: A total of 1,000 participants were invited of which 734 participated in this study. The response rate was 73.4% (734/1,000). The gender, marital status, education, and residence showed a significant association with the knowledge score. The majority of the study participants were thinking that COVID-19 may be more dangerous in elderly individuals 94.5% (n = 700), and individuals with chronic diseases or severe complications 96.7% (n = 710) (p = 0.00). More than half of the participants 52.5% (n = 385) showed their concern that either they or their family members might get the infection. More than 98% (n = 703), (P-value = 0.00) of the participants held that COVID-19 would be successfully controlled in Pakistan by following the standard SOPs and government guidelines. Conclusion: This study showed that the general population of Pakistan has good awareness and reasonable attitudes and perceptions toward the full features of the COVID-19. The current study suggests that mass-level effective health education programs are necessary for developing countries to improve and limit the gap between KAP toward COVID-19.","output":"Assessment of General Populations Knowledge, Attitude, and Perceptions Toward the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19): A Cross-Sectional Study From Pakistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several studies have reported the susceptibility of pregnant women to emotional instability and stress. Thus, pregnancy may be a risk factor that could deepen the already negative effects of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the aim of this study is to analyze longitudinally the psychopathological consequences of the pandemic in pregnant women, and to explore differences with non-pregnant women. The participants in this study were 102 pregnant women, and a control group of 102 non-pregnant women (most of them reported having university studies and little financial impact from the pandemic). They completed the Beck Depression Inventory-II, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, in three different times (2, 14, and 47 days after the start of the lockdown). In a time range of 50 days of quarantine, all women showed a gradual increase in psychopathological indicators and a decrease in positive affect. Pregnant women showed a more pronounced increase in depression, anxiety and negative affect than the non-pregnant women did. In addition, pregnant women showed a more pronounced decrease in positive affect.

The most severe forms of MIS-C (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children related to SARS-CoV-2), that resulted in myocarditis, were characterized by elevated levels of pro-angiogenesis cytokines and several chemokines. Single-cell transcriptomic analyses identified a unique monocyte/dendritic cell gene signature that correlated with the occurrence of severe myocarditis, characterized by sustained NF-B activity, TNF- signaling, associated with decreased gene expression of NF-B inhibitors. We also found a weak response to type-I and type-II interferons, hyperinflammation and response to oxidative stress related to increased HIF-1 and VEGF signaling.

The key insight is that aggregate demand is an externality for individual firms: this generates a strategic complementarity in production that results in equilibrium under- utilization of the economys productive capacity and hysteresis in real GDP per-capita in balanced growth. This equilibrium inefficiency reverberates into both the functional dis- tribution of income and the distribution of wealth: both the wage share and the workers wealth share would be higher at full capacity. Consequently, fiscal allocation policy that achieves productive efficiency also attains a higher labor share and a more equitable dis- tribution of wealth. Demand shocks also have permanent level effects. Extensions look at temporary growth and employment effects of fiscal policy with dynamic increasing returns, and employment hysteresis. These findings are useful as an organizing framework for thinking through the lackluster economic record of the so-called Neoliberal era, the sluggish recovery of most advanced economies following the Great Recession, and what to expect regarding the recovery from the Covid-19 shock.","output":"Aggregate Demand Externalities, Income Distribution, and Wealth Inequality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE This study evaluated the clinical and radiological results of plate osteosynthesis with autologous cortical and cancellous bone graft for nonunion of midshaft clavicle fracture. METHODS A retrospective review was performed for all patients who underwent surgery for midshaft clavicle nonunion at a Level I trauma center. Visual analog scales (VAS) for pain and Quick-DASH (Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand) score were assessed. Bone union rate, change in length of affected clavicle, complications, and reoperation were determined. Risk factors were identified to determine the effect on the healing. RESULTS Thirty-four patients were included for analysis. All patients achieved solid bone union at mean 16 weeks (range 8-36) after surgery. The mean shortening of affected clavicle decreased significantly postoperatively (P < 0.001). There was significant improvement in both pain VAS and Quick-DASH score (P < 0.001). There was no wound complication, infection, or major neurovascular injury. Ten patients (29%) complained of plate irritation and underwent removal of implant without any subsequent adverse event. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that high-energy trauma and previous surgery were the independent risk factors that significantly delayed time to union (P < 0.05).

However, there is currently a paucity of evidence-based, integrated, accessible treatment options for individuals with these comorbidities. The main goal of this study was to examine efficacy of a novel online, minimally guided, integrated program for comorbid alcohol misuse and emotional problems in young adults. Method: The study was an open-label two-arm RCT. Participants (N = 222, M(age) = 24.6, 67.6% female) were randomized to one of two conditions: the Take Care of Me program (an 8-week, online integrated treatment condition consisting of 12 modules), or an online psychoeducational control condition. Intervention modules incorporated content based on principles of cognitive behavioral therapy and motivational interviewing. Participants completed assessment data at baseline, at the end of treatment (i.e., 8 weeks), and at follow-up (i.e., 24 weeks). Data were analyzed using generalized linear mixed models. Results: We observed that participants in the treatment condition showed larger reductions in depression, hazardous drinking, as well as increases in psychological quality of life and confidence at the end of treatment. We did not find group differences on total alcohol use at follow-up, but participants in the treatment group reduced their hazardous drinking and improved their quality of life at 24-week follow-up.

To understand the mechanism of synthesis of these mRNAs, we studied how the synthesis of each mRNA was affected by UV irradiation at different time points after infection. When MHV-infected cells were UV irradiated at a late time in infection (5 h postinfection), the syntheses of the various mRNAs were inhibited to different extents in proportion to the sizes of the mRNAs. Analysis of the UV inactivation kinetics revealed that the UV target size of each mRNA was equivalent to its own physical size. In contrast, when cells were irradiated at 2.5 or 3 h postinfection, there appeared to be two different kinetics of inhibition of mRNA synthesis: the synthesis of every mRNA was inhibited to the same extent by a small UV dose, but the remaining mRNA synthesis was inhibited by additional UV doses at different rates for different mRNAs in proportion to RNA size. The analysis of the UV inactivation kinetics indicated that the UV target sizes for the majority of mRNAs were equivalent to that of the genomic-size RNA early in the infection. These results suggest that MHV mRNA synthesis requires the presence of a genomic-length RNA template at least early in the infection. In contrast, later in the infection, the sizes of the templates used for mRNA synthesis were equivalent to the physical sizes of each mRNA. The possibility that the genomic-length RNA required early in the infection was used only for the synthesis of a polymerase rather than as a template for mRNA synthesis was ruled out by examining the UV sensitivity of a defective interfering (DI) RNA. We found that the UV target size for the DI RNA early in infection was much smaller than that for mRNAs 6 and 7, which are approximately equal to or smaller in size than the DI RNA. This result indicates that even though DI RNA and viral mRNAs are synthesized by the same polymerase, mRNAs are synthesized from a larger (genomic-length) template. We conclude that a genomic-length RNA template is required for MHV subgenomic mRNA synthesis at least early in infection. Several transcription models are proposed.","output":"Coronavirus mRNA transcription: UV light transcriptional mapping studies suggest an early requirement for a genomic-length template."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This report summarizes an event focused on the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic response and its impact on the operational and economic recovery of airports.

Tensor Cores are special processing units that perform [Formula: see text] matrix multiplications on FP16 inputs with FP32 precision, and return the result on FP32. The proposed method adopts the Ozaki scheme, an accurate matrix multiplication algorithm based on error-free transformation for matrix multiplication. The proposed method has three prominent advantages: first, it can be built upon the cublasGemmEx routine using Tensor Core operations; second, it can achieve higher accuracy than standard DGEMM, including the correctly-rounded result; third, it ensures bit-level reproducibility even for different numbers of cores and threads. The achievable performance of the method depends on the absolute-value range of each element of the input matrices. For example, when the matrices were initialized with random numbers over a dynamic range of 1E+9, our DGEMM-equivalent implementation achieved up to approximately 980 GFlops of FP64 operation on the Titan RTX GPU (with 130 TFlops on Tensor Cores), although cublasDgemm can achieve only 539 GFlops on FP64 floating-point units.

The key to understanding SARS-CoV-2s higher infectivity may lie in its host receptor recognition mechanism. This is because experiments show that the human ACE2 protein, which serves as the primary receptor for both CoVs, binds to CoV-2s spike protein 5-20 fold stronger than SARS-CoVs spike protein. The molecular basis for this difference in binding affinity, however, remains unexplained and, in fact, a comparison of X-ray structures leads to an opposite proposition. To gain insight, we use all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Free energy calculations indicate that CoV-2s higher affinity is due primarily to differences in specific spike residues that are local to the spike-ACE2 interface, although there are allosteric effects in binding. Comparative analysis of equilibrium simulations reveals that while both CoV and CoV-2 spike-ACE2 complexes have similar interfacial topologies, CoV-2s spike protein engages in greater numbers, combinatorics and probabilities of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges with ACE2. We attribute CoV-2s higher affinity to these differences in polar contacts, and these findings also highlight the importance of thermal structural fluctuations in spike-ACE2 complexation. We anticipate that these findings will also inform the design of spike-ACE2 peptide blockers that, like in the cases of HIV and Influenza, can serve as antivirals.","output":"Molecular basis for SARS-CoV-2 spike affinity for human ACE2 receptor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: With the rapid propagation of the SARS-COV-2 or COVID-19 pandemic, the healthcare facility around the world has been stretched a large extent.

The risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection among PLWH were explored. RESULTS: Fourteen out of 857 (1.63%) PLWH were infected with SARS-CoV-2, while 68 of 1048 (6.49%) HIV negative individuals were infected. In PLWH, there were 6 confirmed COVID-19 (0.70%), 4 asymptomatic carriers (0.47%) and 4 unapparent infectors (0.47%). In the HIV negative group, the cases of COVID-19, asymptomatic carrier, and unapparent infector were 5 (0.48%), 0 (0.00%), and 63 (6.01%), respectively. After adjusting for age, gender, and chronic comorbidities, the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in PLWH was lower than that in HIV negative group (1.96% vs 5.74%, P=0.001).

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer has a high mortality rate in China, which is closely related to the fact that most lung cancer patients are not diagnosed until the malignancy is advanced. Challenges remain in the early detection, accurate diagnosis, monitoring and individual treatment of lung cancers. Artificial intelligence has developed to process large amounts of data, from clinical presentations to physiological images, which is essential for solving the complex issues with clinical medicine. Increasing evidence has suggested that artificial intelligence technology provides novel, promising strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer. METHODS: A review of literature was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane to identify the latest research on artificial intelligence and lung cancer, and ultimately to generate a narrative review. CONCLUSIONS: Artificial intelligence plays an important role in the imaging inspection, histopathology examination and genomics inspection of lung cancer. In addition, artificial intelligence has the ability to detect a small number of biomarkers, which is conducive to lung cancer monitoring. Moreover, the intelligent treatment of lung cancer has gradually become the trend of future development, whether in internal medicine or surgical treatment.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate imaging findings of MIS-C associated with COVID-19. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Imaging studies and medical records of sixteen patients (0-20 years) admitted with MIS-C were retrospectively reviewed. Thoracic imaging studies were evaluated for parenchymal, mediastinal and hilar, and cardiovascular abnormalities. Abdominal imaging studies were evaluated for abnormalities of solid viscera, hollow viscera, peritoneum, as well as the mesentery and retroperitoneum. Studies were reviewed independently by two radiologists, and disagreements were resolved by a third, senior radiologist. RESULTS: Sixteen patients were included (10 male and 6 female; 20 months - 20 years). All 16 patients presented with fever. Other presenting signs and symptoms included: vomiting (12; 75%), abdominal pain (11; 69%), rash (10;62.5%), conjunctivitis (8;50%), diarrhea (7;44%), headache (6;37.5%), and sore throat (5;31%). Shortness of breath and cough were each present in one patient. Chest radiograph demonstrated cardiomegaly (10; 62.5%), congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema (9; 56%), atelectasis (9; 56%), pleural effusions (7; 44%), adult respiratory distress syndrome (2; 12.5%) and pneumonia (1; 6%). Absolute interobserver agreement was 69-100%. Eight patients (50%) were evaluated for PE (6 [75%] by CT angiography [CTA] and 2 [25%] by ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy). In 2 (25%), CTA demonstrated a segmental PE. Abdominal imaging findings (US and CT) included small volume ascites (6; 38%), hepatomegaly (6; 38%), echogenic kidneys (5; 31%), bowel wall thickening (3; 19%), gallbladder wall thickening (3; 19%), mesenteric lymphadenopathy (2; 13%), splenomegaly (1; 6%), and bladder wall thickening (1; 6%). The frequencies of findings based on all the reviewed modalities were: cardiomegaly (12; 75%), pleural effusion (10; 63%) and atelectasis (10; 63%). 15 patients (94%) were discharged home (length of hospital stay 3-20 days). There were no mortalities. CONCLUSION: MIS-C associated with COVID-19 is characterized predominantly by cardiovascular abnormalities, though also solid visceral organ, gallbladder, and bowel abnormalities as well as ascites, reflecting a multisystemic inflammatory process.

BACKGROUND: To investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the retinal layers and optic disc parameters in previously confirmed COVID-19 patients using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). METHODS: This study included 60 eyes of 60 subjects; 35 of them were in the COVID-19 group and the remaining 25 were in the control group. Patients with the diagnosis of COVID-19 that had a negative result after treatment were included in the study. Macular and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness measurements, each retinal layer thickness of all participants were done 14-30 days after COVID-19 symptom onset, following the negative result of real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test using SD-OCT. RESULTS: The mean value of central macular thickness was significantly higher in the COVID-19 group than the control group (p = 0.02). The mean values of the ganglion cell layer and inner nuclear layer thickness in the COVID-19 group were signicantly thinner than control group (p = 0.04 and p = 0.04, respectively). Even though mean RNFL thickness measurements in all sections in the COVID-19 group was thinner than controls, there were no significant differences between groups (p > 0.05 for all).

Reliable estimates of cumulative incidence in the population are critical to tracking the extent of transmission and informing policies. METHODS: We conducted a statewide seroprevalence study among a 15,101 patron convenience sample at 99 grocery stores in 26 counties throughout NYS. SARS-CoV-2 cumulative incidence was estimated from antibody reactivity by first post-stratification weighting then adjusting by antibody test characteristics. The percent diagnosed was estimated by dividing diagnoses by estimated infection-experienced adults. RESULTS: Based on 1,887 of 15,101 reactive results (12.5%), estimated cumulative incidence through March 29 was 14.0% (95% CI: 13.3-14.7%), corresponding to 2,139,300 (95% CI: 2,035,800-2,242,800) infection-experienced adults. Cumulative incidence was highest in New York City (NYC) 22.7% (95% CI: 21.5-24.0%) and higher among Hispanic/Latino (29.2%), non-Hispanic black/African American (20.2%), and non-Hispanic Asian (12.4%) than non-Hispanic white adults (8.1%, p<.0001).

There are no comprehensive data regarding the perception and situation of scientific misconduct among the Iranian medical faculty members. We conducted a nationwide survey to assess the research misconduct among the medical faculty members in Iran. METHODS: We used the Persian version of the research misconduct questionnaire (PRMQ) on the Google Forms platform. We sent the survey link to a systematic random sample of medical faculty members in Iran (N = 4986). Descriptive analyses were performed on the individual items of the PRMQ, with frequencies and percentages for categorical and Likert-type response items, and means and standard deviation (S.D.) for continuous variables. Chi-square analysis was conducted to test hypotheses examining differences in the frequency of responses related to factors influencing misconduct. We also defined four tenure categories (TC) based on the working years of the participants as tenured faculty members. All the analyses were performed using R 3.6.0. RESULTS: The response rate was 13.8% (692 responses). Nearly 70% of the respondents agreed that their publication output would be of higher quality if there were no publication pressure. Approximately three-quarters (N =499, 72.1%) of the respondents had been aware of some instances of research misconduct during the previous year according to their understanding of misconduct. Among the participants, 18.5% perceived the effectiveness of their associated organisations rules for reducing research misconduct to be high or very high. Pressure for tenure was identified as the item most frequently perceived with a strong behavioural influence on engaging in research misconduct (80.2%). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that research misconduct needs to be actively addressed among the medical faculty members. Making policies with a focus on boosting awareness regarding the occasions of scientific misconduct and its management seems to be indispensable in the future in Iran.

Out of 526 results, a total of 54 articles, including 46 studies on detection methods, were considered eligible for the review. The results showed that most of the proposed tests focused on molecular methods, while immunological and point-of-care tests were investigated in 13 studies. There were also a few commercial automated methods for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples, most of which are not examined in the current review, as no data about their sensitivity and specificity were presented. Although the assessment of publication biases showed that 64% sensitivity and nearly 100% specificity for RT-PCR are close to reality, most of the related reports for serological methods are not valid and further studies are needed to confirm their utility in clinical settings. Moreover, the RT-PCR test alone cannot act as a gold standard because of bias in measurements. Therefore, antibody tests and other proposed methods could be used as supplementary diagnostic tests to improve RT-PCR accuracy.

Methods: All URT RT-PCR testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in NHS Lothian, Scotland, United Kingdom between the 7 th of February and 19 th April 2020 (inclusive) was reviewed, and hospitalised patients were identified. All URT RT-PCR tests were analysed for each patient to determine the sequence of negative and positive results. For those who were tested twice or more but never received a positive result, case records were reviewed, and a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 allocated based on clinical features, discharge diagnosis, and radiology and haematology results. For those who had a negative RT-PCR test but a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, respiratory samples were retested using a multiplex respiratory panel, a second SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay, and a human RNase P control. Results: Compared to the gold standard of a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, the sensitivity of a single upper respiratory tract RT-PCR for COVID-19 was 82.2% (95% confidence interval 79.0-85.1%). The sensitivity of two upper respiratory tract RT-PCR tests increased sensitivity to 90.6% (CI 88.0-92.7%).

METHODS: A cross-sectional, multicenter telephone survey was conducted from July to September 2020 in five Chinese cities (i.e. Wuhan, Nanning, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Dongguan); adult COVID-19 survivors were recruited 6 months after they were discharged from the hospital. Linear regressions and path analysis based on the minority stress model were conducted to test the relationships among hospitalization, social/interpersonal factors, personal factors, and social anxiety. RESULTS: The response rate was 74.5% (N = 199, 55.3% females).

Next, we predicted the protein structure of each allele and used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate their molecular flexibility. The M allele is more flexible than the S and F alleles at 50C, suggesting a plausible explanation for M's loss of activity at high temperatures, and has the greatest structural flexibility at 15C, suggesting that it can retain some enzyme activity at cooler temperatures. MM bees recovered from two hours of cold narcosis significantly better than all other genotypes.

We aimed to review the public health interventions used during the COVID-19 outbreak and describe the impact on seasonal influenza activity in Korea. METHODS: National response strategies and public health interventions, along with daily COVID-19 confirmed cases in Korea were reviewed during the pandemic. National influenza surveillance data were compared between seven sequential seasons. Characteristics of each season, including the rate of influenza-like illness (ILI), duration of epidemic, date of termination of epidemic, distribution of influenza virus strain and hospitalization were analyzed. RESULTS: After various public health interventions including enforced public education on hand hygiene, cough etiquette and staying at home with respiratory symptoms, universal mask use in public places, refrain from non-essential social activities and school closure, the duration of the influenza epidemic in 2019/2020 decreased by 6-12 weeks and the influenza activity peak rated 49.8 ILI/1,000 visits compared to 71.9-86.2 ILI/1,000 visits of previous seasons. During the period of enforced social distancing from week 9 to 17 of 2020, influenza hospitalization cases were 11.9-26.9-fold lower compared with previous seasons. During the 2019/2020 season, influenza B accounted for only 4%, in contrast with previous seasons in which influenza B accounted for 26.6% to 54.9% of all cases.

COVID-19 is highly infectious and is characterized by an acute respiratory illness that varies from mild flu-like symptoms to the life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). As such, there is an urgent need for the development of new therapeutic strategies, which combat the high mortality in severely ill COVID-19 patients. Glucocorticoids are a frontline treatment for a diverse range of inflammatory diseases. Due to their immunosuppressive functions, the use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of COVID-19 patients was initially regarded with caution. However, recent studies concluded that the initiation of systemic glucocorticoids in patients suffering from severe and critical COVID-19 is associated with lower mortality.

Given the absence of effective treatments against SARS-CoV-2, there is an urgent need for a molecular understanding of how the virus influences the machineries of the host cell. The SARS-CoV-2 generates 16 Non-Structural Proteins (NSPs) through proteolytic cleavage of a large precursor protein. In the present study, we focused our attention on the SARS-CoV-2 protein NSP2, whose role in the viral pathogenicity is poorly understood. Recent proteomic studies shed light on the capacity of NSP2 to bind the 4EHP-GIGYF2 complex, a key factor involved in microRNA-mediated silencing of gene expression in human cells. In order to gain a better understanding of the function of NSP2, we attempted to identify the molecular basis of its interaction with 4EHP-GIGYF2. Our data demonstrate that NSP2 physically associates with the endogenous 4EHP-GIGYF2 complex in the cytoplasm. Using co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro interaction assays, we identified both 4EHP and a central segment in GIGYF2 as binding sites for NSP2. We also provide functional evidence that NSP2 impairs the function of GIGYF2 in mediating mRNA silencing using reporter-based assays, thus leading to a reduced activity of microRNAs. Altogether, these data reveal the profound impact of NSP2 on the post-transcriptional silencing of gene expression in human cells, pointing out 4EHP-GIGYF2 targeting as a possible strategy of SARS-CoV-2 to take over the silencing machinery and to suppress host defenses.","output":"The SARS-CoV-2 protein NSP2 impairs the microRNA-induced silencing capacity of human cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this retrospective multicentric cohort study, we evaluate the potential benefits of a clinical decision support system (CDSS) for the automated detection of Acute kidney injury (AKI). A total of 80,389 cases, hospitalized from 2017 to 2019 at a tertiary care hospital (University of Leipzig Medical Center (ULMC)) and two primary care hospitals (Muldentalkliniken (MTL)) in Germany, were enrolled. AKI was defined and staged according to the Kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines. Clinical and laboratory data was automatically collected from electronic patient records using the frameworks of the CDSS. In our cohort, we found an overall AKI incidence proportion of 12.1%. We identified 6,393/1,703/1,604 cases as AKI stage 1/2/3 (8.0%/2.1%/2.0%, respectively).

AKI was associated with higher hospital mortality, increased length of hospitalisation and more frequent need of renal replacement therapy. A total of 19.1% of AKI cases (n = 1,848) showed progression to higher AKI stages (progressive AKI) during hospitalization. These cases presented with considerably longer hospitalization, higher rates of renal replacement therapy and increased mortality (p<0.001, respectively). Furthermore, progressive AKI was significantly associated with sepsis, shock, liver cirrhosis, myocardial infarction, and cardiac insufficiency. AKI, and especially its progression during hospitalization, is strongly associated with adverse outcomes.

The primary health integrated care for chronic (PIC4C) disease project seeks to deliver preventive, promotive, and curative care for diabetes, hypertension, cervical and breast cancers at the primary health care level. We apply the RE-AIM framework to conduct a process evaluation of the integrated PIC4C model. This paper describes the protocol we are using in the PIC4C process evaluation planning and activities. Methods and Analysis: This evaluation utilizes clinic reports as well as primary data collected in two waves. Using mixed methods (secondary data, observation, semi-structured interviews, and focus group discussions), the process evaluation assesses the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation and maintenance of the PIC4C model in Busia and Trans Nzoia Kenya. The evaluation captures the PIC4C process, experiences of implementers and users, and the wishes of those using the PIC4C services. We will analyse our data across the RE-AIM dimensions using descriptive statistics and two-sample t-test to compare the mean scores for baseline and end line. Qualitative data will be analyzed thematically. Discussion: The process evaluation of the PIC4C model in Kenya allows implementers and users to reflect and question its implementation, uptake and maintenance.

Here, an artificial Saccharomyces cerevisiae  Saccharomyces eubayanus tetraploid interspecies hybrid was created by rare mating, and its ability to sporulate and produce viable gametes was exploited to generate phenotypic diversity. Four spore clones obtained from a single ascus were isolated, and their brewing-relevant phenotypes were assessed. These F1 spore clones were found to differ with respect to fermentation performance under lager brewing conditions (15 C, 15 Plato), production of volatile aroma compounds, flocculation potential and temperature tolerance. One spore clone, selected for its rapid fermentation and acetate ester production was sporulated to produce an F2 generation, again comprised of four spore clones from a single ascus. Again, phenotypic diversity was introduced. In two of these F2 clones, the fermentation performance was maintained and acetate ester production was improved relative to the F1 parent and the original hybrid strain. Strains also performed well in comparison to a commercial lager yeast strain. Spore clones varied in ploidy and chromosome copy numbers, and faster wort fermentation was observed in strains with a higher ploidy. An F2 spore clone was also subjected to 10 consecutive wort fermentations, and single cells were isolated from the resulting yeast slurry. These isolates also exhibited variable fermentation performance and chromosome copy numbers, highlighting the instability of polyploid interspecific hybrids. These results demonstrate the value of this natural approach to increase the phenotypic diversity of lager brewing yeast strains. Contribution to the field Lager beer fermentations have traditionally been carried out with natural S. cerevisiae  S. eubayanus hybrids. These strains possess both the ability to tolerate low temperatures and the ability to utilize efficiently wort sugars. However, being closely related, strains within the group exhibit limited phenotypic variability. Since the recent discovery of wild strains of S. eubayanus, it has been possible to generate lager yeast hybrids artificially, thereby increasing the genetic and phenotypic diversity of lager brewing strains. Here, to demonstrate the potential for further increased diversity, a constructed tetraploid hybrid was sporulated and spore clones derived from a single ascus were evaluated with respect to fermentation performance (sugar utilization, stress tolerance and volatile aroma synthesis). Meiosis introduced variability in a number of key parameters. One fertile spore clone from this F1 generation was sporulated to introduce further diversity and to demonstrate the potential of clone selection in steering phenotypes in a desirable direction. Genome instability of hybrids was observed, but this can be exploited to further increase diversity. This was demonstrated by assessing performance of variants isolated after ten consecutive rounds of fermentation. The approach allows for the introduction of phenotypic diversity without the need for targeted genetic modification.","output":"Lager yeast design through meiotic segregation of a fertile Saccharomyces cerevisiae x Saccharomyces eubayanus hybrid"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) practices have been established in home health care. Adherence to IPC practices has been suboptimal with limited available evidence. The study aim was to examine the impact of individual, home environment, and organizational factors on IPC practices using human factors model. METHODS 353 nurses were surveyed across two large home care agencies to examine the relationship between IPC adherence and individual, home environment, and organizational factors. RESULTS Nurses reported multiple barriers to IPC practices in patients' homes (mean=4.34, standard deviation [SD]= 2.53). Frequent barriers included clutter (reported by 74.5% of nurses) and a dirty environment (70.3%). Nurses also reported limited availability of some IPC supplies (mean=7.76, SD=2.44), including personal protective equipment. Home environment factors were significant barriers, and availability of IPC supplies were significant enablers of IPC adherence. Agency-provided training and decision-making resources were not significant factors for IPC adherence in the presence of home environment barriers and IPC supplies. CONCLUSION This study findings suggest that IPC adherence strategies point to addressing barriers in the home environment and increasing availability of IPC supplies.

OBJECTIVE: To assess and quantify how people decided whether to present to the ED during the COVID-19 pandemic for care unrelated to COVID-19 using conjoint analysis, a form of trade-off analysis that examines how individuals make complex decisions. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional survey study was conducted using a nationwide sample from June 1, 2020, during the initial peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Included participants were adults aged 18 years or older in the US who self-reported that they had not tested positive for COVID-19. Data were analyzed from July 2020 through May 2021. EXPOSURES: Participants completed a self-administered online survey. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Using a choice-based conjoint analysis survey, the relative importance was assessed for the following attributes for individuals in deciding whether to seek ED care for symptoms consistent with myocardial infarction or appendicitis: reduction in chance of dying because of ED treatment, crowdedness of ED with other patients, and chance of contracting COVID-19 in the ED. We also performed latent class analyses using conjoint data to identify distinct segments of the respondent population with similar choice patterns. Logistic regression was then used to explore whether patient sociodemographics and political affiliations were factors associated with decision-making. RESULTS: Among 1981 individuals invited to participate, 933 respondents (47.1%) completed the survey; participants mean (SD) age was 40.1 (13.0) years, and 491 (52.6%) were women. In latent class analyses, 158 individuals (16.9%) with symptoms of myocardial infarction and 238 individuals (25.5%) with symptoms of appendicitis prioritized avoidance of COVID-19 exposure in the ED (ie, chance of contracting COVID-19 in the ED or crowdedness of ED with other patients) over seeking appropriate care for symptoms. Having a usual source of care was a factor associated with lower odds of prioritizing avoidance of COVID-19 exposure (myocardial infarction scenario: adjusted odds ratio, 0.49 [95% CI, 0.32-0.76]; P = .001; appendicitis scenario: adjusted odds ratio, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.40-0.82]; P = .003), but most sociodemographic factors and political affiliations were not factors associated with decision-making. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that up to one-quarter of individuals were willing to forgo potentially life-saving ED care to avoid exposure to COVID-19. These findings suggest that health care systems and public health organizations should develop effective communications for patients and the community at large that reassure and encourage timely health care for critical needs during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and other scenarios.","output":"Public Perspectives on Decisions About Emergency Care Seeking for Care Unrelated to COVID-19 During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Spain has been severely affected by the COVID-19 epidemic, with 195,944 persons infected and 20,453 deaths at the time of writing.

These traits are significantly more difficult to assess than cognitive performance, creating a potential gap in measurement. Despite its promise, competency-based medical education (CBME) has yet to bridge this gap, partly due to a lack of well-defined noncognitive observable behaviors that assessors and educators can use in formative and summative assessment. As a result, typical undergraduate to graduate medical education handovers stress standardized test scores, and program directors trust little of the remaining information they receive, sometimes turning to third-party companies to better describe potential residency candidates. The authors have created a list of noncognitive attributes, with associated definitions and noncognitive skills-called observable practice activities (OPAs)-written for learners across the continuum to help educators collect assessment data that can be turned into valuable information. OPAs are discrete work-based assessment elements collected over time and mapped to larger structures, such as milestones, entrustable professional activities, or competencies to create learning trajectories for formative and summative decisions. Medical schools and graduate medical education programs could adapt these OPAs or determine ways to create new ones specific to their own contexts. Once OPAs are created, programs will have to find effective ways to assess them, interpret the data, determine consequence validity, and communicate information to learners and institutions. The authors discuss the need for culture change surrounding assessment-even for the adoption of behavior-based tools such as OPAs-including grounding the work in a growth mindset and the broad underpinnings of CBME. Ultimately, improving assessment of noncognitive capacity should benefit learners, schools, programs, and most importantly, patients.","output":"What Behaviors Define a Good Physician?

While the molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 immunopathology is still unknown, it is well established that lung infection is associated with hyper-inflammation and tissue damage. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) contribute to tissue destruction in many pathological situations, and the activity of MMPs in the lung leads to the release of bioactive mediators with inflammatory properties. We sought to characterize a scenario in which MMPs could influence the lung pathogenesis of COVID-19. Although we observed high diversity of MMPs in lung tissue from COVID-19 patients by proteomics, we specified the expression and enzyme activity of MMP-2 in tracheal-aspirate fluid (TAF) samples from intubated COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. Moreover, the expression of MMP-8 was positively correlated with MMP-2 levels and possible shedding of the immunosuppression mediator sHLA-G and sTREM-1. Together, overexpression of the MMP-2/MMP-8 axis, in addition to neutrophil infiltration and products, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), increased lipid peroxidation that could promote intensive destruction of lung tissue in severe COVID-19. Thus, the inhibition of MMPs can be a novel target and promising treatment strategy in severe COVID-19.","output":"Matrix Metalloproteinases on Severe COVID-19 Lung Disease Pathogenesis: Cooperative Actions of MMP-8/MMP-2 Axis on Immune Response through HLA-G Shedding and Oxidative Stress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nanosized cell-derived membrane vesicles are increasingly recognized as therapeutic vehicles and high-potential biomarkers for several diseases. Currently available methods allow bulk analysis of vesicles but are not suited for accurate quantification and fail to reveal phenotypic heterogeneity in membrane vesicle populations. For such analyses, single vesicle-based, multiparameter, high-throughput methods are needed. We developed a fluorescence-based, high-resolution flow cytometric method for quantitative and qualitative analysis of nanosized membrane vesicles. Proof of principle was obtained by single-particle analysis of virions and liposomes. Further validation was obtained by quantification of cell-derived nanosized membrane vesicles from cell cultures and body fluids. An important aspect was that the technology was extended to detect specific proteins on individual vesicles. This allowed identification of exosome subsets and phenotyping of individual exosomes produced by dendritic cells (DCs) undergoing different modes of activation.

Patients and Methods This retrospective study used secondary data from patients electronic medical records at Hasan Sadikin General Hospital and Santo Borromeus Hospital between March 2020 and March 2021. Overall, 2230 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were screened, and 182 of them who were hospitalized 48 hours with a procalcitonin level of 0.25 ng/mL were enrolled. Culture examination was performed on sputum samples to determine pathogen and antibiotic susceptibilities. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine mortality-related risk factors in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Results The prevalence of secondary pulmonary bacterial infections in COVID-19 patients was 8.2%, with 161/182 pathogen growth from sputum samples. Mainly gram-negative bacteria (64.8%) were present, including Acinetobacter baumannii (31.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (19.8%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8.8%). High rate of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens was found among isolate (45.9%), ie carbapenem-resistance A.baumannii (CR-Ab) was 84.2%, extended-spectrum -lactamase (ESBL) among K. pneumoniae was 61.1%. Secondary infection of MDR pathogens was associated with a higher risk of mortality (AOR 5.63, p = 0.001). Other associated factors were age 60 years, ventilator use, and female gender. Conclusion Gram-negative bacteria are the predominant pathogens causing secondary pulmonary bacterial infection in COVID-19 patients, implying nosocomial infection. High resistance to first-line antimicrobial drugs was observed in Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive bacteria. High rate of MDR pathogens was found among isolate and was associated with a significant risk of mortality.","output":"MDR Pathogens Organisms as Risk Factor of Mortality in Secondary Pulmonary Bacterial Infections Among COVID-19 Patients: Observational Studies in Two Referral Hospitals in West Java, Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 is impacting on food systems and food security around the world, including in South Africa, revealed most starkly in rising food prices and increasing food insecurity. Debates on what kind of food system we need to respond to this crisis remain unresolved and lacking in a good understanding of the impacts of Covid-19 on farmers who are key actors in food systems. This article contributes to these debates by revealing the experiences of black fresh produce farmers in South Africa since Covid-19 arrived in the country and the government responded with a range of emergency regulations. This is based on in-depth research with 40 market-orientated black small- and medium-scale farmers. Giving particular attention to black farmers is essential in South Africa given the high levels of continued wealth and racial inequalities. The study has found that, despite overall growth in the agricultural sector, these farmers are facing many challenges and receive inadequate support. The outcomes of Covid-19 related impacts include reductions in production and incomes as well as job losses. If not addressed there could be long-term negative consequences that undermine the food system and reinforce existing inequalities. A holistic food system approach, better informed by an understanding of black farmers and the networks they are part of, will be valuable to finding solutions.

MethodsWe retrospectively queried our data since April 2021 to identify adult patients (>17 years) who had confirmed (positive RT-PCR or antigen test) or suspected COVID-19 (classic symptoms but negative RT-PCR) and received a high-resolution CT scan to determine the extent of their lung involvement using the CT severity (CORAD) score. Patients were classified in 3 groups based on their vaccination status to determine its correlation with the CORAD score: fully vaccinated, partially vaccinated, and unvaccinated. Basic descriptive statistics, univariate tests and multivariate linear regression analysis were used. ResultsWe identified 229 patients (median age 45 years, 60% male) of which 205 (89%) had confirmed COVID-19 (positive RT-PCR) and 24 had suspected disease (negative RT-PCT but classic symptoms).

The Belgian population continues to enjoy good health and long life expectancy. This is partly due to good access to health services of high quality. Financing is based mostly on proportional social security contributions and progressive direct taxation. The compulsory health insurance is combined with a mostly private system of health care delivery, based on independent medical practice, free choice of physician and predominantly fee-for-service payment. This Belgian HiT profile (2010) presents the evolution of the health system since 2007, including detailed information on new policies. While no drastic reforms were undertaken during this period, policy-makers have pursued the goals of improving access to good quality of care while making the system sustainable. Reforms to increase the accessibility of the health system include measures to reduce the out-of-pocket payments of more vulnerable populations (low-income families and individuals as well as the chronically ill). Quality of care related reforms have included incentives to better integrate different levels of care and the establishment of information systems, among others.

With repeated backcross, the introgression may influence evolutionary trajectories through the entry of foreign genes. However, the genetic admixture via hybridization events is often confused with the ancestral polymorphism, especially in closely related species that have experienced similar evolutionary events. In Taiwan, two independent-originated endemic snakebark maples have contrasted postglacial range expansion routes: northward and upward expansion in Acer caudatifolium and downward expansion in A. morrisonense. The range expansion causes the current parapatric distribution, increasing the possibility of introgression. This study elucidates how their genetic variation reflects introgression and historical demography. With 17 EST-SSR markers among the intensely sampled 657 individuals, we confirmed that the genetic admixture between species mainly was attributed to recent introgression instead of common ancestral polymorphism. The secondary contact scenario inferred by approximate Bayesian computation suggested that A. morrisonense received more genetic variations from A. caudatifolium. Introgression occurred in colonized Taiwan around the early Last Glacial Period. Furthermore, the demography of A. caudatifolium was more severely affected by introgression than A. morrisonense, especially in the wavefront populations with high altitude range expansion, implying an altitude-related adaptive introgression. In contrast, A. morrisonense exhibited ubiquitous introgression independent of postglacial expansion, suggesting that introgression in A. morrisonense was neutral. In terms of different genetic consequences, introgression had different demographic impacts on species with different altitude expansion directions even under the same climate-change conditions within an island.","output":"Different Roles of Introgression on the Demographic Change in Two Snakebark Maples, Acer caudatifolium and A. morrisonense, with Contrasted Postglacial Expansion Routes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper discusses on the increasing relevancy of geospatial technologies such as geographic information system (GIS) in the public health domain, particularly for the infectious disease surveillance and modelling strategies.

In vitro experiments using Pull-down assay and Co-immunoprecipitation (CO-IP) assay showed that GRFT binds to the JEV glycosylated viral proteins, specifically the enveloped (E) and premature (prM) glycoproteins. The binding of GRFT to the JEV was competitively inhibited by increasing concentrations of mannose; in turns abolished anti-JEV activity of GRFT. We suggested that, the binding of GRFT to the glycosylated viral proteins may contribute to its anti-JEV activity. Collectively, our data indicated a possible mechanism by which GRFT exerted its anti-JEV activity.

Population genetic analysis could be useful for investigating the origin and evolutionary dynamics of COVID-19. However, due to extensive sampling bias and existence of infection clusters during the epidemic spread, direct applications of existing approaches can lead to biased parameter estimations and data misinterpretation. In this study, we first present robust estimator for the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) and the mutation rate, and then apply the approach to analyze 12,909 genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2. The mutation rate is inferred to be 8.69  10-4 per site per year with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of [8.61  10-4, 8.77  10-4], and the TMRCA of the samples inferred to be Nov 28, 2019 with a 95% CI of [Oct 20, 2019, Dec 9, 2019].

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 1,402 outpatients with diabetes at a clinic in Osaka, Japan, who responded to an interview sheet regarding lifestyle changes during the COVID-19 pandemic between 28 March and 30 May 2020. The association of lifestyle changes with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and weight changes from February to May 2020 was investigated using the linear regression model. We also investigated the association with clinically important change of HbA1c (by &#8805;0.3%) and bodyweight (by &#8805;3%), using the cumulative link model. RESULTS: Leisure time and other outside physical activities were decreased in one-quarter of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas the amount of meals and snacks was decreased and increased in approximately 10%, respectively. The change in leisure time physical activities was inversely associated with HbA1c and weight changes, whereas the quantitative change of meals with the decline in eating out and that of snacks were positively associated with HbA1c and weight changes (all P < 0.05). The quantitative change of meals without the decline in eating out was also positively associated with weight change (P = 0.012). The cumulative link model for clinically important HbA1c and weight change showed broadly similar associations, except for that between snacks and bodyweight (P = 0.15).

Objective: To estimate the duration of the IgG(S) response to the mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine in NH residents with (COV-Yes) or without (COV-No) history of natural infection with SARS-CoV-2. Design, setting and participants: IgG(S) quantification was carried out at 3 different time periods following administration of the Pfizer BioNtech vaccine: three then seven months after the 2nd dose and one month after the 3rd dose. 574 COV-Yes and COV-No NH residents were included in 2 cohorts: Main (n=115, mean age 84 years) or Confirmatory (n=459, mean age 88 years). Exposure: All subjects received the BNT162b2 vaccine. Main outcomes and measurements: IgG(S) antibodies and seroneutralization capacity. Results: Neutralization capacity was strongly correlated with IgG(S) levels (R2:76%) without any difference between COV-Yes and COV-No groups for the same levels of IgG(S). COV-Yes, compared to the COV-No subjects showed 5-fold and 15-fold higher IgG(S) titers 3 and 7 months after the 2nd dose, but less than 2-fold higher IgG(S) after the 3rd dose, due to a more pronounced effect of the 3rd dose in the COV-No group. These results were similar in both cohorts. After the 2nd dose, duration of assumed robust protection (IgG(S) >264 BAU/ml) was 2-fold higher in the COV-Yes vs. COV-No group: 12.60 (10.69-14.44) vs 5.76 (3.91-8.64) months, and this advantage was mainly due to the higher IgG(S) titers after the 2nd dose and secondary to a slower decay over time. After the 3rd dose, duration (months) of robust protection was estimated at 11.87 (9.88-14.87) (COV-Yes) and 8.95 (6.85-11.04) (COV-No). Conclusions and relevance: In old subjects living in NH, history of SARS-CoV-2 infection provides a clear advantage in the magnitude and duration of high IgG(S) titers following the 2nd dose. Importantly, the 3rd dose induces a much more pronounced IgG(S) response than the 2nd dose in COV-No subjects, the effect of which should be able to ensure in these subjects a prolonged protection against severe forms of COVID-19.","output":"History of SARS-CoV-2 infection, anti-spike IgG antibody kinetics and neutralization capacities following the second and third dose of BNT162b2 vaccine in nursing home residents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: Although the infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus affects primarily the lungs, it is well known that associated cardiovascular (CV) complications are important contributors to the increased morbidity and mortality of COVID-19.

Unscheduled care can include attending emergency departments, ambulance callouts, out-of-hours care, and non-elective hospital admissions. A large proportion of non-elective hospital admissions involve people with diabetes, with significant health and economic burden. AIM: To identify precipitating factors influencing diabetes-related unscheduled hospital admissions, exploring potential preventive strategies to reduce admissions. DESIGN & SETTING: Thirty-six people with type 1 (n = 11) or type 2 (n = 25) diabetes were interviewed. They were admitted to hospital for unscheduled diabetes-related care across three hospitals in Scotland, Northern Ireland, and the Republic of Ireland. Participants were admitted for peripheral limb complications (n = 17), hypoglycaemia (n = 5), hyperglycaemia (n = 6), or for comorbidities presenting with erratic blood glucose levels (n = 8). METHOD: Factors precipitating admissions were examined using framework analysis. RESULTS: Three aspects of care influenced unscheduled admissions: perceived inadequate knowledge of diabetes complications; restricted provision of care; and complexities in engagement with self-care and help-seeking. Limited specialist professional knowledge of diabetes by staff in primary and community care, alongside inadequate patient self-management knowledge, led to inappropriate treatment and significant delays. This was compounded by restricted provision of care, characterised by poor access to services  in time and proximity  and poor continuity of care. Complexities in patient engagement, help-seeking, and illness beliefs further complicated the progression to unscheduled admissions.

Methods: Different hematologic parameters were measured in 225 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in a tertiary care university hospital, during the peak of COVID-19 outbreak and their association with duration of hospitalization, ICU admission and especially mortality was analyzed. Results: Among a total of 225 patients, 24.4% did not survive after admission. Lymphopenia and neutrophilia were observed in 52.7% and 21.4% of the patients, respectively. The mean count of neutrophils was significantly higher in non-survived patients (P = .032). Elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was significantly associated with mortality (P < .001). Low hemoglobin (Hb) concentration significantly correlated with mortality (P = .004) and ICU admission (P = .04). Platelet (Plt) count was significantly lower in the non-survived patients (P = .023).

In the absence of vaccines and effective therapeutical solutions, non-pharmaceutic intervention has become a major way for controlling the epidemic. Gentle mitigation interventions are able to slow down the epidemic but not to halt it well. While strict suppression interventions are efficient for controlling the epidemic, long-term measures are likely to have negative impacts on economics and peoples daily live. Hence, dynamically balancing suppression and mitigation interventions plays a fundamental role in manipulating the epidemic curve. METHODS: We collected data of the number of infections for several countries during the COVID-19 pandemics and found a clear phenomenon of periodic waves of infection. Based on the observation, by connecting the infection level with the medical resources and a tolerance parameter, we propose a mathematical model to understand impacts of combining intervention measures on the epidemic dynamics. RESULTS: Depending on the parameters of the medical resources, tolerance level, and the starting time of interventions, the combined intervention measure dynamically changes with the infection level, resulting in a periodic wave of infections controlled below an accepted level. The study reveals that, (a) with an immediate, strict suppression, the numbers of infections and deaths are well controlled with a significant reduction in a very short time period; (b) an appropriate, dynamical combination of suppression and mitigation may find a feasible way in reducing the impacts of epidemic on peoples live and economics. CONCLUSIONS: While the assumption of interventions deployed with a cycle of period in the model is limited and unrealistic, the phenomenon of periodic waves of infections in reality is captured by our model.

In this study, we provide a coherent overview of the duration of viral detection and viral RNA load in COVID-19 patients, stratified by specimen type, clinical severity, and age. METHOD: We systematically searched PubMed/MEDLINE and Cochrane review database for studies published between 1.11.2019 and 23.04.2020. We pooled the data of selected studies (22/7226 (650 patients) for meta-analysis) to estimate duration of viral detection and visualized viral load over time. FINDINGS: Our analysis showed consistent viral detection from specimen from the upper respiratory tract (URT), the lower respiratory tract (LRT), and faeces, irrespective of the clinical severity of COVID-19. Our analysis suggests that SARS-CoV-2 persists for a longer duration in the LRT compared to the URT in adult patients (5?7 days in mild; 5?9 days in moderate-severe patients). The differences in the duration of viral detection between mild and moderate-severe patients is limited in the LRT, but an indication of longer duration of viral detection for moderate-severe patients was observed in feces (15 days in mild vs. 21 days in moderate-severe patients) and the URT (12 days in mild vs. 16 days in moderate-severe patients). Further, viral load was demonstrated to peak in earlier stages of infection in the URT compared to LRT.

CE patients had a higher incidence of ischemic heart disease (IHD) (p<.03), heart failure (p<.04), and psychiatric disorders (p<.001). During COVID time, more patients were hospitalized with myocarditis (OR: 26.45), arrhythmias (OR: 2.88), and new heart failure (HF) (p<.001) and less with STEMI (OR: 0.39; 95% CI: 0.24-0.63). Fewer PCIs were performed in the CE group (p<.001), with an overall lower success rate (p<.05) than reported in the control group. Patients in the CE group reported a longer period between symptom onset to hospital arrival (p<.001, 2 = 12.42). The six-month survival rate was significantly lower in CE patients (2 = 7.01, P =.008). CONCLUSIONS: Among CICU patients admitted to our center during the initial period of the COVID pandemic, STEMI events were less frequent while cases of newly diagnosed HF sharply increased. Patients waited longer after symptom onset before seeking medical care during the pandemic. The delay may have resulted in clinical deterioration that could explain the high mortality rate and the new HF admission rate.","output":"Profile Trends of Non-COVID Patients Admitted to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit during the 2020 COVID Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute respiratory tract infections are an extremely common and important source of morbidity and mortality.

Literature categories, research hotpots, and the most prolific publications by country, institution, and author were analysed separately. Around 34% of the articles are contributed from five countries: China (29.37%), India (11.00%), Spain (6.29%), Italy (6.20%), and Pakistan (5.67%). The hot research topic keywords were \\"diversity\\", \\"translocation\\", and \\"enhanced phytoremediation\\". Cadmium was the most highly concerned heavy metal in the phytoremediation. Twenty-three articles were highly cited, and they mainly focused on 1) enhancing the remediation ability of plants in heavy metal contaminated soil by microbial and chemical additives; 2) the molecular effect and mechanism of heavy metals on plant growth and development; 3) discovering novel heavy metal hyper-enriched plants which can remediate mixed heavy metal pollution. From the above analysis, we concluded that the future research directions should be 1) strengthening the plant remediation ability by biochemical means; 2) studying the molecular mechanism underlying heavy metal damage to plants; 3) studying the enrichment principle of plants for heavy metals. The present study provides a further understanding of the trends in phytoremediation of heavy metal pollution, and the data analysed can be used as a guide for future research directions.","output":"Phytoremediation of heavy metal pollution: Hotspots and future prospects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To determine the nursing workload in intensive care units (ICUs) and the factors associated with the Nursing Activities Score (NAS). METHOD An analytical cross-sectional study was carried out in three ICUs in Bucaramanga, Colombia, between February 2018 and February 2020. The nursing workload was estimated based on the NAS. A descriptive and bivariate analysis stratified by ICU was performed using a robust multiple linear regression model, and the factors associated with the nursing workload (p < 0.05) were estimated. RESULTS In this study, 362 records were included. The median NAS was 68.1 points (Q1:47.2-Q3:116.7). APACHE II ( = 3.13, CI: 95% 2.28; 3.98), days of stay in ICU 3 ( = 16.78, CI: 95% 6.15; 27.41), surgery provenance service ( = 22.31, CI: 95% 9.76; 34.86), and traumatology and emergencies diagnostic category ( = 33.72, CI 95%: 9.90; 57.53) were associated with high NAS scores.

However, sometimes the stress response can be inappropriate, excessive, or prolonged; in which case, it can hinder rather than help in coping with the stressor, impair normal functioning, and increase the risk of somatic and mental health disorders. There is a need for a more effective and safe pharmacological treatment that can dampen maladaptive stress responses. The endocannabinoid system is one of the main regulators of the stress response. A basal endocannabinoid tone inhibits the stress response, modulation of this tone permits/curtails an active stress response, and chronic deficiency in the endocannabinoid tone is associated with the pathological complications of chronic stress. Cannabidiol is a safe exogenous cannabinoid enhancer of the endocannabinoid system that could be a useful treatment for stress. There have been seven double-blind placebo controlled clinical trials of CBD for stress on a combined total of 232 participants and one partially controlled study on 120 participants. All showed that CBD was effective in significantly reducing the stress response and was non-inferior to pharmaceutical comparators, when included. The clinical trial results are supported by the established mechanisms of action of CBD (including increased N-arachidonylethanolamine levels) and extensive real-world and preclinical evidence of the effectiveness of CBD for treating stress.","output":"Enhancing Endocannabinoid Control of Stress with Cannabidiol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is posing a great threat to global health and economy. Due to the lack of broad diagnostic setup, consistent reagent supply lines, and access to laboratory instruments and equipment, it is undoubtedly an enormous burden for developing countries to face the crisis. OBJECTIVES: To develop a cost-effective, reliable and sensitive multiplex assay for SARS-CoV-2 screening which would expand the testing capacities of a developing and low-income country like Bangladesh. STUDY DESIGN: Initially a singleplex and then a multiplex real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR assays were developed targeting 2 nucleocapsid genes of SARS-CoV-2, and the human RNase P gene as an internal control using laboratory-made mastermixes. Three sets of primer- probes were designed for each of the target genes and one set was optimized for the final reaction set-up. Limit of detection, cross-reactivity and reproducibility were checked in order to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the assays, and validation was done using clinical specimens. RESULTS: Clinical evaluation of the new assays using 240 nasopharyngeal swabs showed 100 % sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection in human. Equal efficiency and concordant results were observed between the singleplex and multiplex approaches. Notably, the kit was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA at very low concentration upto 5 copies/reaction. CONCLUSION: This is the first locally developed multiplex rRT-PCR kit in Bangladesh providing rapid and low-cost screening of COVID-19 which would be valuable for infection prevention and clinical management in the perspective of Bangladesh.","output":"Development and performance evaluation of the first in-house multiplex rRT-PCR assay in Bangladesh for highly sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Liposomes have been used extensively as micro- and nanocarriers for hydrophobic or hydrophilic molecules. However, conventional liposomes are biodegradable and quickly eliminated, making it difficult to be used for delivery in specific routes, such as the oral and systemic routes. One way to overcome this problem is through complexation with polymers, which is referred to as a liposome complex. The use of polymers can increase the stability of liposome with regard to pH, chemicals, enzymes, and the immune system. In some cases, specific polymers can condition the properties of liposomes to be explicitly used in drug delivery, such as targeted delivery and controlled release. These properties are influenced by the type of polymer, crosslinker, interaction, and bond in the complexation process. Therefore, it is crucial to study and review these parameters for the development of more optimal forms and properties of the liposome complex. This article discusses the use of natural and synthetic polymers, ways of interaction between polymers and liposomes (on the surface, incorporation in lamellar chains, and within liposomes), types of bonds, evaluation standards, and their effects on the stability and pharmacokinetic profile of the liposome complex, drugs, and vaccines. This article concludes that both natural and synthetic polymers can be used in modifying the structure and physicochemical properties of liposomes to specify their use in targeted delivery, controlled release, and stabilizing drugs and vaccines.","output":"Liposome-polymer complex for drug delivery system and vaccine stabilization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the early months of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, our center reported a mortality rate of 34% in a cohort of 32 lung transplant recipients with COVID-19 between March and May 2020. Since then, there has been evolving knowledge in prevention and treatments of COVID-19. To evaluate the impact of these changes, we describe the clinical presentation, management, and outcomes of a more recent cohort of lung transplant recipients during the second surge and provide a comparison with our first cohort. METHODS. We conducted a retrospective cohort study that included all consecutive lung transplant recipients who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 between November 2020 and February 28, 2021. We compared baseline demographics and major outcomes between the first- and second-surge cohorts. RESULTS. We identified 47 lung transplant recipients (median age, 60; 51% female) who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 between November 2020 and February 28, 2021. The current cohort had a higher proportion of patients with mild disease (34% versus 16%) and fewer patients with a history of obesity (4% versus 25%). Sixty-six percent (n = 31) required hospitalization and were treated with remdesivir (90%) and dexamethasone (84%). Among those hospitalized, 77% (n = 24) required supplemental oxygen, and 22% (n = 7) required invasive mechanical ventilation. The overall 90-d mortality decreased from 34% to 17% from the first cohort to the second (adjusted odds ratio, 0.26; 95% confidence interval, 0.08-0.85; P = 0.026). CONCLUSIONS.

Telemedicine is a good option to help reduce in-person visits during the pandemic. Saudi Arabia has prepared for this pandemic by implementing applications, such as Tetamman and Seha. In this study, we aimed to determine the readiness of the Saudi population to use telemedicine for musculoskeletal care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from July 2020 to October 2020. The study used a predesigned, self-administered questionnaire with acceptable internal consistency (Cronbachs =0.79). A questionnaire with 30 questions was distributed electronically and randomly to the Saudi population. The included participants were Arabic speakers, Saudis, and men or women age 18 years or older. Results: A total of 635 respondents, of which 250 were men (39.4%) and 385 were women (60.6%), completed the questionnaire. The most common region of residence was the Central region (41.6%), followed by the Eastern region (28%). The proportions of patients who had knowledge about virtual clinics and who used a virtual clinic during the COVID-19 pandemic were 47.6% and 30.4%, respectively. The mean overall attitude score was 24.4 (standard deviation, 9.9) of 35 points; negative, neutral, and positive attitudes were reported among 9.9%, 54.3%, and 35.7% of respondents, respectively. Compared with the older population, younger-aged participants (25 years) had significantly more positive attitudes about virtual clinics ((2)=6.068; p=0.048). Those respondents who had never been married showed significantly more positive attitudes about virtual clinics compared with those who had been married ((2)=6.695; p=0.035).

During the pandemic, dramatic decreases in seasonal influenza virus detection have been reported worldwide. Information on pediatric influenza-related hospitalizations is limited. We describe influenza-related hospitalization in Canadian children during the 2020/2021 influenza season compared to ten previous seasons. METHODS: Data on influenza-related hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and in-hospital deaths in children across Canada were obtained from the Canadian Immunization Monitoring Program, ACTive (IMPACT). This national surveillance initiative comprises 90% of all tertiary care pediatric beds in Canada. The total study period included eleven influenza seasons from September 2010 to April 2021 inclusive. Time series modelling was used to compare trends in influenza-related hospitalizations during the 2020/2021 season (September 2020 to April 2021 inclusive) with the ten previous seasons. RESULTS: During the 2020/2021 influenza season there were no pediatric influenza infection-related hospitalizations. This was a significant decrease compared to the predicted total influenza-related hospitalizations for this period (p< 0.001). No pediatric ICU admission or deaths were reported for the 2020/2021 influenza season. CONCLUSION: We show complete absence of influenza infection-related hospitalization in children in Canada during the 2020/2021 season. This significant decrease is likely related in large part to non-pharmacological public health interventions implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic, although the potential role of viral interference is unknown. Our findings suggest measures such as use of facemasks, hand-washing, distancing and school closures may be beneficial for influenza control and mitigation of future influenza epidemics.

We sought to develop and validate a clinical risk score that uses readily accessible information at testing to predict individualized 30-day hospitalization risk following COVID-19 diagnosis. METHODS: We assembled a retrospective cohort of U.S. Veterans Health Administration patients (age  18 years) diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020. We screened patient characteristics using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator logistic regression and constructed the risk score using characteristics identified as most predictive for hospitalization. Patients diagnosed before November 1, 2020, comprised the development cohort, while those diagnosed on or after November 1, 2020, comprised the validation cohort. We assessed risk score discrimination by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve and calibration using the HosmerCLemeshow (HL) goodness-of-fit test. This study was approved by the Veterans Institutional Review Board of Northern New England at the White River Junction Veterans Affairs Medical Center (Reference no.:1473972-1). RESULTS: The development and validation cohorts comprised 11,473 and 12,970 patients, of whom 4,465 (38.9%) and 3,669 (28.3%) were hospitalized, respectively. The independent predictors for hospitalization included in the risk score were increasing age, male sex, non-white race, Hispanic ethnicity, homelessness, nursing home/long-term care residence, unemployed or retired status, fever, fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, cough, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Model discrimination and calibration was good for the development (AUROC = 0.80; HL P-value = .05) and validation (AUROC = 0.80; HL P-value = .31) cohorts.

RESULTS: Seventy-four studies with total 5560 pregnant women included in this systematic review. The results show that the pooled prevalence of neonatal mortality, lower birth weight, stillbirth, premature birth, and intrauterine fetal distress in women with COVID-19 was 4% (95% Cl: 1 - 9%), 21% (95% Cl: 11 - 31%), 2% (95% Cl: 1 - 6%), 28% (95% Cl: 13 - 43%), and 14% (95% Cl: 4 - 25%); respectively. Moreover, the pooled prevalence of fever, cough, diarrhea, and dyspnea were 56% (95% Cl: 32 - 81%), 29% (95% Cl: 21 - 38%), 9% (95% Cl: 2 - 16%), and 3% (95% Cl: 1 - 6%) in pregnant women with COVID-19.

CONCLUSION: According to this meta-analysis, pregnant women with COVID-19 with or without pneumonia, are at a higher risk of preeclampsia, preterm birth, miscarriage and cesarean delivery. Furthermore, the risk of LBW and intrauterine fetal distress seems to be increased in neonates. In addition, our evaluations are investigative of higher risk of COVID-19 in the third trimester in pregnant women comparing to the first and second trimester.

Alongside COVID-19, diabetes is a long-standing global epidemic. The diabetes population has been reported to suffer adverse outcomes if infected by COVID-19. The aim was to summarise information and resources available on diabetes and COVID-19, highlighting special measures that individuals with diabetes need to follow. METHODS: A search using keywords COVID-19 and Diabetes was performed using different sources, including PubMed and World Health Organization. RESULTS: COVID-19 may enhance complications in individuals with diabetes through an imbalance in angiotension-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) activation pathways leading to an inflammatory response. ACE2 imbalance in the pancreas causes acute -cell dysfunction and a resultant hyperglycemic state. These individuals may be prone to worsened COVID-19 complications including vasculopathy, coagulopathy as well as psychological stress. Apart from general preventive measures, remaining hydrated, monitoring blood glucose regularly and monitoring ketone bodies in urine if on insulin is essential. All this while concurrently maintaining physical activity and a healthy diet. Different supporting entities are being set up to help this population. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is a top priority. It is important to remember that a substantial proportion of the world's population is affected by other co-morbidities such as diabetes. These require special attention during this pandemic to avoid adding on to the burden of countries' healthcare systems.","output":"COVID-19 and diabetes: The why, the what and the how"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 infection manifests itself with several clinical forms, from an asymptomatic course to a life-threatening multiple-organ dysfunction. In terms of pathogenesis, these clinical forms can be divided into a group of mucosal infections (respiratory tract infections, gastroenteritis) and internal organ infections (especially pneumonia). Of particular concern is the dysregulated immune response associated with the production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF) which is otherwise typical of severe bacterial infections. Knowledge of the pathogenetic context allows for better interpretation of the virological and serological findings and aids in choosing an individualized covid-19 treatment.

Thus, our goal was to review the literature on COVID and T1DM. RECENT FINDINGS We identified 21 reports focusing on COVID-19 infections among patients with preexisting T1DM (n = 7), incident T1DM presentations during the COVID-19 quarantine (n = 6), and outpatient management of T1DM during the COVID-19 quarantine (n = 8). These studies showed that patients with preexisting T1DM and COVID-19 infection often present with hyperglycemia and/or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Although the risk of in-hospital mortality may be increased, hospitalization rates among patients with T1DM mirror that of the general population. The numbers of patients presenting with incident T1DM during COVID-19 quarantine have remained stable, but cases with severe DKA may have increased. COVID-19 quarantine has also impacted outpatient T1DM management and studies examining changes in glycemic control have shown mixed results.

In mice, æ T cells are a large component of the IEL population. In the rat, æ IELs are reportedly much less common, but technical issues suggest that previous analyses should be interpreted cautiously. The study of IELs in rats has been impeded by isolation procedures that are lengthy and complex, leading to small cell yields. For this reason, it is possible that rat IELs analyzed in previous studies have not been representative of the entire IEL compartment. We report a new method for the isolation of rat IELs that is based on the selective removal of intestinal epithelial cells under conditions that leave the basement membrane undisturbed. The method is rapid and requires neither enzymatic digestion, nor surgical removal of Peyer's patches, nor vigorous mechanical manipulation of the intestine. The yield of rat IELs using this method is 5- to 10-fold greater than that reported for other methods. Morphological and phenotypic analyses demonstrated that the purified cell population is comprised of IELs and is not contaminated with lamina propria or Peyer's patch lymphocytes. Phenotypic analysis revealed five major subsets of IELs based on differential cell surface expression of CD4, CD8, and  T cell receptor (TcR). Among the TcR(?) cells was a population of æ T cells present at levels not previously detected. The isolation of IEL sub-populations using this methodology should facilitate studies of the function of these cells in gut immunity.","output":"A new isolation method for rat intraepithelial lymphocytes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although most SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals experience mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), some patients suffer from severe COVID-19, which is accompanied by acute respiratory distress syndrome and systemic inflammation. To identify factors driving severe progression of COVID-19, we performed single-cell RNA-seq using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from healthy donors, patients with mild or severe COVID-19, and patients with severe influenza. Patients with COVID-19 exhibited hyper-inflammatory signatures across all types of cells among PBMCs, particularly up-regulation of the TNF/IL-1-driven inflammatory response as compared to severe influenza. In classical monocytes from patients with severe COVID-19, type I IFN response co-existed with the TNF/IL-1-driven inflammation, and this was not seen in patients with milder COVID-19. Interestingly, we documented type I IFN-driven inflammatory features in patients with severe influenza as well.

METHODS: COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital between February 25 and May 2, 2020, were retrospectively included according to the following criteria: (a) COVID-19 defined as severe based on the WHO interim guidance (i.e., clinical signs of pneumonia plus respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min, severe respiratory distress, and/or SpO(2) < 90% on room air); (b) chest radiograph in the acute setting; (c) post-discharge unenhanced chest CT; and (d) post-discharge comprehensive PFT. Imaging findings were retrospectively evaluated in consensus by two readers, and volume of abnormal lung was measured on CT using 3D Slicer software. Differences between demographics, comorbidities, acute radiographic findings, PFT, and post-discharge clinical and laboratory data of patients with normal and abnormal CT findings were assessed by Mann-Whitney or Fisher tests, and the compromised lung volume-PFT association by Pearson correlation after removing possible outliers. RESULTS: At a median of 105 days from symptom onset, 74/91 (81%) patients had CT abnormalities. The most common CT pattern was combined ground-glass opacity and reticular pattern (46/74, 62%) along with architectural distortion (68/74, 92%) and bronchial dilatation (66/74, 89%). Compromised lung volume had a median value of 15% [11C23], was higher in dyspneic patients, and negatively correlated with the percentage of predicted DLCO, VA, and FVC values (r = -0.39, -0.5, and -0.42, respectively). These PFT parameters were significantly lower in patients with CT abnormalities. Impairment of DLCO and KCO was found in 12 (13%) cases, possibly implying an underlying pulmonary vasculopathy in this subgroup of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Most severe COVID-19 survivors still had physiologically relevant CT abnormalities about three months after the disease onset, with an impairment of diffusion capacity on PFT.

If the basic assumption of vice epistemology is right, then people with epistemic vices such as indifference to the truth or rigidity in their belief structures will tend to be more susceptible to believing COVID-19 misinformation. We carried out an observational study (US sample, n = 998) in which we measured the level of epistemic vice of participants using a novel Epistemic Vice Scale.

This study sought to qualitatively explore the views of health care providers in British Columbia (BC), Canada, on strategies for integrating preventive oral health into prenatal care. METHODS Twenty-four purposefully selected health care providers (13 oral health and 11 prenatal care providers) in Vancouver and Surrey BC participated in audio-recorded semistructured interviews. Interviews lasted from 31 to 61 min, were transcribed verbatim, and were analyzed using an inductive thematic analysis with N-Vivo software. Study validity was ensured via memoing, fieldnotes, member checking, and external audit. RESULTS Thematic analysis revealed 5 major themes: perception of integrated care, relevance of integrated prenatal oral health, strategies for achieving integrated prenatal oral health, drivers of the integration process, and barriers to integrating oral health during pregnancy. Interprofessional collaboration based on information sharing and communication was identified as a critical factor for integrated care. Oral health checks should be a component of prenatal assessments for achieving integrated prenatal oral health. Participants recommended that prenatal providers should offer oral health education and use screening questions to identify the pregnant woman's oral health needs. The establishment of referral systems was advocated, while dental assessments and oral prophylaxis via the medical services plan were proposed. The inclusion of dental providers in prenatal teams and educating health care providers on interprofessional collaboration were also supported. CONCLUSION Oral health and prenatal providers in BC are positively disposed to adopting integrated preventive prenatal oral health care based on interprofessional collaborative practices. The inclusion of oral health providers in prenatal teams was suggested.

This presentation (a) summarizes recommendations from six key organizations related to preparation for and response to COVID in AL in relation to resident health and quality of life;(b) compares recommendations for AL with those for NHs;and (c) assesses implications for the future of AL. Methods: We collected, categorized, and summarized recommendations related to preparation for and response to COVID in AL, long-term care in general, and NHs, from six key organizations: the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Centers for Medicare& Medicaid Services, the American Geriatrics Society, the Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine, the American Health Care Association/National Center for Assisted Living, and the Alzheimer's Association. Results: Recommendations for AL and NHs were similar in many areas, while differences provided insight into the ways that the pandemic has challenged AL in particular, and may have implications for the evolution of AL. Differences include recommending more flexible visitation and group activities for AL, providing screening by AL staff or an outside provider, and suggesting that AL staff should access resources to facilitate advance care planning. Recommendations for both AL and NHs that provide insight into how AL may be integrating more health care into their offered services include working with consulting clinicians who know both the resident and the AL setting when making transfer decisions, and suggesting that AL communities follow guidance for testing as recommended for NHs.

Consequently, embedding digital into current systems was suggested towards maximising health outcomes for patients. Prior to this strategy NHS Ayrshire and Arran's musculoskeletal service developed a local self-management website for common MSK conditions. This innovation was developed to embrace the Scottish Governments 2020 vision concerning improving accessibility and supporting self-management. As a result the aim of this retrospective evaluation of practice was to see if the digital transformation could: 1. Influenced referral numbers into the service 2. Be accepted by local service users 3. Be inclusive within Ayrshire communities. Methods: The website was audited retrospectively via Google Analytics? to ascertain the monthly views from July 2019 to July 2020. Referral numbers were then collated from Trackcare from previously triaged referrals into the South locality of the musculoskeletal service. Each referral and subsequent discharge report was reviewed to establish the diagnosed conditions pre-website (2018) to gain an average referral rate. The 2018 data was then compared with referral trends post-website development (2019/2020) to assess the impact.

These alterations are commonly accompanied by a rise in neuronal activity. Therefore, hippocampal formation plays an important role in the manifestation of schizophrenia. Furthermore, studies with animal models revealed a link between environmental risk factors and morphological as well as electrophysiological abnormalities in the hippocampus. Here, we review recent findings on structural and functional hippocampal abnormalities in schizophrenic patients and in schizophrenia animal models, and we give an overview on current experimental approaches that especially target the hippocampus.

Although the COVID-19 pandemic has vastly expanded telehealth use, no studies to our knowledge have analyzed the implementation and success of telehealth for orthopaedic trauma. This population is unique in that patients who have experienced orthopaedic trauma range in age from early childhood to late adulthood, they vary across the socioeconomic spectrum, may need to undergo emergent or urgent surgery, often have impaired mobility, and, historically, do not always follow-up consistently with healthcare providers. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) To what extent did telehealth usage increase for an outpatient orthopaedic trauma clinic at a Level 1 trauma center from the month before the COVID-19 stay-at-home order compared with the month immediately following the order? (2) What is the proportion of no-show visits before and after the implementation of telehealth? METHODS: After nonurgent clinic visits were postponed, telehealth visits were offered to all patients due to the COVID-19 stay-at-home order. Patients with internet access who had the ability to download the MyChart application on their mobile device and agreed to a telehealth visit were seen virtually between March 16, 2020 and April 10, 2020 (COVID-19) by three attending orthopaedic trauma surgeons at a large, urban, Level 1 trauma center. Clinic schedules and patient charts were reviewed to determine clinical volumes and no-show proportions. The COVID-19 period was compared with the 4 weeks before March 16, 2020 (pre-COVID-19), when all visits were conducted in-person. The overall clinic volume decreased from 340 to 233 (31%) between the two periods. The median (range) age of telehealth patients was 46 years (20 to 89). Eighty-four percent (72 of 86) of telehealth visits were postoperative and established nonoperative patient visits, and 16% (14 of 86) were new-patient visits. To avoid in-person suture or staple removal, patients seen for their 2-week postoperative visit had either absorbable closures, staples, or nonabsorbable sutures removed by a home health registered nurse or skilled nursing facility registered nurse. If radiographs were indicated, they were obtained at outside facilities or our institution before patients returned home for their telehealth visit. RESULTS: There was an increase in the percentage of office visits conducted via telehealth between the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods (0% [0 of 340] versus 37% [86 of 233]; p < 0.001), and by the third week of implementation, telehealth comprised approximately half of all clinic visits (57%; [30 of 53]). There was no difference in the no-show proportion between the two periods (13% [53 of 393] for the pre-COVID-19 period and 14% [37 of 270] for the COVID-19 period; p = 0.91). CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should consider implementing telehealth strategies to provide high-quality care for patients and protect the workforce during a pandemic. In a previously telehealth-na?ve clinic, we show successful implementation of telehealth for a diverse orthopaedic trauma population that historically has issues with mobility and follow-up. Our strategies include postponing long-term follow-up visits, having sutures or staples removed by a home health or skilled nursing facility registered nurse, having patients obtain pertinent imaging before the visit, and ensuring that patients have access to mobile devices and internet connectivity. Future studies should evaluate the incidence of missed infections or stiffness as a result of telehealth, analyze the subset of patients who may be more vulnerable to no-shows or technological failures, and conduct patient surveys to determine the factors that contribute to patient preferences for or against the use of telehealth.

Methionine- and choline-deficient diets (MCDD) induce fatty liver in mice which is partly mediated by triglyceride (TG) lipolysis in white adipose tissues (WATs). Because Fatp4 knockdown has been shown to increase adipocyte lipolysis in vitro, here, we determined the effects of MCDD on WAT lipolysis in aP2-Cre Fatp4-knockout (Fatp4A-/- ) mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: Isolated WATs of Fatp4A-/- mice exposed to MCD medium showed an increase in lipolysis, and the strongest effect was noted on glycerol release from subcutaneous fat. Fatp4A-/- mice fed with MCDD for 4 weeks showed an increase in serum glycerol, TG, and leptin levels associated with the activation of hormone-sensitive lipase in subcutaneous fat. Chow-fed Fatp4A-/- mice also showed an increase in serum leptin and very-low-density lipoproteins as well as liver phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin levels. Both chow- and MCDD-fed Fatp4A-/- mice showed a decrease in serum ketone and WAT sphingomyelin levels which supported a metabolic shift to TG for subsequent WAT lipolysis. CONCLUSIONS: Adipose Fatp4 deficiency led to TG lipolysis and leptin release, which were exaggerated by MCDD. Our data imply hyperlipidemia risk by a low dietary choline intake and gene mutations that increase adipose TG levels. This article is protected by copyright.

As the global pandemic development is beyond each persons control, we predicted that two basic assumptions about the world, namely its order and positivity, would play an important role. Two studies on the Polish population took place in December 2020 and January 2021. The most interesting finding was that in both studies, belief in world orderliness negatively moderated, i.e., hampered, the positive relationship between belief in the worlds positivity and willingness to vaccinate. It seems that the COVID-19 vaccination might evoke ia feeling of disruption in biological and social natural functioning. If we generalize, any idea undermining our habits and shared beliefs is the more challenged and opposed we have strong faith in the world as an ordered and predictable reality. Believing in the worlds positivity may even aggregate this attitude. In discussing these results, we propose how to introduce new ideas or innovative products to consumers.

Peptides, alongside small molecules and antibodies, are used and are gaining further interest as protein-protein interaction (PPI) modulators. Peptides have high target specificity and high affinity, but, unlike small molecule modulators, they are not able to cross the cell membranes to reach their intracellular targets. To overcome this limitation, the special property of the cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) could benefit their cause. CPPs are a class of peptides that can enter the cells and with them also deliver the attached cargoes. Today, with the advancement of in silico prediction tools and the availability of protein databases, designing new and multifunctional peptides that are able to reach intracellular targets and inhibit certain cellular processes in a very specific manner is reachable. Although there are several efficient CPP sequences already known, the discovery of new CPPs is crucial for the development of efficient delivery methods for both biotechnological and therapeutic applications. In this work, we chose 10 human nuclear proteins from which we predicted new potential CPP sequences by using three different CPP predictors: cell-penetrating peptide prediction tool, CellPPD, and SkipCPP-Pred. From each protein, one predicted CPP sequence was synthesized and its internalization into cells was assessed. Out of the tested sequences, three peptides displayed features characteristic to CPPs. These peptides and also the predicted peptide sequences could be used to design and modify new CPPs. In this work, we show that we can use protein sequences as input for generating new peptides with cell internalization properties. Three new CPPs, AHRR(8-24), CASC3(251-264), and AKIP1(27-37), can be further used for the delivery of other cargoes or designed into multifunctional peptides with capability of internalizing cells.","output":"Cell-Penetrating Peptides Predicted From CASC3, AKIP1, and AHRR Proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To characterize the delivery of emergent ophthalmic surgical care during April 2020 of the COVID-19 pandemic compared with the same time interval the year prior. DESIGN: Retrospective, observational before-and-after study METHODS: Review and characterization of each emergent/urgent procedure performed during April 2020 and April 2019 at a single tertiary ophthalmology referral center. Information collected included the details of patient presentation, diagnosis, surgical procedure, and preoperative COVID-19 testing. RESULTS: In total, 117 surgical procedures were performed on 114 patients during the month of April 2020 compared with 1,107 performed in April 2019 (p< 0.0001). Retinal detachment repair was the most common procedure (37, 31.6%) in April 2020 while elective cataract surgery (481, 47.3%) was most common in April 2019. The mean age of patients was 50.0 years in April of 2020 compared to 59.0 years (p<0.0001) the year prior. During April 2020, the mean age of surgeons performing procedures was 42.3 years compared to 48.4 years (p<0.0001) during April 2019.

METHODS: All positive blood cultures suitable for RAST from January to December 2019 were included and RAST results at 4 and 6 h compared with standard disc diffusion. The real-life impact of RAST on clinical decisions was assessed during same-day ID bedside consultation. RESULTS: The proportion of readable RAST results was significantly higher after 6 h of incubation compared with after 4 h (881/930 versus 642/847; P < 0.0001).

Efficient viral subtyping enables visualization and modeling of the geographic distribution and temporal dynamics of disease spread. Subtyping thereby advances the development of effective containment strategies and, potentially, therapeutic and vaccine strategies. However, identifying viral subtypes in real-time is challenging: SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus, and the pandemic is rapidly expanding. Viral subtypes may be difficult to detect due to rapid evolution; founder effects are more significant than selection pressure; and the clustering threshold for subtyping is not standardized. We propose to identify mutational signatures of available SARS-CoV-2 sequences using a population-based approach: an entropy measure followed by frequency analysis. These signatures, Informative Subtype Markers (ISMs), define a compact set of nucleotide sites that characterize the most variable (and thus most informative) positions in the viral genomes sequenced from different individuals. Through ISM compression, we find that certain distant nucleotide variants covary, including non-coding and ORF1ab sites covarying with the D614G spike protein mutation which has become increasingly prevalent as the pandemic has spread. ISMs are also useful for downstream analyses, such as spatiotemporal visualization of viral dynamics. By analyzing sequence data available in the GISAID database, we validate the utility of ISM-based subtyping by comparing spatiotemporal analyses using ISMs to epidemiological studies of viral transmission in Asia, Europe, and the United States. In addition, we show the relationship of ISMs to phylogenetic reconstructions of SARS-CoV-2 evolution, and therefore, ISMs can play an important complementary role to phylogenetic tree-based analysis, such as is done in the Nextstrain project. The developed pipeline dynamically generates ISMs for newly added SARS-CoV-2 sequences and updates the visualization of pandemic spatiotemporal dynamics, and is available on Github at https://github.com/EESI/ISM (Jupyter notebook), https://github.com/EESI/ncov_ism (command line tool) and via an interactive website at https://covid19-ism.coe.drexel.edu/.","output":"Genetic grouping of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus sequences using informative subtype markers for pandemic spread visualization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created significant challenges for healthcare systems across the world. The disease seems to infect men and women in equal numbers, though trends suggest that men have greater morbidity. This has been attributed to differences in immunological response, expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), prevalence of comorbidities, and health-related behaviours, such as smoking. However, this cannot be taken to mean that women are somehow protected. Advanced age, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have emerged as the leading contributors to increased morbidity and mortality from the disease. Women with diabetes form a vulnerable group as they often receive suboptimal diabetes care and support, even though they have a high burden of comorbidities and complications. While there are challenges in healthcare delivery during the pandemic, cardiometabolic care cannot be compromised, which calls for exploring new avenues of healthcare delivery, such as telemedicine. Pregnant women with diabetes should continue to receive quality care for optimal outcomes, and the psychological health of women also needs special consideration. The management of hyperglycaemia during COVID-19 infection is important to reduce morbidity and mortality from the infection.

There should be reflection on: (1) the definition of C and reasons for defining C the terminal stage and associated criteria for making such judgements; Korea and Taiwan limit forgoing LST to patients in this stage, but there are risks associated with defining this too narrowly or broadly; (2) foregoing LST for patients who are not in this stage, as is allowed in Japan and England, because here too there are areas of controversy, including (in England) whether the law in this area does enough to respect the autonomy of (now) incapacitated patients; (3) whether foregoing LST should encompass withholding and withdrawing treatment; this is also an ethically disputed area, particularly in the Asian countries we examine; (4) the familys role in end-of-life decision-making, particularly as, compared with England, the three Asian countries traditionally place a greater emphasis on families and communities than on individuals; and (5) decision-making with and for those incapacitated patients who lack families, surrogate decision-makers or ADs. CONCLUSION: Comparison of, and reflection on, the different legal positions that obtain in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and England should prove informative and we particularly invite reflection on five areas, in the hope the ensuing discussions will help to establish better end-of-life regulatory frameworks in these countries and elsewhere.","output":"Forgoing life-sustaining treatment C a comparative analysis of regulations in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) may spread through respiratory droplets released by infected individuals during coughing, sneezing, or speaking. Given the limited supply of professional respirators and face masks, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended home-made cloth face coverings for use by the general public. While there have been several studies on aerosol filtration performance of household fabrics, their effectiveness at blocking larger droplets has not been investigated. Here, we ascertained the performance of 11 common household fabrics at blocking large, high-velocity droplets, using a commercial medical mask as a benchmark. We also assessed the breathability (air permeability), texture, fiber composition, and water absorption properties of the fabrics. We found that most fabrics have substantial blocking efficiency (median values &gt;70%). In particular, two layers of highly permeable fabric, such as T-shirt cloth, blocks droplets with an efficiency (&gt;94%) similar to that of medical masks, while being approximately twice as breathable. The first layer allows about 17% of the droplet volume to transmit, but it significantly reduces their velocity. This allows the second layer to trap the transmitted droplets resulting in high blocking efficacy. Overall, our study suggests that cloth face coverings, especially with multiple layers, may help reduce droplet transmission of respiratory infections. Furthermore, face coverings made from materials such as cotton fabrics allow washing and reusing, and can help reduce the adverse environmental effects of widespread use of commercial disposable and non-biodegradable facemasks.","output":"Performance of fabrics for home-made masks against the spread of COVID-19 through droplets: A quantitative mechanistic study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Preventive practices are the mainstay to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic We tried to assess the self-reported adherence of our participants to the already known preventive practices Furthermore, we tried to determine whether the non- compliance to specific preventive practices was associated with the acquisition of the infection or not Methods We enrolled 379 healthcare workers, hospital staff, and their family members who were tested for COVID-19 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in an outpatient clinic Socio-demography and the infection prevention practices of the individuals were recorded in a preformed questionnaire Statistical analysis was performed to find out the statistical association between these factors and the RT-PCR results Adjusted and unadjusted odds ratios were determined to find out the degree of protection provided by each of the preventive practices concerning the development of the disease Results Social distancing (p&lt;0 001), hand hygiene (p&lt;0 001), ensuring N-95 mask fit check (p&lt;0 001), and the use of alternative medications (p=0 002) were found to be protective Resident doctors were at a lower risk of developing the disease as compared to the other healthcare workers (odds ratio: 0 39) Conclusion The failure to practice the already known preventive practices is probably one of the most important factors in the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic Adherence to these practices is the intervention of choice to reduce disease transmission in the current scenario","output":"Association Between Self-Reported Adherence to Preventive Practices and Probability of Turning COVID-19 Positive: A Cross-Sectional Analytical Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Hereditary polyneuropathies are heterogeneous group of diseases of the peripheral nervous system.

RESULTS In a total of 1484 nerve conduction studies, 207 patients were diagnosed with polyneuropathy. Ninety-nine of those patients were determined to have hereditary polyneuropathy, 52 of which were male and 47 were female. Sixty-nine patients with hereditary polyneuropathy were compatible with axonal and 30 were compatible with demyelinating polyneuropathy. Genetic analysis was performed in 69 patients, and 49 of those patients were genetically diagnosed, leading to a diagnosis rate of 71%. CONCLUSIONS Advances in genetics have led to an increase in the heterogeneity of hereditary polyneuropathies, causing difficulties in the use of existing classifications.

The performance and proper timing of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) with bariatric surgery remain a clinical question. Objective Evaluation of the outcome of LC during bariatric surgery whether done concomitantly or delayed according to the level of intraoperative difficulty. Methods The prospective study included patients with morbid obesity between December 2018 and December 2019 with preoperatively detected gallbladder stones. According to the level of difficulty, patients were allocated into 2 groups: group 1 included patients who underwent concomitant LC during bariatric surgery, and group 2 included patients who underwent delayed LC after 2 months. In group 1, patients were further divided into subgroups: LC either at the beginning (subgroup A) or after bariatric surgery (subgroup B).

We have developed an automated Cluster Picker which identifies monophyletic clades meeting user-input criteria for bootstrap support and maximum genetic distance within large phylogenetic trees. A second tool, the Cluster Matcher, automates the process of linking genetic data to epidemiological or clinical data, and matches clusters between runs of the Cluster Picker. RESULTS: We explore the effect of different bootstrap and genetic distance thresholds on clusters identified in a data set of publicly available HIV sequences, and compare these results to those of a previously published tool for cluster identification. To demonstrate their utility, we then use the Cluster Picker and Cluster Matcher together to investigate how clusters in the data set changed over time. We find that clusters containing sequences from more than one UK location at the first time point (multiple origin) were significantly more likely to grow than those representing only a single location.

Personal medical records are only partially unified by hospital or general practitioner informatics systems, but only for citizens with long-term permanent residence. Otherwise, insight into the medical history of patients greatly depends on their medical archive and memory. Additionally, occupational exposure records are not combined with clinical or general practitioner records. Environmental exposure starts preconceptionally and continues during pregnancy by transplacental exposure. Antenatal exposure is partially dependent on parental lifestyle, residence and occupation. Newborn screening (NBS) is currently being performed in developed countries and includes testing for rare genetic, hormone-related, and metabolic conditions. Transplacental exposure to substances such as endocrine disruptors, air pollutants and drugs may have life-long health consequences. However, despite the recognised impact of transplacental exposure on the increased risk of metabolic syndrome, neurobehavioral disorders as well as immunodisturbances including allergy and infertility, not a single test within NBS is geared toward detecting biomarkers of exposure (xenobiotics or their metabolites, nutrients) or effect such as oestradiol, testosterone and cytokines, known for being associated with various health risks and disturbed by transplacental xenobiotic exposures. The outcomes of ongoing exposome projects might be exploited to this purpose. Developing and using a OneHealth Medical Record (OneHealth(MR)) may allow the incorporated chip to harvest information from different sources, with high integration added value for health prevention and care: environmental exposures, occupational health records as well as diagnostics of chronic diseases, allergies and medication usages, from birth and throughout life.

Before the pandemic, the management of clerkships was starting to depend less on checkerboards. This study aims to explore undergraduates perceptions of doing rotations in teaching hospitals using different teaching styles and elicit their views regarding the options of managing practices to design a mobile app that substitutes for checkerboards. Methods: In this sequential exploratory mixed methods study, 38 semi-structured interviews at a teaching hospital were conducted. The data was used to survey 124 students doing their rotations in four teaching hospitals during the first wave of COVID-19. Results: 21 themes highlighted concerns related to the practices, the teacher involvement in the students education, and the students adaptation to clinical culture. The students reported positive perceptions concerning self-managing and organizing practices via a mobile application. However, problems emerged regarding transparency, the lack of feedback, and the need for new tools. Regarding the teaching styles, the facilitator and personal models were perceived as optimal, but the personal style had no effect on using or not using a tool. Conclusions: A mobile-learning application designed like an educational opportunities manager tool can probably promote self-directed learning, flexible teaching, and bidirectional assessments.

However, the detection of one gene at high Cycle threshold (Ct) has to be interpreted with caution. In this study we address this specific issue and report our real-life experience. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 1639 nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) were analyzed with Xpert? Xpress SARS-CoV-2. Positive samples showing high Ct values (Ct>35) were concentrated by centrifugation and re-tested with Cepheid or other methods (RealStar SARS-CoV2 RT-PCR, Altona Diagnostics; GeneFinder COVID-19 Plus RealAmp Kit, Elitech). RESULTS: 1599 (97.5%) negative samples, 36 (2.3%) positive samples and 4 (0.2%) presumptive positive samples were detected. In 17 out of 36 positive patients, very low viral RNA copies were suspected since positivity was detected at high Ct. We confirmed positivity for patients who showed both E and N genes detected and for patients with only N detected but with Ct <39. On the contrary, samples with only gene N detected with Ct values >39 were found negative. NPS taken 24 hours after the first collection confirmed the negativity of the 12 samples. Clinical data sustained these results since only 2 of these 12 patients showed COVID-19-like symptoms.

To avoid misinterpretation, we have excluded both unidentified respiratory infections (RI) and mixed RI. A total of 64 RC were included. Plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT) and proadrenomedullin (proADM) were measured at diagnosis and on day 3 and 7. Different cytokines were evaluated in serum on the first day. No HSCT recipients without RC were included as a control group. Compared with RI, non-infectious RC showed a significant increase in CRP, proADM and interleukin 6 on day 0 (P=0.005; P=0.03 and P=0.04, respectively). When only RI were considered, we observed that bacterialCfungal PI showed higher levels of CRP (P=0.02), PCT (P=0.04) and proADM (P<0.01).

We hypothesized that previous immunosuppression and the administration of high-dose steroids adversely affect IPF-AE outcome. METHODS: We studied all consecutive patients hospitalized in our department for IPF deterioration from 2007 to June 2013. Our protocol consisted of immediate cessation of immunosuppression (if any), best supportive care, broad-spectrum antimicrobials and thorough evaluation to detect reversible causes of deterioration. Patients were followed-up for survival; post-discharge none received immunosuppression. RESULTS: Twenty-four out of 85 admissions (28 %) fulfilled IPF-AE criteria. IPF-AE were analyzed both as unique events and as unique patients. As unique events 50 % survived; 3 out of 12 (25 %) in the group previously treated with immunosuppression whereas nine out of 12 (75 %) in the group not receiving immunosuppression (p = 0.041).

The documentation was carried out using European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) statistics. At the same time, we present the epidemic's evolution in Romania, using data provided by the Romanian National Institute of Public Health and Ministry of Health. European statistical data indicate a high number of patients diagnosed with measles both among children and adults. All European countries benefit from the measles vaccination in the form of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) trivaccine included in their National Vaccination Programme. The vaccination schedule varies from country to country. In the vaccination scheme, most European countries include two doses of the MMR vaccine among the pediatric population. Romania registered a limited number of cases of measles between 1980 and 2015 following the introduction of the measles vaccination in the National Vaccination Programme. Since 2005, the Romanian vaccination schedule includes two doses of MMR trivaccine, administered at 12 months and at 6-7 years. After 2015, as a result of a significant decrease in the number of vaccinated children, Romania is facing a major increase in the cases of measles. Consecutively, a measles epidemic was declared in 2016 and an additional dose of mandatory MMR trivaccine was introduced at the age of 9 months. After 4 years of this schedule of administration, starting with August 2020, the additional dose of MMR administered during infancy has been discontinued.

Methods: We recruited 74 patients with APE, who were assigned to CDT and PIT groups, according to the treatments received by them. The arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Pa CO2), pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), pulmonary artery obstruction index (PAOI), thrombus volume, pain score, and therapeutic benefits were compared between the two groups before and after treatment, and the factors affecting patient prognoses were also analyzed. Results: Using the clinical data before treatment as the baseline, it was found that changes in indicators of plasma, thrombus volume, and pain scores were significantly better in the CDT group than in the PIT group after treatment. The total effective rate of CDT was higher than that of PIT in the treatment of APE. The mean follow-up time for both the CDT and PIT groups was 41.08  9.12 months, and the total mortality rate was 14.8% and 31%, respectively. The logistic regression analysis revealed the significant impacts of previous incidences of pulmonary embolism (PE), concurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) on the occurrence and progression of APE, and these factors were subsequently identified as risk factors for APE using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Observations from PAE onset to the end of follow-up revealed that there was a difference in survival rates between the CDT and PIT groups. Conclusions: Taken together, CDT is an effective treatment strategy for APE and can provide effective symptomatic relief.

Results In total, 100 physicians participated in the study. Physicians responded that criteria used for referral for DR screening according to duration was <5 years (n = 0), 5-10 years (n = 60), >10 years (n = 10), and irrespective of the duration (n = 30). According to severity, well-controlled DM without (n = 30) and with other system involvement (n = 50) and uncontrolled DM without (20) and with other system involvement (n = 50) and irrespective of the severity of disease (n = 30) was reported. Physicians (n = 40) responded that patients who were diagnosed with DR belonged to the Type 1 DM category rather than Type 2 DM (P < 0.05). With regard to the barriers and challenges faced in ensuring DR screening, the following themes emerged: no ocular symptoms, lack of compliance, time constraint for the patient, and lack of motivation. Conclusion We found that the preferred practice pattern of physicians regarding referral for DR screening was dependent on the duration of the disease (mostly 5-10 years of the disease) and severity (when other systems were involved). Noncompliance with advice was the major barrier to DR screening.","output":"Preferred practice pattern of physicians regarding diabetic retinopathy in diabetes mellitus patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nowadays, in the aerospace industry, additive manufacturing and repairing damaged metallic components like Ti6Al4V samples have grabbed attention. Among repairing techniques, solid-state additive manufacturing processes like cold spray are promising because of their unique benefits such as high deposition rate with almost no oxidation in the deposited materials. However, its main drawback is the level of porosity of as-sprayed samples. To increase density and inter-particle bonding, deposited particles must go through more degrees of deformation by increasing particle velocity and particle temperature. In order to increase these two parameters simultaneously, high-velocity air fuel (HVAF) can be utilized. For understanding the effect of using HVAF on particle deformation, a proper elastic-plastic finite-element-based simulation is required. The obtained outcomes show that enhancing particle velocity and providing more kinetic energy will increase particle deformation and sample density. Importantly, increasing particle temperature will seize particle deformation by thermal softening effect, i.e., enhancing as-sprayed sample density, while rising substrate temperature by preheating will soften the substrate resulting in a decrease in particle deformation.","output":"Numerical Simulation of the Effect of Particle and Substrate Preheating on Porosity Level and Residual Stress of As-sprayed Ti6Al4V Components"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has disrupted millions of lives and commerce.

A total of 244 adults with MDs and 1116 controls matched for age, gender and sites were included. Worsened symptoms of anxiety, depressive and insomnia were defined when severity levels shifted to a more severe category compared to pre-COVID-19. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 outbreak, we found significantly increased prevalence of anxiety (MDs: 54.9% vs. 49.6%, controls: 25.5% vs. 14.3%), depression (MDs: 63.9% vs. 61.5%, controls: 29.9% vs. 21.2%) and insomnia (MDs: 66.0% vs. 57.8%, controls: 31.5% vs. 24.8%) compared to pre-COVID-19 period (all P-value < 0.001). Furthermore, adults with MDs had higher odds for developing COVID-19-related stress (OR = 3.41, 95% CI 2.49 ~ 4.67), worsened anxiety (OR = 1.95, 95% CI 1.38 ~ 2.76), depression (OR = 2.04, 95% CI 1.43 ~ 2.93) and insomnia (OR = 2.22, 95% CI 1.53 ~ 3.21) during the COVID-19 outbreak compared to controls. Moreover, higher COVID-19-related stress and lower levels of pre-COVID-19 anxiety, depressive and insomnia symptoms were predictors for worsened anxiety, depression and insomnia in adults with MDs, respectively.

Both coagulation methods achieved a5-log removal/inactivation of 6 in 20 min. Enhanced removal was attributed to the high hydrophobicity of 6 imparted by its characteristic phospholipid envelope. 6 adhesion to freshly precipitated iron (hydr)oxide also led to envelope damage causing inactivation in both coagulation techniques. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed oxidative damages to 6 lipids only for electrocoagulation consistent with electro-Fenton reactions. Monitoring 6 dsRNA by a novel reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) method quantified significantly lower viral removal/inactivation in water compared with the plaque assay demonstrating that relying solely on RT-qPCR assays may overstate human health risks arising from viruses. Transmission electron microscopy and computationally generated electron density maps of 6 showed severe morphological damages to virus' envelope and loss of capsid volume accompanying coagulation.

Protein precipitation as sample preparation, without the need of a time-consuming deglucuronidation step for the quantification of 1-hydroxymidazolam glucuronide, resulted in a simple and rapid assay suitable for clinical practice with a total runtime of only 1.1 min. The four components and the isotope-labeled internal standards were separated on a C18 column and detection was performed with a triple-stage quadrupole mass spectrometer operating in positive ionization mode. The method was validated based on the \\"Guidance for Industry Bioanalytical Method Validation\\" (Food and Drug Administration, FDA) and the \\"Guideline on bioanalytical method validation\\" of the European Medicines Agency (EMA).

Their interaction as well as the potential modulating effects of additional confounding factors is poorly known. Therefore, we aimed to identify and evaluate confounding factors affecting the prognostic value of obesity and hyperglycemia in relation to mortality and admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to COVID-19. METHODS: Consecutive patients admitted in two Hospitals from Italy (Bologna and Rome) and three from Spain (Barcelona and Girona) as well as subjects from Primary Health Care centers. Mortality from COVID-19 and risk for ICU admission were evaluated using logistic regression analyses and machine learning (ML) algorithms. RESULTS: As expected, among 3,065 consecutive patients, both obesity and hyperglycemia were independent predictors of ICU admission. A ML variable selection strategy confirmed these results and identified hyperglycemia, blood hemoglobin and serum bilirubin associated with increased mortality risk. In subjects with blood hemoglobin levels above the median, hyperglycemic and morbidly obese subjects had increased mortality risk than normoglycemic individuals or non-obese subjects. However, no differences were observed among individuals with hemoglobin levels below the median. This was particularly evident in men: those with severe hyperglycemia and hemoglobin concentrations above the median had 30 times increased mortality risk compared with men without hyperglycemia. Importantly, the protective effect of female sex was lost in subjects with increased hemoglobin levels.

Data were analyzed using Stata and SPSS. RESULTS: A total of 790 responses were included. The majority of participants were the Saudi population 735 (92.9%). The prevalence of insomnia and poor sleep quality were 54.4% and 55.5%, respectively. Saudi citizenship was associated with longer sleep duration (p=0.031). Female gender and being married were associated with worse global PSQI, sleep quality, sleep distribution, sleep latency, and daytime dysfunction. CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Saudi population had a high prevalence of insomnia and poor sleep quality. Routine monitoring of the psychological impact of life-threatening outbreaks and the adoption of effective early mental health actions should be considered.","output":"Sleep quality and insomnia during the COVID-19 lockdown among the Saudi public: A cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The entire world has been experiencing the outbreak of a novel infectious agent known as severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2), which is responsible for the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID\\\\19)(1).

Notwithstanding this success, there remains an opportunity for innovation in vaccine technology to address current limitations and meet the challenges of inevitable future pandemics. We describe a universal vaccine cell (UVC) rationally designed to mimic the natural physiologic immunity induced post viral infection of host cells. Induced pluripotent stem cells were CRISPR engineered to delete MHC-I expression and simultaneously overexpress a NK Ligand adjuvant to increase rapid cellular apoptosis which was hypothesized to enhance viral antigen presentation in the resulting immune microenvironment leading to a protective immune response. Cells were further engineered to express the parental variant WA1/2020 SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as a representative viral antigen prior to irradiation and cryopreservation. The cellular vaccine was then used to immunize non-human primates in a standard 2-dose, IM injected prime + boost vaccination with 1e8 cells per 1 ml dose resulting in robust neutralizing antibody responses (1e3 nAb titers) with decreasing levels at 6 months duration. Similar titers generated in this established NHP model have translated into protective human neutralizing antibody levels in SARS-Cov-2 vaccinated individuals. Animals vaccinated with WA1/2020 spike antigens were subsequently challenged with 1.0 x 105 TCID50 infectious Delta (B.1.617.2) SARS-CoV-2 in a heterologous challenge which resulted in an approximately 3-log order decrease in viral RNA load in the lungs. These heterologous viral challenge results reflect the ongoing real-world experience of original variant WA1/2020 spike antigen vaccinated populations exposed to rapidly emerging variants like Delta and now Omicron.

In this observational study, we describe the association between biochemical findings, age, gender and HFE genotype in patients referred from general practice to a tertiary care referral center for diagnostic workup based on suspected hemochromatosis due to persistent hyperferritinemia and HFE variants.

OBJECTIVE To determine whether pretreatment CVR can predict postoperative ischemic lesions after carotid artery stenting (CAS) by retrospective analysis. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 46 patients (42 men; mean age 74.28.3 years) who underwent CAS and preprocedural cerebral blood flow measurement by quantitative single-photon emission CT. Ischemic lesions were evaluated by diffusion-weighted image (DWI) within 72 h after the intervention. We also evaluated plaque characteristics using black-blood MR plaque imaging. RESULTS New ipsilateral DWI-positive lesions were found in 11 cases (23.9%). Patients were classified into two groups based on the presence or absence of new DWI-positive lesions, and no significant differences in characteristics were found between the DWI-positive and DWI-negative groups, except for age and CVR of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory. The DWI-positive group was significantly older than the DWI-negative group (79.74.1 vs 72.58.6 years; p=0.0085) and had lower average regional CVR (1.418.2% vs 22.425.8%; p=0.016). MR plaque imaging showed no significant difference in relative overall plaque MR signal intensity between the two groups (1.530.37 vs 1.340.26; p=0.113). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, lower CVR of the ipsilateral MCA territory (<11%) was the only independent risk factor for new ischemic lesions following CAS (OR=6.99; 95% CI 1.17 to 41.80; p=0.033).

We hypothesized that we would find a number of DENV-1 positive mosquito pools, and that the distribution of these arbovirus-positive mosquito pools would be associated with those neighborhoods for which imported DENV cases have been recently reported in 2019 and 2020. Methods We collected and screened Aedes aegypti, Ae. albopictus, Anopheles crucians, Culex coronator, Cx. nigripalpus, and Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes from Miami-Dade County (Florida) for DENV and WNV by rRT-qPCR. Spatial statistical analyses were performed to capture positive mosquito pool distribution in relation to land use, human demography, environmental variables, mosquito trap placement and reported human travel associated DENV cases to guide future mosquito control outbreak responses. Findings A rapid screen of 7,668 mosquitoes detected four DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2), nine DENV-4 and nine WNV-positive mosquito pools, which enabled swift and targeted abatement of trap sites by mosquito control. As expected, DENV-positive pools were in urban areas;however, we found WNV-positive mosquito pools in agricultural and recreational areas with no historical reports of WNV transmission. Interpretation These findings demonstrate the importance of proactive arbovirus surveillance in mosquito populations to prevent and control outbreaks, particularly when other illnesses (e.g., COVID-19), which present with similar symptoms, are circulating concurrently.

The unique characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 - its high reproductive number (R0), time-limited natural immunity and considerable potential for asymptomatic spread - exacerbate the public health repercussions of noncompliance with biomedical and nonpharmaceutical interventions designed to limit disease transmission. In this work, we used game theory to explore when noncompliance confers a perceived benefit to individuals, demonstrating that noncompliance is a Nash equilibrium under a broad set of conditions. We then used epidemiological modeling to explore the impact of noncompliance on short-term disease control, demonstrating that the presence of a noncompliant subpopulation prevents suppression of disease spread. Our modeling shows that the existence of a noncompliant population can also prevent any return to normalcy over the long run. For interventions that are highly effective at preventing disease spread, however, the consequences of noncompliance are borne disproportionately by noncompliant individuals. In sum, our work demonstrates the limits of free-market approaches to compliance with disease control measures during a pandemic. The act of noncompliance with disease intervention measures creates a negative externality, rendering COVID-19 disease control ineffective in the short term and making complete suppression impossible in the long term.

Microarray and Western blot analysis of murine norovirus 1 (MNV-1)-infected cells showed changes in cyclin transcript and protein levels indicative of a G1 phase arrest. Cell cycle analysis confirmed that MNV-1 infection caused a prolonging of the G1 phase and an accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase. The accumulation in G0/G1 phase was caused by a reduction in cell cycle progression through the G1/S restriction point, with MNV-1-infected cells released from a G1 arrest showing reduced cell cycle progression compared to mock-infected cells. MNV-1 replication was compared in populations of cells synchronized into specific cell cycle phases and in asynchronously growing cells. Cells actively progressing through the G1 phase had a 2-fold or higher increase in virus progeny and capsid protein expression over cells in other phases of the cell cycle or in unsynchronized populations. These findings suggest that MNV-1 infection leads to prolonging of the G1 phase and a reduction in S phase entry in host cells, establishing favorable conditions for viral protein production and viral replication. There is limited information on the interactions between noroviruses and the cell cycle, and this observation of increased replication in the G1 phase may be representative of other members of the Caliciviridae. IMPORTANCE Noroviruses have proven recalcitrant to growth in cell culture, limiting our understanding of the interaction between these viruses and the infected cell. In this study, we used the cell-culturable MNV-1 to show that infection of murine macrophages affects the G1/S cell cycle phase transition, leading to an arrest in cell cycle progression and an accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase. Furthermore, we show that MNV replication is enhanced in the G1 phase compared to other stages of the cell cycle. Manipulating the cell cycle or adapting to cell cycle responses of the host cell is a mechanism to enhance virus replication.

Because they often co-exist, it is difficult to assess if age is a risk factor on its own. Methods: We used administrative register data of the total Swedish population from 01/2015 until 07/2020. We stratified the population aged 70+ into three groups according to level of care (in care homes, with home care, and in independent living). Within these groups, we explored the level of excess mortality in 2020 by estimating expected mortality with Poisson regression and compared it to observed levels. We investigated if excess mortality has been of the same magnitude in the three groups, and if age constitutes a risk factor for death during the pandemic regardless of level of care. Findings: Individuals living in care homes experienced the highest excess mortality (75- &gt;100% in April, 25-50% in May, 0-25% in June, depending on age). Individuals with home care showed the second highest magnitude (30-60% in April, 15-40% in May, 0-25% in June), while individuals in independent living experienced excess primarily at the highest ages (5-50% in April, 5-50% in May, 0-25% in June). Although mortality rates increased, the age-pattern of mortality during the pandemic resembled the age-pattern observed in previous years. Interpretation: We found stepwise elevated excess mortality by level of care during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden, suggesting that level of frailty or comorbidities plays a more important role than age for COVID-19 associated deaths. Part of our findings are likely attributable to differences in exposure to the virus between individuals receiving formal care and those living independently, and not only different case fatality between the groups. Although age is a strong predictor for mortality, the relative effect of age on mortality was no different during the pandemic than before.

The study aimed to identify barriers and facilitators to implementing this strategy among Hong Kong Chinese medicine practitioners (CMPs). METHODS: Twenty-five CMPs aged under 45 years and trained in Hong Kong after reunification with China in 1997 were interviewed individually. Four clinical evidence synopses of randomized trials and systematic reviews on Chinese medicine interventions were presented, and CMPs were asked to comment on their applicability in routine practice. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) was applied to guide interview and analysis. RESULTS: The barriers included: i) CMPs perceived difficulties in applying complex evidence in decision-making and ii) inadequate training and limited consultation time. The facilitators were i) availability of publicly accessible and user-friendly synopses, ii) formation of community of evidence-based practice among CMPs with input from key opinion leaders, iii) opportunity for interprofessional collaborations with conventional healthcare providers, and iv) patients demand for evidence-based clinical advice. Besides, i) CMPs knowledge and beliefs in evidence-based healthcare approach, ii) presentations of evidence-based information in the synopses, and iii) clinical decision making as influenced by quality of evidence reported acted as both barriers and facilitators. CONCLUSIONS: This CFIR-based qualitative study investigated how the World Health Organization recommendation of promoting evidence use in routine practice was perceived by CMPs trained in Hong Kong after reunification with China in 1997. Key barriers and facilitators to applying evidence were identified. Such results will inform tailoring of implementation strategies for promoting evidence uptake, in the context of a well-developed health system dominated by conventional medicine.

However, adherence is improved when discharge instructions are provided in Spanish. This study was designed to assess the frequency of providing written discharge instructions in Spanish to patients who speak Spanish and request interpretation services, and to determine factors associated with receiving written discharge instructions in the preferred language in a pediatric emergency department (ED). METHODS This was a retrospective cross-sectional study of all discharges of Spanish-speaking patients who requested an interpreter in 1 year from a large urban pediatric ED and an associated community ED. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify patient and visit level characteristics associated with receiving written discharge instructions in Spanish. RESULTS Sixty-one percent of 11,545 patient encounters where a Spanish interpreter was requested received written discharge instructions in Spanish.

Used widely in qualitative studies, its uptake in quantitative research has been more recent. Objectives To characterize quantitative research applications of intersectionality from 1989 to mid-2020, to evaluate basic integration of theoretical frameworks, and to identify innovative methods that could be applied to health research. Methods Adhering to PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed articles indexed within Scopus, Medline, ProQuest Political Science and Public Administration, and PsycINFO. Original English-language quantitative or mixed-methods research or methods papers that explicitly applied intersectionality theoretical frameworks were included. Experimental studies on perception/stereotyping and measures development or validation studies were excluded. We extracted data related to publication, study design, quantitative methods, and application of intersectionality. Results 707 articles (671 applied studies, 25 methods-only papers, 11 methods plus application) met inclusion criteria. Articles were published in journals across a range of disciplines, most commonly psychology, sociology, and medical/life sciences; 40.8% studied a health-related outcome. Results supported concerns among intersectionality scholars that core theoretical tenets are often lost or misinterpreted in quantitative research; about one in four applied articles (26.9%) failed to define intersectionality, while one in six (17.5%) included intersectional position components not reflective of social power. Quantitative methods were simplistic (most often regression with interactions, cross-classified variables, or stratification) and were often misapplied or misinterpreted. Several novel methods were identified. Conclusions Intersectionality is frequently misunderstood when bridging theory into quantitative methodology. Further work is required to (1) ensure researchers understand key features that define quantitative intersectionality analyses, (2) improve reporting practices for intersectional analyses, and (3) develop and adapt quantitative methods.","output":"Intersectionality in quantitative research: A systematic review of its emergence and applications of theory and methods."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to impact the world, its mechanisms of action begin to unravel. The main entry pathway for SARS-CoV-2 into the cell is thought to be through binding to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2, but it seems another protein can induce its viral entry: neuropilin-1 receptor (NRP-1). NRP-1 is usually bound by vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), a - amongst other- pro-nociceptive factor. By binding to NRP-1, the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 blocks neuronal signaling, reducing the pro-nociceptive implication of VEGF-A. This analgesic role of SARS-CoV-2 gave rise to an increase in screenings for new compounds that could interfere with this pathway.

In recent years, it has become a pandemic outbreak in most peach production areas of China, especially on precocious peaches in the middle reach of the Yangtze River. Rapid, user-friendly detection is extremely important to make the correct diagnosis and develop suitable control strategies. In this study, we described a recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA)/Cas12a-based system that combines RPA and CRISPR/Cas12a for Xap identification. A total of three crRNAs were designed to target a highly conserved ABC transporter ATP-binding protein-encoding gene ftsX to make specific detection of Xap. Results showed that crRNA 2 and crRNA 3 could get consistent detection for Xap. To realize the visualization of detection results, we additionally introduced FQ-reporter and FB-reporter. The developed method was highly sensitive and could detect as low as 10(C18) M Xap gDNA with a mini-UV torch, corresponding to 1.63 copies/l or 8.855 fg/l gDNA of Xap, while with lateral flow strips, the sensitivity was 10(C17) M. In addition, this method could specifically detect Xap from other closely related bacteria or pathogens associated with peach diseases. Furthermore, this method could make correct identification for Xap with crude DNA using NaOH-based extraction (3 min) directly from diseased peach samples. Considering that the developed method could get results within 2 h and could be performed at 37C (body temperature), it is promising to be applied for Xap diagnosis and monitoring in fields.","output":"Recombinase Polymerase Amplification/Cas12a-Based Identification of Xanthomonas arboricola pv. pruni on Peach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is an acute infectious respiratory novel coronavirus disease The infection is caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and confirmed as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization To combat the pandemic, it is desired to develop an effective and safe vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 In silico methods for vaccine development could be the alternative methods to conventional methods which are complex and time-consuming In silico methods are effective, safe, and less time-consuming This in silico method includes reverse vaccinology, immunoinformatics, and structural vaccinology Recently, several vaccines have been developed by using bioinformatics tools, and they are under different phases of clinical trials We have enlisted different tools and software for the in silico designing and validation of vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 ?

A striking recent example is the COVID-19 pandemic which has created severe industry-specific disruptions to economic output in most countries.

We show that existing input-output models which allow for binding demand and supply constraints yield infeasible solutions when applied to pandemic shocks of three major European countries (Germany, Italy, Spain). We then introduce a mathematical optimization procedure which is able to determine best-case feasible market allocations, giving a lower bound on total shock propagation. We find that even in this best-case scenario network effects substantially amplify the initial shocks. To obtain more realistic model predictions, we study the propagation of shocks bottom-up by imposing different rationing rules on firms if they are not able to satisfy incoming demand. Our results show that overall economic impacts depend strongly on the emergence of input bottlenecks, making the rationing assumption a key variable in predicting adverse economic impacts.

Due to the very low ion currents, and thus, limited by the instrumentation of the 1960s, it took some time for the, by then, new technique to become adopted for analytical applications. In FI-MS, volatile or at least vaporizable samples mainly deliver molecular ions, and consequently, mass spectra showing no or at least minor numbers of fragment ion signals. The next major breakthrough was achieved by overcoming the need to evaporate the analyte prior to ionization. This was accomplished in the early 1970s by simply depositing the samples onto the field emitter and led to field desorption-mass spectrometry (FD-MS). With FD-MS, a desorption ionization method had become available that paved the road to the mass spectral analysis of larger molecules of low to high polarity and even of organic salts. In FD-MS, all of these analytes deliver spectra with no or at least few fragment ion peaks. The last milestone was the development of liquid injection field desorption/ionization (LIFDI) in the early 2000s that allows for sample deposition under the exclusion of atmospheric oxygen and water. In addition to sampling under inert conditions, LIFDI also enables more robust and quicker operation than classical FI-MS and FD-MS procedures. The development and applications of FI, FD, and LIFDI had mutual interference with the mass analyzers that were used in combination with these methods. Vice versa, the demand for using these techniques on other than magnetic sector instruments has effectuated their adaptation to different types of modern mass analyzers. The journey started with magnetic sector instruments, almost skipped quadrupole analyzers, encompassed Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) and orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight (oaTOF) analyzers, and finally arrived at Orbitraps. Even interfaces for continuous-flow LIFDI have been realized. Even though being niche techniques to some degree, one may be confident that FI, FD, and LIFDI have a promising future ahead of them.

Tubeless group included 55 patients with pulmonary nodules underwent tubeless uniportal thoracoscopic wedge resection, 211 patients underwent non-intubated uniportal thoracoscopic wedge resection with chest tube drainage were included in drainage group. Peri-operative outcomes between two groups were compared. RESULTS After 1:1 matching, 110 patients remained for analysis, baseline demographic and clinical variables were comparable between the two groups. Mean incision size was 3 cm in both group. Mean operative time was 59.3 min in tubeless group and 52.8 min in drainage group. The detectable mean lowest SpO2 and mean peak EtCO2 during operation was acceptable in both groups.

Therefore, the use of drugs or cocktails of drugs with broader ability to inhibit these cytokine receptors is likely to be effective.

Design: We applied a systems approach to the qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews on the cross-sector, organizational response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed transcribed interviews using conventional content analysis to synthesize key themes.

Main Outcome Measures: We defined the decision landscape as including decision-maker roles, key decisions, and inter-relationships involved in producing community health. Results: Decision-maker roles were characterized by underlying tensions between balancing organizational mission with employee/community health and navigating organizational versus individual responsibility for reducing transmission. Key Decisions fell into several broad categories, including how to translate public health guidance into practice; when to institute, and subsequently loosen, public health restrictions; and how to address downstream social and economic impacts of public health restrictions.

Tracking cases geographically and over time is key for understanding the spread of an infectious disease and how to effectively design interventions to contain and mitigate an epidemic. In this paper we describe the reporting systems on COVID-19 in Southeast Asia during the first wave in 2020, and highlight the impact of specific reporting methods. Methods We reviewed key epidemiological variables from various sources including a regionally comprehensive dataset, national trackers, dashboards, and case bulletins for 11 countries during the first wave of the epidemic in Southeast Asia. We recorded timelines of shifts in epidemiological reporting systems. We further described the differences in how epidemiological data are reported across countries and timepoints, and the accessibility of epidemiological data. Findings Our findings suggest that countries in Southeast Asia generally reported precise and detailed epidemiological data during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, changes in reporting were frequent and varied across data and countries. Changes in reporting rarely occurred for demographic data such as age and sex, while reporting shifts for geographic and temporal data were frequent. We also found that most countries provided COVID-19 individual-level data daily using HTML and PDF, necessitating scraping and extraction before data could be used in analyses. Interpretation Countries have different reporting systems and different capacities for maintaining consistent reporting of epidemiological data. As the pandemic progresses, governments may also change their priorities in data sharing. Our study thus highlights the importance of more nuanced analyses of epidemiological data of COVID-19 within and across countries because of the frequent shifts in reporting. Further, most countries provide data on a daily basis but not always in a readily usable format. As governments continue to respond to the impacts of COVID-19 on health and the economy, data sharing also needs to be prioritised given its foundational role in policymaking, and the implementation and evaluation of interventions.

Later stages are associated with diffuse alveolar damage and ongoing intravascular thrombosis in small to medium-sized pulmonary vessels, occasionally with areas of infarction equivalents, accompanied by laboratory features of disseminated intravascular coagulation. In late stages, organizing pneumonia with extensive intra-alveolar proliferation of fibroblasts and marked metaplasia of alveolar epithelium can be observed. Viral RNA is encountered in the lung, with virus particles in endothelial cells and pneumocytes. In many patients, multi-organ failure with severe liver damage sets in finally, possibly as consequence of an early-onset pro-inflammatory cytokine storm and/or thrombotic microangiopathy.","output":"The evolution of pulmonary pathology in fatal COVID-19 disease: an autopsy study with clinical correlation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biomass from perennial plants can be considered a carbon-neutral renewable resource. The tall wheatgrass hybrid Szarvasi-1 (Agropyron elongatum, hereafter referred to as \\"Szarvasi\\") belongs to the perennial Poaceae representing a species, which can grow on marginal soils and produce large amounts of biomass. Several conventional and advanced pretreatment methods have been developed to enhance the saccharification efficiency of plant biomass. Advanced pretreatment methods, such as microwave-assisted pretreatment methods are faster and use less energy compared to conventional pretreatment methods. In this study, we investigated the potential of Szarvasi biomass as a biorefinery feedstock. For this purpose, the lignocellulosic structure of Szarvasi biomass was investigated in detail. In addition, microwave-assisted pretreatments were applied to Szarvasi biomass using different reagents including weak acids and alkali. The produced pulp, hydrolysates, and extracted lignin were quantitatively characterized. In particular, the alkali pretreatment significantly enhanced the saccharification efficiency of the pulp 16-fold compared to untreated biomass of Szarvasi. The acid pretreatment directly converted 25% of the cellulose into glucose without the need of enzymatic digestion. In addition, based on lignin compositional and lignin linkage analysis a lignin chemical model structure present in Szarvasi biomass could be established.","output":"Microwave Assisted Pretreatment of Szarvasi (Agropyron elongatum) Biomass to Enhance Enzymatic Saccharification and Direct Glucose Production"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Otolaryngologists are at very high risk of COVID-19 infection while performing examination or surgery. Strict guidelines for these specialists have not already been provided, while currently available recommendations could presumably change in course of COVID-19 pandemic as the new data increases. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to synthesize evidence concerning otolaryngology during COVID-19 pandemic. It presents a review of currently existing guidelines and recommendations concerning otolaryngological procedures and surgeries during COVID-19 pandemic, and provides a collective summary of all crucial information for otolaryngologists. It summarizes data concerning COVID-19 transmission, diagnosis, and clinical presentation highlighting the information significant for otolaryngologists. METHODS: The Medline and Web of Science databases were searched without time limit using terms ''COVID-19\\", \\"SARS-CoV-2\\" in conjunction with \\"head and neck surgery\\", \\"otorhinolaryngological manifestations\\". RESULTS: Patients in stable condition should be consulted using telemedicine options. Only emergency consultations and procedures should be performed during COVID-19 pandemic. Mucosa-involving otolaryngologic procedures are considered high risk procedures and should be performed using enhanced PPE (N95 respirator and full face shield or powered air-purifying respirator, disposable gloves, surgical cap, gown, shoe covers). Urgent surgeries for which there is not enough time for SARS-CoV-2 screening are also considered high risk procedures. These operations should be performed in a negative pressure operating room with high-efficiency particulate air filtration. Less urgent cases should be tested for COVID-19 twice, 48 h preoperatively in 24 h interval.

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has a pivotal role in cell-entry and host immune response, thus regarded as potential drug- and vaccine-target. As the virus utilizes the S1 domain of spike to initiate cell-attachment and S2 domain for membrane fusion, several attempts have been made to design viral-receptor and viral-fusion blockers. Here, by deploying interactive structure-based design and pharmacophore-based approaches, we designed short and stable peptide-biologics i.e. CoV-spike-neutralizing peptides (CSNPs) including CSNP1, CSNP2, CSNP3, CSNP4. We could demonstrate in cell culture experiments that CSNP2 binds to S1 at submicromolar concentration and abrogates the S1-hACE2 interaction. CSNP3, a modified and downsized form of CSNP2, could neither interfere with the S1-hACE2 interaction nor bind to S1. CSNP4 exhibited dose-dependent binding to both S1 and hACE2 and abolished the S1-hACE2 interaction in vitro. CSNP4 possibly enhance the mAb-based S1 neutralization by limiting the spontaneous movement of spike receptor-binding domain (RBD), whereas CSNP2 allowed RBD-mAb binding without any steric hindrance. Taken together, we suggest that CSNP2 and CSNP4 are potent and stable candidate peptides that can neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 spike and possibly pose the virus to host immune surveillance.","output":"Pharmacophore-based peptide biologics neutralize SARS-CoV-2 S1 and deter S1-ACE2 interaction in vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mucosal vaccination against amoebiasis using the Gal-lectin of E. histolytica has been proposed as one of the leading strategies for controlling this human disease.

Monitoring of oxidative stress in this patient population is of great interest, and, ideally, this can be done noninvasively. Recently, propionaldehyde, a volatile chemical compound (VOC) released during LPO, was identified in the breath of lung transplant recipients as a marker of oxidative stress. The aim of the present study was to identify if markers of oxidative stress appear in the oxygenator outflow gas of patients with severe ARDS treated with veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Methods: The present study included patients with severe ARDS treated with veno-venous ECMO. Concentrations of acetone, isoprene, and propionaldehyde were measured in inspiratory air, exhaled breath, and oxygenator inflow and outflow gas at corresponding time points. Ion-molecule reaction mass spectrometry was used to measure VOCs in a sequential order within the first 24 h and on day three after ECMO initiation. Results: Nine patients (5 female, 4 male; age = 42.1  12.2 year) with ARDS and already established ECMO therapy (pre-ECMO PaO(2)/FiO(2) = 44.0  11.5 mmHg) were included into analysis. VOCs appeared in comparable amounts in breath and oxygenator outflow gas (acetone: 838 (422C7632) vs. 1114 (501C4916) ppbv; isoprene: 53.7 (19.5C244) vs. 48.7 (37.9C108) ppbv; propionaldehyde: 53.7 (32.1C82.2) vs. 42.9 (24.8C122) ppbv). Concentrations of acetone, isoprene, and propionaldehyde in breath and oxygenator outflow gas showed a parallel course with time. Conclusions: Acetone, isoprene, and propionaldehyde appear in breath and oxygenator outflow gas in comparable amounts.

Their increased transmissibility and higher viral load put them in the spotlight. Much has been investigated on the ability of those new variants to evade antibody recognition. However, little attention has been given to pre-existing and induced SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell responses by new lineages. In this work, we predicted SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell epitopes from the main variants of concern and their potential to trigger or hinder CD8+ T cell response by using HLA binding and TCR reactivity in silico predictions. Also, we estimated the population's coverage for different lineages, which accounts for the ability to present a set of peptides based on the most frequent HLA alleles of a given population. We considered binding predictions to 110 class I HLA alleles from 29 countries to investigate differences in the fraction of individuals expected to respond to a given epitope set from new and previous lineages. We observed a higher population coverage for the variant detected in the UK (B.1.1.7), and South Africa (B.1.351), as well as for the Brazilian P.1 lineage, but not P.2, compared to the reference lineage. Moreover, individual mutations such as Spike N501Y and Nucleocapsid D138Y were predicted to have an overall stronger affinity through HLA-I than the reference sequence while Spike E484K shows signs of evasion. In summary, we provided evidence for the existence of potentially immunogenic and conserved epitopes across new SARS-CoV-2 variants, but also mutant peptides exhibiting diminished or abolished HLA-I binding. It also highlights the augmented population coverage for three new lineages. Whether these changes imply more T cell reactivity or potential to evade from CD8+ T cell responses requires experimental verification.","output":"In silico analysis of mutant epitopes in new SARS-CoV-2 lineages suggest global enhanced CD8+ T cell reactivity and also signs of immune response escape"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter introduces four chemical warfare agents: bacillus anthracis (anthrax), yersinia pestis (plague), variola major (smallpox), and francesella tularensis (tularemia).

The insidious nature of anthrax has both vegetative and spore morphology. The vegetative state, being the growth phase, is typically responsive to most classes of antibiotics, while the spore phase is not. Plague is caused by a bacterium carried by a rodent flea. While current antibiotics are effective against plague, the worry is the possibility of a bioengineered chimeric construct that would be resistant to all classes of antibiotics. Tularemia is a zoonosis that occurs naturally in the United States, with animal transmission to man. Sometimes an insect vector may also be the primary route of infection. It is highly pathogenic and the inhalation of 10 organisms would be adequate for infection.

Given their increased susceptibility to COVID-19, the question arises whether individuals with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and other metabolic conditions can respond effectively to the mRNA-based vaccine. We aimed to evaluate the levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and neutralizing antibodies in people with T2DM and/or other metabolic risk factors (hypertension and obesity) compared to those without. This study included 262 people (81 diabetic and 181 non-diabetic persons) that took two doses of BNT162b2 (PfizerCBioNTech) mRNA vaccine. Both T2DM and non-diabetic individuals had a robust response to vaccination as demonstrated by their high antibody titers. However, both SARS-CoV-2 IgG and neutralizing antibodies titers were lower in people with T2DM. The mean (  1 standard deviation) levels were 154  49.1 vs. 138  59.4 BAU/ml for IgG and 87.1  11.6 vs. 79.7  19.5% for neutralizing antibodies in individuals without diabetes compared to those with T2DM, respectively.

This research assessed the knowledge of COVID?19 and practice of preventive measuresalong with its predictors among Nigerian residents during the ease of the lockdown. Methodology: A cross?sectional study was conducted among 1421 adult residents of Nigeria. Data were collected between 6th and 20th September, 2020, using a semi-structured online questionnaire adapted from previous studies. IBM SPSS version 26 was used for data analysis.

MethodsEfficacy was estimated in a matched case-control study that includes all diagnosed cases of COVID-19 in Scotland up to 19 August 2021. The main outcome measure was severe COVID-19, defined as cases with entry to critical care or fatal outcome. FindingsEfficacy of vaccination against severe COVID-19 decreased in May 2021 coinciding with the replacement of the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) by the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant in Scotland, but this decrease was reversed over the next month. In the most recent time window, the efficacy of two doses was 91% (95 percent CI 87% to 94%) for the AstraZeneca product and 92% (95 percent CI 88% to 95%) for mRNA (Pfizer or Moderna) products. Efficacy of the AstraZeneca product against severe COVID-19 declined with time since second dose to 69% (95 percent CI 52% to 80%) at 20 weeks from second dose. Efficacy of mRNA vaccines declined in the first ten weeks from second dose but more slowly thereafter to 93% (95 percent CI 88% to 96%) at 20 weeks from second dose. InterpretationThese results are reassuring with respect to concerns that efficacy against severe COVID-19 might have fallen since the Delta variant became predominant, or that efficacy of mRNA vaccines wanes with increasing time since second dose. However it is now clear that efficacy of the AstraZeneca vaccine against severe COVID-19 wanes substantially by 20 weeks from second dose, suggesting that delivery of booster doses should initially focus on those who received this type of vaccine.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSSeveral reports have suggested that efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines has fallen since the Delta variant became predominant, or that efficacy wanes with time since second dose. The starting point for this study was the evidence of waning efficacy cited by the CDC, the FDA and more recently the UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation in support of their recent recommendations for delivery of booster doses for the general population. Added value of this studyThis study shows that efficacy of both AstraZeneca and mRNA vaccines against severe COVID-19 (fatal or requiring critical care) remains high (around 90%) in the most recent time window, but that efficacy of the AstraZeneca vaccine wanes to about 70% by 20 weeks from second dose. In contrast efficacy of the mRNA vaccines wanes rapidly at first but stabilises at about 90% by 20 weeks from second dose. Implications of all the available evidenceThese results suggest that booster doses of vaccine are not needed for those who have received two doses of mRNA vaccine, except for vulnerable individuals who may require a third primary dose.","output":"Efficacy of vaccination against severe COVID-19 in relation to Delta variant and time since second dose: the REACT-SCOT case-control study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW This review aims to shed light on recent applications of artificial intelligence in urologic oncology.

We aimed to provide practical methods for COVID-19 risk reduction during breast cancer screening mammography (MMG) by examining an overview of potential contamination routes of aerosols and possible risks for patients and health care providers. METHODS: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted for airflow and aerosol dispersion in a 3D virtual model of a mobile MMG laboratory room. This model was constructed based on the actual mobile screening MMG bus 'Cosmos' in the Chiba Foundation for Health Promotion & Disease Prevention. Examiner and patient geometries were obtained by scanning an actual human using a 3D Scanner. Contamination of the room was evaluated by counting the numbers of suspended and deposited aerosols. RESULTS: We applied the CFD simulation model to the exhalation of small or large aerosols from a patient and examiner in the MMG laboratory. Only 14.5% and 54.5% of large and small aerosols, respectively, were discharged out of the room with two doors open. In contrast, the proportion of large and small aerosols discharged out of the room increased to 96.6% and 97.9%, respectively, with the addition of forced gentle wind by the blower fan. This simulation was verified by a mist aerosol experiment conducted in the mobile MMG laboratory. CONCLUSION: Adding forced ventilation to a MMG laboratory with two doors open may enable risk reduction dramatically. This could be applied to other clinical situations.","output":"Practical approach to prevent COVID-19 infection at breast cancer screening"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While prospect of tracking mobile devices' users is widely discussed all over European countries to counteract COVID-19 propagation, we propose a Bloom filter based construction providing users' location privacy and preventing mass surveillance.

Agar-well diffusion and broth microdilution methods assay were utilized to determine both the antimicrobial activity and minimum inhibitory concentration, of alcoholic extract of Commiphora molmol against E. faecalis and F. nucleatum. The values of the inhibition zones were determined based on the concentration of the investigated material. One hundred and forty extracted human premolar teeth were instrumented and immersed in bacterial suspension of E. faecalis or F. nucleatum (70 teeth in each species suspension). Prepared teeth were then immersed in the myrrh extract solution, 2.5% NaOCl, DMSO, or Cefotaxime and incubated for 30 and 60 minutes. Results The largest inhibition zone diameter for both bacterial species was obtained by the 100mg/100L concentration. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was 0.03mg/300L for both E. faecalis and F. nucleatum. The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) results showed that 0.03mg/L myrrh extract and 2.5% sodium hypochlorite significantly reduced bacterial growth at both 30 and 60 minutes of different treatments of root canals, compared to DMSO group (negative control) and the antibiotic group (positive group).

Here, we review the multiple functions exerted by the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery in driving membrane remodeling and fission, as well as in repairing physiological and pathological membrane damages. In this way, ESCRT machinery enables different fundamental cellular processes, such as cell cytokinesis, biogenesis of organelles and vesicles, maintenance of nuclear-cytoplasmic compartmentalization, endolysosomal activity. Furthermore, we discuss some examples of how viruses, as obligate intracellular parasites, have evolved to hijack the ESCRT machinery or part of it to execute/optimize their replication cycle/infection. A special emphasis is given to the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) interaction with the ESCRT proteins, considering the peculiarities of this interplay and the need for HSV-1 to cross both the nuclear-cytoplasmic and the cytoplasmic-extracellular environment compartmentalization to egress from infected cells.","output":"Why Cells and Viruses Cannot Survive without an ESCRT"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Urban gardening has become increasingly popular, creating green oases in cities;however, many of these activities are undertaken in areas of high traffic density or on ex-brown field sites.

However, the potentially conflicting priorities, understandings, and expectations of the stakeholders involved have not been sufficiently addressed. Regional (or local) authorities have a responsibility to promote prosperity for stakeholders in their administrative region, within the constraints of national policy; conversely companies can have financial imperatives associated with stakeholders who may be globally distributed. Evidence of these conflicting priorities, the various positions stakeholder take, and their expectations of each other can be seen in the language choices regional actors make in their public-facing policy and report documents. The aim of the paper is to consider the challenges for creating a regional-scale CE that might arise from the differing priorities and values of companies and public agencies relating to specific places. It uses discourse analysis (including critical approaches) to examine how policy and business documents represent the stakeholders of the CE, their place in it, their priorities, and, importantly, the relationship between CE actors, focusing on the case of North Humberside on the North East coast of England. The plans set out in these reports are designed for external stakeholders and allow us to gain an insight into company and policy thinking in relation to CE developments in the coming years, including how they view each others roles. Findings indicate a shared motivation across scales and sectors for the CE as a means towards sustainable growth within which business plays a central role. However, there is a critical double disjuncture between different visions for implementation. First, between policy scales, a regional-scale CE is prioritised by regional policymakers, who have an interest in economic advantage being tied to a specific place and call for national scale support for their actions. Second, between regional policymakers and business, companies focus on their own internal operations and potential supply chain collaborations, with little attention given to the regional scale. This can be seen in the way organisations represent the actors of a nascent CE differently. In addition, a hegemonic business-focused growth discourse excludes other visions of the CE; the public are relegated to a passive role primarily as consumers and recipients of under-specified opportunities of wealth creation. CE theorisations need to incorporate and address these critical perspectives in order to support the development of strategies to overcome them.","output":"Negotiating Stakeholder Relationships in a Regional Circular Economy: Discourse Analysis of Multi-scalar Policies and Company Statements from the North of England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The resilience of Agri-Food Supply Chain (AFSC) due to recent epidemics outbreak (COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2) has not been matching with, globalisation of AFSC, and complicated networking system of AFSC and thus poses huge global sustainable issues.

It describes regional variations and COVID-19 infection rate in patients undergoing foot and ankle surgery before, during and after the first national lock-down. PATIENTS & METHODS: This was a multicentre, retrospective, UK-based, national audit on foot and ankle patients who underwent surgery between 13th January and 31st July 2020. Data was examined pre- UK national lockdown, during lockdown (23rd March to 11th May 2020) and post-lockdown. All adult patients undergoing foot and ankle surgery in an operating theatre during the study period included from 43 participating centres in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Regional, demographic and COVID-19 related data were captured. RESULTS: 6644 patients were included. In total 0.53% of operated patients contracted COVID-19 (n = 35). The rate of COVID-19 infection was highest during lockdown (2.11%, n = 16) and lowest after lockdown (0.16%, n = 3). Overall mean activity during lockdown was 24.44% of pre-lockdown activity with decreases in trauma, diabetic and elective foot and ankle surgery; the change in elective surgery was most marked with only 1.73% activity during lock down and 10.72% activity post lockdown as compared to pre-lockdown. There was marked regional variation in numbers of cases performed, but the proportion of decrease in cases during and after lockdown was comparable between all regions. There was also a significant difference between rates of COVID-19 and timing of peak, cumulative COVID-19 infections between regions with the highest rate noted in South East England (3.21%). The overall national peak infection rate was 1.37%, occurring during the final week of lockdown. General anaesthetic remained the most common method of anaesthesia for foot and ankle surgery, although a significant increase in regional anaesthesia was witnessed in the lock-down and post-lockdown periods. CONCLUSIONS: National surgical activity reduced significantly for all cases across the country during lockdown with only a slow subsequent increase in elective activity.

METHODS: This was a retrospective study that included patients with COVID-19 receiving methylprednisolone pulse therapy (250 mg/day for 3 days) with subsequent tapering doses at our hospital between June 2020 and January 2021. We examined the differences in background clinical factors between the surviving group and the deceased group. RESULTS: Out of 156 patients who received steroid therapy, 17 received methylprednisolone pulse therapy. Ten patients recovered (surviving group) and seven patients died (deceased group). The median age of the surviving and deceased groups was 64.5 years (range, 57-85) and 79 years (73-90), respectively, with a significant difference (p=0.004). Five of the deceased patients (71%) had developed serious complications associated with the cause of death, including pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis, cytomegalovirus infection, and bacteremia. On the other hand, out of the 10 survivors, only one elderly person had cytomegalovirus infection and the rest recovered without complications.

A further problem, wich makes adoptability difficult, is that available foreign guidelines and algorithms are optimized for different legislation, and organisations, resources not available in our country. In this article, besides providing a summary of literature, we would also like to make practical recommendations which may increase the safety of healthcare providers participating in the treatment or pathological duties with COVID-19 suspected, probable and confirmed cases.

Therefore, studying the viral susceptibility of other organs is important for a deeper understanding of viral pathogenesis. Angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) is the receptor protein of SARS-CoV-2, and TMPRSS2 promotes virus proliferation and transmission. We investigated the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression levels of cell types from 31 organs to evaluate the risk of viral infection using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. For the first time, we found that the gall bladder and fallopian tube are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Besides, the nose, heart, small intestine, large intestine, esophagus, brain, testis, and kidney are also identified to be high-risk organs with high expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Moreover, the susceptible organs are grouped into three risk levels based on the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression. As a result, the respiratory system, digestive system, and urinary system are at the top-risk level for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We characterize the relative importance of different broad strategies by accounting for two fundamental sources of heterogeneity, i.e. geography and demography. First, we consider Italian regions as separate administrative entities, in which social interactions between age classs occur. Due to the sparsity of the inter-regional mobility matrix, once started the epidemics tend to develop independently across areas, justifying the adoption of solutions specific to individual regions or to clusters of regions. Second, we show that social contacts between age classes play a fundamental role and that measures which take into account the age structure of the population can provide a significant contribution to mitigate the rebound effects.

It has been found that (S)-valine-thiazole-derived compounds such as NEOS-223 are effective inhibitors of one or more of these kinases. NEOS 223 was developed, synthesized, and tested in the NCI 60 human tumor cell-screening panel demonstrating inhibition of colon (-53%), melanoma (-41%), and breast cancers (-9%). Microsomal clearance was determined in mouse, rat, dog, and human, and analyzed by LC-MS/MS by percent of parent material. IC50 values for CYP inhibition of >10 M were calculated for 1A2, 2C19, and 3A4 with IC50 values of 4.86, 4.31, and 7.84 M for 2C9 and 2D6. Microsomal clearance was high in all species with clearance rates ranging from 69-136 mL/min/kg. Plasma protein binding was determined by Rapid Equilibrium Dialysis in mice, rats, dogs, and humans. High plasma protein binding (>70%) was observed across all species. Based on the NCI results several cell lines were assayed in an MTT assay (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide) to determine cell viability in the presence of NEOS-223 resulting in <20% viability in colon, breast, melanoma, pancreatic and prostate human cancer cell lines at a 10 uM concentration. Maximum tolerated dose studies were conducted by both intraperitoneal and oral administration in mice. NEOS-223 delivered up to 80 mg/kg was well tolerated. Minimal or no toxicity was observed in acute and repeat dose animal studies. Pharmacokinetics of oral administration demonstrated adequate systemic exposure at therapeutic levels in mice, rats, and dogs. Preliminary in vivo mouse xenograft studies were performed on colon (COLO 205, HT-29 red FLUC), breast (MDA-Sumathi Chittamuru;Timothy M. Murphy;Sara A. Little;Andrew A. Taylor;Roseanne Wexler;Laxman Desai MB-468), melanoma (M-14), pancreatic (PANC-1), and prostate (PC3) human cancer cells with significant tumor inhibition observed compared to positive control agent groups with twice daily dosing of NEOS-223. In addition, a five-day pilot oral toxicity study in rats with dose range-finding studies and a 28-day repeat dose toxicity study performed in both rats and dogs provided favorable results. NEOS-223 has demonstrated active in vitro activity along with a favorable safety profile. in vivo efficacy resulted in inhibition of growth of multiple cell line.

The disease was later named as a novel Coronavirus disease or COVID-19. It was then declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. The virus originated in bats and was transmitted to humans through yet unknown intermediary animals in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in December 2019. As of February 5, 2021, 103 million laboratory-confirmed cases and nearly 2.3 million deaths have been reported globally. The number of death tolls continue to rise, and a large number of countries have been forced to implement social distancing and lockdown. As per literature, Coronavirus is transmitted human to human or human to animal via airborne droplets. Coronavirus enters the human cell through membrane ACE-2 exopeptidase receptor. WHO, ECDC, and ICMR advised to avoid public places and close contact with infected persons and pet animals. To date, there is no evidence of any effective treatment for COVID-19. The main therapies being used to treat the disease are antiviral drugs, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, and respiratory therapy. Although several therapies have been proposed, quarantine is the only intervention that appears to be effective in decreasing the contagion rate. We conducted a literature review of publicly available information to summarize knowledge about the pathogen and the current epidemic.

More specifically, what determines the transmission mechanism of tax shocks at the state level? How vital are states' fiscal structures, financial conditions, labor market rigidities, and industry mix? Do these economic and structural characteristics drive the transmission mechanism of the tax changes at the state level at different horizons? This study employs a panel factor-augmented vector autoregression (FAVAR) technique to answer these issues. The findings show that state economies respond homogeneously in terms of employment and price levels; however, they react heterogeneously in real GDP and personal income growth. In most states, these reactions are statistically significant, and the heterogeneity in the effects of tax cuts is significantly related to the state's fiscal structure, manufacturing and financial composition, and the labor market's rigidity. A cross-state regression analysis shows that states with higher tax elasticity, higher personal income tax, strict labor market regulation, and economic policy uncertainties are relatively less responsive to federal tax changes. In contrast, the magnitude of the response in real GDP, personal income, and employment to tax cuts is relatively higher in states with a larger share of finance, manufacturing, lower tax burdens, and flexible credit markets.","output":"Heterogeneous Responses to the U.S. Narrative Tax Changes: Evidence from the U.S. States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to clarify the effect of coronavirus disease (hereafter, COVID-19) control on patients health conditions and staffs working conditions in rural nursing homes.

Irradiation could decrease miR-541-5p expression in vitro and in vivo and inversely correlated to RIPF development. Ectopic miR-541-5p expression suppressed radiation-induced-EMT in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of Slug, the functional target of miR-541-5p, inhibited EMT induction by irradiation. The upregulation of transcription factor MZF1 upon irradiation inhibited the expression of endogenous miR-541-5p and its primary precursor (pri-miR-541-5p), which regulated the effect of the Slug on the EMT process. Our finding showed that ectopic miR-541-5p expression mitigated RIPF in mice by targeting Slug.

Treatment of hypotension in very low birthweight (VLBW) infants is common, and most often is based solely on the blood pressure measurement. Whether treatment improves cerebral oxygenation is unclear. OBJECTIVE To determine if treatment of hypotension in VLBW neonates results in an increase in cerebral oxygenation. PATIENTS AND METHODS In this single centre observational study, neonates <30 weeks and <1500 grams, blood pressure and regional cerebral oximetry (rCSO2) with near infrared spectroscopy were continuously monitored and digitally recorded. If patients were treated for hypotension during the first 3 days of life, effects of treatment on blood pressure and regional cerebral saturation were determined. RESULTS Twenty-eight of 50 patients were treated by the medical team for hypotension, of which 22 had accurate data recorded for analysis. Both normal saline 10 ml/kg, and dopamine 2.5-5 mcg/kg per min significantly increased blood pressure, (saline 26.83.5 to 28.84.2 mm Hg, p<0.005; dopamine 27.61.9 to 29.53.2 mm Hg, p<0.02). Pre-treatment values of rCSO2 were similar to published normative values and treatment with either normal saline or dopamine had no effect on rCSO2. CONCLUSION These results suggest that treating hypotension in VLBW neonates based solely on a blood pressure measurement of less than 30 mm Hg, while increasing blood pressure, may not increase cerebral oxygenation, possibly because many of these patients are in the autoregulatory zone for cerebral blood flow.","output":"Treatment of presumed hypotension in very low birthweight neonates: effects on regional cerebral oxygenation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Global genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 has identified variants associated with increased transmissibility, neutralization resistance and disease severity.

METHODS: Fifteen semistructured interviews with practicing primary care physicians and physicians-in-training from a Southern California academic health system and group-model health maintenance organization were conducted to assess physician perspectives regarding the benefits and challenges of telemedicine. RESULTS: Physicians indicated that telemedicine improved patient access to care by providing greater convenience, although some expressed concern that certain groups of vulnerable patients were unable to navigate or did not possess the technology required to participate in telemedicine visits. Physicians noted that telemedicine visits offered more time for patient counseling, opportunities for better medication reconciliations, and the ability to see and evaluate patient home environments and connect with patient families. Challenges existed when visits required a physical examination. Physicians were very concerned about the loss of personal connections and touch, which they believed diminished expected rituals that typically strengthen physician-patient relationships. Physicians also observed that careful consideration to physician workflows may be needed to avoid physician burnout. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians reported that telemedicine visits offer new opportunities to improve the quality of patient care but noted changes to their interactions with patients. Many of these changes are positive, but it remains to be seen whether others such as lack of physical examination and loss of physical presence and touch adversely influence provider-patient communication, patient willingness to disclose concerns that may affect their care, and, ultimately, patient health outcomes.","output":"A Qualitative Study of Primary Care Physicians' Experiences With Telemedicine During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic caused stress and anxiety in many people that can be reduced by regular physical activity Regular physical exercise is essential for health In the absence of COVID-19 symptoms, no limitation in physical activity is recommended However, parameters such as frequency, intensity, type, and time need to be considered to prescribe the program and obtain the best results Consequently, the level of physical activity that should be done during the outbreak has always been one of the most important and common questions","output":"How to Exercise During Coronavirus Quarantine?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During times of public crises (such as COVID-19), governments must act swiftly to release crisis information effectively and efficiently to the public.

Some possible reasons underlying VH were investigated as well. An overall hesitancy rate of 14.2% was registered. Data showed how older age, male gender, higher education level, and having been vaccinated for seasonal influenza in 2020C2021 were associated with a significantly higher propensity to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. On the contrary, having experienced adverse effects following past vaccinations was a negative predictor. In addition to confirming an array of predictors of VH, we found a worryingly high prevalence of VH among diabetics, who have been shown to be particularly exposed to severe COVID-19 and death. These findings may be useful in planning targeted action toward acceptance improvement and enhancing the efficacy of vaccination campaigns.","output":"Rate and Predictors of Hesitancy toward SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine among Type 2 Diabetic Patients: Results from an Italian Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. This study investigated the association between infection prevention behavior and socio-demographic and other lifestyle factors among the Lithuanian public and private university students. Material and methods. The cross-sectional survey took place from 15 January to 28 February 2021, and a total of 234 students responded to the survey. Survey questions included socio-demographic factors, compliance to hand hygiene, attitude towards vaccination, safe sexual behavior and risky sexual behavior, self-rated health, eating habits, physical activity, and compliance with COVID-19 preventative measures. Independent sample t-test, oneway ANOVA, correlation bivariate, and multiple regression tests were used to analyze the association between different factors. Results. Students with better health showed higher compliance to hand hygiene, but reported lower safe sex practices (p<0.05). Likewise, students with chronic disorders were more skeptical of vaccines (p<0.05). Students reporting healthy eating habits displayed a higher compliance to hand hygiene (p<0.05) and safe sex (p<0.05), while students who were more physically active showed lower confidence in vaccines (p<0.05). Conclusions. This study indicates that significant correlations exist between numerous variables related to socio-demographic and lifestyle factors with infection prevention behavior. Moreover, there is a need to increase the compliance of infection prevention behavior among youth. Hence, more health promotion programs should be implemented focusing on infection prevention behavior in young individuals.","output":"Association between Socio-demographic Factors, Healthy Lifestyle Factors, and Infection Prevention Behavior among University Students: a Cross-sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus challenges all of us in the many areas of life.

Variation in gonadal hormones impacts spatial memory and hippocampal attributes in vertebrates, although the direction of the effect has not been entirely consistent. To add complexity, individuals in the field must optimize fitness by coordinating activities with the appropriate environmental cues, and many of these behaviors are correlated tightly with seasonal variation in gonadal hormone release. As such, it remains unclear if the relationship among systemic gonadal hormones, spatial cognition, and the hippocampus also exhibits seasonal variation. This review presents an overview of the relationship among gonadal hormones, the hippocampus, and spatial cognition, and how the seasonal release of gonadal hormones correlates with seasonal variation in spatial cognition and hippocampal attributes. Additionally, this review presents other neuroendocrine mechanisms that may be involved in modulating the relationship among seasonality, gonadal hormone release, and the hippocampus and spatial cognition, including seasonal rhythms of steroid hormone binding globulins, neurosteroids, sex steroid hormone receptor expression, and hormone interactions. Here, endocrinology, ecology, and behavioral neuroscience are brought together to present an overview of the research demonstrating the mechanistic effects of systemic gonadal hormones on spatial cognition and the hippocampus, while, at a functional level, superimposing seasonal effects to examine ecologically-relevant circannual changes in gonadal hormones and spatial behaviors.","output":"Seasonal variation in gonadal hormones, spatial cognition, and hippocampal attributes: More questions than answers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECT Intracranial aneurysms, especially those of the cavernous segment of the internal carotid artery (ICA), can present with cranial nerve (CN) palsies. The Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) has demonstrated safety and efficacy in the treatment of cerebral aneurysms by flow diversion, but little data exist reporting the outcomes of cranial neuropathies following treatment with the device. METHODS The prospectively maintained Barrow Neurological Institute's endovascular database was reviewed for all patients treated with the PED after presenting with one or more CN palsies secondary to a cerebral aneurysm since May 2011. Patient charts and digital subtraction angiograms were reviewed to report clinical and angiographic outcomes. Only patients with clinical follow-up were included in the analysis. RESULTS A total of 127 patients were treated with the PED at the authors' institution after FDA approval. Twentytwo patients presented with cranial neuropathies, for initial inclusion in this study. Of these, 20 had sufficient followup for analysis. Cranial neuropathies included those of CN II, III, V, and VI, with presenting symptoms of diplopia, decreased visual acuity, and facial numbness and/or pain. Thirteen lesions were cavernous segment ICA aneurysms, whereas the remainder included supraclinoid and petrous segment ICA, posterior communicating artery, and basilar trunk aneurysms. At an average clinical follow-up of 9.55 months, 15 patients (75%) had resolution or significant improvement of their cranial neuropathies, and the remaining 5 had stable symptoms. Of the 18 patients with angiographic follow-up, 12 (66.7%) demonstrated complete obliteration or small neck residual, whereas 6 (33.3%) had residual lesion. Patients with complete or near-complete obliteration of their lesion were significantly more likely to demonstrate symptomatic improvement at follow-up (p = 0.009). Two patients with persistent symptoms were eventually treated with microsurgical bypass. Transient complications in this series included 6 (30%) extracranial hemorrhagic complications related to dual-antiplatelet therapy, all of which were managed medically. There was 1 delayed right ICA occlusion following retreatment that led to microsurgical bypass. CONCLUSIONS Intracranial aneurysms presenting with one or more CN palsies show a high rate of clinical improvement after treatment with the PED.

However, the success of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout is dependent on public acceptance and willingness to be vaccinated. In this study, we aim to examine how the attitude towards public sector officials and the government impact vaccine willingness. The secondary aim is to understand the impact of ethnicity on vaccine-willingness after we explicitly account for trust in public institutions. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used data from a UK population based longitudinal household survey (Understanding Society COVID-19 study, Understanding Society: the UK Household Longitudinal Study) between April 2020-January 2021. Data from 22,421 participants in Waves 6 and 7 of the study were included after excluding missing data. Demographic details in addition to previous survey responses relating to public sector/governmental trust were included as covariates in the main analysis. A logit model was produced to describe the association between public sector/governmental mistrust and the willingness for vaccination with interaction terms included to account for ethnicity/socio-economic status. RESULTS: In support of existing literature, we identified those from BAME groups were more likely to be unwilling to take the COVID-19 vaccine. We found that positive opinions towards public sector officials (OR 2.680: 95% CI 1.888 C 3.805) and the UK government (OR 3.400; 95% CI 2.4544.712) led to substantive increase in vaccine willingness. Most notably we identified this effect to vary across ethnicity and socio-economic status with those from South Asian background (OR 4.513; 95% CI 1.01220.123) and possessing a negative attitude towards public officials and the government being the most unwilling to be vaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggests that trust in public sector officials play a key factor in the low vaccination rates particularly seen in at-risk groups. Given the additional morbidity/mortality risk posed by COVID-19 to those from lower socio-economic or ethnic minority backgrounds, there needs to be urgent public health action to review how to tailor health promotion advice given to these groups and examine methods to improve trust in public sector officials and the government.","output":"COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in the UK: a longitudinal household cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The early and reliable detection of COVID-19 infected patients is essential to prevent and limit its outbreak. The PCR tests for COVID-19 detection are not available in many countries and also there are genuine concerns about their reliability and performance. Motivated by these shortcomings, this paper proposes a deep uncertainty-aware transfer learning framework for COVID-19 detection using medical images. Four popular convolutional neural networks (CNNs) including VGG16, ResNet50, DenseNet121, and InceptionResNetV2 are first applied to extract deep features from chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) images. Extracted features are then processed by different machine learning and statistical modelling techniques to identify COVID-19 cases. We also calculate and report the epistemic uncertainty of classification results to identify regions where the trained models are not confident about their decisions (out of distribution problem). Comprehensive simulation results for X-ray and CT image datasets indicate that linear support vector machine and neural network models achieve the best results as measured by accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC. Also it is found that predictive uncertainty estimates are much higher for CT images compared to X-ray images.","output":"An Uncertainty-aware Transfer Learning-based Framework for Covid-19 Diagnosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV2 virus, which causes COVID-19 (coronavirus disease) has become a pandemic and has expanded all over the world.

Due to such limitations, the need for clinical decisions making system with predictive algorithms has arisen. Predictive algorithms could potentially ease the strain on healthcare systems by identifying the diseases. In this study, we perform clinical predictive models that estimate, using deep learning and laboratory data, which patients are likely to receive a COVID-19 disease. To evaluate the predictive performance of our models, precision, F1-score, recall, AUC, and accuracy scores calculated. Models were tested with 18 laboratory findings from 600 patients and validated with 10 fold cross-validation and train-test split approaches. The experimental results indicate that our predictive models identify patients that have COVID-19 disease at an accuracy of 86.66%, F1-score of 91.89%, precision of 86.75%, recall of 99.42%, and AUC of 62.50%.

Evidence suggests that the risk of CVDs differs by race/ethnicity. Scarce information exists about the association between CVD risk, obesity indicators and sociodemographic characteristics in the Brazilian population. Objectives: We aimed to assess the CVD risk following the Framingham risk score in relation to the population's sociodemographic profile. Further, we examined the association between anthropometric markers and risk of CVDs. Methods: A total of 701 subjects aged 20 years from North-eastern Brazil were recruited randomly to participate in a population-based, cross-sectional survey. Age-adjusted data for CVD risk, sociodemographic characteristics, and anthropometric indices were assessed, and their relationships examined. Results: High CVD risk (Framingham risk score 10%) was observed in 18.9% of the population. Males (31.9 vs. 12.5%) and older subjects (age 45 years: 68.9% vs. age <45 years: 4.2%) had significantly higher risk of CVDs, whereas those employed in manual labor showed lower risk (7.6 vs. 21.7%). Central obesity measures like waist-to-hip ratio and waist-to-height ratio were more strongly associated with predicted CVD risk than body mass index. Conclusions: Our population had a high risk of CVDs using the Framingham risk score.

METHODS: To address this question, data from charts of 123 patients who have died after allogeneic stem cell transplantation were extracted. In detail, the time line of the clinical course, the symptoms, the administered drugs and other applied procedures were analysed. RESULTS: Approximately one half of the patients, who have died after stem cell transplantation, did not live more than 5 months. Two-thirds of patients died within 14 months after SCT. 28.5% of the patients could not be discharged after transplantation. However, a significant proportion had a low ECOG-score (0C1) prior to death, indicating a high degree of mobility. Major symptoms were weakness, fatigue and need for aid at daily activities. Severe pain, dyspnoea and obstipation, as known from patients suffering from advanced solid tumours, were rare. In consequence, use of opioids seemed to be less frequent than in patients with solid tumours. Measures of intensive care and i.v.-drug administration were applied to a significant proportion of patients. CONCLUSION: The present investigation indicates that the somatic, psychic and spiritual end-of-life-care after allogeneic stem cell transplantation could be optimised.

The concentrations of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies (IgM and IgG) were detected by a chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA). RESULTS: According to the cutoff value recommended by the manufacturer (cutoff = 10 AU/mL), the sensitivity, specificity, Youden index (YI), positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of IgM were 60%, 100%, 60%, 100%, and 89.29%, respectively; and 86.67%, 100%, 86.67%, 100%, and 96.15%, respectively, for IgG.

This article describes literature methods, experimental analysis methods, and other methods, in-depth study of the causes of traumatic anterior injuries, ultrasound biomicroscopy, and other theoretical knowledge, ultrasound biomicroscopy and microcontrol experiments for traumatic anterior injury design, and finally the causes of eye damage. This study compares the pairing results of ultrasound biomicroscopy biological measurements, analyzes the relationship between anterior bleeding level and anterior ocular injury, and analyzes the outcome and extent of service ophthalmology. The angle retreat accounted for 52.17% in grade I, 72.22% in grade II, and 60% in grade III. Anterior bleeding can cause single or complex iris root detachment, iris root detachment, ciliary body detachment, and angular leakage. The more the bleeding, the more serious the eye damage.","output":"Ultrasound Biomicroscopy Diagnosis Analysis and Fine Care of Anterior Segment Injury of Traumatic Anterior Chamber Based on Intelligent Virtual Reality Technology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"O Informe Dirio de Evidncias  uma produo do Ministrio da Sade que tem como objetivo acompanhar diariamente as publicaes cientficas sobre tratamento farmacolgico e vacinas para a COVID-19 Dessa forma, s?o realizadas buscas estruturadas em bases de dados biomdicas, referente ao dia anterior desse informe N?o s?o includos estudos pr-clnicos (in vitro, in vivo, in silico) A frequncia dos estudos  demonstrada de acordo com a sua classificao metodolgica (revis?es sistemticas, ensaios clnicos randomizados, coortes, entre outros) Para cada estudo  apresentado um resumo com avaliao da qualidade metodolgica Essa avaliao tem por finalidade identificar o grau de certeza/confian?a ou o risco de vis de cada estudo Para tal, s?o utilizadas ferramentas j validadas e consagradas na literatura cientfica, na rea de sade baseada em evidncias Cabe ressaltar que o documento tem carter informativo e n?o representa uma recomendao oficial do Ministrio da Sade sobre a temtica Foram encontrados 17 artigos","output":"Informe dirio de evidncias COVID-19: busca referente aos dias 4, 5 e 6 de julho de 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2019, young Australians reported that two of their top concerns were climate change and the environment and mental health. The events of 2020/2021, such as the ongoing climate emergency, the Australian bushfires, and the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, reflect the human\\\\induced environmental issues young people are most worried about and have also exacerbated the mental health issues which they already reported to be at a crisis point back in 2019. Given experiences of mental illness in adolescence are associated with poorer mental health across the lifespan, it is becoming increasingly important to address ecological determinants of youth mental health in the Anthropocene. However, despite the inclusion of ecological determinants of health in seminal health promotion frameworks, health promotion has been described as ecologically blind, emphasising social determinants of health at the expense of ecological determinants of health. A socio\\\\ecological model, which equally considers upstream social and ecological factors, should be applied to youth mental health issues. Using the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion, we demonstrate how the ecological determinants of health may be incorporated into health promotion approaches targeting youth mental health. We also call for the health promotion sector to consider a number of actions to work towards achieving a transition to ecological determinants of health being at the forefront of health promotion activities. This commentary, written by young public health professionals, hopes to build on the momentum garnered by youth activists around the world and bring attention to the importance of ecological determinants of health for youth mental health promotion in the era of COVID\\\\19 and the Anthropocene.","output":"Considering ecological determinants of youth mental health in the era of COVID\\\\19 and the Anthropocene: A call to action from young public health professionals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in China in December 2019, the epidemic has continued to spread globally. Despite continuous reports of clinical trials being launched, no studies have yet systematically summarized and analysed their characteristics. Our objective is to do this by reviewing trials registered at ClinicalTrials.gov. METHODS We searched the ClinicalTrials.gov database and retrieved all clinical trials on COVID-19 registered up to and including 3 April 2020. We summarized the characteristics of the trials, presenting the results of all trials, all intervention trials and drug intervention (including vaccines and traditional Chinese medicine) trials. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION We identified 306 COVID-19-related clinical trials. Seven of the studies had been withdrawn, leaving 299 active trials. Of the trials, 28.8% were planned to be conducted in Asia, 26.8% in Europe and 18.7% in North America. Most (73.0%) proposed trials expected to recruit fewer than 500 people, and only 22.1% of the studies included children (aged <18 years). About two-thirds (67.2%) of the studies were funded by the own resources of medical or research institutions. Of intervention trials, 73.9% used random allocation, and 73.4% used parallel assignment. Only 36.7% of the intervention trials used blinding. In terms of drug trials, 147 trials were drug intervention studies, covering 80 conventional drugs and seven traditional Chinese medicine drugs. Antiviral drugs and antimalarial drugs were the most commonly studied drugs with 52 and 45 trials registered, respectively. Five registered clinical trials were on vaccines. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION A large number of COVID-19-related trials have been registered within the first 4 months since the first infection was reported. These involve a large number of different drugs, the most common being antiviral drugs and antimalarial drugs. More attention should be paid to adequate blinding in future trials.","output":"Characteristics of Clinical Trials relating to COVID-19 registered at ClinicalTrials.gov."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The CT manifestation of COVID-19 patients is now well known and essentially reflects pathological changes in the lungs. Actually, there is insufficient knowledge on the long-term outcomes of this new disease, and several chest CTs might be necessary to evaluate the outcomes. The aim of this study is to evaluate the radiation dose for chest CT scans in COVID-19 patients compared to a cohort with pulmonary infectious diseases at the same time of the previous year to value if there is any modification of exposure dose. The analysis of our data shows an increase in the overall mean dose in COVID-19 patients compared with non-COVID-19 patients. In our results, the higher dose increase occurs in the younger age groups (+86% range 21C30 years and +67% range 31C40 years). Our results show that COVID-19 patients are exposed to a significantly higher dose of ionizing radiation than other patients without COVID infectious lung disease, and especially in younger age groups, although some authors have proposed the use of radiotherapy in these patients, which is yet to be validated.

In connection with the ordinance of the Minister of Health of 13 March 2020 (Journal of Laws of 2020, item 433), announcing the state of epidemic threat in the territory of the Republic of Poland, common units of the prosecutor's office faced a new challenge regarding quick and effective response to crimes arising in connection with the use of the state of emergency for unlawful purpose. Certainly, for people who act against the law this is a typical opportunity, a situation that can be used to generate spectacular profits. On the other hand, for law-enforcing organizations the state of epidemic threat is, if not a crisis, certainly an emergency situation. Apart from the specific dichotomy that emerged as part of the analysis carried out for this article (the relationship between opportunity and crisis), it is worth presenting the actions taken in the public entity during the crisis caused by COVID-19. What is the purpose of this study? The study analyses the actions taken by the Polish Public Prosecutor's office in reaction to the crisis which aim to minimize the spread of not only the virus, but also criminal activity in Poland. The study consists of 4 parts. The first part is theoretical and describes the issues from management and quality sciences related both to crisis and emergency situation. The second part describes strategic and operational actions taken by organizations in crisis environment.

The information will assist policy makers in reaching correct decisions and the public in adopting appropriate behaviors. As the available data suffer from sample selection bias, I use partial identification to derive the above quantities. Partial identification combines assumptions with the data to deliver a set of admissible values or bounds. Stronger assumptions yield stronger conclusions but decrease the credibility of the inference. Therefore, I start with assumptions that are always satisfied, then I impose increasingly more restrictive assumptions. Using my preferred bounds, during March 2020 in Lombardia, there were between 10,000 and 18,500 more deaths than in previous years. The narrowest bounds of mortality rates from COVID-19 are between 0.1 and 7.5%, much smaller than the 17.5% discussed in earlier reports. This finding suggests that the case of Lombardia may not be as special as some argue.","output":"True COVID-19 mortality rates from administrative data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the current pandemic context, it is necessary to remember the lessons learned from previous outbreaks in Africa, where the incidence of other diseases could rise if most resources are directed to tackle the emergency. Improving the access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) could be a win-win strategy, because the lack of these services not only hampers the implementation of preventive measures against SARS-CoV-2 (e.g. proper handwashing), but it is also connected to high mortality diseases (for example, diarrhoea and lower respiratory infections (LRI)). This study aims to build on the evidence-based link between other LRI and WASH as a proxy for exploring the potential vulnerability of African countries to COVID-19, as well as the role of other socioeconomic variables such as financial sources or demographic factors. The selected methodology combines several machine learning techniques to single out the most representative variables for the analysis, classify the countries according to their capacity to tackle public health emergencies and identify behavioural patterns for each group. Besides, conditional dependences between variables are inferred through a Bayesian network. Results show a strong relationship between low access to WASH services and high LRI mortality rates, and that migrant remittances could significantly improve the access to healthcare and WASH services. However, the role of Official Development Assistance (ODA) in enhancing WASH facilities in the most vulnerable countries cannot be disregarded, but it is unevenly distributed: for each 50C100 US$ of ODA per capita, the probability of directing more than 3 US$ to WASH ranges between 48% (Western Africa) and 8% (Central Africa).","output":"COVID-19 pandemic in Africa: Is it time for water, sanitation and hygiene to climb up the ladder of global priorities?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To investigate the impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from APOA5, APOC3, CETP, ATP binding cassette transporter A1 and SIK3 genes in the development of hypertriglyceridemia in HIV patients under antiretroviral therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS A case-control study was developed. Leukocytic genomic DNA was extracted and genotyping for SNPs rs662799, rs964184, rs5128, rs2854116, rs2854117, rs3764261, rs4149310, rs4149267 and rs139961185 was performed by real time-PCR using TaqMan allelic discrimination assays, in Mexican mestizo patients with HIV infection, with hypertriglyceridemia (>1.7 mmol/L) under antiretroviral therapy. Genetic variants were also investigated in a control group of normolipidemic HIV patients ( 1.7 mmol/L). Haplotypes and gene interactions were analyzed. RESULTS A total of 602 HIV patients were genotyped (316 cases and 286 controls). Age and antiretroviral regimen based on protease inhibitors were associated with hypertriglyceridemia (P = 0.0001 and P = 0.0002. respectively). SNP rs964184 GG genotype in APOA5 gene exhibited the highest association with hypertriglyceridemia risk (OR, 3.2, 95% CI, 1.7-5.8, P = 0.0001); followed by SNP rs139961185 in SIK3 gene (OR = 2.3; (95% CI, 1.1-4.8; P = 0.03 for AA vs. AG genotype; and APOC3 rs5128 GG genotype, (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1-4.9; P = 0.04) under codominant models. These associations were maintained in the adjusted analysis by age and protease inhibitors based antiretroviral regimens. CONCLUSIONS This study reveals an association between rs964184 in APOA5; rs5128 in APOC3 and rs139961185 in SIK3 and high triglyceride concentrations in Mexican HIV-patients receiving protease inhibitors.

However, little is known on the impact of undiagnosed diabetes in the COVID-19 population. We investigated whether diabetes, particularly undiagnosed diabetes, was associated with an increased risk of death from COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective study identified adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to Tongji Hospital (Wuhan) from January 28 to April 4, 2020. Diabetes was determined using patients past history (diagnosed) or was newly defined if the hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level at admission was 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) (undiagnosed). The in-hospital mortality rate and survival probability were compared between the non-diabetes and diabetes (overall, diagnosed, and undiagnosed diabetes) groups. Risk factors of mortality were explored using Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: Of 373 patients, 233 were included in the final analysis, among whom 80 (34.3%) had diabetes: 44 (55.0%) reported a diabetes history, and 36 (45.0%) were newly defined as having undiagnosed diabetes by HbA1c testing at admission. Compared with the non-diabetes group, the overall diabetes group had a significantly increased mortality rate (22.5% vs. 5.9%, p < 0.001). Moreover, the overall, diagnosed, and undiagnosed diabetes groups displayed lower survival probability in the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (all p < 0.01). Using multivariate Cox regression, diabetes, age, quick sequential organ failure assessment score, and D-dimer 1.0 g/mL were identified as independent risk factors for in-hospital death in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of undiagnosed pre-existing diabetes among patients with COVID-19 is high in China. Diabetes, even newly defined by HbA1c testing at admission, is associated with increased mortality in patients with COVID-19. Screening for undiagnosed diabetes by HbA1c measurement should be considered in adult Chinese inpatients with COVID-19.

NFAT5 has three intrinsically ordered (ID) activation domains (ADs). Using the NFAT5 N-terminal domain (NTD), which contains AD1, as a model, we demonstrate by biophysical methods that the NTD senses osmolytes and hypertonicity, resulting in stabilization of its ID regions. In the presence of sufficient NaCl or osmolytes, trehalose and sorbitol, the NFAT5 NTD undergoes a disorder-to-order shift, adopting higher average secondary and tertiary structure. Thus, NFAT5 is activated by the stress that it protects against. In its salt and/or osmolyte-induced more ordered conformation, the NTD interacts with several proteins, including HMGI-C, which is known to protect against apoptosis. These findings raise the possibility that the increased intracellular ionic strength and elevated osmolytes caused by hypertonicity activate and stabilize NFAT5.","output":"NFAT5, which protects against hypertonicity, is activated by that stress via structuring of its intrinsically disordered domain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Living with a chronic mental condition such as schizophrenia impacts significantly on the individuals social functioning and activities of daily living.

In addition, plasma samples were analyzed for IgM and IgG antibodies and the ability of these antibodies to neutralise SARS-CoV-2. Despite several risk factors for an impaired immune response to SARS-CoV-2, both T- and B-cell responses were observed. Moreover, after treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors, a sufficient cellular and humoral immune response was achieved in this SARS-CoV-2 infected patient.

In addition to its everyday applications, ML holds the potential to improve medicine as well, especially with regard to diagnostics in clinics. In a world characterized by population growth, demographic change, and the global COVID-19 pandemic, ML systems offer the opportunity to make diagnostics more effective and efficient, leading to a high interest of clinics in such systems. However, despite the high potential of ML, only a few ML systems have been deployed in clinics yet, as their adoption process differs significantly from the integration of prior health information technologies given the specific characteristics of ML. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the factors that influence the adoption process of ML systems for medical diagnostics in clinics to foster the adoption of these systems in clinics. Furthermore, this study provides insight into how these factors can be used to determine the ML maturity score of clinics, which can be applied by practitioners to measure the clinic status quo in the adoption process of ML systems. METHODS: To gain more insight into the adoption process of ML systems for medical diagnostics in clinics, we conducted a qualitative study by interviewing 22 selected medical experts from clinics and their suppliers with profound knowledge in the field of ML. We used a semistructured interview guideline, asked open-ended questions, and transcribed the interviews verbatim. To analyze the transcripts, we first used a content analysis approach based on the health careCspecific framework of nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, and sustainability. Then, we drew on the results of the content analysis to create a maturity model for ML adoption in clinics according to an established development process. RESULTS: With the help of the interviews, we were able to identify 13 ML-specific factors that influence the adoption process of ML systems in clinics. We categorized these factors according to 7 domains that form a holistic ML adoption framework for clinics. In addition, we created an applicable maturity model that could help practitioners assess their current state in the ML adoption process. CONCLUSIONS: Many clinics still face major problems in adopting ML systems for medical diagnostics; thus, they do not benefit from the potential of these systems. Therefore, both the ML adoption framework and the maturity model for ML systems in clinics can not only guide future research that seeks to explore the promises and challenges associated with ML systems in a medical setting but also be a practical reference point for clinicians.","output":"Adoption of Machine Learning Systems for Medical Diagnostics in Clinics: Qualitative Interview Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: The purpose of this study was to investigate the predictive value of combined clinical and imaging features, compared with the clinical or radiological risk factors only.

There is increasing interest in developing complement regulatory and inhibitory agents to treat complement dysfunction. In this study, we describe the nanobody hC3Nb3, which is specific for the C-terminal C345c domain of human and mouse complement component C3/C3b/C3c and potently inhibits C3 cleavage by the alternative pathway. A high-resolution structure of the hC3Nb3-C345c complex explains how the nanobody blocks proconvertase assembly. Surprisingly, although the nanobody does not affect classical pathway-mediated C3 cleavage, hC3Nb3 inhibits classical pathway-driven hemolysis, suggesting that the C-terminal domain of C3b has an important function in classical pathway C5 convertase activity. The hC3Nb3 nanobody binds C3 with low nanomolar affinity in an SDS-resistant complex, and the nanobody is demonstrated to be a powerful reagent for C3 detection in immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. Overall, the hC3Nb3 nanobody represents a potent inhibitor of both the alternative pathway and the terminal pathway, with possible applications in complement research, diagnostics, and therapeutics.","output":"A Complement C3-Specific Nanobody for Modulation of the Alternative Cascade Identifies the C-Terminal Domain of C3b as Functional in C5 Convertase Activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A case of COVID-19-associated acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy in adults in combination with comorbid pathology was analyzed.

Gambling activity among adolescents and young people has received considerable research attention due to a high prevalence of gambling reported among these groups in recent years. Despite legislation worldwide to constrain gambling among adolescents and young people, modern technology, such as online gaming apps and online gambling venues, has significantly increased their exposure to the risks of problem gambling. It is important, therefore, to have up to date information about what is currently known about gambling and to explore gaps in our knowledge. This gap analysis presents the results of a systematic approach to reviewing the current literature on gambling behaviour, attitudes, and associated risk factors for gambling and problem gambling among adolescents and young adults (aged 10C25 years). The review included studies published between January 2015 and August 2020 and included 85 studies for final synthesis.

The effect of COVID\\\\19 on liver injury has not been fully presented. AIMS: To evaluate the dynamic changes in liver function and the relationship between liver function damage and prognosis in patients with COVID\\\\19. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of clinical data of 675 patients with COVID\\\\19 in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 3 to March 8, 2020. Patients were classified as normal, abnormal liver function and liver injury. RESULTS: Of 675 patients, 253 (37.5%) had abnormal liver function during hospitalisation, and 52 (7.7%) had liver injury. The dynamic changes of ALT and AST levels were more significant in patients with liver injury and in those who died. AST >3\\\\fold ULN had the highest risk of death and mechanical ventilation.

However, it also implied that many patients were not screened and therefore had no accurate diagnosis. In this study, we carried out a population-based SARS-CoV-2 screening in Mexico to evaluate the COVID-19-related symptoms and their weighting in predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also discuss this data in the context of the operational definition of suspected cases of COVID-19 established by the Mexican Health Authority's consensus. Materials and Methods: One thousand two hundred seventy-nine subjects were included. They were screened for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR. The weighting of COVID-19 symptoms in predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection was evaluated statistically. Results: Three hundred and twenty-five patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 954 were negative. Fever, asthenia, dysgeusia, and oxygen saturation predicted SARS-CoV-2 infection (odds ratios ranged from 1.74 to 4.98; p < 0.05). The percentage of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients was 36% and only 38.15% met the Mexican operational definition. Cq-values for the gene N of SARS-CoV-2 were significantly higher in asymptomatic subjects than in the groups of COVID-19 patients with neurological, respiratory, and/or musculoskeletal manifestations (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Dysgeusia, fever, and asthenia increased the odds of a positive result for COVID-19 1.74-4.98-fold among the study population. Patients with neurological, respiratory, and/or musculoskeletal manifestations had higher viral loads at COVID-19 diagnosis than those observed in asymptomatic patients.

Diabetes mellitus is co-morbidity which is considered as the risk factor for COVID 19. Well-controlled diabetes is associated with better outcomes than poorly controlled diabetes. Measurement of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) is the standard method for assessing long term glycaemic control. Regardless of the level of hyperglycaemia, improvement in glycaemic control will lower the risk of diabetic complications. Aim: This study was conducted to identify the role of glycaemic control (HbA1c) in predicting the severity of illness in patients with COVID 19 pneumonia. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective observational study of (51 diabetic and 51 were non diabetic) patients at Kamineni Academy of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, India. The patients diagnosed with COVID 19 pneumonia, which includes both diabetics and non diabetics from June 2020 to September 2020. Patients age, sex, baseline HbA1c levels, and oxygen requirement during the hospital stay were analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 22.0. The Chi-Square test was used to analyse qualitative data and p-value significant at level &lt;0.05. Results: In the study among diabetics (n=51), 20 (39.2%) were on room air, 24 (47.1%) required intermittent oxygen support, 3 (5.9%) high flow oxygen, and 4 (7.8%) non invasive ventilator support. Among non diabetics (n=51), 28 (54.9%) were on room air, 18 (35.3%) on intermittent oxygen, 2 (3.9%) high flow oxygen, and 3 (5.9%) Non Invasive Ventilator (NIV) support. It was observed that patients with HbA1c measurements with poor glycaemic control required more oxygen support during treatment in diabetics (p-value:0.469) Conclusion: In the present study, patients with poor glycaemic control required insignificantly, more oxygen support than patients with good glycaemic control.","output":"Role of glycaemic control in predicting severity of illness in COVID 19 patients with diabetes mellitus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article, we investigated the spatial dependence of the incidence rate by COVID-19 in the S?o Paulo municipality, Brazil, including the association between the spatially smoothed incidence rate (INC_EBS) and the social determinants of poverty, the average Salary (SAL), the percentage of households located in slums (SLUMS) and the percentage of the population above 60 years of age (POP>60Y). We used data on the number notified cases accumulated per district by May 18, 2020. The spatial dependence of the spatially smoothed incidence rate was investigated through the analysis of univariate local spatial autocorrelation using Moran's I. To evaluate the spatial association between the INC_EBS and the determinants SAL, POP>60Y and SLUMS, we used the local bivariate Moran's I. The results showed that the spatially smoothed incidence rate for COVID-19 presented significant spatial autocorrelation (I = 0.333; P<0.05), indicating that the cases were concentrated in clusters of neighbouring districts. The INC_EBS showed a negative spatial association with SAL (I = -0.253, P<0.05) and POP>60Y (I = -0.398, P<0.05). We also found that the INC_EBS showed a positive spatial association with households located in the slums (I = 0.237, P<0.05).

We aim to explore the effect of these changes on a Psychiatry Emergency Service during COVID-19 lockdown in Spain. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on all patients admitted to our Psychiatric Emergency Service 90 days before and after March 14th, 2020, the first day of lockdown in Spain. Extracted data were compared between the two periods. Poisson regression analysis was performed to analyze changes in admission rates. RESULTS: 1,958 psychiatric emergency admissions were analyzed. Although the number of admissions decreased by 37.9%, we observed a significant increase in the percentage of acute psychiatric hospitalization during the lockdown. Anxiety spectrum disorders accumulated the greatest significant decrease in admission rates during the lockdown. On the other hand, a significant increase in admissions rates was found in patients with dementia, autism spectrum disorders, and substance use disorders during the lockdown.

The usually precise switch is thought to occur during the synthesis of negative-strand templates for sgmRNA production and to be directed by heptameric core donor sequences within the genome that match an acceptor core (UCUAAAC in the case of bovine coronavirus) near the 3' end of the 5'-terminal genomic leader. Here it is shown that a 22-nucleotide (nt) donor sequence engineered into a packageable bovine coronavirus defective interfering (DI) RNA and made to match a sequence within the 65-nt virus genomic leader caused a template switch yielding an sgmRNA with only a 33-nt minileader. By changing the donor sequence, acceptor sites between genomic nt 33 and 97 (identical between the DI RNA and the viral genome) could be used to generate sgmRNAs detectable by Northern analysis (approximately 2 to 32 molecules per cell) by 24 h postinfection. Whether the switch was intramolecular only was not determined since a potentially distinguishing acceptor region in the DI RNA rapidly conformed to that in the helper virus genome through a previously described template switch known as leader switching.

However, there are concerns regarding adverse effects, such as the induction of fever attributed to mRNA vaccines and pre-existing immunity against adenovirus vectored vaccines or their possible involvement in the development of thrombosis. The induction of antibodies against the adenovirus vector itself constitutes another hindrance, rendering boosting vaccinations ineffective. Additionally, it has been questioned whether inactivated vaccines that predominantly induce humoral immunity are effective against newly arising variants, as some isolated strains were found to be resistant to the serum from COVID-19 recovered patients. Although the number of vaccinated people is steadily increasing on a global scale, it is still necessary to develop vaccines to address the difficulties and concerns mentioned above. Among the various vaccine modalities, live attenuated vaccines have been considered the most effective, since they closely replicate a natural infection without the burden of the disease. In our attempt to provide an additional option to the repertoire of COVID-19 vaccines, we succeeded in isolating temperature-sensitive strains with unique phenotypes that could serve as seeds for a live attenuated vaccine. In this review article, we summarize the characteristics of the currently approved SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. In particular, we focus on the novel temperature-sensitive variants of SARS-CoV-2 that we have recently isolated, and their potential application as live-attenuated vaccines.

The AA population is disproportionally affected by COVID-19, in part, because they have high prevalence of underlying conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension, which are known to exacerbate not only kidney diseases, but also COVID-19. Further, a decreased adherence to COVID-19 guidelines among tobacco smokers could result in increased infection, inflammation, reduced immune response, and lungs damage, leading to more severe form of COVID-19. As a result of high prevalence of underlying conditions that cause kidney diseases in the AA population coupled with tobacco smoking make the AA population vulnerable to severe form of both COVID-19 and kidney diseases. In this review, we describe how tobacco smoking interact with SARS-CoV-2 and exacerbates SARS-CoV-2-induced kidney diseases including renal failure, especially in the AA population. We also explore the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in COVID-19 patients who smoke tobacco. EVs, which play important role in tobacco-mediated pathogenesis in infectious diseases, have also shown to be important in COVID-19 pathogenesis and organ injuries including kidney. Further, we explore the potential role of EVs in biomarker discovery and therapeutics, which may help to develop early diagnosis and treatment of tobacco-induced renal injury in COVID-19 patients, respectively.

ZIKV non-structural protein 5 (NS5) methyltransferase (MTase), which is essential for viral replication, is regarded as a potential drug target. In our study, a luminescence-based methyltransferase assay was used to establish the ZIKV NS5 MTase inhibitor screening model. Through screening a natural product library, we found theaflavin, a polyphenol derived from tea, could inhibit ZIKV NS5 MTase activity with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of 10.10 M. Molecular docking and site-directed mutagenesis analyses identified D146 as the key amino acid in the interaction between ZIKV NS5 MTase and theaflavin. The SPR assay indicated that theaflavin had a stronger binding activity with ZIKV NS5 wild-type (WT)-MTase than it with D146A-MTase. Moreover, theaflavin exhibited a dose dependent inhibitory effect on ZIKV replication with a 50% effective concentration (EC(50)) of 8.19 M.

The severe respiratory pneumonia caused by novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has so far claimed more than 0.38 million lives and has impacted human lives worldwide. However, as the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus displays high transmission rates, the underlying genomic severity is required to be fully understood. We studied the complete genomes of 95 SARS-CoV-2 strains from different geographical regions worldwide to uncover the pattern of the spread of the virus. We show that there is no direct transmission pattern of the virus among neighboring countries, suggesting that its spread is a result of travel of infected humans to different countries. We revealed unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in nonstructural protein 13 (nsp13), nsp14, nsp15, and nsp16 (ORF1b polyproteins) and in the S-protein within 10 viral isolates from the United States. These viral proteins are involved in RNA replication and binding with the human receptors, indicating that the viral variants that are circulating in the population of the United States are different from those circulating in the populations of other countries. In addition, we found an amino acid addition in nsp16 (mRNA cap-1 methyltransferase) of a U.S. isolate (GenBank accession no. MT188341.1) leading to a shift in the amino acid frame from position 2540 onward. Through comparative structural analysis of the wild-type and mutant proteins, we showed that this addition of a phenylalanine residue renders the protein in the mutant less stable, which might affect mRNA cap-1 methyltransferase function. We further analyzed the SARS-CoV-2-human interactome, which revealed that the interferon signaling pathway is targeted by orf1ab during infection and that it also interacts with NF-&#954;B-repressing factor (NKRF), which is a potential regulator of interleukin-8 (IL-8). We propose that targeting this interaction may subsequently improve the health condition of COVID-19 patients. Our analysis also emphasized that SARS-CoV-2 manipulates spliceosome machinery during infection; hence, targeting splicing might affect viral replication. In conclusion, the replicative machinery of SARS-CoV-2 is targeting interferon and the notch signaling pathway along with spliceosome machinery to evade host challenges.IMPORTANCE The COVID-19 pandemic continues to storm the world, with over 6.5 million cases worldwide. The severity of the disease varies with the territories and is mainly influenced by population density and age factor. In this study, we analyzed the transmission pattern of 95 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from 11 different countries. Our study also revealed several nonsynonymous mutations in ORF1b and S-proteins and the impact on their structural stability. Our analysis showed the manipulation of host system by viral proteins through SARS-CoV-2-human protein interactome, which can be useful to understand the impact of virus on human health.","output":"Comparative Genomic Analysis of Rapidly Evolving SARS-CoV-2 Reveals Mosaic Pattern of Phylogeographical Distribution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical and computed tomographic (CT) features in the patients with COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by the real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) amplification of the viral DNA from a sputum sample. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical information and CT findings of a total of 14 patients with COVID-19 infection (age range, 12-83 years; females 6) were analyzed retrospectively. The clinical information includes the history of exposure, laboratory results, and the symptoms (such as fever, cough, headache, etc.); CT findings of chest include the extension and distribution of lesion, the ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, bronchovascular enlarged, irregular linear appearances, pleural effusion, and lymphadenopathy. RESULTS: Eight patients had the exposure history for recent travel to Wuhan of Hubei province (8/14, 57%), 6 had the exposure to patients with COVID-19 infection. Significant statistical differences were observed in lymphocyte percentage decreased and C-reactive protein elevated (pa=a0.015). Seven patients had fever, 7 had cough, 2 had headache, 3 had fatigue, 1 had body soreness, 3 had diarrhea, and 2 had no obvious symptoms. In chest CT examination, 10 patients were positive (10/14, 71.43%). Among these patients, 9 had lesions involving both lungs (9/10, 90%), 8 had lesions involving 4 to 5 lobes (8/10, 80%). Most of lesions were distributed peripherally and the most significant lesions were observed in the right lower lobe in 9 patients (9/10, 90%).

This review focuses on weight loss interventions utilizing real-time telemedicine. RECENT FINDINGS: Telemedicine interventions are usually run as a weekly counseling and educational session or as a complement to a primarily Web-based intervention. A wide variety of healthcare professionals may provide the intervention. Common content includes portion control, increased physical activity, and relapse prevention. Self-monitoring is associated with intervention success. Modalities considered include online chats, text messages, phone calls, and videoconferences. Videoconferencing may be especially useful in capturing the interpersonal connection associated with in-person care but is understudied compared to other modalities. While many interventions show improvements in weight and weight-related outcomes, small sample sizes limit generalizability. Technology access and digital literacy are both necessary. SUMMARY: Telemedicine interventions can successfully help patients with obesity lose weight. Telemedicine interventions provide a safe, remote alternative and may expand treatment access to hard-to-reach populations.

Previous studies have reported that elder abuse increases the risk of dementia; however, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have investigated the association between different types of abuse and dementia onset yet. This study, therefore, investigated the association between physical, psychological, and financial abuses and dementia onset in independent older adults in Japan. METHODS A 6-year prospective cohort data from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study (JAGES) were collected in 2010 through a mail survey conducted among 5,674 men and 6,562 women aged 65 years across Japan. Dementia was assessed using the nationally standardized dementia scale proposed by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. Poisson regression analysis was performed separately for each type of abuse to calculate the incidence rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS During follow-up, 552 (9.7%) men and 728 (11.1%) women developed dementia. After adjusting for potential confounders, participants who experienced financial abuse were 1.53 (1.09-2.16) times more likely to develop dementia than those who did not. On the other hand, participants who experienced physical abuse were 1.53 (0.92-2.56) times more likely and those who experienced psychological abuse were 0.98 (0.82-1.17) times less likely to develop dementia than participants who did not experience such abuses. However, the difference was not significant. CONCLUSION Financial abuse may promote dementia among older adults in Japan, suggesting that preventing this abuse may help prevent dementia onset.

In this paper, we propose an improved hybrid classification approach for COVID-19 images by combining the strengths of CNNs (using a powerful architecture called Inception) to extract features and a swarm-based feature selection algorithm (Marine Predators Algorithm) to select the most relevant features. A combination of fractional-order and marine predators algorithm (FO-MPA) is considered an integration among a robust tool in mathematics named fractional-order calculus (FO). The proposed approach was evaluated on two public COVID-19 X-ray datasets which achieves both high performance and reduction of computational complexity. The two datasets consist of X-ray COVID-19 images by international Cardiothoracic radiologist, researchers and others published on Kaggle. The proposed approach selected successfully 130 and 86 out of 51 K features extracted by inception from dataset 1 and dataset 2, while improving classification accuracy at the same time.

Several studies analyzing these factors in the function of disease severity of have been published; however, no studies have shown how all of these factors interplay within a defined cohort. To address this important question, we sought to understand how these four key components interplay in a cohort of COVID-19 patients. We determined the viral loads and gene expression using high throughput sequencing and various virological methods. We found that viral loads in the upper respiratory tract in COVID-19 patients at an early phase of infection vary widely. While the majority of nasopharyngeal (NP) samples have a viral load lower than the limit of detection of infectious viruses, there are samples with an extraordinary amount of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and a high viral titer. No specific viral factors were identified that are associated with high viral loads. Host gene expression analysis showed that viral loads were strongly correlated with cellular antiviral responses. Interestingly, however, COVID-19 patients who experience mild symptoms have a higher viral load than those with severe complications, indicating that naso-pharyngeal viral load may not be a key factor of the clinical outcomes of COVID-19. The metagenomics analysis revealed that the microflora in the upper respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients with high viral loads were dominated by SARS-CoV-2, with a high degree of dysbiosis. Finally, we found a strong inverse correlation between upregulation of interferon responses and disease severity. Overall our study suggests that a high viral load in the upper respiratory tract may not be a critical factor for severe symptoms; rather, dampened antiviral responses may be a critical factor for a severe outcome from the infection.","output":"Induction of interferon response by high viral loads at early stage infection may protect against severe outcomes in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Myoclonus and ataxia, with or without opsoclonus, have recently been recognized as a central nervous system syndrome associated with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).

METHODS: Surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) antibody levels of adults receiving either two doses of BNT162b2 (n = 366) or CoronaVac (n = 360) vaccines in Hong Kong were determined. An age-matched subgroup (BNT162b2 [n = 49] vs. CoronaVac [n = 49]) was tested for plaque reduction neutralization (PRNT) and spike-binding antibody and T-cell reactivity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. RESULTS: One month after the second dose of vaccine, BNT162b2 elicited significantly higher PRNT50 , PRNT90 , sVNT, spike receptor binding, spike N-terminal domain binding, spike S2 domain binding, spike FcR binding and antibody avidity levels than CoronaVac. The geometric mean PRNT50 titres in those vaccinated with BNT162b2 and CoronaVac vaccines were 251.6 and 69.45, while PRNT90 titres were 98.91 and 16.57, respectively. All of those vaccinated with BNT162b2 and 45 (91.8%) of 49 vaccinated with CoronaVac achieved the 50% protection threshold for PRNT90. Allowing for an expected seven-fold waning of antibody titres over 6 months for those receiving CoronaVac, only 16.3% would meet the 50% protection threshold versus 79.6% of BNT162b2 vaccinees. Age was negatively correlated with PRNT90 antibody titres.

The aims of the current study were to assess natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) as an alternative to transthoracic endoscopic surgery, and to test the feasibility of peroral transesophageal right upper pulmonary lobectomy with the assistance of a single transthoracic trocar. METHODS In 10 acute and 4 survival pigs, right upper pulmonary lobectomy was performed using a forward-viewing double-channel gastroscope and an operative thoracoscope with a 5-mm working channel inserted through a single transthoracic 12-mm) port. Time, safety, and feasibility of the following steps were recorded in all animals: esophagotomy, hilar dissection, individual ligation of the hilum elements, pulmonary lobectomy, and specimen retrieval. In the survival experiments, esophagotomy was closed using a reticulated laparoscopy suture device and an esophageal stent was placed. These animals were kept alive and monitored for 2 weeks. RESULTS Esophagotomy was performed safely in all animals (mean procedure duration 5.4  1.7 minutes). Dissection of the right upper lobe hilum elements (bronchus, arteries, and veins) was carried out without adverse events. Individual ligation of the hilum elements was performed in all but two cases (time for dissection and ligation 44.2  14.8 minutes). Lobectomy and specimen retrieval were completed in all animals (9.5  3.1 minutes). Esophagotomy closure and stent placement were carried out in 20.0  2.8 minutes in the survival animals.

However, the multidimensional relationship between social media support and social confidence, perceived media credibility and life attitude during the COVID-19 pandemic is an important, yet less explored, research issue. The present research aimed to fill in this gap by a survey of 1343 participants who are permanent residents aged 18 and above in a city through WeChat social networking platform. The results showed that: (1) social media support exerted direct influence on social confidence, perceived media credibility and life attitude; (2) perceived media credibility positively influenced social confidence; (3) social media support not only directly promoted social confidence, but also indirectly influenced social confidence through publics perceived media credibility. These findings suggested that strengthening social media support during the COVID-19 pandemic is not only helpful to reconstitute the publics confidence in prevailing against the pandemic, but also is able to help promote the diversification of the power of public network autonomy.

This situation poses the problem that the chest x-rays collected annually in hospitals cannot be used due to the lack of manual labeling by experts, especially in deprived areas. To address this, here we present a novel deep learning framework that uses knowledge distillation through self-supervised learning and self-training, which shows that the performance of the original model trained with a small number of labels can be gradually improved with more unlabeled data. Experimental results show that the proposed framework maintains impressive robustness against a real-world environment and has general applicability to several diagnostic tasks such as tuberculosis, pneumothorax, and COVID-19. Notably, we demonstrated that our model performs even better than those trained with the same amount of labeled data. The proposed framework has a great potential for medical imaging, where plenty of data is accumulated every year, but ground truth annotations are expensive to obtain.","output":"AI can evolve without labels: self-evolving vision transformer for chest X-ray diagnosis through knowledge distillation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report a case of febrile Plasmodium falciparum malaria in a 36-year-old male patient occurring 14 years after immigration from and more than 12 months since a return visit to the endemic area.

How sequence variations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome affect pathogenicity is poorly understood. Starting in October 2020, using the methodology of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we looked at the association between whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data of the virus and COVID-19 mortality as a potential method of early identification of highly pathogenic strains to target for containment. Although continuously updating our analysis, in December 2020, we analyzed 7548 single-stranded SARS-CoV-2 genomes of COVID-19 patients in the GISAID database and associated variants with mortality using a logistic regression. In total, evaluating 29,891 sequenced loci of the viral genome for association with patient/host mortality, two loci, at 12,053 and 25,088 bp, achieved genome-wide significance (p values of 4.09e-09 and 4.41e-23, respectively), though only 25,088 bp remained significant in follow-up analyses. Our association findings were exclusively driven by the samples that were submitted from Brazil (p value of 4.90e-13 for 25,088 bp). The mutation frequency of 25,088 bp in the Brazilian samples on GISAID has rapidly increased from about 0.4 in October/December 2020 to 0.77 in March 2021. Although GWAS methodology is suitable for samples in which mutation frequencies varies between geographical regions, it cannot account for mutation frequencies that change rapidly overtime, rendering a GWAS follow-up analysis of the GISAID samples that have been submitted after December 2020 as invalid. The locus at 25,088 bp is located in the P.1 strain, which later (April 2021) became one of the distinguishing loci (precisely, substitution V1176F) of the Brazilian strain as defined by the Centers for Disease Control. Specifically, the mutations at 25,088 bp occur in the S2 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which plays a key role in viral entry of target host cells. Since the mutations alter amino acid coding sequences, they potentially imposing structural changes that could enhance viral infectivity and symptom severity. Our analysis suggests that GWAS methodology can provide suitable analysis tools for the real-time detection of new more transmissible and pathogenic viral strains in databases such as GISAID, though new approaches are needed to accommodate rapidly changing mutation frequencies over time, in the presence of simultaneously changing case/control ratios. Improvements of the associated metadata/patient information in terms of quality and availability will also be important to fully utilize the potential of GWAS methodology in this field.","output":"Genome-wide association analysis of COVID-19 mortality risk in SARS-CoV-2 genomes identifies mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that colocalizes with P.1 of the Brazilian strain."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Recently, dyslipidemia was observed in the patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

The blood lipid profile in the patients with COVID-19 were investigated, and their predictive values for COVID-19 severity were analysed. Results: : There were 125 and 17 cases in the non-severe and severe group, respectively.

Given the similarities in the systemic responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection with those observed after pandemic influenza, there is a question if a similar syndrome of post-encephalic parkinsonism could follow COVID-19 infection. OBJECTIVES: To determine if prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 increased sensitivity to a mitochondrial toxin known to induce parkinsonism. METHODS: K18-hACE2 mice were infected with SARS-CoV-2 to induce mild to moderate disease. After 38 days recovery, mice were administered a non-lesion inducing dose of the parkinsonian toxin MPTP and euthanized 7 days later. Subsequent neuroinflammation and SNpc dopaminergic neuron loss was determined and compared to SARS-CoV-2 or MPTP alone. RESULTS: K18-hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 or MPTP showed no SNpc DA neuron loss following MPTP. In mice infected and recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, MPTP induced a 23% or 19% greater loss of SNpc dopaminergic neurons than SARS-CoV-2 or MPTP, respectively (p < 0.05). Examination of microglial activation showed a significant increase in the number of activated microglia in both the SNpc and striatum of the SARS-CoV-2 + MPTP group compared to SARS-CoV-2 or MPTP alone. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations have important implications for long-term public health, given the number of people that have survived SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as for future public policy regarding infection mitigation. However, it will be critical to determine if other agents known to increase risk of PD also have synergistic effects with SARS-CoV-2 and are abrogated by vaccination.","output":"COVID-19 infection enhances susceptibility to oxidative-stress induced parkinsonism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic respiratory disease with serious public health risk and has taken the world off-guard with its rapid spread.

Other traumatic, infectious, endocrine, electrolyte disturbance and autoimmune causes of rhabdomyolysis were excluded. The temporal relationship between vaccine administration and disease onset indicated possible causality. The patient had a favourable evolution after receiving fluids and completely recovered.

The emerging of still new escape variants of influenza A viruses causing epidemics and periodic worldwide pandemics represents a threat for human population. Therefore, current, hot task of influenza virus research is to look for a way how to get us closer to a universal vaccine. Combination of chosen conserved antigens inducing cross-protective antibody response with epitopes activating also cross-protective cytotoxic T-cells would offer an attractive strategy for improving protection against drift variants of seasonal influenza viruses and reduces the impact of future pandemic strains. Antigenically conserved fusion-active subunit of hemagglutinin (HA2 gp) and ectodomain of matrix protein 2 (eM2) are promising candidates for preparation of broadly protective HA2- or eM2-based vaccine that may aid in pandemic preparedness. Overall protective effect could be achieved by contribution of epitopes recognized by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) that have been studied extensively to reach much broader control of influenza infection. In this review we present the state-of-art in this field. We describe known adaptive immune mechanisms mediated by influenza specific B- and T-cells involved in the anti-influenza immune defense together with the contribution of innate immunity.

Limited reports exist discussing the anaesthetic management of obstetric patients infected with COVID-19. We review a cohort of obstetric patients in the Bronx with COVID-19 and report their delivery data, anaesthetic management, and maternal-fetal outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHODS We reviewed 92 pregnant patients with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) who delivered between 1 February 2020 and 1 May 2020. Medical records were reviewed for patient characteristics, anaesthetic management, and clinical outcomes. Patients were stratified by mode of delivery and COVID-19 disease severity. RESULTS Of the 92 deliveries, 49 (53%) were vaginal, 14 (15%) were scheduled caesareans, and 29 (32%) were unscheduled caesareans. 64 patients (70%) were asymptomatic for COVID-19 (mild disease: 18 patients [19%], moderate disease: 7 patients [8%], severe disease: 2 patients [2%], critical disease: 1 patient [1%]). 83 patients (90%) received neuraxial analgesia and/or anaesthesia, with combined spinal-epidural (CSE) and dural puncture epidural (DPE) as the most common techniques. 5 patients (5%) required general anaesthesia (GA) for caesarean delivery, 3 (3%) of whom were intubated for severe or critical COVID-19 disease. CONCLUSIONS Given the risks associated with SARS-CoV-2 aerosol transmission, GA was avoided in all but the most critically ill patients. CSE and DPE were optimal for minimizing catheter failure rates and risk of conversion to GA. SARS-CoV-2 infection in obstetric patients may be associated with an increased risk for adverse outcomes including preeclampsia, preterm delivery, unscheduled caesarean delivery, and mechanical ventilation.","output":"A review of 92 obstetric patients with COVID-19 in the Bronx, New York and their peripartum anaesthetic management."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two heterocyclic azole compounds, 3-(2,3-dihydrobenzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-4H-chromen-4-one (SVS1) and 5-(1H-indol-3-yl)-4-methyl-2,4-dihydro-3H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thione (SVS2) were obtained unexpectedly from 2-aminothiophenol and 4-oxo-4H-chromene-3-carbaldehyde (for SVS1), and (E)-2-((1H-indol-3-yl)methylene)-N-methylhydrazine-1-carbothioamide in the presence of anhydrous FeCl(3) (for SVS2), respectively. The compounds were well characterized by analytical and spectroscopic tools. The molecular structures of both the compounds were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction (X-RD) study. The results obtained from density functional theory (DFT) study revealed the molecular geometry and electron distribution of the compounds, which were correlated well with the three-dimensional structures obtained from the single crystal X-ray diffraction. DMol(3) was used to calculate quantum chemical parameters [chemical potential (), global hardness (), global softness (), absolute electronegativity () and electrophilicity index ()] of SVS1 and SVS2. Molecular docking study was performed to elucidate the binding ability of SVS1 and SVS2 with SARS-CoV-2 main protease and human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) molecular targets. Interestingly, the binding efficiency of the compounds with the molecular targets was comparable with that of remdesivir (SARS-CoV-2), chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. SVS1 showed better docking energy than SVS2. The molecular docking study was complemented by molecular dynamic simulation study of SARS-CoV-2 main protease-SVS1 complex, which further exemplified the binding ability of SVS1 with the target. In addition, SVS1, SVS2 and cisplatin were assessed for their cytotoxicity against a panel of three human cancer cells such as HepG-2 (hepatic carcinoma), T24 (bladder) and EA.hy926 (endothelial), as well as Vero (kidney epithelial cells extracted from an African green monkey) normal cells using MTT assay. The results showed that SVS2 has significant cytotoxicity against HepG-2 and EA.hy926 cells with the IC(50) values of 33.8 M (IC(50) = 49.9 M-cisplatin and 8.6 M-doxorubicin) and 29.2 (IC(50) = 26.6 M-cisplatin and 3.8 M-doxorubicin), respectively.","output":"Design and synthesis of heterocyclic azole based bioactive compounds: Molecular structures, quantum simulation, and mechanistic studies through docking as multi-target inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 and cytotoxicity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Suicide and suicidal behaviors were already a global public health problem, producing preventable injuries and deaths.

The spreading rate is measured by the ratio between the reproductive number R(t)(t) and the doubling time T(d)(t) called RIC-index and the daily fatalities number. The dynamics of the Covid-19 epidemics have been studied by wavelet analysis and represented by a non-linear helicoid vortex in a 3D space where both RIC-index and fatalities change with time.

Increased ACD rates in mitotic cells from aged mice restore the expansion and memory potential of their cellular progenies. Further characterization of the composition of CD8+ T cells reveals that virtual memory cells (TVM cells), which accumulate during ageing, have a unique proliferation and metabolic profile, and retain their ability to divide asymmetrically, which correlates with increased memory potential. The opposite is observed for naive CD8+ T cells from aged mice. Our data provide evidence on how ACD modulation contributes to long-term survival and function of T cells during ageing, offering new insights into how the immune system adapts to ageing.","output":"Asymmetric cell division shapes naive and virtual memory T-cell immunity during ageing."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As being radiation-free, portable, and capable of repetitive use, ultrasonography is playing an important role in diagnosing and evaluating the COVID-19 Pneumonia (PN) in this epidemic. By virtue of lung ultrasound scores (LUSS), lung ultrasonography (LUS) was used to estimate the excessive lung fluid which is an important clinical manifestation of COVID-19 PN, with high sensitivity and specificity. However, as a qualitative method, LUSS suffered from large inter-observer variations and requirement for experienced clinicians. Considering this limitation, we developed a quantitative and automatic lung ultrasound scoring system for evaluating the COVID-19 PN. A total of 1527 ultrasound images prospectively collected from 31 COVID-19 PN patients with different clinical conditions were evaluated and scored with LUSS by experienced clinicians. All images were processed via a series of computer aided analysis including curve-to-linear conversion, pleural line detection, region of interest (ROI) selection and feature extraction. A collection of 28 features extracted from the ROI was specifically deofined for mimicking the LUSS. Multi-layer fully connected neural networks, support vector machines and decision trees were developed for scoring LUS images using the 5-fold cross-validation. The model with 128C256 two fully connected layers gave the best accuracy of 87%.

This study investigated whether MGIB is associated with the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), low-dose aspirin (LDA), thienopyridines, anticoagulants, and proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), and whether PPI use affects the interactions between MGIB and antithrombotic drugs. METHODS In this multicenter, hospital-based, case-control study, 400 patients underwent upper and lower endoscopy, 80 had acute overt MGIB and 320 had no bleeding and were matched for age and sex as controls (1:4). MGIB was additionally evaluated by capsule and/or double-balloon endoscopy, after excluding upper and lower GI bleeding. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) for MGIB risk were calculated using conditional logistic regression. To estimate the propensity score, we employed a logistic regression model for PPI use. RESULTS In patients with MGIB, mean hemoglobin level was 9.4 g/dL, and 28 patients (35%) received blood transfusions. Factors significantly associated with MGIB were chronic kidney disease (p<0.001), liver cirrhosis (p = 0.034), NSAIDs (p<0.001), thienopyridines (p<0.001), anticoagulants (p = 0.002), and PPIs (p<0.001).

We studied potential immunohistochemical markers for the detection of the villus-crypt border: apolipoprotein A4 (APOA4), Ki-67, glucose transporter 2, keratin 20, cytochrome P450 3A4 and intestinal fatty-acid binding protein. Among these, villus-specific APOA4 was chosen as the best candidate for further studies.

Strict lockdown measures were implemented early to contain the viral outbreak in Austria. Massive changes in organizational structures of healthcare facilities followed with unclear implications on the care of non-COVID-19-affected patients. We studied the nationwide impact of COVID-19 on kidney transplantation in Austria during the first six months of 2020. Concurrent with general lockdown measures, all kidney transplant activity was suspended from 13 March to 9 April. Nevertheless, between January and June, total transplant (p = 0.48) and procured donor organ numbers (p = 0.6) did not differ significantly from earlier years. Ten (0.18%) of 5512 prevalent Austrian kidney transplant recipients were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2. The case fatality rate (one death; 10%) in renal transplant patients was less than in other countries but higher than in Austria's general population (2.4%). We conclude that early and strict general lockdown measures imposed by the government allowed an early, however cautious, re-opening of Austrian transplant programs and played a crucial role for the favorable outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 in Austrian kidney transplant patients.

The cause of SARS was identified as a novel coronavirus (CoV). The existence of asymptomatic seroconvertors and the detection of the SARS-CoV RNA in plasma during the course of infection all suggest that SARS could, as least theoretically, be transmitted by transfusion. An estimate of the risk of SARS transmission through blood transfusion will contribute to decisions concerning blood safety monitoring and may be useful in the design of strategies to decrease the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Case onset dates from the 2003 Shenzhen SARS epidemic and investigational results from Taiwan on viremia in humans are used to estimate the number of cases that were viremic throughout the epidemic. Estimates of the asymptomatic-to-clinically confirmed SARS-CoV infection ratio, the proportion of asymptomatic infections reported in a seroprevalence survey in Hongkong, and the population size of Shenzhen are used to infer the SARS-CoV transfusionCtransmission risk. Statistical resampling methods are used. RESULTS: Based on data from Shenzhen, Hongkong and Taiwan, the maximum and mean risk (per million) of SARS-CoV transmission from donors in Shenzhen were estimated as 23.57 (95% CI: 6.83C47.69) and 14.11 (95% CI: 11.00C17.22), respectively. The estimated risk peaked on April 02, 2003. CONCLUSIONS: Although there are currently no confirmed reports of the transmission of SARS-CoV from asymptomatic individuals, recent research data indicate that transfusion-transmitted SARS-CoV is at least theoretically possible. Although the risk is low, with its rapid spread of the disease, appearance of alarmingly high infectivity and high fatality rate, public health authorities need to consider strategies for blood donor recruitment and virus inactivation during an epidemic to further ensure blood safety.","output":"Theoretically estimated risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome transmission through blood transfusion during an epidemic in Shenzhen, Guangdong, China in 2003"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has had a negative economic impact on the global swine industry for decades since its first emergence in the 1970s in Europe.

Method In this multicenter study, we retrospectively identified 153 discharged patients with COVID-19 pneumonia from Jan 16, 2020 to Feb 26, 2020 in Hunan province. Patients were grouped based on the hospitalization days: Group 1 (hospitalization daysQ12 days) and Group 2((hospitalization days> 12days). Demographic, clinical characteristics and laboratory findings on admission and the imaging features of the first Chest CT on admission were analyzed. The differences between groups were analyzed using univariate logistic regression to find the impact factors. Results The cohort included 153 discharged patients (85 males and 68 females, with the mean age of 42.3214.03 years old). 90(58.8%) patients had hospitalization daysQ12 and 63(41.2%) patients had hospitalization days>12. 44(48.9%) patients in Group1 and 28(44.4%) in Group 2 had been to Wuhan. In both Group1 and Group2, most common symptoms at onset were fever (62.2%, 60.3%) and cough (33.3%, 50.8%). Cough was occurred more common in Group 2(50.8%) than Group 1(33.3%) with a significant difference (p=0.03). 6(6.7%) patients in Group1 and 10(15.9%) in Group2 had admitting diagnosis as non-pneumonia (p=0.07), some of them occurred mild pneumonia during hospital stay. White blood cell (2.2%, 9.5%) and neutrophil (9.5%) count above normal were more common on in Group 2 (p=0.04, p=0.04). Patients in Group 2 had higher concentration of aspartate aminotransferase (P=0.04) than Group 1. Most of patients had multiple lesions (75.6%, 69.8%) with bilateral distribution (73.3%, 58.7%) in both groups. Mixed ground-glass opacity (GGO) and consolidation appearance were seen in most patients. GGO components > consolidation appearance were more common in Group 1(31.1%) than in Group 2(8.0%) with a significant difference between groups (P<0.01). Patients had cough at onset disease (OR, 0.47;95%CI, 0.23 to 0.96, p=0.04) and CT represented as GGO components more than consolidation (OR, 4.84;95%CI, 1.80 to 13.04, p<0.01) were associated with hospitalization days. Conclusions COVID-19 non-pneumonia patients with longer hospitalization days might have the persistent symptoms or pneumonia occurrence after admission. Chest CT could help prompt diagnosis and monitor disease progression, GGO/consolidation >1 in mixed lesions was associated with shorter hospitalization days.

We found oral administration of ramelteon (3.0 mg/kg) significantly attenuated ischemic injury even when it was given 4 h after the onset of ischemia. We showed that administration of ramelteon (3.0 mg/kg) displayed comparable protective efficacy and length of effective time window as administration of edaravone (10 mg/kg, i.p.), which was used in clinic to treat ischemic stroke.

We sought to capture the patient perceptions of the COVID-19 implications and the worldwide imposed treatment modifications. METHODS: A patient survey was conducted in 16 European countries, using a new COVID-19-related questionnaire, developed by ENGAGe and the Hospital Anxiety & Depression Scale questionnaire (HADS). The survey was promoted by national patient advocacy groups and charitable organisations. FINDINGS: We collected 1388 forms; 592 online and 796 hard-copy (May, 2020). We excluded 137 due to missing data. Median patients' age was 55 years (range: 18-89), 54.7% had ovarian cancer and 15.5% were preoperative. Even though 73.2% of patients named cancer as a risk factor for COVID-19, only 17.5% were more afraid of COVID-19 than their cancer condition, with advanced age (>70 years) as the only significant risk factor for that. Overall, 71% were concerned about cancer progression if their treatment/follow-up was cancelled/postponed. Most patients (64%) had their care continued as planned, but 72.3% (n = 892) said that they received no information around overall COVID-19 infection rates of patients and staff, testing or measures taken in their treating hospital. Mean HADS Anxiety and Depression Scores were 8.8 (range: 5.3-12) and 8.1 (range: 3.8-13.4), respectively. Multivariate analysis identified high HADS-depression scores, having experienced modifications of care due to the pandemic and concern about not being able to visit their doctor as independent predictors of patients' anxiety. INTERPRETATION: Gynaecological cancer patients expressed significant anxiety about progression of their disease due to modifications of care related to the COVID-19 pandemic and wished to pursue their treatment as planned despite the associated risks. Healthcare professionals should take this into consideration when making decisions that impact patients care in times of crisis and to develop initiatives to improve patients' communication and education.","output":"Perspectives, fears and expectations of patients with gynaecological cancers during the COVID-19 pandemic: A Pan-European study of the European Network of Gynaecological Cancer Advocacy Groups (ENGAGe)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cat's whiskers or the 'misai kucing' is an herbal plant native to the Southeast Asian region.

Data indicate that emotional reading of 9 to 10 years old pupils (N = 57) was similarly impaired as adults on an overall performance level, but that their selective performance on specific emotions was quite different. Kids showed extreme problems in reading the emotion disgust, strong effects on fear and sadness, and only mild effects on happiness, but also even better performances for emotional states anger and neutral when faces were masked. This project did gain not only relevant data about childrens perception but also made clear how fruitful seriously conducted school projects can be to encourage the interest and commitment for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)-relevant topics.","output":"The Impact of Face Masks on the Emotional Reading Abilities of ChildrenA Lesson From a Joint SchoolCUniversity Project"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world experienced the outbreak of a new pandemic disease in 2019, known as coronavirus (CoV) disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The respiratory system is the organ system most commonly affected by COVID-19;however, several other organ systems have been reported to be affected. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA found in infected stub samples can cause lung contagion by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor of the alveolar epithelial cells. The gut microbiota (GM) promote immunity, indicating that the alignment of the microbiota and corresponding metabolic processes in COVID-19 can help to identify novel biomarkers and new therapeutic targets for this disease. The cause of kidney damage in COVID-19 patients is possibly multifactorial, involving a complex mechanism that involves complement dysregulation and thrombotic microangiopathy, as well as the occurrence of a \\"cytokine storm\\" syndrome, which are immune responses that are abandoned and dysfunctional with unfavorable prognosis in severe COVID-19 cases. Furthermore, COVID-19 involves a continuous proliferation and activation of macrophages and lymphocytes. SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to the ACE-2 receptor expressed in the cerebral capillary endothelial cells that can invade the blood-brain wall, to penetrate the brain parenchyma. However, in the ongoing pandemic, there has been a surge in studies on a wide range of topics, including causes of respiratory failure, asymptomatic patients, intensive care patients, and survivors. This review briefly describes the damaging effects of COVID-19 on vital human organs and the inhibitory function of the ACE-2 receptor on the GM, which causes gut dysbiosis, and thus, this review discusses topics that have an opportunity for further investigation.

Samplings were performed in the early morning hours, with in situ determination and physicochemical analysis carried out in the laboratory. Microcystin-LR were determined in water and within the cells (intracellular toxins) using UPLC-MS analysis after solid phase extraction. The reservoirs studied were found to be affected by eutrophication, with high levels of TN:TP ratio and phytoplankton cell concentrations, high water temperatures and low transparency, which cause collateral effect such as cyanobacterial bloom and microcystin-LR occurrence.

Conversely, poor social support and loneliness are a social determinant of poor health outcomes and can adversely affect physical, emotional, and mental well-being. Social support is especially important in traumatic grief. However, the ways in which grieving individuals interpret and define social support is not well understood, and little is known about what specific behaviours are perceived as helpful. Using qualitative description and content analysis, this study assessed bereaved individuals satisfaction of social support in traumatic grief, using four categories of social support as a framework. Findings suggest inadequate satisfaction from professional, familial, and community support. Pets emerged with the most satisfactory ratings. Further, findings suggest that emotional support is the most desired type of support following traumatic loss.

Tensions generated by both of these developments have exposed the inadequacies of the existing, under-developed system for bringing governments together in the UK. The limitations of the current system include the ad hoc nature of intergovernmental meetings, and their consultative rather than decision-making character. Drawing upon an analysis of how intergovernmental relationships are structured in five other countries, the authors offer a number of suggestions for the reconfiguration of the UK model. They explore different ways of enabling joint decision making by its governments, and argue against the assumption that England can be represented adequately by the UK administration. Without a serious attempt to address this dysfunctional part of the UK's territorial constitution, there is every prospect that relations between these different governments will continue to deteriorate.","output":"Intergovernmental Relations in the UK: Time for a Radical Overhaul?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The most immediate response of the research community to COVID-19 has been a focus on understanding the effects, treatment and prevention of infection. Of equal and ongoing importance is elucidating the impact of mitigation measures, such as lockdown, on the well-being of societies. Research about mental health and lockdown in the UK has predominately involved large surveys that are likely to encounter self-selection bias. Further, self-reporting does not constitute a clinical judgement. AIMS: To (a) compare the age, gender and ethnicity of patients experiencing mental health emergencies prior compared with during lockdown, (b) determine whether the nature of mental health emergencies has changed during compared with before lockdown, (c) explore the utility of emergency medical service data for identifying vulnerability to mental health emergencies in real time during a pandemic. METHOD: A total of 32 401 clinical records of ambulance paramedics attending mental health emergencies in the East Midlands of the UK between 23 March and 31 July 2020 and the same period in 2019 were analysed using binary logistic regression. RESULTS: People of younger age, male gender and South Asian and Black ethnicity are particularly vulnerable to acute mental health conditions during lockdown. Patients with acute cases of anxiety have increased during lockdown whereas suicide and intentional drug overdose have decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported data may underrepresent the true impact of lockdown on male mental health and ethnic minority groups. Emergency medical data can be used to identify vulnerable communities in the context of the extraordinary circumstances surrounding the current pandemic, as well as under more ordinary circumstances.","output":"Mental health emergencies and COVID-19: the impact of lockdown in the East Midlands of the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives Migrant workers are one of the most vulnerable population groups during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This study investigated knowledge and awareness of COVID-19 among Indonesian migrant workers (IMWs) in Macao (SAR), Hong Kong (SAR) and Taiwan. Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods Data were collected through an online survey in February and March 2020 to gain information on: (a) participants sociodemographic characteristics; (b) experience and awareness regarding COVID-19 information; and (c) knowledge and understanding of COVID-19. A series of Chi-square, t-test and logistic regression analyses were conducted. Results The survey was completed by 491 participants (92.1% female). Knowledge of COVID-19 was obtained from multiple sources, including a large proportion from online social media. However, participants who obtained information from their employer, local social networks and migrant organisations answered a greater number of questions correctly. One-third of participants reported receiving hoax, fake news and incorrect information, and obtained information from unverified sources. Participants were most interested in information about how to cure COVID-19 and 57.8% knew that no specific drug or vaccine was currently available. Almost all participants correctly identified fever and wearing a facemask as the main COVID-19 symptom and prevention strategy, respectively. Participants with senior high school or higher education and who worked as domestic or care workers had a greater knowledge of COVID-19 than their counterparts. Conclusions Public health communication strategies utilising multiple channels, including employers and community organisations, would help to minimise COVID-19 knowledge gaps.

Cities are considered contagious because they are hubs in (inter)national networks and contain high densities of people. However, the role of the urban and population density in the spread of pathogens is complex and is mediated by the wider bio-social environment. This paper analyses the role of population density in the outbreak of COVID-19 in the densely and highly urbanised context of the Netherlands. It compares the geography of the different phases in the epidemic and assesses when and where density plays a role. Using municipal data on the rate of infections and hospitalisations, this paper reveals that spatial patterns differ substantially in time, which does not appear to be simple diffusion. Using panel regressions, it is demonstrated that population density plays a role in those stages in which containment and mitigation measures were least strict, while in periods of lockdown other factors such as household size are associated with higher infection rates. It concludes that lockdowns may have greater effect in urban areas as key urban elements are temporarily cancelled out.

Herein, we report a droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) platform that can achieve this sensitivity and rapidity without bulky lab-bound equipment. The key technology is a flattened pipette tip with an elliptical cross-section, which extends a high aspect-ratio microfluidic chip design to pipette scale, for rapid (<5 min) generation of several thousand monodispersed droplets a150 to 350 m in size with a CV of a2.3%. A block copolymer surfactant (polyoxyalkylene F127) is used to stabilize these large droplets in oil during thermal cycling. At this droplet size and number, positive droplets can be counted by eye or imaged by a smartphone with appropriate illumination/filtering to accurately quantify up to 100 target copies. We demonstrate with 2019 nCoV-PCR assay LODs of 3.8 copies per 20 L of sample and a dynamic range of 4-100 copies. The ddPCR platform is shown to be inhibitor resistant with spiked saliva samples, suggesting RNA extraction may not be necessary.

METHODS Two observers independently examined the CT images of COVID-19 patients, and the SCT severity score was calculated. The SCT score was calculated as the sum of values ranging from 0 to 4, according to the volumetric rate of involvement for each lung lobe. In quantitative assessment, total lung volume (TLV) was automatically calculated from CT density values between -200 and -950 HU. Besides, healthy lung volume (HLV) was calculated from voxels between -800 and -950 HU. The QCT score was calculated with the following formula: (TLV - HLV / TLV) 100. All patients were clinically divided into four groups: mild, common, severe, and critical. Interobserver agreement for SCT assessment was investigated using the Cohen's Kappa statistics (). Pearson's correlation coefficient was used for the relationship between continuous data. The diagnostic accuracy of SCT and QCT in the differentiation of clinically limited (mild, common) and extensive (severe, critical) disease was investigated using ROC analysis. RESULTS Seventy-six patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 were included. There was good agreement between the two observers in the SCT evaluation of pulmonary disease severity ( = 0.796; 95% CI, 0.751-0.841). A significant correlation was found between QCT and SCT scores (P < 0.001, r = 0.661). Both QCT and SCT scores showed a significant correlation with clinical severity score (P < 0.001, r = 0.620 and P = 0.004, r = 0.529, respectively). The ROC analysis revealed the AUC of QCT and SCT for differentiation of limited and extensive disease as 0.873 (95% CI, 0.774-0.972) and 0.816 (95% CI, 0.673-0.959), respectively. CONCLUSION The QCT assessment is an objective method in the evaluation of COVID-19 severity and is more successful than semiquantitative CT assessment to discriminate extensive from limited disease.","output":"Evaluation of disease severity with quantitative chest CT in COVID-19 patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Such viruses as enteroviruses (hepatitis A may now be included in this group), rotaviruses, parvovirus-like viruses, astroviruses, caliciviruses, adenoviruses and coronaviruses may be detected in human faecal extracts. Although acute poliomyelitis is seldom accounted in developed countries, which now administer polio vaccines routinely to children, poliomyelitis is a still a considerable problem in many developing countries. In parts of India, about 3.4/1000 children have poliovirus induced deformities, infection occurring most commonly in infancy. In temperate climates, outbreaks of echovirus infection occur periodically and although small children are most frequently infected, CNS involvement is reported more commonly in those aged 25-44 years. Although most persons living in developing countries acquire immunity to hepatitis A in childhood, only about 30% of healthy blood donors in the UK have immunity. Unlike infection by hepatitis B virus, hepatitis A virus does not cause post-transfusion hepatitis or outbreaks of hepatitis among haemodialysis patients. Furthermore, hepatitis A does not induce chronic liver disease. Patients with hepatitis A virus are most infectious during the latter part of the incubation period, but once symptoms develop very little virus is present in the faeces. Rotaviruses are the commonest cause of acute non-bacterial gastroenteritis in infancy and childhood. In temperate climates, infection occurs most frequently during winter months and in children aged 6 months to 3 years. Studies in hospital have shown that 40-50% of children admitted with acute diarrhoeal disease are excreting rotavirus, but in winter the proportion may be as high as 70-80%. Rotaviruses have also been shown to cause acute infantile gastroenteritis in developing countries although there is considerable variation in the incidence of rotavirus infection among children in the tropics. Parvovirus-like viruses cause winter vomiting disease and although different serotypes have been identified, approximately 25% of outbreaks appear to be related to Norwalk agent which represents the protype for this group viruses. Astroviruses and caliciviruses may induce acute diarrhoeal disease in childhood but they probably represent relatively minor pathogens.

Both our knowledge on and models to investigate the host and bacterial determinants that drive Mabs pathology in CF patients remain rudimentary. Here, we evaluated whether the lung organoid technology from CF patients is appropriate for modelling Mabs infection and whether antioxidant treatment is a candidate therapeutic approach in the context of CF disease. We derived airway organoids (AOs) from lung biopsy of a CF patient and characterized these AO by assessing CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) function, mucus and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, lipid peroxidation, and cell death. We microinjected smooth (S-) or rough (R-)Mabs in the lumen of AOs to evaluate its fitness, responses of AOs to infection, and treatment efficacy by colony forming unit assay, qPCR and microscopy. We show that CF patient-derived AOs exhibited low residual CFTR function, enhanced mucus accumulation, and increased oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and cell death at basal state. While in AOs, S Mabs formed biofilm, R Mabs formed cord serpentines and displayed a higher virulence. S and R Mabs replicated more efficiently in CF AOs than in AOs derived from healthy lung. Pharmacological activation of antioxidant pathways resulted in better control of Mabs growth. In conclusion, we have established CF patient-derived AOs as a suitable human system to decipher mechanisms of CF-enhanced respiratory infection by Mabs and confirmed antioxidant approaches as a potential host-directed strategy to improve Mabs infection control.","output":"Cystic fibrosis patient-derived bronchial organoids unveil druggable pathways against Mycobacterium abscessus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction La conduite des essais vaccinaux COVID-19 ncessite le recrutement dun nombre important de participants dans un dlai court.

Rather than representing nested types via their Church encodings in a higher-kinded or dependently typed extension of System F, we adopt a functional programming perspective and design a Hindley-Milner-style calculus with primitives for constructing nested types directly as fixpoints. Our calculus can express all nested types appearing in the literature, including truly nested types. At the term level, it supports primitive pattern matching, map functions, and fold combinators for nested types. Our main contribution is the construction of a parametric model for our calculus. This is both delicate and challenging: to ensure the existence of semantic fixpoints interpreting nested types, and thus to establish a suitable Identity Extension Lemma for our calculus, our type system must explicitly track functoriality of types, and cocontinuity conditions on the functors interpreting them must be appropriately threaded throughout the model construction. We prove that our model satisfies an appropriate Abstraction Theorem and verifies all standard consequences of parametricity for primitive nested types.","output":"Parametricity for Primitive Nested Types"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) is an invasive procedure with diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes commonly used in critically ill patients.

Increasing evidences suggest the use of high-flow through nasal cannula (HFNC) over conventional oxygen therapy (COT) in critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF). Indeed, HFNC has a rationale and possible physiologic advantages, even during FOB. However, to date, evidences in favor of HFNC over COT or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or non-invasive ventilation (NIV) during FOB are still weak. Nonetheless, in critically ill patients with hypoxemic ARF, the choice of the oxygenation strategy during a FOB is challenging. Based on a review of the literature, HFNC may be preferred over COT in patients with mild to moderate hypoxemic ARF, without cardiac failure or hemodynamic instability. On the opposite, in critically ill patients with more severe hypoxemic ARF or in the presence of cardiac failure or hemodynamic instability, CPAP or NIV, applied with specifically designed interfaces, may be preferred over HFNC.","output":"Should high-flow through nasal cannula be used during bronchoscopy in critically ill patients with hypoxemic acute respiratory failure?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is the third most common malignancy worldwide. Therefore, it is critically important to identify new useful markers that can be easily obtained in routine practice. Inflammation is a crucial issue in the pathogenesis and development of cancer. AIM: To evaluate the prognostic value of absolute monocyte count, monocyte to lymphocyte ratio (MLR), the combination of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR-PLR), and combined platelet and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLT-NLR) in peripheral blood samples of patients with colorectal cancer undergoing surgery. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 160 patients with colorectal cancer who underwent surgery, and 42 healthy controls. The status of absolute monocyte count, MLR, NLR-PLR and PLT-NLR was calculated on the basis of blood samples obtained before and after surgery. Haematologic factors were examined in correlation with the type of tumour growth, tumour size, histological type, percentage of mucinous component, grade of malignancy, Tumour-Node-Metastasis stage, venous, lymphatic and perineural invasion of cancer cells, status of lymph node invasion and the presence of cancer cell deposits. The Kaplan-Meier method and the long-rank test were used to compare survival curves. To determine independent prognostic factors, univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were applied. RESULTS: The PLT-NLR status was correlated with tumour size and the presence of perineural invasion (P = 0.015; P = -0.174, P = 0.037). Moreover, high NLR-PLR and PLR-NLR ratios in the blood samples obtained after surgery were positively associated with histological type of cancer and percentage of the mucinous component (NLR-PLR: P = 0.002; P = 0.009; PLR-NLR status: P = 0.002; P = 0.007). The analysis of 5-year disease-free survival showed that the MLR of whole blood obtained after surgery [HR = 2.903, 95%CI: (1.368-6.158), P = 0.005] and the status of lymph node metastasis [HR = 0.813, 95%CI: (0.653-1.013), P = 0.050] were independent prognostic factors in colorectal cancer patients.

Deficiency of lysyl hydroxylase 1 (LH1) due to mutations of PLOD1 (procollagen-lysine, 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 1) gene has been identified as the pathogenic cause of kEDS (kEDS-PLOD1). Up to now, kEDS-PLOD1 has not been reported among Chinese population. CASE PRESENTATION: A 17-year-old Chinese male patient presenting with hypotonia, joint hypermobility and scoliosis was referred to our hospital. After birth, he was found to have severe hypotonia leading to delayed motor development. Subsequently, joint hypermobility, kyphoscoliosis and amblyopia were found. Inguinal hernia was found at age 5 years and closed by surgery. At the same time, he presented with hyperextensible and bruisable velvety skin with widened atrophic scarring after minor trauma. Dislocation of elbow joint was noted at age of 6 years. Orthopedic surgery for correction of kyphoscoliosis was performed at age 10 years. His family history was unremarkable. Physical examination revealed elevated blood pressure. Slight facial dysmorphologies including high palate, epicanthal folds, and down-slanting palpebral fissures were found. He also had blue sclerae with normal hearing. X-rays revealed severe degree of scoliosis and osteopenia. The Echocardiography findings were normal. Laboratory examination revealed a slightly elevated bone turnover. Based on the clinical manifestations presented by our patient, kEDS was suspected. Genetic analysis revealed a novel homozygous missense mutation of PLOD1 (c.1697 G > A, p.C566Y), confirming the diagnosis of kEDS-PLOD1. The patient was treated with alfacalcidol and nifedipine. Improved physical strength and normal blood pressure were reported after 12-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first case of kEDS-PLOD1 of Chinese origin. We identified one novel mutation of PLOD1, extending the mutation spectrum of PLOD1. Diagnosis of kEDS-PLOD1 should be considered in patients with congenital hypotonia, progressive kyphoscoliosis, joint hypermobility, and skin hyperextensibility and confirmed by mutation analysis of PLOD1.","output":"The first case report of Kyphoscoliotic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome of chinese origin with a novel PLOD1 gene mutation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is a review of full-length articles strictly concerning subacute thyroiditis (SAT) in relation to the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection (SVI) and COVID-19 vaccine (COV) that were published between the 1st of March 2020 and the 21st of March 2022 in PubMed-indexed journals. A total of 161 cases were reported as follows: 81 cases of SATCSVI (2 retrospective studies, 5 case series, and 29 case reports), 80 respective cases of SATCCOV (1 longitudinal study, 14 case series, 17 case reports; also, 1 prospective study included 12 patients, with 6 patients in each category). To our knowledge, this represents the largest cohort of reported cases until the present time. SATCSVI was detected in adults aged between 18 and 85 years, mostly in middle-aged females. SATCCOVID-19 timing classifies SAT as viral (synchronous with infection, which is an original feature of SATs that usually follow a viral infection) and post-viral (during the recovery period or after infection, usually within 6 to 8 weeks, up to a maximum 24 weeks). The clinical spectrum has two patterns: either that accompanying a severe COVID-19 infection with multi-organ spreading (most frequent with lung involvement) or as an asymptomatic infection, with SAT being the single manifestation or the first presentation. Either way, SAT may remain unrecognized. Some data suggest that more intense neck pain, more frequent fever, and more frequent hypothyroidism at 3 months are identified when compared with non-SATCSVI, but other authors have identified similar presentations and outcomes. Post-COVID-19 fatigue may be due to residual post-SAT hypothyroidism. The practical importance of SATCSVI derives from the fact that thyroid hormone anomalies aggravate the general status of severe infections (particular concerns being tachycardia/arrhythmias, cardiac insufficiency, and ischemic events). If misdiagnosed, SAT results in unnecessary treatment with anti-thyroid drugs or even antibiotics for fever of unknown cause. Once recognized, SAT does not seem to require a particular approach when compared with non-COVID-19 cases, including the need for glucocorticoid therapy and the rate of permanent hypothyroidism. A complete resolution of thyroid hormone anomalies and inflammation is expected, except for cases with persistent hypothyroidism. SATCCOV follows within a few hours to a few weeks, with an average of 2 weeks (no particular pattern is related to the first or second vaccine dose). Pathogenesis includes molecular mimicry and immunoinflammatory anomalies, and some have suggested that this is part of ASIA syndrome (autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants). An alternative hypothesis to vaccine-related increased autoimmunity is vaccine-induced hyperviscosity; however, this is supported by incomplete evidence. From what we know so far concerning the risk factors, a prior episode of non-SVICSAT is not associated with a higher risk of SATCCOV, nor is a previous history of coronavirus infection by itself. Post-vaccine SAT usually has a less severe presentation and a good outcome. Generally, the female sex is prone to developing any type of SAT. HLA susceptibility is probably related to both new types of SATs. The current low level of statistical evidence is expected to change in the future. Practitioners should be aware of SATCCOV, which does not restrict immunization protocols in any case.","output":"The New Entity of Subacute Thyroiditis amid the COVID-19 Pandemic: From Infection to Vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This quantitative study (n = 370) compares the pandemic-related experiences of the family carers of older people living with dementia during the first wave of the pandemic, in two countries with different care regimes: Italy (Mediterranean) and Hungary (Eastern European).

(2) What factors significantly predicted negative changes in these experiences? (3) What were carers main difficulties during the first pandemic wave? Results have shown that carers in both samples reported a worsening in mental health (Italy/Hungary: M = 2.25/2.55, SD = 0.93/0.99), and Italian carers also in general health (M = 2.54, SD = 0.98) (on a scale of 1 to 5, with values under 3 representing deterioration).

In regression models, all of the above negative experiences were predicted by a combination of factors. Two of these factors stood out in importance due to being a predictor of more than one type of negative experience: a decline in the carerCcare receiver relationship, predicting work overload, as well as general and mental health deterioration and being the child of the care receiver, predicting both high worry and subjective work overload.

Both IPA soaking and spraying removed most electrostatic charges on all four electret materials (three commercial and one alternative), causing significant deterioration of filtration efficiency to unacceptable level. The other non-electret alternative material sustained its N95-grade performance after both IPA soaking and spraying treatments, demonstrating the possible application of IPA disinfection for non-electret alternative respirator/mask materials. UVGI preserved the filtration of all three commercially available respirator/mask materials after up to 10 treatments, suggesting it can be a possible decontamination method for hospital and clinic use without compromising respirator/mask performance. The considerations of the practical implementation of this method was discussed. Between the two heat treatment methods tested, dry heat showed better compatibility with electret material by sustaining both filtration efficiency and fit (tested on commercial respirator only), although adding moisture was reported in favor of virus inactivation. Heat treatment is easily accessible method for general publics to implement at home, while it is recommended to maintain the moisture level below saturation. Comparing to size-integrated method, the size-resolved fractional efficiency measurement technique, although more time consuming, proved to be a better method for evaluating respirator/mask filtration performance after decontaminations by providing more sensitive detection of performance degradation and the capability of distinguishing charge loss to other mechanisms causing efficiency deterioration. Detailed descriptions are provided in methodology part to emphasize the cares needed for an appropriate efficiency evaluation. The limited results in this study on worn masks made of alternative sterilization wrap indicated possible performance degradation of electret material caused by normal human wearing activities, suggesting the need of assessing respirator/mask decontamination strategy by testing practically worn-and-decontaminated/reused samples instead of unworn only-decontaminated counterparts.","output":"Evaluation of decontamination methods for commercial and alternative respirator and mask materials C view from filtration aspect"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage is highly infectious and as of April 2021 accounted for 92% of COVID-19 cases in Europe and 59% of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. It is defined by the N501Y mutation in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Spike (S) protein, and a few other mutations.

METHODS: We reviewed the current challenges and determined the potential implications of virtual technologies on modern pathology education for the future of pathology competency learning and assessment. RESULTS & CONCLUSION: The challenges are partly due to transferring from in-person teaching to a virtual education. Other reasons are shifting away from discipline-based teaching to organ-system based in medical curriculum and additional pressures on pathology faculties, such as increased demand for pathology services, lack of time, and learning resources. Keeping the national standards in pathology education even in the constant disruptions from pandemic outbreaks are current challenges. Pathology expertise will need to use emergent technologies in providing educational material to ensure quality pathology education. However, virtualization of pathology education produces a value of digital pathology and web-based pathology training materials. Medical students could review clinical cases remotely with their supervisors and gain the pathology competencies necessary for clinical practice. We need new innovative strategies, and we suggested the following steps to take advantage of the current opportunity to meet the challenges: evaluating the available digital training materials for formal pathology education, investing in the virtual infrastructure for competency-based pathology education, expanding student/residents exposure to pathology educational cases through virtual platforms; applying digital pathology solutions for virtual pathology education.","output":"COVID-19 Impact on Modern Virtual Pathology Education: Challenges and Opportunities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pneumonia outbreak observed in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 evolved into a general multi-system infection.

Furthermore, a meta-regression analysis was performed by using Stata 15.0 to find the potential factors of the high degree of heterogeneity (I2>50%). Sixteen studies have been included, with 1,172 severe patients and 2,803 non-severe patients. Compared with non-severe patients, severe patients were more likely to have the symptoms of dyspnea, hemoptysis, and the complications of ARDS, shock, secondary infection, acute kidney injury, and acute cardiac injury. Interestingly, the former smokers were more prevalent in severe cases as compared to non-severe cases, but there was no difference between the two groups of 'current smokers'. Except for chronic liver disease and chronic kidney disease, the underlying comorbidities of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), malignancy, cerebrovascular disease, and HIV can make the disease worse.

Temperature probes are commonly placed in the nasopharynx in children, but when utilizing an uncuffed endotracheal tube (ETT) with a softly audible leak, ventilated gases from the trachea can escape upwards toward the nasopharynx, thereby potentially causing a cooling effect in the nasopharynx. OBJECTIVES We sought to establish if nasopharyngeal and lower esophageal temperatures are in agreement in children undergoing general anesthesia, both in scenarios of ventilation with a cuffed ETT that has minimal or no leak (cuff up), as well as an ETT with leak (cuff down). METHODS A prospective, crossover agreement study was performed on anesthetized children. Children were intubated with a MicroCuff(?) ETT and had temperature probes inserted into both the nasopharynx and lower esophagus. Under standardized ventilator and gas flow settings, temperatures were recorded with the ETT cuff inflated, and with the cuff deflated. Bland-Altman plots were utilized to assess agreement of temperatures. RESULTS Fifty patients successfully completed this study. The mean difference between esophageal and nasopharyngeal temperature was found to be -0.03C in the presence of minimal or no leak around the ETT (cuff up), with 95% limits of agreement (LOA) of -0.22 to 0.15C. The mean difference between esophageal and nasopharyngeal temperature was found to be 0.1C when a larger leak existed around the ETT (cuff down), with LOA of -0.31 to 0.51C. CONCLUSIONS Nasopharyngeal temperature accurately reflects lower esophageal temperature when there is minimal or no ETT leak. When a larger ETT leak is present, nasopharyngeal temperature is on average 0.1C cooler than lower esophageal temperature. As the nasopharyngeal temperature probe site confers the advantage of simplicity of accurate placement compared to its esophageal counterpart, our findings support the use of nasopharyngeal temperature probes in children ventilated with both cuffed and uncuffed ETTs.","output":"Agreement between lower esophageal and nasopharyngeal temperatures in children ventilated with an endotracheal tube with leak."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A large amount of labelled data (absolute information) is usually needed for an ordinal classifier to attain a good performance.

However, our understanding of pathogen jumps is primarily based around viruses, despite bacteria accounting for the greatest proportion of zoonoses. Because bacterial pathogens in bats (Order: Chiroptera) can have conservation and human health consequences, studies that examine the ecological and evolutionary drivers of bacterial prevalence and barriers to pathogen sharing are crucially needed. We here studied hemotropic Mycoplasma spp. (i.e., hemoplasmas) across a species-rich bat community in Belize over two years. Across 469 bats spanning 33 species, half of individuals and two-thirds of species were hemoplasma positive. Infection prevalence was higher for males and for species with larger body mass and colony sizes. Hemoplasmas displayed high genetic diversity (21 novel genotypes) and strong host specificity. Evolutionary patterns supported co-divergence of bats and bacterial genotypes alongside phylogenetically constrained host shifts. Bat species centrality to the network of shared hemoplasma genotypes was phylogenetically clustered and unrelated to prevalence, further suggesting rarebut detectablebacterial sharing between species. Our study highlights the importance of using fine phylogenetic scales when assessing host specificity and suggests phylogenetic similarity may play a key role in host shifts for not only viruses but also bacteria. Such work more broadly contributes to increasing efforts to understand cross-species transmission and epidemiological consequences of bacterial pathogens.","output":"Ecological and evolutionary drivers of hemoplasma infection and bacterial genotype sharing in a Neotropical bat community"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Insufficient coverage of the area of a possible groin hernia is an important risk factor in hernia recurrence. To prevent recurrence, it is important to use the appropriate mesh size based on the size of the myopectineal orifice (MPO), which is the weak area of the abdominal wall where inguinal hernias occur. We aimed to estimate the appropriate mesh size for groin hernias by investigating MPO size. METHODS: Four hundred and six patients underwent groin hernia repair using a totally extraperitoneal (TEP) approach at the Zeze Hospital between July 2009 and December 2017. We investigated patients' backgrounds, MPO components dimensions, and hernia recurrence, and evaluated the appropriate mesh size. RESULTS: The 359 male and 47 female patients had an average age of 63  15 years. In 171, 147, and 88 cases, hernias were localized to the right, left, and bilaterally, respectively. The number of lateral, medial, femoral, and combined hernias was 317, 124, 11, and 42, respectively. The 95th percentile for the horizontal and vertical lengths in cases of hernia orifice  3 cm were 9.6 cm and 7.0 cm, respectively, while it was 9.2 cm and 6.4 cm in cases of hernia orifice < 3 cm. We added 2 cm and 3 cm to the 95th percentile for the length and width of the MPO, resulting in 13.2  10.4 cm and 15.6  13.0 cm in cases with hernia orifice < 3 cm and  3 cm, respectively. Relapse after TEP occurred in 1 patient (0.2%). CONCLUSION: The appropriate mesh size for TEP repair, derived from intraoperative MPO measurements, was estimated as 13.2  10.4 cm and 15.6  13.0 cm when the hernia orifice was < 3 cm and  3 cm, respectively.

METHODS This retrospective study reviewed the medical records of 390 patients who underwent single-site laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer from January 2010 to December 2016. Antithrombotic drugs were stopped preoperatively and heparin was administered according to the operative risk of each patient, based on consultation with the cardiologist physician or neurosurgeon. Propensity score modeling was utilized to adjust for baseline characteristics. RESULTS Of 390 patients, 29 were treated with standard bridging intravenous heparin therapy. Propensity matching identified 119 patients: 22 patients in the heparinization group and 97 in the control group. The matched groups were not significantly different in operation times, bleeding volumes, or conversion rate. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 17.9 days in the heparinization group and 9.5 days in the control group (p = 0.034). Postoperative bleeding was observed in 4 patients (18.2%) in the heparinization group and 11 patients (11.4%) in the control group (p = 0.646), while other complications were similar in the two study groups (p = 0.502).

In particular, a mechanism of static suspended sand of nano-ZrO2 cross-linker is analyzed by microscopic simulation. The adsorption performance of guar fracturing fluid on the shale surface is also studied for analyzing the environmental pollution and damage of guar gum fracturing fluid to shale reservoirs after cross-linking in this investigation. The results obtained that the inclusion of a small content of nano-ZrO2 cross-linker (0.4%) leads to an apparent increase of fracturing fluid viscosity and decrease in the falling quality of gravel (104 mPas and 0.3 g) compared to the classical cross-linker (63 mPas and 3.5 g). The lower adsorption capacity of guar fracturing fluid containing nano-ZrO2 cross-linker on the shale surface means that it has a weaker pollution ability to the shale reservoir than the commercially available cross-linker. Meanwhile, the grid structure density formed by nano-cross-linker and guar gum is considered to be the key factor to significantly change the suspended sand capacity. The investigation of nano-cross-linker cannot only provide necessary theoretical technology and data support for the stability of water-based fracturing fluid, efficient sand carrying, and the development of water-based fracturing technology, but also effectively protect the underground shale reservoir.","output":"Experimental investigation on the high-pressure sand suspension and adsorption capacity of guar gum fracturing fluid in low-permeability shale reservoirs: factor analysis and mechanism disclosure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT The racial health equity implications of the Trump administration's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

More than 83.2% of the individuals were found to be symptomatic with 9.9% of those required hospitalization. The seropositivity in individuals receiving Covishield (96.7%) was significantly higher than in Covaxin (77.1%). Hospitalized patients were having less median antibody titers than individuals in home isolation. The median age for breakthrough infection among the referred cases was 47.0 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 28.0) with a significantly older age group among Covishield recipients. The median spike receptor binding domain IgG titer values for Covaxin and Covishield recipients were 213.5 AU/ml (IQR: 537.5) and 647.5 AU/ml (IQR: 1645.1), respectively.

We herein studied the field observation and statistical analysis of 10 years data of PM2.5 and selected emitted co-pollutants (CO, NOx, and O3), in the vicinity of three major Canadian airports, with moderate to cold climates. The decadal data analysis indicated that in colder climate airports, pollutants like PM2.5 and CO accumulate disproportionally to their emissions, in fall and winter, in comparison to airports in milder climates. Decadal daily averages and standard errors of PM2.5 concentrations were Vancouver: 5.31  0.017, Toronto: 6.71  0.199, and Montreal: 7.52  0.023 g/m3. The smallest and the coldest airport with least flights/passengers had the highest PM2.5 concentration. QQQ-ICP-MS/MS and HR-S/TEM analysis of snow near Montreal airport indicated a wide range of emerging contaminants (Cd, Mo, Co, As, Ni, Cr, and Pb) ranging from 0.90 to 622 g/L, which were also observed in the atmosphere, hinting air-snow interactions. The concentration of selected emerging contaminants in snow near the Montreal airport were at pare with highly polluted snow samples like Albertas oil sands regions. The mean freezing temperature of snow close to the airport was -6.19  0.06 C, statistically higher than in downtown Montreal (-13.35  0.06 C) hinting to the importance of anthropogenic particles on snow microphysics. During the lockdown a pronounced decrease in the concentrations of PM 2.5 in residential areas close to airports was observed, conforming with the recommended workplace health thresh-holds (~ 2  104 cm-3), while before the lockdown condensed nano-sized particles were above the health limit.

We undertook a systematic review to investigate the effectiveness of the collaborative care model for depression for LEP patients in primary care. METHODS We queried online PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL and EMBASE databases (January 1, 2000, to June 10, 2017) for quantitative studies comparing collaborative care to usual care to treat depression in adults with LEP in primary care. We evaluated the impact of collaborative care on depressive symptoms or on depression treatment. Two reviewers independently extracted key data from the studies and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane bias and quality assessment tool (RCTs) and the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (non-RCTs). RESULTS Of 86 titles identified, 15 were included (representing 9 studies: 5 RCTs, 3 cohort studies, and 1 case-control study). Studies included 4859 participants; 2679 (55%) reported LEP. The majority spoke Spanish (93%). The wide variability in study design and outcome definitions precluded performing a meta-analysis. Follow-up ranged from 3 months to 2 years. Three of four high-quality RCTs reported that 13-25% more patients had improved depressive symptoms when treated with culturally tailored collaborative care compared to usual care; the last had high treatment in the control arm and found equal improvement. Two non-RCT studies suggest that Spanish-speaking patients may benefit as much as, if not more than, English-speaking patients treated with collaborative care. The remaining studies reported increased receipt of preferred depression treatment (therapy vs. antidepressants) in the intervention groups. Eight of nine studies used bilingual providers to deliver the intervention. DISCUSSION While limited by the number and variability of studies, the available research suggests that collaborative care for depression delivered by bilingual providers may be more effective than usual care among patients with LEP. Implementation studies of collaborative care, particularly among Asian and non-Spanish-speakers, are needed.","output":"Collaborative Care for Depression among Patients with Limited English Proficiency: a Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The role of a known contact history in coronavirus disease 2019 severity in secondary cases is unknown. The study was aimed to investigate the relationship between the close contact history and the severity of the disease in coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia. MATERIAL AND METHODS Hospitalized patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia were included. The demo- graphic, clinical, and laboratory data of the patients were collected retrospectively and patients with or without close contact history were analyzed with respect to the severity of pneumonia. RESULTS In a total of 100 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia, 54 (54%) were male and mean age was 42.28 17.13 years. Respiratory rate/min (P = .033) was higher, duration of hospitalization (P = .043) was longer, need for oxygen therapy (P < .001), intensive care unit admission (P = .001), and severe pneumonia (P < .001) were higher in the group without a close contact history (n = 50).

As a result of increasing social pressure, doctors are at high risk for diseases such as \\"sudden death\\" and \\"overwork death\\". It is essential that the physical and mental health of medical staff be assessed and long-term mechanisms be introduced to care for medical staff. This study sought to investigate the health status, work pressure, and occupational environments of medical staff at level A tertiary public hospitals in Shanghai to provide a basis for exploring the establishment of long-term mechanisms for the exquisite and precise care of medical staff. METHODS A questionnaire was administered to employees at 10 level A tertiary public hospitals in Shanghai using a random sampling method; 50 medical staff were surveyed at each hospital. A descriptive analysis of the data was conducted using R language. RESULTS A total of 478 questionnaires were collected; thus, the recovery rate was 95.6%. The analysis revealed that 61% of the medical staff surveyed believed that their health was \\"good,\\" and 57% believed that they were under high pressure. Over 50% of medical staff were moderately satisfied with their practice environment and salary; however, staff's satisfaction evaluations were affected by their academic qualifications (degrees), work positions, and other factors. Reasonable salary is the primary motivating and demotivating factor. CONCLUSIONS The party organization can play a leading role in contacting and serving employees.

Nevertheless, our knowledge and efficacy are quite limited in terms of measuring and evaluating all the variables and components that affect the management of medication adherence regimes as a complex phenomenon. The study aim is mapping the state-of-the-art of medication adherence measurement and assessment methods applied in chronic conditions. Specifically, we are interested in what methods and assessment procedures are currently used to tackle medication adherence. We explore whether Big Data techniques are adopted to improve decision-making procedures regarding patients' adherence, and the possible role of digital technologies in supporting interventions for improving patient adherence and avoiding waste or harm. METHODS A scoping literature review and bibliometric analysis were used. Arksey and O'Malley's framework was adopted to scope the review process, and a bibliometric analysis was applied to observe the evolution of the scientific literature and identify specific characteristics of the related knowledge domain. RESULTS A total of 533 articles were retrieved from the Scopus academic database and selected for the bibliometric analysis. Sixty-one studies were identified and included in the final analysis. The Morisky medication adherence scale (36%) was the most frequently adopted baseline measurement tool, and cardiovascular/hypertension disease, the most investigated illness (38%). Heterogeneous findings emerged from the types of study design and the statistical methodologies used to assess and compare the results.

Combining a phylogenetic approach with the study of contact zones can help to overcome such difficulties. The Podarcis hispanicus species complex has proven to be prosperous in independent evolutionary units, sometimes associated with cryptic diversity. Previous studies have revealed that one of the species of this complex, P. guadarramae, comprises two deeply divergent yet morphologically indistinguishable evolutionary units, currently regarded as subspecies (P. g. guadarramae and P. g. lusitanicus). In this study we used molecular data to address the systematics of the two lineages of Podarcis guadarramae and the closely related P. bocagei. Firstly, we reconstructed the species tree of these three and two additional taxa based on 30 nuclear loci using the multispecies coalescent with and without gene flow. Secondly, we used SNPs obtained from RADseq data to analyze the population structure across the distribution limits P. g. lusitanicus and P. g. guadarramae, and for comparison, a contact zone between P. bocagei and P. g. lusitanicus. Nuclear phylogenetic relationships between these three taxa are clearly difficult to determine due to the influence of gene flow, but our results give little support to the monophyly of P. guadarramae, potentially due to a nearly simultaneous divergence between them. Genetic structure and geographic cline analysis revealed that the two lineages of P. guadarramae replace each other abruptly across the sampled region and that gene flow is geographically restricted, implying the existence of strong reproductive isolation. Podarcis bocagei and P. g. lusitanicus show a similar degree of genetic differentiation and reproductive isolation, with very low levels of admixture in syntopy. These results support that all three forms are equally differentiated and reproductively isolated. In consequence, we conclude that the two former subspecies of Podarcis guadarramae constitute valid, yet cryptic species, that should be referred to as P. lusitanicus and P. guadarramae.","output":"Nuclear phylogenies and genomics of a contact zone establish the species rank of Podarcis lusitanicus (Squamata, Lacertidae)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.3389/fpsyg.2020.588293.].","output":"Corrigendum: Individuals' Self-Reactions Toward COVID-19 Pandemic in Relation to the Awareness of the Disease, and Psychological Hardiness in Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumen La evidencia actual es limitada para determinar el impacto del uso de los inhibidores de la enzima convertidora de angiotensina (IECA) en la predisposicin al empeoramiento de la enfermedad del coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).

Abstract There is limited evidence for determining the impact of the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) in the tendency to worsening of coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19). It was initially reported that, in patients with serious progression of COVID-19, there was an increased mortality in those that had a history of suffering arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease. A proportion of these patients also had in common that they used ACE-I, which alerted the medical community on the potential risk in coexisting with COVID-19. However, in more recent case-control studies, they found that inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system, including ACE-I, does not increase the risk of COVID-19 or require hospital admission due to this cause. Several scientific journals have provided access to preliminary reports, leaving the use of such information at the discretion of the medical and scientific community for promoting the development of studies that might confirm these preclinical and epidemiological findings experimentally. These may finally have an impact on the clinical practice decisions, in order to benefit patients with COVID-19. In this literature review, the different effects mediated by ACE-I that could be related to the immune response during the infection and transmission of COVID-19 are examined, gathering available evidence that evaluates whether, in reality, they represent a risk or if on the other hand, they confer a protector effect.","output":"Uso teraputico de los inhibidores de la enzima convertidora de angiotensina en pacientes con COVID-19: las dos caras de la moneda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The activation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes by mitogens or by triggering the T-cell receptor with anti-CD3 antibodies leads to the production of a potent soluble inhibitory activity against foamy virus-induced cytopathic effects in vitro.

Hence, an effective model to predict VAP in ARDS is urgently needed. METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of patient-level data from the Early versus Delayed Enteral Nutrition (EDEN) of ARDSNet randomized controlled trials. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis established a predictive model, incorporating characteristics selected by systematic review and univariate analyses. The model's discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness were assessed using the C-index, calibration plot, and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: Of the 1000 unique patients enrolled in the EDEN trials, 70 (7%) had ARDS complicated with VAP. Mechanical ventilation duration and intensive care unit (ICU) stay were significantly longer in the VAP group than non-VAP group (Pa? <a? .001 for both) but the 60-day mortality was comparable. Use of neuromuscular blocking agents, severe ARDS, admission for unscheduled surgery, and trauma as primary ARDS causes were independent risk factors for VAP. The area under the curve of the model was .744, and model fit was acceptable (Hosmer-Lemeshow Pa? =a? .185). The calibration curve indicated that the model had proper discrimination and good calibration. DCA showed that the VAP prediction nomogram was clinically useful when an intervention was decided at a VAP probability threshold between 1% and 61%.

METHOD A retrospective review of our prospectively collected database on aneurysms was performed to identify all patients with acute subarachnoid hemorrhage in the setting of bilateral intradural vertebral artery dissections (VAD) encompassing a period from January 2000 and March 2012. RESULT Four patients (M/F = 2/2; mean age, 51.5 years) were identified. In two cases the site of rupture could be identified by angiographic and cross-sectional features; in these patients deconstructive treatment (proximal obliteration or trapping) of the ruptured site and reconstructive treatment of the unruptured site (using stents and coils) were performed. In the patients in whom the site of hemorrhage could not be determined, bilateral reconstructive treatment was performed. No treatment-related complications were encountered.

RESULTS: Fifty-three cases of clinical or laboratory-confirmed botulism were examined in this study. Nineteen patients were confirmed by laboratory data (serotype A (89.5%) and serotype E (10.5%)). In seven cases, the cause of botulism was unclear. In two patients, systemic symptoms emerged after the therapeutic injection of botulinum neurotoxin. The majority of cases (83%) were caused by an obvious food source. In 66% of cases, the initial symptoms emerged within less than 36 h, while in 20.8% of cases, the symptoms developed within or after 36 h; however, in seven patients that their botulism sources were unclear, the onset could not be estimated.

At discharge, we assessed instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) with Lawton's IADL scale, dependence in activities of daily living (ADL) with the Barthel Index, and anxiety with Zung's self-reported anxiety scale. Exposures included comorbidity, smoking, setting (Hubei vs. others), disease severity, symptoms, and length of hospital stay. Other risk factors considered were age, gender, and ethnicity (Han vs. Tibetan). RESULTS: Prevalence of at least one IADL problem was 36.81% (95% CI: 32.39-41.46). ADL dependence was present in 16.44% (95% CI: 13.23-20.23) and 28.70% (95% CI: 24.63-33.15) were screened positive for clinical anxiety.

Neither glucocorticoids nor anticoagulants prescribed at hospital discharge were associated with a lower readmission rate. Patients who were readmitted due to a thrombotic event (8 patients, 13.1%) presented a higher level of D-dimer at discharge of initial admission. CONCLUSION: The rate of readmission after discharge from hospital for COVID-19 was low.

A number of already approved and marketed drugs are being tested for repurposing, including Favipiravir. We aim to investigate the efficacy and safety of Favipiravir in treatment of COVID-19 patients through a systematic review and meta-analysis. This systematic review and meta-analysis were reported in accordance with the PRISMA statement. We registered the protocol in the PROSPERO (CRD42020180032). All clinical trials which addressed the safety and efficacy of Favipiravir in comparison to other control groups for treatment of patients with confirmed infection with SARS-CoV2 were included. We searched electronic databases including LitCovid/PubMed, Scopus, Web of Sciences, Cochrane, and Scientific Information Database up to 31 December 2020. We assessed the risk of bias of the included studies using Cochrane Collaboration criteria. All analyses were performed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software version 2, and the risk ratio index was calculated. Egger and Begg test was used for assessing publication bias. Nine studies were included in our meta-analysis. The results of the meta-analysis revealed a significant clinical improvement in the Favipiravir group versus the control group during seven days after hospitalization (RR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.09C1.41; P = 0.001). Viral clearance was more in 14 days after hospitalization in Favipiravir group than control group, but this finding marginally not significant (RR = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.98C1.25; P = 0.094). Requiring supplemental oxygen therapy in the Favipiravir group was 7% less than the control group, (RR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.67C1.28; P = 0.664). Transferred to ICU and adverse events were not statistically different between two groups. The mortality rate in the Favipiravir group was approximately 30% less than the control group, but this finding not statistically significant. Favipiravir possibly exerted no significant beneficial effect in the term of mortality in the general group of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.

METHODS: A total of 56 health care workers, including 37 nurses and 19 physicians, were recruited to don and doff the PPE recommended by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Operational errors and sites of self-contamination were recorded using UV-fluorescent labeling and video surveillance. RESULTS: Three main errors during donning were identified: choosing a loose-fitting coverall that was difficult to handle; ignoring to inspect the seal of N95 respirator or gloves; and forgetting to pull up the zipper completely. Four main errors during doffing were identified: removing the N95 respirator in a wrong way; touching the scrubs with contaminated hands and elbows; touching contaminated external surfaces of the goggles; and performing insufficient hand hygiene. Key sites that were easily contaminated during the doffing of PPE included left hand and wrist, left lower leg, chest, and left abdomen.

Home food growing has been associated with improved food access and well-being, but it is unknown what role it plays during food supply crises and lockdown. It is also unclear how home food growing and social restrictions may affect opinions about growing food in urban areas (i.e., urban agriculture [UA]). A cross-sectional online survey was conducted during the UK national lockdown in March-April 2020 to measure home food growing, perceived food insecurity, well-being, and opinions of UA. The participants were 477 UK-based adults (369 female, mean age 39.57 years  13.36); 152 participants were engaged in home food growing prior to the pandemic. Responses were compared to data collected from a separate sample of participants before the pandemic ( N = 583) to explore potential shifts in opinions about UA. Participants who engaged in home food growing had lower levels of food insecurity ( U (-)= 19894.50, z = -3.649, p<.001, r = -.167) and higher well-being ( U = 19566.50, z = -3.666, p<.001, r = -.168) than those not engaged in home food growing. Perceived food insecurity partially mediated the relationship between home food growing and well-being; home food growing was associated with less food insecurity, which in turn was associated with better well-being. There were no differences in opinions of UA compared to the sample of participants from before the pandemic. Home food growing may have had a protective effect over perceived food security and well-being in the early stages the pandemic. Opinions of UA were positive and unchanged compared to data collected pre-pandemic.

However, clinical data regarding utilization of the multiplex RT-PCR test for RVs are lacking. METHODS: We investigated the utilization of the multiplex RT-PCR test for RVs at Chung-Ang University Hospital in Seoul, Korea, between January 2012 and April 2013. RESULTS: During the study period, the multiplex RT-PCR test was performed for 291 adult patients. The test frequency was 4.9% of rapid influenza antigen detection tests and 0.8% of respiratory bacterial culture studies. A turnaround time of < 48 hours was observed in 25.9% of positive tests. Most of the tests were performed for admitted patients (97.9%) with a community-acquired infection (84.2%) during the flu season (82.5%). RVs were detected in 81 of 291 cases (27.8%). The RV positivity rates for community- and hospital-acquired infections did not differ (28.6% vs. 23.9%, p = 0.52). Of 166 patients with pneumonia, 44 (26.5%) had a viral infection. Among the patients with RV-associated pneumonia, an RV other than influenza was detected in 20 patients (45.4%). CONCLUSIONS: The multiplex RT-PCR test for RVs was infrequently performed at a tertiary care center, and the test results were often reported late.

Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration is an important trigger in development of atherosclerosis that is associated with Chlamydia pneumoniae (C. pneumoniae) infection. However, the mechanism of VSMC migration remains unclear, and whether antioxidant could be a therapeutic target for C. pneumoniae infection-induced atherosclerosis also remains unknown. The results showed that C. pneumoniae infection mainly impaired mitochondrial function and increased the level of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS). The expressions of protein JunB, Fra-1 and Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP) evidently increased after C. pneumoniae infection, and the interaction between JunB and Fra-1 was also enhanced. After scavenging mtROS by antioxidant Mito-TEMPO, the increasing expressions of JunB, Fra-1, MMP2 and the capacity of VSMC migration induced by C. pneumoniae infection were all inhibited. In comparison with infected ApoE-/- mice, the level of ROS in atherosclerotic lesion in ApoE-/-TLR2-/- mice with C. pneumoniae infection decreased. Knocking out TLR2 suppressed the expressions of JunB, Fra-1 and MMP2 in VSMCs and the formation of atherosclerotic lesion after C. pneumoniae infection. Furthermore, after using small interfering RNA to inhibit the expression of TLR2, the level of mtROS and the expressions of JunB, Fra-1 and MMP2 apparently decreased. Taken together, C. pneumoniae infection may promote VSMC migration and atherosclerosis development by increasing the level of mtROS through TLR2 to activate the JunB-Fra-1/MMP2 signaling pathway. The data provide the first evidence that antioxidant could reduce C. pneumoniae infection-induced VSMC migration and atherosclerosis.","output":"Chlamydia pneumoniae Infection Induces Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell Migration and Atherosclerosis Through Mitochondrial Reactive Oxygen Species-Mediated JunB-Fra-1 Activation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Patients with cancer, both active and previously treated, are at a higher risk of developing severe outcomes from COVID-19. During the pandemic, health care systems (HCS) have adapted the delivery of care, and disparities between private and public systems became even more striking. In Brazil, where 70% of the population depends on the public system, ICU demands largely exceed the capacity in most public centers, whereas in private centers the situation is less challenging. Herein we compare outcomes of patients with cancer and COVID-19 treated in the public and private HCS in Brazil. Methods: We used data from adult patients with solid malignancies who tested positive for COVID-19 and were admitted to two tertiary centers in the state of S?o Paulo. Patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV2 RNA real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were included. We collected data on baseline clinical conditions, cancer and treatment. Patients were classified by HCS: public system (public) versus (vs) private insurance coverage (private). The co-primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and a composite endpoint consisting of intensive-care-unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation or death (ICU-MV-D). Chi-square, Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney U test were used when appropriate. We assessed the association between outcomes and HCS using logistic regression analyses, adjusting for age, sex, current anticancer treatment and comorbidities. Results: From March 16 to October 20 2020, 124 patients were identified. Of those, 90 (72%) were from the public and 34 (28%) from the private HCS. There were no statistical differences in sex, smoking, primary tumor siteand staging between patients from both HCS. Conversely, patients treated in the private system were older [66 (SD 13.8) vs 74 (SD 15.1), p=0.004], had more comorbidities (64.7% vs 37.8% p=0.009), and were on anticancer treatment more frequently (64.7% vs 34.4% p=0.004) compared to public patients. There were no differences in all-cause mortality (public 40% vs private 44.1% p=0.69) between patients treated at the different HCS. Nevertheless, in the composite outcome, private system was significantly associated with increased risk of ICU-MV-D compared to the public system (79.4% and 57.8% p=0.030, respectively). The median time from COVID-19 diagnosis to ICU-MV-D was 13 vs 8 days (p=0.031) and to death was 25 vs 24 days (p=0.24), respectively for public and private HCS patients. In the multivariable logistic regression, HCS was not associated with death [adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=1.16 p=0.75] or ICU-MV-D (aOR=0.55, p=0.27). Conclusion: While patients in the private system were older and had more comorbidities, there were no differences in inpatients all-cause mortality between private and public systems. However, private patients were associated with increased ICU-MV-D. We hypothesize that these findings may reflect disparities in ICU availability, known to be higher in the private system.

We find a negative relationship between COVID-19 disclosure and return volatility, suggesting COVID-19 disclosure reduces investor uncertainty. This reduction effect concentrates mainly during the short window following 10-Q releases and phases out over time. We then detect that the industry-wide COVID-19 disclosure dispersion is positively associated with return volatility, suggesting high variation of industry-wide COVID-19 disclosures reduces information comparability across firms, resulting in increased investor uncertainty. Moreover, we find that COVID-19 disclosures are positively associated with analysts downward earnings forecast revisions and negatively associated with analyst forecast dispersion after 10-Q releases, suggesting the disclosures reduce information risk even for sophisticated market participants. Further analyses show that COVID-19 disclosures are negatively associated with future financial and operational performances (i.e., sales, operating cash flow, operating income, and ROA). Lastly, we find that the low readability of COVID-19 disclosure attenuates the negative relation between COVID-19 disclosure and market volatility.

The aim of this study was to examine the associations between self-reported age at first drink and age at first alcohol intoxication with the risk of death by age 30. METHODS The sample (n = 6564; 49.1% males) included all participants of the Northern Finland Birth Cohort Study 1986 (NFBC1986) for whom the two measures of adolescent drinking were available. Self-reported age at onset of first drink and first alcohol intoxication were analyzed along with background variables and data regarding subsequent psychiatric diagnoses. Adolescents were dichotomized into those reporting age at first drink and age at first intoxication before or after age 14. Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for death by age 30. RESULTS By the age of 30, 0.7% (n = 47) of all 6564 participants were deceased. In the multivariable models, male gender and a history of illicit substance use in adolescence were associated with both all-cause mortality and mortality due to accidents or suicide. After controlling for confounding variables, age at first alcohol intoxication was associated with all-cause mortality (HR 2.33; 95% CI 1.04-5.20) as well as death due to accidents or suicide (HR 2.99; 95% CI 1.11-8.05).

Shelters used for this purpose usually accommodate a large number of flood evacuees for a temporary period. Floods during a pandemic result in a compound hazard. Evacuations under such situations are difficult to plan as social distancing is nearly impossible in the highly crowded shelters. This results in a multi-objective problem with conflicting objectives of maximizing the number of evacuees from flood-prone regions and minimizing the number of infections at the end of the shelter's stay. To the best of our knowledge, such a problem is yet to be explored in literature. Here we develop a simulation-optimization framework, where multiple objectives are handled with a max-min approach. The simulation model consists of an extended Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Susceptible model. We apply the proposed model to the flood-prone Jagatsinghpur district in the state of Odisha, India. We find that the proposed approach can provide an estimate of people required to be evacuated from individual flood-prone villages to reduce flood hazards during the pandemic. At the same time, this does not result in an uncontrolled number of new infections.

To improve public health preparedness, we sought to predict which existing amino acid mutations in SARS-CoV-2 might contribute to future variants of concern. We tested the predictive value of features comprising epidemiology, evolution, immunology, and neural network-based protein sequence modeling, and identified primary biological drivers of SARS-CoV-2 intra-pandemic evolution. We found evidence that ACE2-mediated transmissibility and resistance to population-level host immunity has waxed and waned as a primary driver of SARS-CoV-2 evolution over time. We retroactively identified with high accuracy (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve, AUROC=0.92-0.97) mutations that will spread, at up to four months in advance, across different phases of the pandemic. The behavior of the model was consistent with a plausible causal structure wherein epidemiological covariates combine the effects of diverse and shifting drivers of viral fitness. We applied our model to forecast mutations that will spread in the future and characterize how these mutations affect the binding of therapeutic antibodies. These findings demonstrate that it is possible to forecast the driver mutations that could appear in emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. We validate this result against Omicron, showing elevated predictive scores for its component mutations prior to emergence, and rapid score increase across daily forecasts during emergence.

However, this strategy is not curative, and many unanswered questions remain regarding the optimization of lenalidomide-based maintenance therapy. AREAS COVERED In this review, we evaluate the current data supporting the use of lenalidomide maintenance, either alone or in combination, following ASCT. We provide an overview of the management of lenalidomide-associated toxicities as well as address the unresolved topics of optimal treatment duration and use of minimal residual disease assessment. EXPERT OPINION While single agent lenalidomide maintenance is a current standard of care, a one-size-fits all approach to maintenance therapy is not optimal. The rapidly evolving landscape of multiple myeloma therapy in conjunction with ongoing clinical trials, should enable a future where an individualized approach based on disease characteristics, response to induction and ASCT (or even non-ASCT consolidation approaches such as CAR T-cell therapy or bispecific antibodies), as well as patient preferences will influence the use of lenalidomide maintenance.","output":"The era of lenalidomide maintenance therapy in multiple myeloma: settings for achieving best outcomes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Antenatal depression has become a common and serious problem, significantly affecting maternal and fetal health. However, evaluation and intervention methods for pregnant women in obstetric clinics are inadequate. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for depression among all pregnant women at their first attending antenatal care in the obstetrics clinic, a comprehensive teaching hospital, southwest of China. METHODS: From June to December 2019, 5780 pregnant women completed online psychological assessments, and data from 5728 of the women were analyzed. The women were categorized into two groups according to the presence or absence of depression. Depression was assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), with a cutoff point of 10 for depression. Anxiety and somatic symptoms were measured by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15), respectively. Univariate analysis and binary logistic regression analysis were used to determine the association among antenatal depression, anxiety, somatic symptoms and participants characteristics. RESULTS: The prevalence of antenatal depression among all the pregnant women at their first attending antenatal care was 16.3%, higher in the first trimester (18.1%). Anxiety symptoms (Mild anxiety AOR = 2.937; 95% CI: 2.448C3.524) and somatic symptoms (Mild somatic symptoms AOR = 3.938; 95% CI: 2.888C3.368) were major risk factors for antenatal depression among women and the risk increased more with the anxiety level or somatic symptoms level. Gestational weeks (second trimester AOR = 0.611; 95% CI: 0.483C0.773; third trimester AOR = 0.337; 95% CI: 0.228C0.498) and urban residence (AOR = 0.786; 95% CI: 0.652C0.947) were protective factors for antenatal depression among women. CONCLUSIONS: About one in six pregnant women would experience depression, and special attention should be paid to some risk factors (i.e., early pregnancy, anxiety symptoms, somatic symptoms, rural residence). Online psychological assessments might be a time-saving and convenient screening method for pregnant women in obstetric clinics.","output":"The prevalence of and factors associated with antenatal depression among all pregnant women first attending antenatal care: a cross-sectional study in a comprehensive teaching hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The end of the Transition Period following the UKs exit from the European Union and COVID-19 are major catalysts for the Competition and Markets Authoritys future work, including in the fields of merger control and antitrust enforcement.

Biogas-AD produced, represents a useful source of green energy, while its by-product (digestate) is a waste, that needs to be safely disposal. The sustainability of anaerobic digestion plants partly depends on the management of their digestion residues. This study has been focused on the environmental and economic benefits of co-digest recalcitrant agricultural wastes such olive wastes and citrus pulp, in combination with livestock wastes, straw and cheese whey for biogas production. The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of two different bioenergy by-products on soil carbon stock, enzymes involved in nutrient cycling and microbial content. The two digestates were obtained from two plants differently fed: the first plant (Uliva) was powered with 60% of recalcitrant agricultural wastes, and 40% of livestock manure milk serum and maize silage. The second one (Fattoria) was fed with 40% of recalcitrant agricultural wastes and 60% of livestock manure, milk serum and maize silage. Each digestate, separated in liquid and solid fractions, was added to the soil at different concentrations. Our results evidenced that mixing and type of input feedstock affected the composition of digestates. Three months after treatments, our results showed that changes in soil chemical and biochemical characteristics depended on the source of digestate, the type of fraction and the concentration used. The mainly affected soil parameters were: Soil Organic Matter (SOM), Microbial Biomass Carbon (MBC), Fluorescein Diacetate Hydrolysis (FDA), Water Soluble Phenol (WSP) and Catalase (CAT) that can be used to assess the digestate agronomical feasibility. These results show that the agronomic quality of a digestate is strictly dependent on percentage and type of feedstocks that will be used to power the digester.","output":"Anaerobic co-digestion of recalcitrant agricultural wastes: Characterizing of biochemical parameters of digestate and its impacts on soil ecosystem."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION There is increasing concern among hospital personnel about potential secondary exposure when treating chemically contaminated patients. OBJECTIVE To assess which circumstances and chemicals require the use of Level C Personal Protective Equipment (chemical splash suit and air-purifying respirator), to prevent secondary contamination of hospital personnel treating a chemically contaminated patient. METHODS The US National Library of Medicine PubMed database was searched for the years 1985 to 2020 utilizing combinations of relevant search terms. This yielded 557 papers which were reviewed by title and abstract. After excluding papers on biological or radiological agents, or those not related to hospital personnel, 38 papers on chemicals remained. After a full-text review, 13 papers without an in-depth discussion on the risk for secondary contamination were omitted, leaving 25 papers for review. The references of these papers were searched and this yielded another seven additional citations, bringing the total to 32 papers. INCIDENCE OF SECONDARY TOXICITY Secondary toxicity in hospital personnel is rare: a large-scale inventory of 120,000 chemical incidents identified only nine cases, an occurrence of 0.0075%. SKIN CONTACT AS A SECONDARY EXPOSURE ROUTE Skin exposure is rare under normal hygienic working conditions, reflected by the very small number of cases reported in the literature: two cases with corrosive effects due to unprotected contact and one case of presumed skin absorption. INHALATION AS A SECONDARY EXPOSURE ROUTE Most case reports described secondary toxicity as a result of inhalation. The chemicals involved were irritating solid particles (capsaicin spray/CS), toxic gases formed in the stomach of patients (arsine/hydrazoic acid/phosphine) and vapours from volatile liquids (solvents). FEATURES OF SECONDARY TOXICITY Reported symptoms after secondary inhalation were generally mild and reversible (mostly irritation of eyes and respiratory tract, nausea, headache, dizziness/light-headedness) and did not require treatment. In many cases, special circumstances increased exposure: treatment/decontamination of multiple patients, regurgitation of the chemical agent from the stomach, or inadequate room ventilation. USE OF MORE THAN STANDARD PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT Normal hygienic precautions prevent direct skin contact from exposure to common chemical agents. When solid particle contamination is extensive, a mask and eye protection should be applied. Splash proof outer clothing (splash suit) and eye protection is preferred if (partial) wet decontamination is performed on single patients. Adequate ventilation, careful removal of clothing in case of solid particles contamination and adequate disposal of gastric content reduces exposure. Hospital staff can be rotated if symptoms occur, which can be odour-mediated. The use of more elaborate personal protective equipment with an air-purifying respirator (Level C) is only necessary in exceptional cases of contamination with highly toxic volatile chemicals (e.g., sarin). It should also be considered when decontaminating a large number of patients. CONCLUSIONS The risk of secondary contamination and subsequent toxicity in hospital personnel decontaminating or treating chemically contaminated patients is small. Normal hygienic precautions (gloves and water-resistant gown) will adequately protect hospital staff when treating the majority of chemically contaminated patients. More extensive protection is only necessary infrequently and there is no reason to delay critical care, even if more elaborate protection is not immediately available.","output":"Is secondary chemical exposure of hospital personnel of clinical importance?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Between March and May 2020, Japan experienced a lockdown due to the COVID-19 crisis.

A black yeast Aureobasidium pullulans AFO 202 strain produced beta 1,3 1,6 glucan has been reported to offer potential immune enhancement and metabolism balancing, as well as mitigation of coagulopathy risks. The N 163 strain produced beta glucan is an efficient anti-inflammatory immune modulator. In this pilot clinical study, we report the beneficial effects of these two beta glucans on the biomarkers for cytokine storm and coagulopathy in COVID-19 patients. Methods: A total of 24 RT PCR positive COVID 19 patients were recruited (Age range: 18~62; 17 males and 7 females). Patients were randomly divided into three groups (Gr): Gr. 1 control (n=8); Gr. 2: AFO-202 beta glucan (n=8); and Gr. 3, a combination of AFO-202 and N-163 beta glucans (n=8). All three groups received the standard care while groups 2 and 3 received additional supplementation of beta glucans for 30 days. In addition to basic clinical parameters, we periodically evaluated D Dimer, IL6, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C reactive protein (CRP), the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), the lymphocyte to CRP ratio (LCR) and the leukocyte CRP ratio (LeCR). Results: The duration of hospital stay for all three groups was nearly equivalent. There was no mortality of the subjects in any of the groups. Intermittent oxygen was administered from day of admission for up to four to five days with mask (two to four Lpm) to two subjects in Gr. 2 and one subject in Gr. 3. None of the subjects required ventilation. The D Dimer values in Gr. 1, which was on average 751 ng/ml at baseline, decreased to 143.89 ng/ml on day 15, but increased to 202.5 ng/ml on day 30, which in groups 2 and 3 decreased on day 15 and continued to remain at normal levels until day 30. IL6 levels decreased on day 15 from an average of 7.395 pg/ml to 3.16 pg/ml in the control, 26.18 pg/ml to 6.94 pg/ml in Gr. 2 and 6.25 pg/ml to 5.22 pg/ml in Gr. 3. However, when measured on day 30, in Gr. 1, the IL-6 increased to 55.37 pg/ml while there was only slight marginal increase in Gr. 2 but within normal range, and the levels further decreased to less than 0.5 pg/ml in Gr. 3. The same trend was observed with ESR. LCR and LeCR increased significantly in Gr. 3. NLR decreased significantly in groups 2 and 3. There was no difference in CRP within the groups. Conclusion: In this exploratory study, consumption of Aureobasidium pullulans produced beta glucans for thirty days, results in a significant control of IL6, D Dimer and NLR, a significant increase in LCR, LeCR and marginal control of ESR in COVID 19 patients. As these beta glucans are well known food supplements with decades of a track record for safety, based on these results, we recommend larger multi-centric clinical studies to validate their use as an adjunct in the management of COVID-19 and the ensuing long COVID-19 syndrome.","output":"Beneficial Effects of novel Aureobasidium Pullulans strains produced Beta-1,3-1,6 Glucans on Interleukin-6 and D-Dimer levels in COVID-19 patients; results of a randomized multiple-arm pilot clinical study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Despite the effective scale-up of HIV testing and treatment programs, only 75% of people living with HIV (PLWH) globally know their status, and this rate is lower among men. This highlights the importance of implementing HIV testing and linkage interventions with a high uptake in this population. In a cluster randomized controlled trial conducted in Kenya between 2013 and 2015, we found that assisted partner services (APS) for HIV-exposed partners of newly diagnosed PLWH safely reached more HIV-exposed individuals with HIV testing compared with client referral alone. However, more data are needed to evaluate APS implementation in a real-world setting. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness, acceptability, fidelity, and cost of APS when integrated into existing HIV testing services (HTS) in Western Kenya. METHODS: Our study team from the University of Washington and PATH is integrating APS into 31 health facilities in Western Kenya. We are enrolling females newly diagnosed with HIV (index clients) who consent to receiving APS, their male sexual partners, and female sexual partners of male sexual partners who tested HIV positive. Female index clients and sexual partners testing HIV positive will be followed up at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months postenrollment to assess linkage to care, antiretroviral therapy initiation, and HIV viral load suppression. We will evaluate the acceptability, fidelity, and cost of real-world implementation of APS via in-depth interviews conducted with national, county, and subcounty-level policy makers responsible for HTS. Facility health staff providing HTS and APS, in addition to staff working with the study project team, will also be interviewed. We will also conduct direct observations of facility infrastructure and clinical procedures and extract data from the facilities and county and national databases. RESULTS: As of March 2020, we have recruited 1724 female index clients, 3201 male partners, and 1585 female partners. We have completed study recruitment as well as 6-week (2936/2973, 98.75%), 6-month (1596/1641, 97.25%), and 12-month (725/797, 90.9%) follow-up visits. Preliminary analyses show that facilities scaling up APS identify approximately 12-18 new HIV-positive males for every 100 men contacted and tested. We are currently completing the remaining follow-up interviews and incorporating an HIV self-testing component into the study in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The results will help bridge the gap between clinical research findings and real-world practice and provide guidance regarding optimal strategies for APS integration into routine HIV service delivery.

This condition could potentially involve all organs with main complications concerning cardiovascular system. Despite up to 90% of patients complain gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomit, and diarrhea), a presentation mimicking acute appendicitis has rarely been reported, and can be the presenting feature of the disease, potentially leading to misdiagnosis and delayed treatment. Case Description A 15-year-old boy presented to the Emergency Department for a 2-day history of fever, vomiting, and mild abdominal pain. One month before, the patient complained ageusia and anosmia while his mother tested positive for Sars-CoV2 nasopharyngeal swab. At admission, laboratory tests showed leukocytosis with lymphopenia and elevation of inflammatory markers, while cardiac enzymes, electrocardiogram and echocardiography were unremarkable. An abdominal ultrasound displayed a thickening of terminal ileus and cecum with ascites. Because of the worsening abdominal pain and a physical examination suggestive of acute appendicitis, a laparoscopy was performed but no surgical condition was found. After surgery, fever and generalized malaise persisted, so a cardiac evaluation was repeated, showing a relevant increase in inflammatory markers and cardiac enzymes. Electrocardiogram demonstrated a QTc prolongation with mild decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction at echocardiogram. A MIS-C was diagnosed and intravenous immunoglobulin along with a steroid treatment started. After 36 h, the patient presented a complete clinical recovery with fever cessation. Cardiac anomalies normalized in 3 weeks. Conclusion MIS-C has been defined as a systemic inflammation, involving at least two organs, after a previous SARS-CoV2 infection in children and adolescents. Physicians should be aware that while gastrointestinal manifestations are common, a pseudo appendicitis presentation may also occur, leading to misdiagnosis and delayed treatment. This report suggests that in patients with symptoms suggestive of an acute appendicitis, the presence of lymphopenia, hypoalbuminemia and ultrasound images of terminal ileus inflammation, should raise the suspect for MIS-C even without initial overt signs of cardiac involvement.","output":"Case Report: Simil-Appendicitis Presentation May Precede Cardiac Involvement in MIS-C Patient"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Several drugs are being repurposed for the treatment of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic based on in vitro or early clinical findings. As these drugs are being used in varied regimens and dosages, it is important to enable synthesis of existing safety data from clinical trials. However, availability of safety information is limited by a lack of timely reporting of overall clinical trial results on public registries or through academic publication. We aimed to analyse the evidence gap in this data by conducting a rapid review of results posting on ClinicalTrials.gov and in academic publications to quantify the number of trials missing results for drugs potentially being repurposed for COVID-19. METHODS: ClinicalTrials.gov was searched for 19 drugs that have been identified as potential treatments for COVID-19. Relevant clinical trials for any prior indication were listed by identifier (NCT number) and checked for results and for timely result reporting (within 395 days of the primary completion date). Additionally, PubMed and Google Scholar were searched to identify publications of results not listed on the registry. A second, blinded search of 10% of trials was conducted to assess reviewer concordance. RESULTS: Of 3754 completed trials, 1516 (40.4%) did not post results on ClinicalTrials.gov or in the academic literature. Tabular results were available on ClinicalTrials.gov for 1172 (31.2%) completed trials. A further 1066 (28.4%) had published results in the academic literature, but did not report results on ClinicalTrials.gov. Key drugs missing clinical trial results include hydroxychloroquine (37.0% completed trials unreported), favipiravir (77.8%) and lopinavir (40.5%). CONCLUSIONS: There is an important evidence gap for the safety of drugs being repurposed for COVID-19. This uncertainty could cause unnecessary additional morbidity and mortality during the pandemic.

Long-term data provided by the monitoring networks revealed that the deposition of sulfur and nitrogen compounds in this area has stabilized since around 2010; in 2020, however, both concentrations and deposition were significantly below the average values of the previous decade for SO(4) and NO(3). Less evident changes were observed for NH(4) and base cation. The estimated decrease of deposition in 2020 with respect to the previous decade was on average ? 54% and ? 46% for SO(4) and NO(3), respectively. The lower deposition of SO(4) and NO(3) recorded in 2020 was caused by the sharp decrease of SO(2) and particularly of NO(x) air concentrations mainly due to the mobility restrictions consequent to the COVID-19 lockdown. The limited effects on NH(4) deposition can be explained by the fact that NH(3) emission was not affected by the lockdown, being mainly related to agricultural activities. A widespread response to the decreased deposition of S and N compounds was observed in a group of pristine freshwater sites, with NO(3) concentrations in 2020 clearly below the long-term average. The rapid chemical recovery observed at freshwater sites in response to the sharp decrease of deposition put in evidence the high resilience potential of freshwater ecosystems in pristine regions and demonstrated the great potential of emission reduction policy in producing further substantial ameliorations of the water quality at sensitive sites.

Lung injury causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) appears to be a most dreaded complication occurring in 30%. Older patients with cardiovascular (CV) comorbidities and ARDS have an increased mortality. Although the precise mechanisms involved in the development of lung injury have not been fully elucidated, the role of the extended renin-angiotensin system (RAS) appears to be pivotal. In this context, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an ACE homologue, has been recognized as a facilitator of viral entry into the host, albeit its involvement in other counter-regulatory effects, such as converting angiotensin (Ang) II into Ang 1-7 with its known protective actions. Thus, concern was raised that the use of RAS inhibitors by increasing ACE2 expression may enhance patient susceptibility to the COVID virus. However, current data have appeased such concerns as there has been no clinical evidence of a harmful effect of these agents as based on observational studies. However, properly designed future studies will be needed to further confirm or refute current evidence. Furthermore, other pathways may also play important roles in COVID-19 transmission and pathogenesis; spike (S) protein proteases facilitate viral transmission by cleaving S protein that promotes viral entry into the host; neprilysin (NEP), a neutral endopeptidase known to cleave natriuretic peptides, degrades Ang I into Ang 1-7; NEP can also catabolize bradykinin and thus mitigate bradykinin's role in inflammation, while, in the same context, specific bradykinin inhibitors might also negate bradykinin's harmful effects. Based on these intricate mechanisms, various preventive and therapeutic strategies may be devised, such as upregulating ACE2 and/or using recombinant ACE2, and exploiting the NEP, bradykinin and serine protease pathways, in addition to anti-inflammatory and antiviral therapies.

In this study, we describe the heterogeneity in water service satisfaction and WASH access in low-income, peri-urban neighborhoods of Beira, Mozambique, and examine whether this heterogeneity can be explained by distance to water distribution mains. Using spatial statistics and regression analyses, we identified statistical spatial heterogeneity in household WASH access, as well as consumer-reported satisfaction with water services (services, pressure, quality, and sufficient quantity). We found that as distance from the water main increased, both access to an improved water source at the household and satisfaction with water pressure decreased, controlling for household density and socioeconomic status. The odds of a household having access to a water source at the household or on the compound decreased with every 100-meter increase in distance from a water main pipe (odds ratio [OR] 0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.82, 0.92). Satisfaction with water services also decreased with every 100-meter increase in distance from a water main pipe (OR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.69, 0.94).

Due to their unique working conditions, nursing is counted among the occupational groups at high risk for developing depression. Because of the shortage of nursing resources in China, Chinese nurses suffer from heavy daily workloads more than those in many other countries. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the overall prevalence of depressive symptoms and analyse the potential risk factors of depressive symptoms in Chinese nurses. METHODS: A systematic literature search in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Chinese BioMedical Literature Database (CBM), the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and the Weipu and Wanfang databases up to Dec 31st, 2019 was performed regarding the prevalence of depressive symptoms in Chinese nurses. Eligibility assessment and data extraction were performed independently by 2 researchers, and meta-analysis was used to synthesize the data. Heterogeneity was evaluated using Cochrans Q test and quantified using the I(2) statistic. To explore the potential source of heterogeneity, subgroup analyses were also performed. In addition, both funnel plot and Eggers tests were adopted to assess publication bias. RESULTS: A total of 102 studies published from 1996 to 2019 covering 22 provinces were included for further analysis. The total number of participants was 52,592, with a range of 46 to 7205 per study. The overall prevalence of depressive symptoms in Chinese nurses was 43.83% (95%CI: 40.26%-47.42%), and 31.12% (95%CI: 27.30%-35.07%) were classified as mild degrees of depressive symptoms. The prevalence of depressive symptoms may be significantly affected by region, province or municipality and department marital status. Moreover, an increasing trend in the prevalence of depressive symptoms was observed in recent years. CONCLUSION: The results presented a high prevalence of depressive symptoms among Chinese nurses, which suggests interventional programmes by health decision-makers to improving the mental state of nurses is needed urgently, especially in nurses with high risk factors for depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the nationwide investigation of depressive symptoms prevalence should be performed with a standard diagnostic tool, which may be more useful for policy makers and planners.","output":"Prevalence of depressive symptoms among nurses in China: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 genetic material has been detected in raw wastewater around the world throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and has served as a useful tool for monitoring community levels of SARS-CoV-2 infections. SARS-CoV-2 genetic material is highly detectable in a patient feces and the household wastewater for several days before and after a positive COVID-19 qPCR test from throat or sputum samples. Here, we characterize genetic material collected from raw wastewater samples and determine recovery efficiency during a concentration process. We find that pasteurization of raw wastewater samples did not reduce SARS-CoV-2 signal if RNA is extracted immediately after pasteurization. On the contrary, we find that signal decreased by approximately half when RNA was extracted 24-36 hours post-pasteurization and ~90% when freeze-thawed prior to concentration. As a matrix control, we use an engineered enveloped RNA virus. Surprisingly, after concentration, the recovery of SARS-CoV-2 signal is consistently higher than the recovery of the control virus leading us to question the nature of the SARS-CoV-2 genetic material detected in wastewater. We see no significant difference in signal after different 24-hour temperature changes; however, treatment with detergent decreases signal ~100-fold. Furthermore, the density of the samples is comparable to enveloped retrovirus particles, yet, interestingly, when raw wastewater samples were used to inoculate cells, no cytopathic effects were seen indicating that wastewater samples do not contain infectious SARS-CoV-2. Together, this suggests that wastewater contains fully intact enveloped particles.","output":"Characterization of SARS-CoV-2 Genetic Material in Wastewater"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the beginning of the year, the deadly coronavirus pandemic, better known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), brought the entire world to an unprecedented halt.

This review attempts to provide a comprehensive overview of the COVID-19 research in India including design aspects, through the clinical trials registered in the Clinical Trials Registry - India (CTRI) till June 5, 2020. One hundred and twenty two registered trials on COVID-19 were extracted from the CTRI database. These trials were categorized into modern medicine (n=42), traditional medicine (n=67) and miscellaneous (n=13). Of the 42 modern medicine trials, 28 were on repurposed drugs, used singly (n=24) or in combination (n=4). Of these 28 trials, 23 were to evaluate their therapeutic efficacy in different severities of the disease. There were nine registered trials on cell- and plasma-based therapies, two phytopharmaceutical trials and three vaccine trials. The traditional medicine trials category majorly comprised Ayurveda (n=45), followed by homeopathy (n=14) and others (n=8) from Yoga, Siddha and Unani. Among the traditional medicine category, 31 trials were prophylactic and 36 were therapeutic, mostly conducted on asymptomatic or mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients.

Since the announcement of this public health emergency, several diagnostic methods have been developed including molecular and serological assays, and more recently biosensors. Here, we present the use of these assays as well as their main technical features, advantages, and limits. Key Messages: The development of reliable diagnostic assays is crucial not only for a correct diagnosis and containment of COVID-19 pandemic, but also for the decision-making process that is behind the clinical decisions, eventually contributing to the improvement of patient management. Furthermore, with the advent of vaccine and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, serological assays will be instrumental for the validation of these new therapeutic options.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Infection and the COVID-19 Pandemic Emergency: The Importance of Diagnostic Methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This study aims to investigate inequalities in leisure-time physical activity (PA) practice amid the COVID-19 pandemic in a southern Brazilian city.

RESULTS: The sample is composed of 1556 individuals (66.1% female). Overall, between rounds 1 and 2, PA prevalence declined, followed by a gradual increase thereafter. PA practice during the pandemic was higher among men, individuals with higher education level, and individuals with white skin color in all rounds. In rounds 2, 3, and 4, PA was lower among individuals who were practicing more social distancing. CONCLUSION: To tackle the PA inequalities, policymakers and stakeholders need to confront disparities, defending greater availability of public policies that are attentive to inequalities, especially regarding gender, skin color, and educational level, to promote PA as a human right.","output":"Inequalities in Physical Activity During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Report on 4 Consecutive Population-Based Surveys in Southern Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A coronavirus (covid-19) epidemic which started in Wuhan (China) spread fastly on several continents, turning into a pandemic then into a health crisis, disrupting the global balance This viral infectious disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 strain, induces as most frequent symptoms: respiratory discomfort and acute respiratory distress syndrome leading to death In the absence of medicines or vaccines against this virus, aromatic and medicinal plants constitute an alternative to relieve the severe respiratory infections associated with the COVID 19 pandemic Hence, this study aims to enumerate and describe some efficient aromatic and medicinal plants that can be used against this virus Required studies on acute and chronic respiratory infections and effective medicinal and aromatic plants were searched in the most famous scientific databases;by using specific, well-targeted keywords The search was limited to publications in English and French Covid 19 is mainly due to acute and chronic respiratory infections by the new coronavirus strain;which could be alleviated by using the alternative of medicinal and aromatic plants in the absence of treatment and vaccine to prevent this pandemic This study enabled to identify the effectiveness of some plants such as Quinquina, Eucalyptus, Thyme, Artemisia etc Moreover, several components of these plants have shown wonderful results in the fight against this virus According to published research, it can be said that medicinal and aromatic plants can be effective in reducing and preventing the risk of contamination as well as in treating some Covid 19 symptoms","output":"Prevention of COVID 19 by aromatic and medicinal plants: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Older adults have been disproportionately affected during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, including higher risk of severe disease and long-COVID. Prior exposure to endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) may modulate the response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and contribute to age-related observations. We hypothesized that cross-reactive antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are associated with antibodies to HCoV and that both increase with age. METHODS: To assess SARS-CoV-2 unexposed individuals, we drew upon archived anonymized residual sero-surveys conducted in British Columbia (BC), Canada, including before SARS-CoV-2 emergence (May, 2013) and before widespread community circulation in BC (May, 2020). Fifty sera, sex-balanced per ten-year age band, were sought among individuals 10 to 80 years old, supplemented as indicated by sera from March and September 2020. Sera were tested on the Meso Scale Diagnostics (MSD) electrochemiluminescent multiplex immunoassay to quantify IgG antibody against the Spike proteins of HCoV, including alpha (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63) and beta (HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43) viruses, and the 2003 epidemic beta coronavirus, SARS-CoV-1. Cross-reactive antibodies to Spike, Nucleocapsid, and the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 were similarly measured, with SARS-CoV-2 sero-positivity overall defined by positivity on 2 targets. RESULTS: Samples included 407 sera from 2013, of which 17 were children 10 years. The 2020 samples included 488 sera, of which 88 were children 10 years. Anti-Spike antibodies to all four endemic HCoV were acquired by 10 years of age. There were 20/407 (5%) sera in 2013 and 8/488 (2%) in 2020 that were considered sero-positive for SARS-CoV-2 based on MSD testing. Of note, antibody to the single SARS-CoV-2 RBD target was detected in 329/407 (81%) of 2013 sera and 91/488 (19%) of 2020 sera. Among the SARS-CoV-2 overall sero-negative population, age was correlated with anti-HCoV antibody levels and these, notably 229E and HKU1, were correlated with cross-reactive anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD titres. SARS-CoV-2 overall sero-positive individuals showed higher titres to HCoV more generally. CONCLUSION: Most people have an HCoV priming exposure by 10 years of age and IgG levels are stable thereafter. Anti-HCoV antibodies can cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 epitopes.

We examined the following COVID-19 outcomes within federal penitentiaries and contrasted them with the overall population in the penitentiaries' respective provincial jurisdictions: testing, prevalence, the proportion recovered, and fatality. Methods: Data for prisons were obtained from the Correctional Service of Canada and, for the general population, from COVID-19 Esri Canadian Outbreak Tracking Hub. Data were retrieved between March 30 and April 21, 2020, and are accurate to this date. Penitentiary-, province- and sex-specific frequency statistics for each outcome were calculated. Results: Data on 50 of 51 penitentiaries (98%) were available. Of these, 72% of penitentiaries reported fewer tests per 1000 population than the Canadian general population average (16 tests/1000 population), and 24% of penitentiaries reported zero tests. Penitentiaries with high levels of testing were those that already had elevated COVID-19 prevalence. Five penitentiaries reported an outbreak (at least one case). Hardest hit penitentiaries were those in Quebec and British Columbia, with some prisons reporting COVID-19 prevalence of 30% to 40%. Of these, two were women's prisons. Female prisoners were over-represented among cases (31% of cases overall, despite representing 5% of the total prison population). Conclusion: Increased sentinel or universal testing may be appropriate given the confined nature of prison populations.

Sensitivity and specificity of these classifiers ranged from 83-100% and 90-99% respectively, and was dependent on the classification level and data pre-processing. Exclusion of human reads generally resulted in increased specificity. Normalization of read counts for genome length resulted in minor overall performance, however negatively affected the detection of targets with read counts around detection level. Correlation of sequence read counts with PCR Ct-values varied per classifier, data pre-processing (R2 range 15.1-63.4%), and per virus, with outliers up to 3 log10 reads magnitude beyond the predicted read count for viruses with high sequence diversity.

TTE showed severe biventricular impairment with an EF of 20 %. Chest X-ray revealed interstitial edema (Fig.1). Invasive mechanical ventilation and inotropic support and empiric antibiotic therapy were set up. High levels of IL-6, lactate, TpnI, and pro-BNP and WBC emerged from laboratory exams (Fig.2).Testing for cardiotropic viruses came back negative, as well as hemocultures. BAL PCR resulted positive for SARS-CoV2. COVID-19 myocarditis was therefore diagnosed. Due to severe hypotension irresponsive to noradrenaline and adrenaline, IABP was placed. The following day, a pericardiocentesis was carried out for cardiac tamponade. Due to worsening of the general conditions, V-A ECMO was implanted. Corticosteroids were administered at high dosage. As cardiac function steadily improved and pro BNP and troponins decreased, vasopressor and inotrope were stopped, V-A ECMO was removed and IABP support was interrupted. Improvement of biventricular function was observed (EF 55 %), after 15 days the patient was transferred to the ward and after 25 days was discharged with heart failure therapy.

However, the data on the COVID-19 vaccine efficacy in cancer patients is limited due to exclusion of cancer patients from most vaccine clinical trials. Therefore, we systemically reviewed the available evidence evaluating the antibody responses in cancer patients. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search from the Pubmed database and calculated risk differences (RD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to compare seroconversion rates between cancer patients and controls using the Review Manager software, version 5.3. RESULTS: Our systematic search retrieved a total 27 studies and we included 17 studies with control arms in the analyses. Cancer patients had significantly lower seroconversion rates (37.3%) than controls (74.1%) (RD: -0.44, 95% CI: -0.52, -0.35, p<0.001) with first vaccine dose. After two doses, the seroconversion rates were 99.6% in control arm and 78.3% in cancer patients (RD: -0.19, 95% CI: -0.28, -0.10, p<0.001). The difference in seroconversion rates was more pronounced patients with hematologic malignancies (72.6%) (RD: -0.25, 95% CI: -0.27, -0.22, p<0.001) than patients with solid tumors (91.6%) (RD: -0.09, 95% CI: -0.13, -0.04, p<0.003) and patients in remission (RD: -0.10, 95% CI: -0.14, -0.06, p<0.001).

The high morbidity and mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) make it a significant threat to global public health. Elucidating its pathogenesis is essential to finding effective therapy. A retrospective study was conducted on 71 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Data on cytokines, T lymphocytes, and other clinical and laboratory characteristics were collected from patients with variable disease severity. The effects of cytokines on the overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) of patients were analyzed. The critically severe and severe patients had higher infection indexes and significant multiple organ function abnormalities than the mild patients (P<0.05). IL-6 and IL-10 were significantly higher in the critically severe patients than in the severe and mild patients (P<0.05). IL-6 and IL-10 were closely associated with white blood cells, neutrophils, T lymphocyte subsets, D-D dimer, blood urea nitrogen, complement C1q, procalcitonin C-reactive protein. Moreover, the IL-6 and IL-10 levels were closely correlated to dyspnea and dizziness (P<0.05). The patients with higher IL-10 levels had shorter OS than the group with lower levels (P<0.05). The older patients with higher levels of single IL-6 or IL-10 tended to have shorter EFS (P<0.05), while the patients who had more elevated IL-6 and IL-10 had shorter OS (P<0.05). The Cox proportional hazard model revealed that IL-6 was the independent factor affecting EFS.

As an essential service, community pharmacies remained open to provide care and service. The unprecedented nature and scale of the pandemic triggered considerable change in daily practice. In anticipation of future pandemic waves and similar mass-scale civil disruptions, it is important to understand how community pharmacies adapted and responded in the early weeks of COVID-19. Methods: A combination of convenience, snowball and purposive sampling methods was used to recruit staff from community pharmacies across Ontario, from a variety of different practice locations and types. A semistructured focus group interview protocol was used to elicit experiences. Data gathering was undertaken until the point of saturation. Thematic analysis was used to surface common experiences and to describe how community pharmacies adapted and responded. Results: A total of 39 participants (pharmacists, registered technicians and assistants) from 11 different pharmacies participated in this study. Data were coded based on 1) what happened, 2) how community pharmacies responded, and 3) what worked and did not work to support pharmacy staff in continued provision of service and care. Key findings included the collapse of provision of nondispensing remunerated services, the central role of managerial decisions in supporting resilience (e.g., change to 8-hour shifts from 12-hour shifts) and the central role of technology in supporting continuity of quality pharmacy services. Discussion: With anticipated future pandemic waves, preparedness of community pharmacy will be essential.

The paper demonstrates the results of own research on the quality standards of customer services in courier service companies. The significance of the aspects of sustainable development implemented by courier companies for customers was also analyzed. The investigations focused on a group of individual customers availing of the services of courier service companies. The study was conducted in September 2020 with the application of electronic tools in the form of an online survey. The questionnaire was composed of single-choice and multiple-choice questions. Upon a factual and logical verification, 260 surveys were selected for further analysis. The conducted study demonstrates that the prime motives behind the choice of a courier company are delivery completion time, service prices, and safety concerns. The last issue has been particularly crucial amidst the Covid-19 coronavirus epidemic. Over three-fourths of the studied subjects (75.8%) said they felt safe in contact with courier operators. The door-to-door (D2D) segment is gradually absorbed by PUDO (pick up drop off) and automated package machines. This may, as a consequence, lower the cost of the last mile and increase customer satisfaction. An important element in the activities of courier companies are also aspects of sustainable development. It is about reducing the negative impact on the natural environment. For over half of the respondents (52.7%), ecological aspects are important or very important. As a result, the most modern companies invest in hybrid and electric cars, optimize travel routes to the customer, and use recyclable packaging.

For this population, eHealth interventions represent an opportunity for promoting healthy lifestyle habits, thus mitigating the consequences of food insecurity. However, before their widespread dissemination, it is essential to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of these interventions among end users. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the feasibility and acceptability of a home-based eHealth intervention focused on improving dietary and physical activity through an interactive television (TV) app among older adults with food insecurity. METHODS: A pilot noncontrolled quasi-experimental study was designed with baseline and 3-month follow-up assessments. Older adult participants with food insecurity were recruited from 17 primary health care centers in Portugal. A home-based intervention program using an interactive TV app aimed at promoting healthy lifestyle behaviors was implemented over 12 weeks. Primary outcomes were feasibility (self-reported use and interest in eHealth) and acceptability (affective attitude, burden, ethicality, perceived effectiveness, and self-efficacy), which were evaluated using a structured questionnaire with a 7-point Likert scale. Secondary outcomes were changes in food insecurity (Household Food Insecurity Scale), quality of life (European Quality of Life Questionnaire with five dimensions and three levels and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue), physical function (Health Assessment Questionnaire, Elderly Mobility Scale, grip strength, and regularity of exercise), and nutritional status (adherence to the Mediterranean diet). RESULTS: A sample of 31 older adult individuals with food insecurity was enrolled in the 12-week intervention program with no dropouts. A total of 10 participants self-reported low use of the TV app. After the intervention, participants were significantly more interested in using eHealth to improve food insecurity (baseline median 1.0, IQR 3.0; 3-month median 5.0, IQR 5.0; P=.01) and for other purposes (baseline median 1.0, IQR 2.0; 3-month median 6.0, IQR 2.0; P=.03). High levels of acceptability were found both before and after (median range 7.0-7.0, IQR 2.0-0.0 and 5.0-7.0, IQR 2.0-2.0, respectively) the intervention, with no significant changes for most constructs. Clinically, there was a reduction of 40% in food insecurity (P=.001), decreased fatigue (mean ?3.82, SD 8.27; P=.02), and improved physical function (Health Assessment Questionnaire: mean ?0.22, SD 0.38; P=.01; Elderly Mobility Scale: mean ?1.50, SD 1.08; P=.01; regularity of exercise: baseline 10/31, 32%; 3 months 18/31, 58%; P=.02). No differences were found for the European Quality of Life Questionnaire with five dimensions and three levels, grip strength, or adherence to the Mediterranean diet. CONCLUSIONS: The home-based eHealth intervention was feasible and highly acceptable by participants, thus supporting a future full-scale trial.

Considerable controversy resulted regarding which procedures and behaviours were associated with the greatest risk of SARS-CoV transmission. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted to identify risk factors for transmission of SARS-CoV during intubation from laboratory confirmed SARS patients to HCWs involved in their care. All SARS patients requiring intubation during the Toronto outbreak were identified. All HCWs who provided care to intubated SARS patients during treatment or transportation and who entered a patient room or had direct patient contact from 24 hours before to 4 hours after intubation were eligible for this study. Data was collected on patients by chart review and on HCWs by interviewer-administered questionnaire. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) logistic regression models and classification and regression trees (CART) were used to identify risk factors for SARS transmission. RESULTS: 45 laboratory-confirmed intubated SARS patients were identified. Of the 697 HCWs involved in their care, 624 (90%) participated in the study. SARS-CoV was transmitted to 26 HCWs from 7 patients; 21 HCWs were infected by 3 patients. In multivariate GEE logistic regression models, presence in the room during fiberoptic intubation (OR = 2.79, p = .004) or ECG (OR = 3.52, p = .002), unprotected eye contact with secretions (OR = 7.34, p = .001), patient APACHE II score 20 (OR = 17.05, p = .009) and patient Pa0(2)/Fi0(2) ratio 59 (OR = 8.65, p = .001) were associated with increased risk of transmission of SARS-CoV. In CART analyses, the four covariates which explained the greatest amount of variation in SARS-CoV transmission were covariates representing individual patients. CONCLUSION: Close contact with the airway of severely ill patients and failure of infection control practices to prevent exposure to respiratory secretions were associated with transmission of SARS-CoV.

We sought to further this research and to understand the impact of the stay-at-home order on crashes in the post order period in Connecticut. METHODS: We used a multiple-comparison group, interrupted time-series analysis design to compare crashes per 100 million vehicle miles traveled (VMT) per week in 2020 to the average of 2017C2019 from January 1-August 31. We stratified crash rate by severity and the number of vehicles involved. We modeled two interruption points reflecting the weeks Connecticut implemented (March 23rd, week 12) and rescinded (May 20th, week 20) its stay-at-home order. RESULTS: During the initial week of the stay-at-home order in Connecticut, there was an additional 28 single vehicle crashes compared to previous years (95% confidence interval (CI): [15.8, 36.8]). However, the increase at the order onset was not seen throughout the duration. Rescinding the stay-at-home order by and large did not result in an immediate increase in crash rates. Crash rates steadily returned to previous year averages during the post-stay-at-home period. Fatal crash rates were unaffected by the stay-at-home order and remained similar to previous year rates throughout the study duration. DISCUSSION: The initial onset of the stay-at-home order in Connecticut was associated with a sharp increase in the single vehicle crash rate but that increase was not sustained for the remainder of the stay-at-home order.

Although sedatives are often administered to improve comfort and facilitate ventilation, they can be deleterious. Whether opioids improve asynchronies with fewer negative effects is unknown. We hypothesized that opioids alone would improve asynchronies and result in more wakeful patients than sedatives alone or sedatives-plus-opioids. METHODS This prospective multicenter observational trial enrolled critically ill adults mechanically ventilated (MV) > 24 h. We compared asynchronies and sedation depth in patients receiving sedatives, opioids, or both. We recorded sedation level and doses of sedatives and opioids. BetterCare? software continuously registered ineffective inspiratory efforts during expiration (IEE), double cycling (DC), and asynchrony index (AI) as well as MV modes. All variables were averaged per day. We used linear mixed-effects models to analyze the relationships between asynchronies, sedation level, and sedative and opioid doses. RESULTS In 79 patients, 14,166,469 breaths were recorded during 579 days of MV. Overall asynchronies were not significantly different in days classified as sedatives-only, opioids-only, and sedatives-plus-opioids and were more prevalent in days classified as no-drugs than in those classified as sedatives-plus-opioids, irrespective of the ventilatory mode. Sedative doses were associated with sedation level and with reduced DC (p < 0.0001) in sedatives-only days. However, on days classified as sedatives-plus-opioids, higher sedative doses and deeper sedation had more IEE (p < 0.0001) and higher AI (p = 0.0004). Opioid dosing was inversely associated with overall asynchronies (p < 0.001) without worsening sedation levels into morbid ranges. CONCLUSIONS Sedatives, whether alone or combined with opioids, do not result in better patient-ventilator interaction than opioids alone, in any ventilatory mode. Higher opioid dose (alone or with sedatives) was associated with lower AI without depressing consciousness. Higher sedative doses administered alone were associated only with less DC.

Most notably, IBD and CRC share significantly increased expression of five genes (MMP10, LCN2, REG1A, REG3A, and DUOX2), enriched inflammatory and neutrophil activation pathways and, most notably, highly significant enrichment of IL-4 and IL-13 signaling. Thus, our work expands our knowledge about the intricate relationship between IBD and CRC development and provides new rationales for developing novel therapeutic strategies.","output":"Identification of Common and Distinct Pathways in Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Colorectal Cancer: A Hypothesis Based on Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, the whole world is facing the pandemic which is caused by covid-19 or SARS-CoV-2.

Little is known about whether social distancing and other societal changes has provoked an increase in gambling, whether decreased betting opportunities due to paused sports events spurred gamblers to transition to online casino gambling, or whether any of these factors have had an impact on problem gambling. Methods: Data on lookup queries against the Swedish Gambling Paus registry, logging all initiated gambling sessions by all licensed gambling providers, from 2019-01-01 (start of registry) to 2020-04-08 (well into the first phase of the outbreak) were analyzed using TBATS time series forecasting to estimate trends after the first domestic COVID-19 death. Obfuscated data on daily total wagered and deposited amounts, split by modality (casino or betting, and low and high intensity, respectively) for the equivalent period were supplied by a licensed online gambling provider. Results: Total gambling activity decreased by 13.29% during the first phase of the outbreak compared to forecast. Analyses of online gambling data revealed that although betting decreased substantially in synchrony with a slight increase in online casino gambling, there was no increase in likely problematic, high-intensity gambling and neither did total online gambling increase. Conclusions: This first, preliminary study revealed no increase in Swedish gambling activity, total or specifically online, in the first phase of the COVID-19 outbreak. Future research should examine whether pandemic-induced transitioning between gambling modalities and/or increased participation in gambling, leads to long-term effects on prevalence of problem gambling.","output":"Transitioning Between Online Gambling Modalities and Decrease in Total Gambling Activity, but No Indication of Increase in Problematic Online Gambling Intensity During the First Phase of the COVID-19 Outbreak in Sweden: A Time Series Forecast Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The purpose of this study was to propose a hypothesis that there is a potential association between the incidence of selective IgA deficiency in various countries and COVID-19 cases The number of deaths due to COVID-19 increased in clear proportion to the number of infected patients, and the difference in the number of deaths by country was due to the difference in the number of infected patients The frequency of selective IgA deficiency has a strong positive correlation with the prevalence of COVID-19 per population The low infection rate contributed to the low death rate from COVID-19 in Japan, suggesting that the extremely low frequency of selective IgA deficiency may be a contributing factor","output":"Association between selective IgA deficiency and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigated users perceptions of the University of Education, Winneba (UEW) Learning Management Systems (LMS) based on SWOT The study adopted the explanatory sequential mixed methods which sampled 3272 students and 20 lecturers by using the stratified and purposive sampling techniques, respectively The study used questionnaires and semi-structured interview guides to collect quantitative and qualitative data Quantitative data were analyzed using Means and Standard Deviations, Independent Samples t-test, and ANOVA The qualitative data was analyzed thematically The study found that UEW LMS is perceived to have elements of weaknesses and threats as well as strengths and opportunities The study further found that the users of LMS differ in their perceptions in terms of SWOT based on students age The students, however, did not differ significantly in their perceptions of SWOT based on gender The study recommended that the management of UEW LMS need to educate both lecturers and students about the benefits that LMS offers to its users Management of the UEW should make the usage of the LMS compulsory for teaching and learning while taking into consideration the age of the students in the designing and implementation of subsequent online platforms for students and lecturers ? 2020 The authors and IJLTER ORG All rights reserved","output":"COVID-19 and online learning: A SWOT analysis of users perspectives on learning management system of University of Education, Winneba, Ghana"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The relationship between the increases in pulse pressure (PP) and arterial stiffness determined by aging or systemic hypertension has been widely reported. These findings are supported by large-cohort analysis conducted in well-known populations, such as the Framingham Study. However, there is evidence that an age-PP curvilinear relationship may exist in hypertensive subjects. This study aimed to evaluate the age-related change in pulse pressure and arterial stiffness in a population-based study. METHODS Carotid femoral Pulse Wave Velocity (cfPWV) were obtained in 2075 subjects. RESULTS Age-related changes of PP showed a curvilinear relationship (R=0.39, p<0.0001) in normotensive subjects, with a nadir at around 50 years of age. On the other hand, the age-cfPWV relationship showed a linear and positive correlation (R=0.72, p<0.0001). PP also showed a curvilinear relationship with age (R=0.36, p<0.0001) in hypertensive subjects, with a nadir around 50 years of age. The age-cfPWV relationship showed a linear and positive correlation (R=0.55, p<0.0001). Similar results were observed in the adult population (age16 years). Multivariate analysis showed that age, sex, cfPWV, and mean arterial pressure are determinants of PP values in the entire population; however, this result is not uniform when the different subgroups are analyse. CONCLUSION In conclusion, age-related changes in PP showed a curvilinear relationship and no parallelism with the age-cfPWV relationship for both normotensive and hypertensive subjects.

For conditions within the respiratory tract, targeted drug delivery directly to the site of action can achieve a high local concentration for efficacy with reduced unwanted systemic exposure and adverse effect. For systemic conditions, the unique physiology of the lung evolutionarily designed for rapid gaseous exchange presents an entry route for systemic drug delivery. Although the development of inhaled formulations has come a long way over the last few decades, many aspects of it remain to be elucidated. In particular, a reliable and well-understood method for in vitro-in vivo correlations remains to be established. With the rapid and ongoing advancement of technology, there is much potential to better utilise computational methods including different types of modelling and simulation approaches to support inhaled formulation development. This review intends to provide an introduction on some fundamental concepts in pulmonary drug delivery and inhaled formulation development followed by discussions on some challenges and opportunities in the translation of inhaled pharmaceuticals from preclinical studies to clinical development.

Abnormal MK hyperplasia is a hallmark feature of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). The JAK2V617F mutation is present in hematopoietic cells in a majority of patients with MPNs. Using a murine model of MPN in which the human JAK2V617F gene is expressed in the MK lineage, we show that the JAK2V617F-bearing MKs promote hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) aging, manifesting as myeloid-skewed hematopoiesis with an expansion of CD41+ HSCs, a reduced engraftment and self-renewal capacity, and a reduced differentiation capacity. HSCs from 2-year-old mice with JAK2V617F-bearing MKs were more proliferative and less quiescent than HSCs from age-matched control mice. Examination of the marrow hematopoietic niche reveals that the JAK2V617F-bearing MKs not only have decreased direct interactions with hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells during aging but also suppress the vascular niche function during aging. Unbiased RNA expression profiling reveals that HSC aging has a profound effect on MK transcriptomic profiles, while targeted cytokine array shows that the JAK2V617F-bearing MKs can alter the hematopoietic niche through increased levels of pro-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic factors. Therefore, as a hematopoietic niche cell, MKs represent an important connection between the extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms for HSC aging.","output":"JAK2V617F Mutant Megakaryocytes Contribute to Hematopoietic Aging in a Murine Model of Myeloproliferative Neoplasm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The intranasal pathway is a direct route of communication between the environment and the brain.

AIM: To explore the association between D-dimer at admission and in-hospital mortality in patients hospitalised for COVID-19, with or without symptomatic venous thromboembolism. METHODS: From 26 February to 20 April 2020, D-dimer concentration at admission and outcomes (in-hospital mortality and venous thromboembolism) of patients hospitalised for COVID-19 in medical wards were retrospectively analysed in a multicenter study in 24 French hospitals. RESULTS: Among 2878 patients enrolled in the study, 1154 (40.1%) patients had D-dimer measurement at admission. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified a D-dimer concentration>1128ng/mL as the best cut-off value for in-hospital mortality (area under the curve 64.9%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 60-69), with a sensitivity of 71.1% (95% CI 62-78) and a specificity of 55.6% (95% CI 52-58), which did not differ in the subgroup of patients with venous thromboembolism during hospitalisation. Among 545 (47.2%) patients with D-dimer concentration>1128ng/mL at admission, 86 (15.8%) deaths occurred during hospitalisation. After adjustment, in Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression models, D-dimer concentration>1128ng/mL at admission was also associated with a worse prognosis, with an odds ratio of 3.07 (95% CI 2.05-4.69; P<0.001) and an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.11 (95% CI 1.31-3.4; P<0.01).

While anxiety was quantified using the Zungs Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), tinnitus severity was evaluated using the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) questionnaire and the test of tinnitus loudness (TL). The assessments were repeated after the sound therapy plus educational counselling (STEC) for 38 patients in 2020 and 58 patients in 2019 and compared with EC alone therapy for 42 patients in 2020 and 17 patients in 2019.

SAS, THI and TL were all deteriorated after the EC alone treatment in 2020, while an improvement was seen in 2019. This suggests that EC alone could not counteract the stress by COVID-19 at all, and the stress, if not managed well, can significantly increase the severity of tinnitus and associated anxiety.

Here we analyze the immunological mechanism(s) of rapidly protective vaccinia virus immunization using mousepox as surrogate model for human smallpox. We found that fast protection against lethal systemic poxvirus disease solely depended on CD4 and CD8 T cell responses induced by vaccination with highly attenuated modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) or conventional vaccinia virus. Of note, CD4 T cells were critically required to allow for MVA induced CD8 T cell expansion and perforin-mediated cytotoxicity was a key mechanism of MVA induced protection. In contrast, selected components of the innate immune system and B cell-mediated responses were fully dispensable for prevention of fatal disease by immunization given two days before challenge.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the educational effect of using a real-size 3D-printed spine model for training beginners of the free-hand pedicle screw instrumentation technique. We asked whether the use of a 3D spine model can improve (1) screw instrumentation accuracy and (2) length of procedure. METHODS Twenty life-size 3D-printed lumbar spine models were made from 10 volunteers (two models for each volunteer). Two novice surgeons who had no experience of free-hand pedicle screw instrumentation technique were instructed by an experienced surgeon, and each surgeon inserted 10 pedicle screws for each lumbar spine model. Computed tomography scans of the spine models were obtained to evaluate screw instrumentation accuracy. The length of time in completing the procedure was recorded. The results of the latter 10 spine models were compared with those of the former 10 models to evaluate learning effect. RESULTS A total of 37/200 screws (18.5%) perforated the pedicle cortex with a mean of 1.7 mm (range, 1.2-3.3 mm). However, the latter half of the models had significantly less violation than the former half (10/100 vs. 27/100, p < 0.001).

Median (interquartile range) case incidence and fatality rates per 100a?000 people were approximately 10 times higher for the top decile of densely populated counties (1185.2 [313.2-1891.2] cases; 43.7 [10.4-106.7] deaths) than for counties in the lowest density quartile (121.4 [87.8-175.4] cases; 4.2 [1.9-8.0] deaths). Mean (SD) Rt in the first 2 weeks was 5.7 (2.5) in the top decile compared with 3.1 (1.2) in the lowest quartile. In multivariable analysis, a 50% decrease in visits to nonessential businesses was associated with a 45% decrease in Rt (95% CI, 43%-49%). From a relative Rt at 0 C of 2.13 (95% CI, 1.89-2.40), relative Rt decreased to a minimum as temperatures warmed to 11 C, increased between 11 and 20 C (1.61; 95% CI, 1.42-1.84) and then declined again at temperatures greater than 20 C. With a 70% reduction in visits to nonessential business, 202 counties (95.7%) were estimated to fall below a threshold Rt of 1.0, including 17 of 21 counties (81.0%) in the top density decile and 52 of 53 counties (98.1%) in the lowest density quartile.2.

A set of simulation toolkits was utilized for the design and optimization of the self-resetting probe, allowing for highly consistent signal amplitudes across cyclic detections of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Idiosyncratically, FWHM regulated by dissipative kinetics exhibits a fingerprint signal for high confidential identification of single-nucleotide mutation in the virus sequence. We further exploited our self-resetting probes to examine multiple human-infectious RNA virus including SARS-CoV-2, ZIKV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV to demonstrate its generic nucleic acid detection capability and superior orthogonality. Self-resetting probes were also deployed for detection of 110 clinical nasopharyngeal swabs and correctly classify all the clinical samples from 55 COVID-19 patients and 55 controls.

The acute episode is characterized by deterioration in consciousness, often with focal neurologic deficits and seizures. Additionally, symmetric multifocal brain lesions are seen in the bilateral thalami as well as other characteristic regions, involving both gray and white matter. Prognosis is variable, with a high mortality rate and most surviving patients having persistent neurologic deficits. Early treatment with high dose steroids is associated with a more favorable outcome, however the diagnosis is often overlooked resulting in delayed treatment. The RANBP2 mutation associated with ANE1 causes an incompletely penetrant predisposition to encephalopathy in the setting of febrile illness through a mechanism that remains elusive. There are several non-mutually exclusive hypotheses suggesting possible etiologies for this phenotype based on the many functions of RANBP2 within the cell. These include dysfunctions in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking and intracellular metabolic regulation, as well as cytokine storm, and abnormal distribution of mitochondria.

We hereby describe the ICU management of a 23rd gestational week pregnant woman who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, prone positioning, and cesarean delivery during her ICU stay for COVID-19 related pneumonia. Moreover, we focused on the occurrence and management of recurrent tension pneumothorax after the cesarean delivery. CASE REPORT: A 23rd gestational week pregnant woman was admitted to the ICU for a COVID-19 bilateral pneumonia and underwent invasive mechanical ventilation and prone positioning. Cesarean delivery was planned during the ICU stay, while the patient was receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. After delivery, the patient experienced a recurrent pneumothorax that required the positioning of multiple chest drains.

The following descriptors were used: [(pediatrics) AND (emergencies) AND (diagnostic imaging) AND (medical overuse)] and [(Coronavirus infections) OR (COVID-19) AND (pediatrics) AND (emergencies) AND (diagnostic imaging)]. Inclusion criteria were articles available in full, in Portuguese or English, published from 2016 to 2020 or from 2019 to 2020, and articles that covered the theme. Articles without adherence to the theme and duplicate texts in the databases were excluded. DATA SYNTHESIS: 61 publications were identified, of which 17 were comprised in this review. Some imaging tests used in pediatric emergency departments increase the possibility of developing future malignancies in patients, since they emit ionizing radiation. There are clinical decision instruments that allow reducing unnecessary exam requests, avoiding over-medicalization, and hospital expenses. Moreover, with the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a growing concern about the overuse of imaging exams in the pediatric population, which highlights the problems pointed out by this review.

After training, the GAN can be used to predict the evolution of the spatial distribution of the simulation states and observed data is assimilated. In this paper, we describe the process required in order to quantify uncertainty, during which no additional simulations of the high-fidelity numerical model are required. These methods take advantage of the adjoint-like capabilities of generative models and the ability to simulate forwards and backwards in time. Set within a reduced-order model framework for efficiency, we apply these methods to a compartmental model in epidemiology to predict the spread of COVID-19 in an idealised town.

To address the many challenges associated with collecting and reporting data during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, we used a design thinking approach to build the Global Ebola Laboratory Data collection and reporting system. MAIN TEXT: We used the five-stage Design Thinking model proposed by Hasso-Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. This approach offers a flexible model which focuses on empathizing, defining, ideating, prototyping, and testing. A strong focus of the methodology includes end-users feedback from the beginning to the end of the process. This is an iterative methodology that continues to adapt according to the needs of the system. The stages do not need to be sequential and can be run in parallel, out of order, and repeated as necessary. Design thinking was used to develop a data collection and reporting system, which contains all laboratory data from the three countries during one of the most complicated multi-country outbreaks to date. The data collection and reporting system was used to orient the response interventions at the district, national, and international levels within the three countries including generating situation reports, monitoring the epidemiological and operational situations, providing forecasts of the epidemic, and supporting Ebola-related research and the Ebola National Survivors programs within each country.

One of the most helpful approaches to creating stress-resilient crops is genome editing and trans- or cis-genesis. Out of hundreds of stress-responsive genes, many have been used to impart tolerance against a particular stress factor, while a few used in combination for gene pyramiding against multiple stresses. However, a better approach would be to use multi-role pleiotropic genes that enable plants to adapt to numerous environmental stresses simultaneously. Herein we attempt to integrate and present the scattered information published in the past three decades about these pleiotropic genes for crop improvement and remodeling future cropping systems. Research articles validating functional roles of genes in transgenic plants were used to create groups of multi-role pleiotropic genes that could be candidate genes for developing weather-proof crop varieties. These biotech crop varieties will help create high-value farms to meet the goal of a sustainable increase in global food productivity and stabilize food prices by ensuring a fluctuation-free assured food supply.

However, EHR may lack pertinent screening variables. One strategy is to identify surrogate EHR variables which can predict the screening variable of interest. In this article, we use BMI to develop a prediction rule for arm circumference using data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. This work applies to EHR patient screening for clinical trials of hypertension. METHODS: We included 11 585 participants aged 52C75 years with BMI and arm circumference measured at ARIC follow-up visit 4 (1996C1998). We selected the following arm circumference cutpoints based on the American Heart Association recommendations for blood pressure (BP) cuffs: small adult (26 cm), adult (34 cm) and large adult (44 cm). We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of BMI values for predicting arm circumference using receiver operating characteristic curves. We report the BMI threshold that maximized Youdens Index for each arm circumference upper limit of a BP cuff. RESULTS: Participants mean BMI and arm circumference were 28.8  5.6 kg/m(2) and 33.4  4.3 cm, respectively. The BMI-arm circumference Pearsons correlation coefficient was 0.86. The BMI threshold for arm circumference26 cm was 23.0 kg/m(2), arm circumference34 cm was 29.2 kg/m(2) and arm circumference44 cm was 37.4 kg/m(2). Only the BMI threshold for arm circumference34 cm varied significantly by sex.

Further, the COVID-19 pandemic had a major impact on residency selection that is undetermined. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine to what degree and the type of PRS SM content that drives prospective applicants interest of a residency program, especially in the context of COVID-19. METHODS: Prospective PRS residency applicants were surveyed anonymously. RESULTS: An average of 60% of respondents reported that PRS social media (SM) content influenced their perception of a program. Fifty-eight percent reported that resident lifestyle content made them gain interest in a program. Separately, 32% reported that resident lifestyle content influenced them to rank a program higher. Seventy-two percent of respondents claimed SM content did not make them lose interest in a program. Rarely posting, outdated content, and lack of engagement were cited as factors for loss of interest in a program. A majority of respondents (53%) reported wanting to see more resident life and culture content on SM. Of the existing PRS SM content, respondents were most interested in resident lifestyle, followed by clinical and program-specific content. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic amplified the importance of SM PRS residency selection. Resident lifestyle content was consistently indicated as more likely to make respondents gain interest in a program, rank a program higher, and as the most desired content.

The aim of this paper is to examine the effect of adopting COVID-19 safety protocols on construction sites on the economic performance (EP) of construction projects. Design/methodology/approach: Employing the survey method using a structured questionnaire, data were collected from small- and large-sized construction projects in Nigeria and analysed using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) technique. Findings: The findings reveal that job re-organization and sanitization have negative significant effects on EP, while social distancing and specific training have no effect on EP. Furthermore, project size moderates the relationship between job re-organization, sanitization, specific training and EP with the stronger effect on the relationships observed in big projects, except for the relationship between sanitization and EP where the moderating relationship is stronger in small projects. However, there is no significant moderating effect of project size on the relationship between social distancing and EP. Practical implications: As construction project sites continue to operate amidst strict safety protocols, this study offers theoretical and practical insights on how construction projects can adhere to the safety protocols while performing economically.

We then identify users' online features and situational predictors that correlate with their susceptibility to COVID-19 misinformation. This work brings unique contributions: First, contrary to the prior studies on bot influence, our analysis shows that social bots' contribution to misinformation sharing was surprisingly low, and human-like users' misinformation behaviors exhibit heterogeneity and temporal variability. While the sharing of misinformation was highly concentrated, the risk of occasionally sharing misinformation for average users remained alarmingly high.

A group of high frequency users of Dr iQ emerged and clinicians were concerned their health needs were not being met through the platform. High frequency attendance in a traditional general practice setting is associated with increased time and healthcare costs. This project evaluated the number of high frequency users (identified as 10 or more consultations a month) of Dr iQ in one busy inner city practice over a 5-month period. We aimed to decrease the subsequent monthly usage frequency of all Dr iQ high frequency users from 10 or more consultations to less than 10 consultations.

The human, economic and financial costs are increasing dramatically, with potentially huge impact on developing countries and emerging market countries in addition to developed countries and regions. Across all of these, the greatest toll is likely to fall on those least able to bear it, with terrible damage to human development across the world.This paper examines how the digital financial infrastructure that emerged in the wake of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis is being, and can be, leveraged to overcome the immediate challenges presented by the pandemic and manage the impending economic fallout. The origins of the 2008 crisis and current crisis are different: 2008 was a financial crisis spilling over into the real economy. 2020 is a health and geopolitical crisis, spilling over simultaneously into financial markets and the real economy. As such, this crisis requires different approaches.This study operates at two levels: ? At the macro level, it seeks to identify areas of systemic risk and strategies and frameworks to support policy coordination and action;and ? At the micro level is seeks to illustrate how digital finance tools may be able to assist addressing some of the challenges emerging.Strategies to address financial aspects of the crisis in order to reduce the economic and human impact include: (1) ensuring sufficient liquidity to support market functioning and underpin demand;(2) intensifying information exchange on health and financial / economic matters in an effort to ensure accurate information despite forces that work against this;(3) heavy, temporary financial support for individuals;for small, medium and large enterprises to avoid loss of infrastructure and preserve the capacity for an orchestrated response (by avoiding mass insolvency);and potentially, in some cases, for governments;(4) leveraging digital finance and payments to reduce human-to-human contact, while organizing support for the elderly and other digitally excluded people who would normally use physical channels;(5) establishing a well-funded coordination body as a crisis management tool to ensure information exchange;(6) directing financial resources to medical infrastructure;and (7) directing financial resources to digital infrastructure and connectivity to support all other aspects of society and the economy, including, especially, the online facilitation of education and widespread work-from-home policies.At the same time, the digitization of financial services in the last decade offers alternative and more direct means by which it may be possible to stimulate the real economy, which will be critical in mitigating the economic impacts and maintaining social cohesion. Tools that support financial inclusion, sustainable development and achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals can also provide useful tools during a crisis.

METHODS: Analysis of visits to 36 community health centers (CHCs) in NYS by modality (telephone vs video) from February to November 2020. Semi-structured interviews with 25 primary care, behavioral health, and pediatric providers from 8 CHCs. FINDINGS: In the week following the NYS stay-at-home order, video and telephone visits rose from 3.4 and 0% of total visits to 14.9 and 22.3%. At its peak, more than 60% of visits were conducted via telemedicine (April 2020) before tapering off to about 30% of visits (August 2020). Providers expressed a strong preference for video visits, particularly for situations when visual assessments were needed. Yet, more visits were conducted over telephone than video at all points throughout the pandemic. Video-specific advantages included enhanced ability to engage patients and use of visual cues to get a comprehensive look into the patient's life, including social supports, hygiene, and medication adherence. Telephone presented unique benefits, including greater privacy, feasibility, and ease of use that make it critical to engage with key populations and as a backup for when video was not an option.

In many ways, we, as a nation, are handing over our data without realizing it, without fully thinking it through or even being aware of cyber threats, which will ultimately have a tremendous impact on the governments and citizens both personally and at work. The goal of this paper is to investigate the correlation between the cyberattacks before the coronavirus and during the coronavirus in order to build an understanding of what is happening. To optimize cyber security and provide effective ways to tackle cyber security attacks during COVID-19 or something similar, we need to consider extra precautions and take a more secure approach to protection. To minimize the universal risks of data breaches and other cyber incidents, we need to enforce practical steps to deal with and if possible limit those risks. This requires not only thoughtful consideration, but also a good understanding of the opportunities that COVID-19 provides to cyber-criminals. The aim of this research paper is to investigate the growth of and reasons for the increase of cyberattacks during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods Using longitudinally collected blood samples from the COMMUNITY study, we determined binding (WHO BAU/ml) and neutralizing antibody titers against ten SARS-CoV-2 variants over seven months following BNT162b2 in healthcare workers with (n=111) and without (n=298) confirmed prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. A smaller group with (n=47) and without (n=61) confirmed prior SARS-CoV-2 infection receiving ChAdOx1 ncov-19 was followed for three months. Results Vaccination (BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 ncov-19) following SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in higher wild-type BAU/ml geometric mean titers (GMTs) at all sampling time points when compared to SARS-CoV-2 naive vaccinees (all p<0.001). GMTs were 1875 BAU/ml in convalescent and 981 BAU/ml in naive BNT162b2 vaccinees 6 weeks post vaccination. 29 weeks post vaccination, GMTs had decreased to 524 BAU/ml in convalescent and 148 BAU/ml in naive vaccinees. GMT differences between convalescents and naive following ChAdOx1 ncov-19 mirrored those after BNT162b2, but the titers were considerably lower. Finally, at all time points, neutralizing antibody titers against all ten tested SARS-CoV-2 variants were at least 2 respectively 3-fold higher in SARS-CoV-2 recovered as compared to naive vaccinees following BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 ncov-19, respectively (all p<0.001).

The effect of PVDF-PVP-TiO2-FeCl3 (PPTFe) membrane filtration-photocatalytic system on the removal of trace concentration of sulfadiazine (SD) in water was evaluated. A two-factor four-level experiment was established to optimize 16 self-made modified membranes. The optimal membrane was then characterized in seven tests (SEM, EDS, membrane pure water flux, contact angle, porosity, mean pore size, ATR-FTIR), resulting in the optimal ratio (PPTFe membrane with 1.2 wt%TiO2 and 0.8 wt%FeCl3). Compared with the original membrane, the pore number, pore size, permeability, and hydrophilicity of the PPTFe membrane were all enhanced. The removal efficiency (92.63%) of SD by PPTFe membrane filtration-photocatalysis system was investigated. The reaction rate (0.0214 min-1) of the removal SD of the system was determined according to the pseudo-first-order kinetic model. The removal performance of membrane type, pH, and water quality parameters (Cl-, SO42-, NO3-, HA) on PPTFe membrane filtration-photocatalytic system were also made a deep inquiry. The results reflected that acidic conditions (pH = 3) were beneficial to SD removal, the presence of Cl-, SO42-, and HA could inhibit SD removal, while the existence of NO3- was unaffected. Furthermore, the removal rate of SD in the actual water body was displayed well in this system.

ObjectivesThis study aimed to determine the activity of the molnupiravir (NHC) to different SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern (VoCs), and to establish the therapeutic window in human lung cell model. MethodsDose response assays were performed in parallel to determine the IC50 (the concentration of drug required to inhibit virus titre by 50%) of NHC against different variants. Human ACE-2 A549 cells were treated with NHC at different time points either before, during or after infection with SARS- CoV-2.

Because of their clinical similarities to patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) these post-SARS subjects were similarly compared to 21 drug free female patients, (mean age 42.4 +/- 11.8 yrs.) who fulfilled criteria for fibromyalgia. RESULTS: Chronic post-SARS is characterized by persistent fatigue, diffuse myalgia, weakness, depression, and nonrestorative sleep with associated REM-related apneas/hypopneas, an elevated sleep EEG cyclical alternating pattern, and alpha EEG sleep anomaly. Post- SARS patients had symptoms of pre and post-sleep fatigue and post sleep sleepiness that were similar to the symptoms of patients with FMS, and similar to symptoms of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome.

In order for contact-tracing apps to be efficient tools in combatting pandemics, a significant proportion of the population has to install it. However, in many countries, the success of apps introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic has been limited due to lack of public support. This paper aims to better understand why consumers seem unwilling to install and use a contact-tracing app. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, the authors test a number of determinants hypothesized to influence acceptance of contact-tracing apps based on the theory of privacy calculus (Dinev and Hart, 2006). Both perceived privacy concerns, as well as perceived hedonic, utilitarian and pro-social benefits are included. The hypotheses are tested through SEM analysis on a representative sample of 1,007 Swedish citizens. Findings: The results indicate significant privacy concerns with using contact-tracing apps. However, this is to some extent offset by perceived hedonic and pro-social positive consequences of using the app. This study further shows that a general positive attitude towards innovation increases acceptance of the app. Originality/value: The study contributes to research on consumer privacy, both in general in its application of the calculus model but also specifically in the context of contact-tracing apps. Moreover, as the results highlight which aspects that are important for consumers to accept and install an app of this kind, they also represent an important contribution to policymakers in countries around the world. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Individual costs and societal benefits: the privacy calculus of contact-tracing apps"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Provide an updated review of the clinical management and diagnosis of Kawasaki disease with inclusion of potential diagnostic difficulties with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS: Adjunctive corticosteroid therapy has been shown to reduce the rate of coronary artery dilation in children at high risk for IVIG resistance in multiple Japanese clinical studies (most notably RAISE study group). Additional adjunctive therapies (etanercept, infliximab, cyclosporin) may also provide limited benefit, but data is limited to single studies and subgroups of patients with cardiac abnormalities. The efficacy of other agents (atorvastatin, doxycycline) is currently being investigated. MIS-C is a clinically distinct entity from KD with broad clinical manifestations and multiorgan involvement (cardiac, GI, hematologic, dermatologic, respiratory, renal). MIS-C with Kawasaki manifestations is more commonly seen in children < 5 years of age.

METHODS: We developed in a 12-hospital system a model using training and validation followed by a real-time assessment. The LASSO guided feature selection included demographics, comorbidities, home medications, vital signs. We constructed a logistic regression-based ML algorithm to predict severe COVID-19, defined as patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, or died in or out-of-hospital. Training data included 1,469 adult patients who tested positive for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) within 14 days of acute care. We performed: 1) temporal validation in 414 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, 2) validation in a PUI set of 13,271 patients with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 test during an acute care visit, and 3) real-time validation in 2,174 ED patients with PUI test or positive SARS-CoV-2 result. Subgroup analysis was conducted across race and gender to ensure equity in performance. RESULTS: The algorithm performed well on pre-implementation validations for predicting COVID-19 severity: 1) the temporal validation had an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.87 (95%-CI: 0.83, 0.91); 2) validation in the PUI population had an AUROC of 0.82 (95%-CI: 0.81, 0.83).

METHODS: Here, we report a simple iron flocculation method for concentrating viruses in water, together with a newly-developed hydrolysis probe quantitative RT-qPCR method for the detection and quantification of TiLV. RESULTS: The RT-qPCR method designed to target a conserved region of the TiLV genome segment 9 has a detection limit of 10 viral copies per L of template. The method had a 100% analytical specificity and sensitivity for TiLV. The optimized iron flocculation method was able to recover 16.11  3.3% of the virus from water samples spiked with viral cultures. Tilapia and water samples were collected for use in the detection and quantification of TiLV disease during outbreaks in an open-caged river farming system and two earthen fish farms. TiLV was detected from both clinically sick and asymptomatic fish. Most importantly, the virus was successfully detected from water samples collected from different locations in the affected farms (i.e., river water samples from affected cages (8.50  10(3) to 2.79  10(5) copies/L) and fish-rearing water samples, sewage, and reservoir (4.29  10(3) to 3.53  10(4) copies/L)). By contrast, TiLV was not detected in fish or water samples collected from two farms that had previously experienced TiLV outbreaks and from one farm that had never experienced a TiLV outbreak. In summary, this study suggests that the eRNA detection system using iron flocculation, coupled with probe based-RT-qPCR, is feasible for use in the concentration and quantification of TiLV from water. This approach may be useful for the non-invasive monitoring of TiLV in tilapia aquaculture systems and may support evidence-based decisions on biosecurity interventions needed.","output":"Concentration and quantification of Tilapia tilapinevirus from water using a simple iron flocculation coupled with probe-based RT-qPCR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article, we discuss current evidence on some of the dietary supplements that have been most commonly used for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prevention and/or treatment, including vitamin C, vitamin D, and zinc.","output":"Current evidence on vitamin c, d, and zinc supplementation for covid-19 prevention and/or treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, suddenly 54 cases of viral pneumonia emerged in Wuhan, China, caused by some unknown microorganism The virus responsible for these pneumonia infections was identified as novel coronavirus of the family Coronaviridae The novel coronavirus was renamed as COVID-19 by WHO Infection from the virus has since increased exponentially and has spread all over the world in more than 196 countries The WHO has declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern due to the outbreak of COVID-19 The virus is highly infectious and can cause human-to-human transmission Every 24 h, cases of COVID-19 increase severalfolds The WHO is monitoring the SARS-CoV-2 spread very closely via a global surveillance system The current situation demands the enforcement of strict laws which would help in inhibiting the further spread of COVID-19 Social distancing, international travel restrictions to affected countries, and hygiene are three important ways to nullify SARS-CoV-2 Government and private organizations need to come forward and work together during this pandemic Public awareness, social distancing, and sterilization must be maintained to neutralize the viral infection, especially in major hot spots","output":"Global Trends in Epidemiology of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pharmacogenomics (PGx) is the study of genetic influences on an individuals response to medications.

We structure this editorial essay in two parts. First, we consider the challenges of theorising pandemics with an attentiveness to inequality. We consider what different theoretical approaches have brought and can bring to studying risk and inequality, before developing a more in-depth consideration of the work of Mary Douglas for this purpose. We draw out key features of Douglas's work on 'centre and periphery', alongside the related group dynamics and tensions which are configured by, and help reproduce, social inequalities. Second, we then develop a dialogue between these analytical sensibilities around inequality, drawn from Douglas, and various conceptualisations and findings emerging in the eight studies published on pandemics in Health, Risk and Society this year (4 in this issue, 4 appearing earlier in the year). Douglas's work, which has often been neglected in studies of inequalities and risk, provides valuable insights into institutional dynamics of culture and power. The eight recent studies in the journal include some conducted in contexts, and by researchers, located towards the global economic and academic periphery. This diversification, beyond the usual social and governmental contexts, and alongside the growing involvement of different epistemic communities, introduces and cultivates valuable insights, for the field of risk, inequality and health more generally, and for grasping the global phenomena of the pandemic.","output":"Covid-19, pandemic risk and inequality: emerging social science insights at 24 months"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is the viral pathogen causing the COVID19 global pandemic. Consequently, much research has gone into the development of pre-clinical assays for the discovery of new or repurposing of FDA-approved therapies. Preventing viral entry into a host cell would be an effective antiviral strategy. One mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 entry occurs when the spike protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 binds to an ACE2 receptor followed by cleavage at two cut sites (priming) that causes a conformational change allowing for viral and host membrane fusion. This fusion event is proceeded by release of viral RNA within the host cell. TMPRSS2 has an extracellular protease domain capable of cleaving the spike protein to initiate membrane fusion. Additionally, knock-out studies in mice have demonstrated reduced infection in the absence of TMPRSS2 with no detectable physiological impact; thus, TMPRSS2 is an attractive target for therapeutic development. A validated inhibitor of TMPRSS2 protease activity would be a valuable tool for studying the impact TMPRSS2 has in viral entry and potentially be an effective antiviral therapeutic. To enable inhibitor discovery and profiling of FDA-approved therapeutics, we describe an assay for the biochemical screening of recombinant TMPRSS2 suitable for high throughput application. We demonstrate effectiveness to quantify inhibition down to subnanomolar concentrations by assessing the inhibition of camostat, nafamostat and gabexate, clinically approved agents in Japan for pancreatitis due to their inhibition of trypsin-like proteases. Nafamostat and camostat are currently in clinical trials against COVID19. The rank order potency for the three inhibitors is: nafamostat (IC(50) = 0.27 nM), camostat (IC(50) = 6.2 nM) and gabexate (IC(50) = 130 nM). Further profiling of these three inhibitors against a panel of proteases provides insight into selectivity and potency.","output":"An Enzymatic TMPRSS2 Assay for Assessment of Clinical Candidates and Discovery of Inhibitors as Potential Treatment of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The trial YOURTREAT aims to compare the pragmatic, short-term psychotherapy Narrative Exposure Therapy for Children (KIDNET) with treatment as usual (TAU) for the treatment of young refugees in Germany. This update outlines changes made to the study protocol in response to the current COVID-19 pandemic with the aim of allowing the continuation of the clinical trial while ensuring the safety of the staff and the participants, maintaining methodological quality, and ensuring compliance with legal regulations. METHODS: The major amendments to the original study protocol include (1) the possibility of using telehealth technology for the conduction of diagnostic and therapy sessions, (2) a reduction of the diagnostic set, and (3) an increased flexibility in the time frame of the study protocol. DISCUSSION: The adaptations to the study protocol made it feasible to continue with the trial YOURTREAT during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the diagnostic set had to be shortened, the primary outcomes and the main secondary outcomes remain unimpaired by the amendment. Therefore, we expect the trial to provide evidence regarding effective treatment options for young refugees in Germany, a population that has received little scientific attention so far and has only very limited access to mental health care in the German health care system. In light of the current pandemic, which globally increases the risk of mental problems, the situation for young refugees is likely to aggravate further. Thus, the clinical and social relevance of the present trial YOURTREAT is even more important in these particular times.

In order to understand why this is the case, the opinions of users of engineering design tools were gathered. The results from a survey showing the attitudes of engineers and students with design experience with respect to optimisation algorithms are presented. A survey was designed to answer two research questions: To what extent is there a pre-existing sentiment (negative or positive) among students, engineers, and managers towards genetic algorithm-based design? and What are the requirements of practitioners with regards to design optimisation and the design optimisation process? A total of 23 participants (N = 23) took part in the 3-part mixed methods survey. Thematic analysis was conducted on the open-ended questions. A common thread throughout participants responses is that there is a question of trust towards genetic algorithms within industry. Perhaps surprising is that the key to gaining this trust is not producing good results, but creating algorithms which explain the process they take in reaching a result. Participants have expressed a desire to continue to remain in the design loop. This is at odds with the motivation of a portion of the genetic algorithms community of removing humans from the loop. It is clear we need to take a different approach to increase industrial uptake. Based on this, the following recommendations have been made to increase their use in industry: an increase of transparency and explainability of genetic algorithms, an increased focus on user experience, better communication between developers and engineers, and visualising algorithm behaviour.","output":"It's the Journey Not the Destination: Building Genetic Algorithms Practitioners Can Trust"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Few data are available regarding follow up of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) after their discharge. We aim to describe the long-term outcomes of survivors of hospitalization for COVID-19 followed up first at an outpatient facility and subsequently by telephone. METHODS: Observational prospective study conducted at a tertiary general hospital. Clinical and radiological progression was assessed and data were recorded on a standardized reporting form. Patients were divided into three groups according to Pao2/Fio2 at hospitalization: Pao2/Fio2 >300, Pao2/Fio2 300-200 and Pao2/Fio2 <200. A logistic multivariate regression model was performed to identify factors associated with persistence of symptoms. RESULTS: For facility follow up, 302 individuals were enrolled. Median follow up was 45 days after discharge; 78% (228/294) of patients had COVID-19-related symptoms (53% asthenia, 56% respiratory symptoms) and 40% (122/302) had residual pulmonary radiographic lesions. Pao2/Fio2 <200 was an independent predictor of persistent dyspnoea (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.38-2.52, p < 0.0001). Pao2/Fio2 >300 was associated with resolution of chest radiographic lesions (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.42-0.74, p < 0.0001). Fifty per cent of patients required specific medical follow up after the first consultation and were transferred to another physician. A total of 294 patients were contacted for telephone follow up after a median follow-up time of 7 months. Fifty per cent of patients (147/294) still presented symptoms and 49% (145/294) had psychological disorders. Asthenia was identified in 27% (78/294) and dyspnoea in 10% (28/294) of patients independently of Pao2/Fio2.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 24th, 2020 and March 5th, 2020, 103 patients were studied. Among these, 32 were patients in the isolation ward of the Infectious Disease Department in Baoding Second Hospital with suspected 2019-nCoV, and 71 patients diagnosed with 2019-nCoV were in the Tangshan Infectious Disease Hospital. Of the 103 patients included, 97 cases were observed in isolation. Using a self-control study design, each patient's anxiety was scored on a self-rating anxiety scale before receiving the psychological intervention (on the 7th day of isolation) and after receiving the intervention (on the 14th day of isolation). The severity of anxiety was evaluated based on the anxiety score before receiving the intervention. The anxiety scores before and after receiving the intervention were then compared using the paired t-test, and p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: After receiving the psychological intervention once or twice a week, the anxiety of the patients improved significantly after one week. CONCLUSIONS: The anxiety of patients with 2019-nCoV in isolation wards can be alleviated through psychological intervention.

This retrospective study of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection was conducted to evaluate the association between blood glucose levels and the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia and patient mortality. MATERIAL/METHODS: A total of 268 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in this retrospective study. We obtained demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, laboratory data, and survival information from patients electronic medical records. Blood glucose was measured on admission to the hospital. Comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cardiovascular disease, were collected by self-reported medical history. RESULTS: Significantly higher risks of severe COVID-19 were found in patients with blood glucose levels ranging from 5.53 to 7.27 mmol/L (odds ratio [OR], 3.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.81C8.75) and in patients with blood glucose 7.27 mmol/L (OR, 12.10; 95% CI, 5.53C26.48) than in those with blood glucose <5.53 mmol/L. There was a trend toward better survival in patients with blood glucose <5.53 mmol/L than in patients with blood glucose from 5.53 to 7.27 mmol/L (hazard ratio [HR], 6.34; 95% CI, 1.45C27.71) and 7.27 mmol/L (HR, 19.37; 95% CI, 4.68C80.17).

In ongoing second-trimester pregnancies, however, chorionic bumps usually resolve over time with no deleterious effect on the fetus. In this report, we describe the incidental ultrasound detection of a chorionic bump in early pregnancy and its progression to a subamniotic hematoma in the second trimester of pregnancy that persisted as such until delivery. Case Report: A round, echogenic mass protruding from the choriodecidual surface measuring 13  11  8 mm was first identified during a transvaginal scan at 6.3 weeks' gestation. Subsequent follow-up scan at 8.3 weeks revealed an increase in the size of the chorionic bump to 25  20  19 mm, which remained stable as determined by the routine late first-trimester scan. At the second-trimester scan, a subamniotic hematoma was identified in the surface of the placenta, close to the insertion of the umbilical cord. Subsequently, the pregnancy proceeded uneventfully. Discussion: The etiopathology and clinical significance of a chorionic bump remain unclear. The case herein reported demonstrates that a chorionic bump can grow considerably without having a deleterious effect on the early embryo and, occasionally, can persist throughout pregnancy as a subamniotic hematoma. Conclusion: A chorionic bump can occasionally progress to a subamniotic hematoma from the second trimester onwards. This observation further supports the hypothesis that a chorionic bump is the result of choriodecidual bleeding.

While much progress in this field has been in single image-based mesh estimation, there has been a recent uptick in efforts to infer mesh dynamics from video given its role in alleviating issues such as depth ambiguity and occlusions. However, a key limitation of existing work is the assumption that all the observed motion dynamics can be modeled using one dynamical/recurrent model. While this may work well in cases with relatively simplistic dynamics, inference with in-the-wild videos presents many challenges. In particular, it is typically the case that different body parts of a person undergo different dynamics in the video, e.g., legs may move in a way that may be dynamically different from hands (e.g., a person dancing). To address these issues, we present a new method for video mesh recovery that divides the human mesh into several local parts following the standard skeletal model. We then model the dynamics of each local part with separate recurrent models, with each model conditioned appropriately based on the known kinematic structure of the human body. This results in a structure-informed local recurrent learning architecture that can be trained in an end-to-end fashion with available annotations.

The dataset was extracted from the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) for air pollutants data and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for disease cases from 2009 to 2018. First, this paper applied the ARIMA method, which trained based on the weekly number of disease cases in time series. Second, we implemented the Long short-term memory (LSTM) method, which trained based on the correlation between the weekly number of diseases and air pollutants. The models were also trained and evaluated based on five and ten years of historical data. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) has an excellent model in the five-year dataset of ILI at 2564.9 compared to ten years at 8173.6 of RMSE value. This accuracy is similar to the Respiratory dataset, which gets 15,656.7 in the five-year dataset and 22,680.4 of RMSE value in the ten-year dataset. On the contrary, LSTM has better accuracy in the ten-year dataset than the five-year dataset. For example, on average of RMSE in the ILI dataset, LSTM has 720.2 RMSE value in five years and 517.0 in ten years dataset. Also, in the Respiratory disease dataset, LSTM gets 4768.6 of five years of data and 3254.3 of the ten-year dataset.

METHODS A cross-sectional study design was used. Isometric arm strength (wrist flexion, wrist extension with flexed and extended fingers, elbow flexion/extension) was assessed in 72 children (mean age = 9.3 [SD = 1.9] years) with USCP, and isometric grip/pinch strength was assessed in 86 children (mean age = 9.3 [SD = 1.8] years) with USCP. Arm/grip/pinch strength was assessed in 120 children (mean age = 9.5 [SD = 1.7] years) with TD. Arm strength was measured with a hand-held dynamometer, and grip/pinch strength was measured with a calibrated, modified (digitized) grip dynamometer and a pinch meter. The nonaffected UE of children with USCP was compared with the preferred UE of children with TD, because both sides represent the preferred UE. The affected UE was compared with the nonpreferred UE of children with TD, as both sides represent the nonpreferred UE. RESULTS In all measurements except for grip strength of the preferred UE, children with USCP were weaker than children with TD.

Recent studies propose an active role of coagulation disorders in disease progression. This hypercoagulability has been displayed by marked increase in D-dimer in hospitalized patients. AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, generation of cytokine storm, the interdependence between inflammation and coagulation, its consequences and the possible management options for coagulation complications like venous thromboembolism (VTE), microthrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and systemic and local coagulopathy. We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar for relevant reports using COVID-19, cytokine storm, and coagulation as keywords. EXPERT OPINION: A prophylactic dose of 5000-7500 units of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has been recommended for hospitalized COVID-19 patients in order to prevent VTE. Treatment dose of LMWH, based on disease severity, is being contemplated for patients showing a marked rise in levels of D-dimer due to possible pulmonary thrombi. Additionally, targeting PAR-1, thrombin, coagulation factor Xa and the complement system may be potentially useful in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection induced lung injury, microvascular thrombosis, VTE and related outcomes like DIC and multi-organ failure.","output":"Cytokine storm associated coagulation complications in COVID-19 patients: Pathogenesis and Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The superfamily 1 helicase nonstructural protein 13 (nsp13) is required for SARS-CoV-2 replication.

Here, using optical tweezers, we find that nsp13 unwinding frequency, processivity, and velocity increase substantially when a destabilizing force is applied to the RNA substrate. These results, along with bulk assays, depict nsp13 as an intrinsically weak helicase that can be activated >50-fold by piconewton forces. Such force-dependent behavior contrasts the known behavior of other viral monomeric helicases, such as hepatitis C virus NS3, and instead draws stronger parallels to ring-shaped helicases.

With Coronavirus Disease (COVID)-19, everything has happened too fast and both cases and fatalities are huge but still uncertain in most places. Diagnostic testing of active and past SARS-CoV-2 infections needs to expand rapidly, ideally using rapid tests.

For others such as lopinavir/ritonavir, neither significant virological nor clinical benefit has been shown. Given the characteristic pulmonary cytokine storm underlying the pathogenic mechanism of severe COVID-19 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress, antiinflammatory agents are being investigated. The benefit of orticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, etc., is limited.

Limited data exist on the epidemiology of ICU-acquired infections in China. This retrospective study was carried out to determine the current status of nosocomial infection in China. METHODS: A retrospective review of nococomial infections in the ICU of a tertiary hospital in East China between 2003 and 2007 was performed. Nosocomial infections were defined according to the definitions of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The overall patient nosocomial infection rate, the incidence density rate of nosocomial infections, the excess length of stay, and distribution of nosocomial infection sites were determined. Then, pathogen and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were further investigated. RESULTS: Among 1980 patients admitted over the period of time, the overall patient nosocomial infection rate was 26.8% or 51.0 per 1000 patient days., Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) accounted for most of the infections (68.4%), followed by urinary tract infections (UTI, 15.9%), bloodstream (BSI, 5.9%), and gastrointestinal tract (GI, 2.5%) infections. There was no significant change in LRTI, UTI and BSI infection rates during the 5 years. However, GI rate was significantly decreased from 5.5% in 2003 to 0.4% in 2007. In addition, A. baumannii, C. albicans and S. epidermidis were the most frequent pathogens isolated in patients with LRTIs, UTIs and BSIs, respectively. The rates of isolates resistant to commonly used antibiotics ranged from 24.0% to 93.1%. CONCLUSION: There was a high and relatively stable rate of nosocomial infections in the ICU of a tertiary hospital in China through year 2003C2007, with some differences in the distribution of the infection sites, and pathogen and antibiotic susceptibility profiles from those reported from the Western countries.

Published data on changes in medication use after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, a type of bariatric surgery that is growing in popularity, are limited. OBJECTIVE To determine whether patients took fewer medications for management of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, relative to preprocedure medications. METHODS In this prospective, single-centre cohort study, a nurse practitioner used standard medication reconciliation and study data-extraction forms to interview adult patients who had undergone laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and determine their medication use and pertinent demographic data. The data were analyzed using generalized estimating equations and standard statistical software. Outcome measures included changes in the use of antidiabetic, antihypertensive, and antilipemic medications at 1, 3, and 6 months after the surgery. RESULTS A total of 65 patients who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy between May 2011 and January 2014 met the study inclusion criteria. Before surgery, the 30 patients with type 2 diabetes were taking an average of 1.9 antidiabetic medications. One month after the procedure, 15 (50%) had discontinued all antidiabetic medications, with a further decline at 3 and 6 months (p < 0.001 at each time point). Among the patients who were taking antihypertensives (n = 48) and antilipemics (n = 33) before surgery, the decline in use occurred at a more modest rate, with 6 (12%) and 2 (6%), respectively, discontinuing these medication classes within 1 month, and 12 (25%) (p = 0.001) and 8 (24%) (p = 0.015) having discontinued by 6 months.

Our previous study showed that MBs could detect bladder cancer cells and cells shed in the urine from patients with bladder cancer. METHODS Samples from 35 patients with bladder cancer and 35 healthy adults were initially evaluated. Cyanine 3-labeled MBs linked to a survivin mRNA probe were used to detect exfoliative cells in urine. Exfoliative cytology, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Western blotting of the tissues were used to confirm the MB results. We then evaluated the urine samples from 187 patients with suspected bladder cancer. All 187 patients also underwent cystoscopy. RESULTS In the initial cohort evaluated, MBs detected cancerous cells in 28 (80%) of the 35 patients with confirmed bladder cancer. Survivin protein was detected by Western blotting in 25 (71.4%) of the 35 patients. The sensitivity and specificity of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was 54.3% (20 of 35) and 68.6% (24 of 35), respectively. In a large group of patients with suspected bladder cancer, the sensitivity of MBs was 77.3% (85 of 110) and the specificity was 76.6% (59 of 77) compared with the cystoscopy data. Differences in the protein levels between the tumor grades and stages were not significant.

We compared the SARS-CoV-2 S-specific total and neutralizing antibody (Ab) responses, and B and T cell immunity, in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) and blood of COVID-19 vaccinated individuals and hospitalized patients. Vaccinated individuals had significantly lower levels of neutralizing Ab against D614G, Delta and Omicron in the BAL compared to COVID-19 convalescents, despite robust S-specific Ab responses in the blood. Further, mRNA vaccination induced significant circulating S-specific B and T cell immunity, but in contrast to COVID-19 convalescents, these responses were absent in the BAL of vaccinated individuals. Using an animal immunization model, we demonstrate that systemic mRNA vaccination alone induced weak respiratory mucosal neutralizing Ab responses, especially against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron; however, a combination of systemic mRNA vaccination plus mucosal adenovirus-S immunization induced strong neutralizing Ab response, not only against the ancestral virus but also the Omicron variant. Together, our study supports the contention that the current COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective against severe disease development, likely through recruiting circulating B and T cell responses during re-infection, but offer limited protection against breakthrough infection, especially by Omicron.

Here we determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on latency to presentation and clinical outcomes for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study of all patients presenting to a single center in Atlanta, Georgia, USA with aSAH between 2012 and 2020. COVID-19 was first reported in Georgia on March 2, 2020. All patients presenting from March 2nd through June 30th of a given calendar year were compared from the pre-COVID-19 era (2012- 2019) to the COVID-19 era (2020). Patient characteristics, latency from ictus to presentation, and clinical outcomes were compared. Every index digital subtraction angiogram was scored for the presence of vasospasm, and all cranial imaging studies were reviewed for infarcts consistent with delayed cerebral ischemia. Results 470 patients presented with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage during the study period. 433 and 37 presented before and during the COVID-19 era, respectively. Compared to the pre-COVID-19 era patients, patients presenting during the early phase of the pandemic were more likely to delay presentation (2.3  1.3 days vs. 0.9  2.2 days, respectively, p<0.01). Delays to presentation were driven by low and mid-grade subarachnoid hemorrhage patients (2.8 3.1 days vs. 1.0  2.2 days, p<0.01) with no differences noted in high-grade subarachnoid hemorrhage patients. The COVID-19 era was independently associated with significantly increased rates of angiographic vasospasm on presentation (aOR 2.52, 1.01 - 6.29, p = .048), delayed cerebral ischemia (aOR 3.84, 1.74 - 8.50, p=.001), and in-hospital aneurysmal re-rupture (aOR 5.75, 1.05 - 31.54, p=.044).

The disease, caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis, is currently treated effectively with antibiotics. However, in the case of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, alternative treatments are required. Bacteriophage (phage) therapy has shown efficient antibacterial activity in various experimental animal models and in human patients infected with different MDR pathogens. Here, we evaluated the efficiency of A1122 and PST phage therapy, alone or in combination with second-line antibiotics, using a well-established mouse model of pneumonic plague. Phage treatment significantly delayed mortality and limited bacterial proliferation in the lungs. However, the treatment did not prevent bacteremia, suggesting that phage efficiency may decrease in the circulation. Indeed, in vitro phage proliferation assays indicated that blood exerts inhibitory effects on lytic activity, which may be the major cause of treatment inefficiency. Combining phage therapy and second-line ceftriaxone treatment, which are individually insufficient, provided protection that led to the survival of all infected animalsa synergistic protective effect that represents a proof of concept for efficient combinatorial therapy in an emergency event of a plague outbreak involving MDR Y. pestis strains.","output":"Phage Therapy Potentiates Second-Line Antibiotic Treatment against Pneumonic Plague"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Here, we report for the first time DNA aptamers targeted toward the COVID-19 nucleocapsid protein (Np).

We describe a technique for a SPA transabdominal combined with transanal approach to perform laparoscopic proctectomy with total mesorectal excision (TME) and intersphincteric resection of low rectal adenocarcinoma. METHOD Transanal intersphincteric resection was followed by laparoscopic abdominal proctectomy with TME. An SPA device was placed at the site of the future stoma through a 2.5-cm incision. A hand-sewn side-to-end coloanal anastomosis was performed and a terminal loop ileostomy was created at the site of the SPA device. RESULTS The procedure was performed on two healthy nonobese women who had not had previous abdominal surgery. The operating times were 195 and 210 min, and blood loss < 250 ml. The postoperative course was uneventful, with discharge on postoperative days 5 and 6. Pathological examination revealed adequate surgical margins and lymph node retrieval with an intact mesorectum. Four weeks after stoma closure, the scar in the right lower quadrant was 35 mm in one patient and 45 mm in the other, and the scar from the 5-mm port was barely visible.

Understanding the activation mechanism of NTSR1 is an important prerequisite for exploring the therapeutic potential of targeting NTSR1 and the development of drug molecules specific to NTSR1. Previous studies have been aimed at elucidating the structure of NTSR1 in the active and inactive conformations; however, the intermediate molecular pathway for NTSR1 activation dynamics is largely unknown. In this study, we performed extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the NTSR1 protein and analyzed its kinetic conformational changes to determine the microswitches that drive NTSR1 activation. To biophysically interpret the high-dimensional simulation trajectories, we used Markov state models and machine learning to elucidate the important and detailed conformational changes in NTSR1.

Their estimation usually requires solving a mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem, where the segmentation is the discrete part and all other model parameters are continuous. A number of estimation algorithms have been developed that are highly specialized for their specific model assumptions. The dependence on non-standard algorithms makes it hard to integrate segmented models in state-of-the-art deep learning architectures that critically depend on gradient-based optimization techniques. In this work, we formulate a relaxed variant of segmented models that enables joint estimation of all model parameters, including the segmentation, with gradient descent. We build on recent advances in learning continuous warping functions and propose a novel family of warping functions based on the two-sided power (TSP) distribution. TSP-based warping functions are differentiable, have simple closed-form expressions, and can represent segmentation functions exactly. Our formulation includes the important class of segmented generalized linear models as a special case, which makes it highly versatile.

Since the COVID-19 epidemic has a negative impact on all countries and has become a significant threat, it is necessary to determine the most effective strategy for governments by considering a variety of criteria;however, few studies in the literature can assist governments in this topic. Selective governmental intervention during the COVID-19 outbreak is considered a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) problem under a vague and uncertain environment when governments and medical communities adjust their priorities in response to rising issues and the efficacy of interventions applied in various nations. In this study, a novel hybrid Spherical Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (SF-AHP) and Fuzzy Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS-F) model is proposed to help stakeholders such as governors and policymakers to prioritize governmental interventions for dealing with the COVID-19 outbreak. The SF-AHP is implemented to measure the significance of the criteria, while the WASPAS-F approach is deployed to rank intervention alternatives. An empirical case study is conducted in Vietnam. From the SF-AHP findings, the criteria of effectiveness in preventing the spread of COVID-19, ease of implementation, and high acceptability to citizens were recognized as the most important criteria. As for the ranking of strategies, vaccinations, enhanced control of the countrys health resources, common health testing, formation of an emergency response team, and quarantining patients and those suspected of infection are the top five strategies. Aside from that, the robustness of the approach was tested by performing a comparative analysis. The results illustrate that the applied methods reach the general best strategy rankings. The applied methodology and its analysis will provide insight to authorities for fighting against the severe pandemic in the long run. It may aid in solving many complicated challenges in government strategy selection and assessment. It is also a flexible design model for considering the evaluation criteria.

The immunological mechanisms underlying these age-related differences in clinical outcomes remain unexplained. Here, we quantify 23 immune cell populations in 141 samples from children and adults with mild COVID-19 and their PCR-negative close household contacts at acute and convalescent time points. Children with COVID-19 displayed marked reductions in myeloid cells during infection, most prominent in children under the age of five. Recovery from infection in both children and adults was characterised by the generation of CD8 T(CM) and CD4 T(CM) up to 9 weeks post infection. SARS-CoV-2-exposed close contacts also had immunological changes over time despite no evidence of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection on PCR testing. This included an increase in low-density neutrophils during convalescence in both exposed children and adults, as well as increases in CD8 T(CM) and CD4 T(CM) in exposed adults. In comparison to children with other common respiratory viral infections, those with COVID-19 had a greater change in innate and T cell-mediated immune responses over time.

METHODS: Data was collected from Maltas only acute general hospital using health records and computer databases including iSoft Clinical Manager (ICM) and Electronic Case Summaries (ECS). Data was collected for 1/3-9/5/2019 (control period) and the corresponding 2020 period (study period). RESULTS: Acute paediatric medical admissions dropped by 63.5%. Neonates increased by 5.25% (p = 0.001). An increase in child abuse/social paediatric cases (p < 0.001) was noted. Data analysed after school closure revealed a significant drop in the number of communicable (infectious) disease admissions (p < 0.001). There was also a negative correlation between daily paediatric admissions and active COVID-19 cases in Malta (p = 0.005). No significant delay in the presentation of patients was noted and no increased admissions to the NPICU was recorded.

Therefore mutations in proteins that govern cell tropism, such as the spike glycoprotein, may play an important role in FIP progression. In a prior study, involving a limited number of samples, we have shown an association of FIP with mutations in the protease cleavage-activation site located between the receptor-binding and fusion domains of the FCoV spike (S1/S2). Here, we extend these studies to investigate a larger sample set and to obtain a more refined analysis of the mutations at this S1/S2 site. Our larger data set more clearly shows that the mutations acquired by FIPV at S1/S2 are also accompanied by additional mutations at a second protease cleavage-activation site located in the fusion domain (S2'), adjacent to the viral fusion peptide. Overall, our data indicate a pattern of mutations across the two protease recognition sites that results in substitutions, and/or altered recognition, of critical basic/polar amino acid residues needed for virus activation in the enteric tract. Typically, FIPVs have substitutions of non-polar, aliphatic or aromatic residues in the protease recognition sites.

OBJECTIVE: This study, as the first report of the structure and function of the pan-genome of Mycoplasma anatis, may provide a valuable genetic basis for many aspects of future research on the pathogens of waterfowl. METHODS: We sequenced the whole genomes of 15 Mycoplasma anatis isolated from ducks in China. Draft genome sequencing was carried out and whole-genome sequencing was performed by the sequencers of the PacBio Sequel and an IonTorrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM). Then the common genic elements of protein-coding genes, tRNAs, and rRNAs of Mycoplasma anatis genomes were predicted by using the pipeline Prokka v1.13.7. To investigate homologous protein clusters across Mycoplasma anatis genomes, we adopted Roary v3.13.0 to cluster orthologous genes (OGs) based on the following criteria. RESULTS: We obtained one complete genome and 14 genome sketches. Microbial mobile genetic element analysis revealed the distribution of insertion sequences (IS30, IS3, and IS1634), prophage regions, and CRISPR arrays in the genome of Mycoplasma anatis. Comparative genomic analysis decoded the genetic components and functional classification of the pan-genome of Mycoplasma anatis that comprised 646 core genes, 231 dispensable genes and among them 110 was strain-specific. Virulence-related gene profiles of Mycoplasma anatis were systematically identified, and the products of these genes included bacterial ABC transporter systems, iron transport proteins, toxins, and secretion systems. CONCLUSION: A complete virulence-related gene profile of Mycoplasma anatis has been identified, most of the genes are highly conserved in all strains. Sequencing results are relevant to the molecular mechanisms of drug resistance, adaptive evolution of pathogens, population structure, and vaccine development.

A vast majority (98.6%) of the respondents had registered to be vaccinated. Twenty participants (4.7%) expressed concerns about either registering or receiving the COVID-19 vaccination, mainly due to their uncertainty of vaccine safety. Approximately 77.5% received their vaccinations. Of them, 76.8% had experienced vaccine-related side effects. About 40% of the side effects occurred more with the second dose, particularly those who received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (p < 0.001). Pain at the injection site (61.1%) and tiredness (48.8%) were the most reported side effects.

This microvascular complication of diabetes is termed diabetic retinopathy (DR) and is associated with an expanding risk of cardiovascular events in diabetes patients. DR, in its various forms, is seen to be a powerful indicator of atherosclerosis. Further, the macrovascular complication of diabetes leads to coronary artery disease (CAD). Thus, the timely identification of cardiovascular disease (CVD) complications in DR patients is of utmost importance. Since CAD risk assessment is expensive for low-income countries, it is important to look for surrogate biomarkers for risk stratification of CVD in DR patients. Due to the common genetic makeup between the coronary and carotid arteries, low-cost, high-resolution imaging such as carotid B-mode ultrasound (US) can be used for arterial tissue characterization and risk stratification in DR patients. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques has facilitated the handling of large cohorts in a big data framework to identify atherosclerotic plaque features in arterial ultrasound. This enables timely CVD risk assessment and risk stratification of patients with DR. Thus, this review focuses on understanding the pathophysiology of DR, retinal and CAD imaging, the role of surrogate markers for CVD, and finally, the CVD risk stratification of DR patients. The review shows a step-by-step cyclic activity of how diabetes and atherosclerotic disease cause DR, leading to the worsening of CVD. We propose a solution to how AI can help in the identification of CVD risk.

RESULTS: Lung parenchyma showed severe DAD with thromboemboli. Viral infection was found in an extensive range of cells including pneumocyte type II, ciliated, goblet, club-like and endothelial cells. Over 90% infiltrating immune cells were positive for viral proteins including macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, and natural killer (NK), B and T cells. Most but not all infected cells were ACE2-positive. The numbers of infected and ACE2-positive cells are associated with extensive tissue damage. Infected tissues exhibited high inflammatory cells including macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils and NK cells, and low B- but abundant T-cells consisting of mainly T helper cells, few cytotoxic T cells, and no T regulatory cell. Robust interleukin-6 expression was present in most cells, with or without infection.

For ultimate treatment to cure T2DM, association of diabetes with immune components provides a strong basis for immunotherapies and vaccines developments that could stimulate the immune cells to minimize the insulin resistance and initiate gluconeogenesis through an insulin independent route. METHODOLOGY: Immunoinformatics based approach was used to design a polyvalent vaccine for T2DM that involved data accession, antigenicity analysis, T-cell epitopes prediction, conservation and proteasomal evaluation, functional annotation, interactomic and in silico binding affinity analysis. RESULTS: We found the binding affinity of antigenic peptides with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class-I molecules for immune activation to control T2DM. We found 13-epitopes of 9 amino acid residues for multiple alleles of MHC class-I bears significant binding affinity. The downstream signaling resulted by T-cell activation is directly regulated by the molecular weight, amino acid properties and affinity of these epitopes. Each epitope has important percentile rank with significant ANN IC(50) values. These high score potential epitopes were linked using AAY, EAAAK linkers and HBHA adjuvant to generate T-cell polyvalent vaccine with a molecular weight of 35.6 kDa containing 322 amino acids residues. In silico analysis of polyvalent construct showed the significant binding affinity (? 15.34 Kcal/mol) with MHC Class-I.

METHODS: Based on the reference sequences of S protein, physical and chemical properties, hydrophobicity, signal peptide, transmembrane region, domain, secondary structure, tertiary structure analysis and antigenic epitopes prediction were carried out. Meanwhile, the tissue expression, related pathways and reactome pathways of angiotensis a converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and C-type lectin domain family 4 member M (CLEC4M) receptors were analyzed. RESULTS: The amino acid sequence of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV has a 75.80% consistency. The structural characteristics of the two coronaviruses are highly consistent, but the secondary structure and tertiary structure of SARS-CoV-2 is not as obvious as SARS-CoV. ACE2 and CLEC4M are expressed in alimentary system, heart, kidney, lung and placenta. The main related the pathways of renin-angiotensin system, protein digestion and absorption pathway, and the reactome pathways of metabolism of angiotensinogen to angiotensins, GPCR ligand binding, are related to typical symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 induced by SARS-CoV-2.

Compared with short-acting, immediate-release (IR) formulations, ER and oral long-acting opioid analgesics are associated with clinical advantages, such as extended periods of time during which drug plasma levels are within the therapeutic range, decreased peak-to-trough fluctuations, and prolonged analgesia over the dosing period. Additionally, ER opioids offer a more convenient, less frequent dosing regimen to chronic pain patients who are often taking several concomitant medications. The increased utilization of ER opioids has been accompanied by a rise in the misuse and abuse of these formulations. Certain pharmacokinetic parameters (e.g., longer time to maximum drug plasma concentration, lower maximum drug plasma concentration) may decrease the abuse potential of intact ER opioids by limiting the positive subjective and reinforcing effects relative to IR formulations. Putative abuse-deterrent formulations have also recently been introduced to impede physical manipulation of these formulations, or reduce the harm resulting from such behavior.

Since the first confirmed case was reported on January 31, 2020, there have been over 405,000 cases and 28,000 deaths in Spain. The economic and social impact is without precedent. Thus, it is important to quickly assess the situation and perception of the population. Large-scale online surveys have been shown to be an effective tool for this purpose. OBJECTIVE: We aim to assess the situation and perception of the Spanish population in four key areas related to the COVID-19 pandemic: social contact behavior during confinement, personal economic impact, labor situation, and health status. METHODS: We obtained a large sample using an online survey with 24 questions related to COVID-19 in the week of March 28-April 2, 2020, during the peak of the first wave of COVID-19 in Spain. The self-selection online survey method of nonprobability sampling was used to recruit 156,614 participants via social media posts that targeted the general adult population (age >18 years). Given such a large sample, the 95% CI was 0.843 for all reported proportions. RESULTS: Regarding social behavior during confinement, participants mainly left their homes to satisfy basic needs. We found several statistically significant differences in social behavior across genders and age groups. The population's willingness to comply with the confinement measures is evident. From the survey answers, we identified a significant adverse economic impact of the pandemic on those working in small businesses and a negative correlation between economic damage and willingness to stay in confinement. The survey revealed that close contacts play an important role in the transmission of the disease, and 28% of the participants lacked the necessary resources to properly isolate themselves. We also identified a significant lack of testing, with only 1% of the population tested and 6% of respondents unable to be tested despite their doctor's recommendation. We developed a generalized linear model to identify the variables that were correlated with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. Using this model, we estimated an average of 5% for SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in the Spanish population during the time of the study. A seroprevalence study carried out later by the Spanish Ministry of Health reported a similar level of disease prevalence (5%). CONCLUSIONS: Large-scale online population surveys, distributed via social media and online messaging platforms, can be an effective, cheap, and fast tool to assess the impact and prevalence of an infectious disease in the context of a pandemic, particularly when there is a scarcity of official data and limited testing capacity.","output":"Assessing the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Spain: Large-Scale, Online, Self-Reported Population Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 (Zero Hunger) aims to end all forms of hunger and malnutrition by 2030.

METHODS: We scrutinized published research articles in peer-reviewed journals, UN reports and in-country Africa reports (between 2015 and 2020) that were relevant to the current topic. RESULTS: Several hunger indicators are showing slow progress or even deterioration in Africa. The prevalence of undernourishment in the general population was 19.1% in 2019 and is expected to increase to 25.7% by 2030. Improvements in child stunting in several regions in Africa are slow, especially in sub-Saharan Africa where about 34% of under-fives were stunted in 2012 and 31% in 2019. In Eastern Africa, stunting prevalence decreased from 38% in 2012 to 34% in 2019. Major drivers of hunger are poor governance and state fragility, war and conflicts, increasing inequality, weak economic development, climate change, biodegradation C and now lately the Covid 19 pandemic C factors that all increase food insecurity.

However, endotracheal tube impaction by highly viscous sputum occurred during this mechanical ventilation system. Replacing the endotracheal tube, the use of a humidifier instead of a heat moisture exchanger, and prone positioning contributed to the patient being weaned off mechanical ventilation. Although anti-aerosol measures are important for severe COVID-19 pneumonia, attention should be given to potential endotracheal tube impaction during mechanical ventilation.","output":"Humidifier Use and Prone Positioning in a Patient with Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia and Endotracheal Tube Impaction Due to Highly Viscous Sputum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory diseases kill million of people each year.

The recent COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the need of developing systems to automatize the diagnosis of pneumonia, whilst Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) have proved to be an excellent option for the automatic classification of medical images. However, given the need of providing a confidence classification in this context it is crucial to quantify the reliability of the model's predictions. In this work, we propose a multi-level ensemble classification system based on a Bayesian Deep Learning approach in order to maximize performance while quantifying the uncertainty of each classification decision. This tool combines the information extracted from different architectures by weighting their results according to the uncertainty of their predictions. Performance of the Bayesian network is evaluated in a real scenario where simultaneously differentiating between four different pathologies: control vs bacterial pneumonia vs viral pneumonia vs COVID-19 pneumonia. A three-level decision tree is employed to divide the 4-class classification into three binary classifications, yielding an accuracy of 98.06% and overcoming the results obtained by recent literature. The reduced preprocessing needed for obtaining this high performance, in addition to the information provided about the reliability of the predictions evidence the applicability of the system to be used as an aid for clinicians.","output":"Uncertainty-driven ensembles of deep architectures for multiclass classification.

They must be effective tools for fast detection and diagnose of the virus using a large number of tests;besides, they should be low-cost developments. While a chest x-ray scan is a powerful candidate tool, if several tests are carried out, the images produced by the devices must be interpreted accurately and rapidly. COVID-19 induces longitudinal pulmonary parenchymal ground-glass and consolidates pulmonary opacity, in some cases with rounded morphology and peripheral lung distribution, which is very difficult to predict in an early stage. Aim In this paper, we aim to develop a robust model to extract high-level features of COVID-19 from chest x-ray (CXR) images to help in rapid diagnosis. In specific, this paper proposes an optimization model for COVID-19 diagnosis based on adaptive Fuzzy C-means (AFCM) and improved Slime Mould Algorithm (SMA) based on Lvy distribution, namely AFCM-LSMA. Methods The SMA optimizer is proposed to adapt weights in oscillation mode and to mimic the process of generating positive and negative feedback from the propagation wave to shape the optimum path for food connectivity. Lvy motion is used as a permutation to perform a local search and to adapt SMA optimizer (LSMA) by generating several solutions that are apart from current candidates. Furthermore, it permits the optimizer to escape from local minima, examine large search areas and reach optimal solutions in fewer iterations with high convergence speed. The FCM algorithm is used to segment pulmonary regions from CXR images and is adapted to reduce time and amount of computations using histogram of the image intensities during the clustering process. Results The performance of the proposed AFCM-LSMA has been validated on CXR images and compared with different conventional machine learning and deep learning techniques, meta-heuristics methods, and different chaotic maps. The accuracies achieved by the proposed model are around (ACC=0.96, RMSE=0.23, Prec.=0.98, F1_score=0.98, MCC=0.79, and Kappa=0.79). Conclusion The experimental findings indicate that the proposed new method outperforms all other methods, which will be beneficial to the clinical practitioner for the early identification of infected COVID-19 patients.","output":"AFCM-LSMA: New Intelligent Model based on Lvy Slime Mould Algorithm and Adaptive Fuzzy C-means for Identification of COVID-19 Infection from Chest X-ray Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Enormous hope in the efficacy of vaccines became recently a successful reality in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. However, vaccine hesitancy, fueled by exposure to social media misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines became a major hurdle. Therefore, it is essential to automatically detect where misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines on social media is spread and what kind of misinformation is discussed, such that inoculation interventions can be delivered at the right time and in the right place, in addition to interventions designed to address vaccine hesitancy. This paper is addressing the first step in tackling hesitancy against COVID-19 vaccines, namely the automatic detection of known misinformation about the vaccines on Twitter, the social media platform that has the highest volume of conversations about COVID-19 and its vaccines. We present CoVaxLies, a new dataset of tweets judged relevant to several misinformation targets about COVID-19 vaccines on which a novel method of detecting misinformation was developed.

OBJECTIVE This study aims to statistically compare the outcomes of the two strategies, represented by data from Thailand and Sweden, respectively. METHODS Data for COVID-19 pandemic control from Thailand, representing social restriction, versus data from Sweden, representing the herd immunity plan, collected from January 13 to May 31, 2020, were analyzed by using the SIR (susceptible, infectious, recovered) model. RESULTS The SIR model analysis demonstrated a beneficial effect of each model on the attenuation of the mortality rate, with lower mortality in social restriction and shorter overall pandemic duration in the herd immunity plan. However, the herd immunity plan demonstrated a higher mortality rate than social restriction (46.9% versus 1.9%) despite the later entry of the virus in Sweden. When the SIR model was used for predicting the COVID-19 status, Sweden was shown to likely end its COVID-19 epidemic earlier than Thailand (268 vs. 368 days). With the nonlinear estimation, at least one log difference between total confirmed cases versus active cases could be used as an indicator for relaxation of the lockdown policy in Thailand. CONCLUSIONS Both the social restriction and herd immunity plans are beneficial for COVID-19 pandemic control in terms of the amelioration of pandemic mortality. The cumulative number of total recovered cases might be a potential parameter that could be used for determining the policy direction for COVID-19 control.","output":"Social restriction versus herd immunity policies in the early phase of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: A mathematical modelling study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The current COVID-19 pandemic has been identified as a possible trigger for increases in loneliness and social isolation among older people due to the restrictions on movement that many countries have put in place. Loneliness and social isolation are consistently identified as risk factors for poor mental and physical health in older people. Video calls may help older people stay connected during the current crisis by widening the participant's social circle or by increasing the frequency of contact with existing acquaintances. OBJECTIVES The primary objective of this rapid review is to assess the effectiveness of video calls for reducing social isolation and loneliness in older adults. The review also sought to address the effectiveness of video calls on reducing symptoms of depression and improving quality of life. SEARCH METHODS We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and CINAHL from 1 January 2004 to 7 April 2020. We also searched the references of relevant systematic reviews. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (including cluster designs) were eligible for inclusion. We excluded all other study designs. The samples in included studies needed to have a mean age of at least 65 years. We included studies that included participants whether or not they were experiencing symptoms of loneliness or social isolation at baseline. Any intervention in which a core component involved the use of the internet to facilitate video calls or video conferencing through computers, smartphones or tablets with the intention of reducing loneliness or social isolation, or both, in older adults was eligible for inclusion. We included studies in the review if they reported self-report measures of loneliness, social isolation, symptoms of depression or quality of life. Two review authors screened 25% of abstracts; a third review author resolved conflicts. A single review author screened the remaining abstracts. The second review author screened all excluded abstracts and we resolved conflicts by consensus or by involving a third review author. We followed the same process for full-text articles. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS One review author extracted data, which another review author checked. The primary outcomes were loneliness and social isolation and the secondary outcomes were symptoms of depression and quality of life. One review author rated the certainty of evidence for the primary outcomes according to the GRADE approach and another review author checked the ratings. We conducted fixed-effect meta-analyses for the primary outcome, loneliness, and the secondary outcome, symptoms of depression. MAIN RESULTS We identified three cluster quasi-randomised trials, which together included 201 participants. The included studies compared video call interventions to usual care in nursing homes. None of these studies were conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Each study measured loneliness using the UCLA Loneliness Scale. Total scores range from 20 (least lonely) to 80 (most lonely). The evidence was very uncertain and suggests that video calls may result in little to no difference in scores on the UCLA Loneliness Scale compared to usual care at three months (mean difference (MD) -0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.28 to 2.41; 3 studies; 201 participants), at six months (MD -0.34, 95% CI -3.41 to 2.72; 2 studies; 152 participants) and at 12 months (MD -2.40, 95% CI -7.20 to 2.40; 1 study; 90 participants). We downgraded the certainty of this evidence by three levels for study limitations, imprecision and indirectness. None of the included studies reported social isolation as an outcome. Each study measured symptoms of depression using the Geriatric Depression Scale. Total scores range from 0 (better) to 30 (worse). The evidence was very uncertain and suggests that video calls may result in little to no difference in scores on the Geriatric Depression Scale compared to usual care at three months' follow-up (MD 0.41, 95% CI -0.90 to 1.72; 3 studies; 201 participants) or six months' follow-up (MD -0.83, 95% CI -2.43 to 0.76; 2 studies, 152 participants). The evidence suggests that video calls may have a small effect on symptoms of depression at one-year follow-up, though this finding is imprecise (MD -2.04, 95% CI -3.98 to -0.10; 1 study; 90 participants). We downgraded the certainty of this evidence by three levels for study limitations, imprecision and indirectness. Only one study, with 62 participants, reported quality of life. The study measured quality of life using a Taiwanese adaptation of the Short-Form 36-question health survey (SF-36), which consists of eight subscales that measure different aspects of quality of life: physical function; physical role; emotional role; social function; pain: vitality; mental health; and physical health. Each subscale is scored from 0 (poor health) to 100 (good health). The evidence is very uncertain and suggests that there may be little to no difference between people allocated to usual care and those allocated to video calls in three-month scores in physical function (MD 2.88, 95% CI -5.01 to 10.77), physical role (MD -7.66, 95% CI -24.08 to 8.76), emotional role (MD -7.18, 95% CI -16.23 to 1.87), social function (MD 2.77, 95% CI -8.87 to 14.41), pain scores (MD -3.25, 95% CI -15.11 to 8.61), vitality scores (MD -3.60, 95% CI -9.01 to 1.81), mental health (MD 9.19, 95% CI 0.36 to 18.02) and physical health (MD 5.16, 95% CI -2.48 to 12.80). We downgraded the certainty of this evidence by three levels for study limitations, imprecision and indirectness. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Based on this review there is currently very uncertain evidence on the effectiveness of video call interventions to reduce loneliness in older adults. The review did not include any studies that reported evidence of the effectiveness of video call interventions to address social isolation in older adults. The evidence regarding the effectiveness of video calls for outcomes of symptoms of depression was very uncertain. Future research in this area needs to use more rigorous methods and more diverse and representative participants. Specifically, future studies should target older adults, who are demonstrably lonely or socially isolated, or both, across a range of settings to determine whether video call interventions are effective in a population in which these outcomes are in need of improvement.","output":"Video calls for reducing social isolation and loneliness in older people: a rapid review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Soft, skin-integrated electronic sensors can provide continuous measurements of diverse physiological parameters, with broad relevance to the future of human health care.

Moreover, we explored households that are satisfied even when they are unable to go out and clarified how children and their parents who live in the central area perceive the current situation. The study results indicate that the risks of COVID-19 in large cities have spatial characteristics and increase the burden on households raising children. Particularly in the central area, which has a high population density, the changes children experience are striking. Furthermore, due to the inadequate amount of open space, a strong awareness of the new normal (avoiding the Three Cs (closed spaces, crowded places, and close-contact settings) is required.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 life on the Tokyo metropolitan area households with primary school-aged children: A study based on spatial characteristics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease (COVID\\\\19) has been identified as a pandemic and affected almost whole world.

In this study, we developed a recombinant fowlpox virus (rFPV) vaccine expressing the IBV S1 gene and chicken interleukin-18 gene (IL-18), rFPV-S1/IL18. Recombinant plasmid pSY-S1/IL18 was constructed by cloning chicken IL-18 into fowlpox virus transfer plasmid containing S1 gene and transfected into the chicken embryo fibroblasts cell pre-infected with S-FPV-017 to generate rFPV-S1/IL18. Expression of the recombinant proteins was confirmed by RT-PCR and IFA. We also constructed the recombinant fowlpox virus rFPV-S1 without IL-18. One-day-old chickens were vaccinated by wing-web puncture with the two rFPVs, and the induced humoral and cellular responses were evaluated. There was a significant difference in ELISA antibody levels (P < 0.05) elicited by either rFPV-S1 or rFPV-S1/IL18. The ratios of CD4(+) to CD8(+) in chickens immunized with rFPV-S1/IL18 were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than in those immunized with rFPV-S1. All chickens immunized with rFPV-S1/IL18 were completely protected (20/20) after challenge with the virulent IBV HN99 strain 43 days after immunization, while only 15 out of 20 of the chickens immunized with the rFPV-S1 were protected.

Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive technology that has been recently applied in the field of wildlife science to evaluate various aspects of animal physiology and may have potential as an in vivo technique for determining biological sex in live amphibian species. This study investigated whether NIRS could be used as a rapid and non-invasive method for discriminating biological sex in the endangered Houston toad (Anaxyrus houstonensis). NIR spectra (N = 396) were collected from live A. houstonensis individuals (N = 132), and distinct spectral patterns between males and females were identified using chemometrics. Linear discriminant analysis (PCA-LDA) classified the spectra from each biological sex with accuracy  98% in the calibration and internal validation datasets and 94% in the external validation process. Through the use of NIRS, we have determined that unique spectral signatures can be holistically captured in the skin of male and female anurans, bringing to light the possibility of further application of this technique for juveniles and sexually monomorphic species, whose sex designation is important for breeding-related decisions.","output":"Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) as a Method for Biological Sex Discrimination in the Endangered Houston Toad (Anaxyrus houstonensis)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As COVID-19 run rampant in high-density housing sites, it is important to use real-time data in tracking the virus mobility. Emerging cluster detection analysis is a precise way of blunting the spread of COVID-19 as quickly as possible and save lives. To track compliable mobility of COVID-19 on a spatial-temporal scale, this research appropriately analyzed the disparities between spatial-temporal clusters, expectation maximization clustering (EM), and hierarchical clustering (HC) analysis on Texas county-level. Then, based on the outcome of clustering analysis, the sensitive counties are Cottle, Stonewall, Bexar, Tarrant, Dallas, Harris, Jim hogg, and Real, corresponding to Southeast Texas analysis in Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) modeling. The sensitive period took place in the last two quarters in 2020 and the first quarter in 2021. We explored PostSQL application to portray tracking Covid-19 trajectory. We captured 14 social, economic, and environmental impacts indices to perform principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and minimize multicollinearity. By using the PCA, we extracted five factors related to mortality of COVID-19, involved population and hospitalization, adult population, natural supply, economic condition, air quality or medical care. We established the GWR model to seek the sensitive factors. The result shows that adult population, economic condition, air quality, and medical care are the sensitive factors. Those factors also triggered high increase of COVID-19 mortality.

Effective antiviral therapy is important for tackling these patients. We assessed the efficacy and safety of favipiravir for treating these patients. METHODS: This is a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial in SARS-CoV-2 RNA re-positive patients. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either favipiravir, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone. The primary outcome was time to achieve a consecutive twice (at intervals of more than 24 h) negative RT-PCR result for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swab and sputum sample. RESULTS: Between March 27 and May 9, 2020, 55 patients underwent randomization; 36 were assigned to the favipiravir group and 19 were assigned to the control group. Favipiravir group had a significantly shorter time from start of study treatment to negative nasopharyngeal swab and sputum than control group (median 17 vs. 26 days); hazard ratio 2.1 (95% CI [1.1-4.0], p = 0.038). The proportion of virus shedding in favipiravir group was higher than control group (80.6% [29/36] vs. 52.6% [10/19], p = 0.030, respectively). C-reactive protein decreased significantly after treatment in the favipiravir group (p = 0.016). The adverse events were generally mild and self-limiting. CONCLUSION: Favipiravir was safe and superior to control in shortening the duration of viral shedding in SARS-CoV-2 RNA recurrent positive after discharge. However, a larger scale and randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is required to confirm our conclusion.","output":"Favipiravir in the treatment of patients with SARS-CoV-2 RNA recurrent positive after discharge: A multicenter, open-label, randomized trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 patients requiring treatment with blockers of the reninangiotensin- aldosterone system (RAAS) are at highest risk of developing pneumonia and dying ACE2 is the functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 Animal studies suggest that RAAS blocking agents might increase the expression of ACE2 and hence potentially increase the risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies on the association of RASS blocking agents with lung disease related outcomes Results: The effect of ACE inhibitor treatment on the incidence of pneumonia in non-COVID-19 patients was analyzed in 25 studies (330,780 patients) ACE inhibitor use was associated with a 27% reduction of pneumonia risk (OR: 0 73, p&lt;0 001) Pneumonia related death cases in ACE inhibitor treated non-COVID-19 patients were reduced by 27% (OR: 0 73, p=0 004) ARB treatment was analyzed in 10 studies (275,621 non- COVID-19 patients) The risk of pneumonia was not different between patients who did or did not use ARBs Pooled result from 13 studies (27,704 COVID-19 patients) showed that COVID-19 related severe adverse clinical outcomes were not different between patients who did or did not use RAAS blocking agents (OR: 0 87, p=0 28) All-cause mortality risk in COVID-19 patients was reduced by 27% (p=0 04) Conclusions: Given the weak evidence coming from animal studies and the clear beneficial data of ACE inhibition in non-COVID-19 patients and the limited but promising data in COVID-19 patients, the use of RAAS blocking agents in patients with SARSCoV- 2 infection is justified Further clinical studies analysing ARBs and ACE inhibitors separately in COVID-19 patients are needed","output":"Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blocking drugs in patients with SARS-COV-2: Systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The Gambia introduced seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) in August 2009, followed by PCV13 in May, 2011, using a schedule of three primary doses without a booster dose or catch-up immunisation. We aimed to assess the long-term impact of PCV on disease incidence. METHODS We did 10 years of population-based surveillance for invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and WHO defined radiological pneumonia with consolidation in rural Gambia. The surveillance population included all Basse Health and Demographic Surveillance System residents aged 2 months or older. Nurses screened all outpatients and inpatients at all health facilities using standardised criteria for referral. Clinicians then applied criteria for patient investigation. We defined IPD as a compatible illness with isolation of Streptococcus pneumoniae from a normally sterile site (cerebrospinal fluid, blood, or pleural fluid). We compared disease incidence between baseline (May 12, 2008-May 11, 2010) and post-vaccine years (2016-2017), in children aged 2 months to 14 years, adjusting for changes in case ascertainment over time. FINDINGS We identified 22 728 patients for investigation and detected 342 cases of IPD and 2623 cases of radiological pneumonia. Among children aged 2-59 months, IPD incidence declined from 184 cases per 100 000 person-years to 38 cases per 100 000 person-years, an 80% reduction (95% CI 69-87). Non-pneumococcal bacteraemia incidence did not change significantly over time (incidence rate ratio 088; 95% CI, 064-121). We detected zero cases of vaccine-type IPD in the 2-11 month age group in 2016-17. Incidence of radiological pneumonia decreased by 33% (95% CI 24-40), from 105 to 70 per 1000 person-years in the 2-59 month age group, while pneumonia hospitalisations declined by 27% (95% CI 22-31). In the 5-14 year age group, IPD incidence declined by 69% (95% CI -28 to 91) and radiological pneumonia by 27% (95% CI -5 to 49). INTERPRETATION Routine introduction of PCV13 substantially reduced the incidence of childhood IPD and pneumonia in rural Gambia, including elimination of vaccine-type IPD in infants. Other low-income countries can expect substantial impact from the introduction of PCV13 using a schedule of three primary doses.
