The aim of this paper is to evaluate the health care for patients with classical phenylketonuria in Poland. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We reviewed the National Health Fund's reporting data concerning information on healthcare services for patients with classical phenylketonuria (PKU), which were reported to the payer by the healthcare service providers between 2009 and 2015. The analysis was prepared within the framework of mapping the health care needs of patients with metabolic diseases published in December 2016 (http://www.mapypotrzebzdrowotnych.mz.gov.pl/). RESULTS: A total of 2706 patients with PKU (including 1180 children) were registered in the healthcare system in the period covered. The estimated national prevalence of PKU was 1 per 7758 live births. Paediatric patients up to 12 moths of age accounted for over 40% of all visits to outpatient clinics. Patients over 28 years of age accounted for only 1% of all PKU patients receiving specialist outpatient care. There were twice as many clinics providing health care to children than to adults. The majority of adult patients received healthcare from the same providers as children. Sixty-nine percent of adults and 64% of children were treated in the two largest outpatient centres. There were 12 deaths, with a median age of 63 years. The working-age adults accounted for 50% of the deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Adult patients with PKU do not receive sufficient healthcare. The discontinuation of healthcare by adults with PKU can result from the lack of an adequate transition process from paediatric to adult care.","output":"Leczenie fenyloketonurii w Polsce w latach 2009-2015 na podstawie bazy danych Narodowego Funduszu Zdrowia./ Treatment of classic phenylketonuria in Poland in the years 2009-2015 based on the database of the Polish National Health Fund"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has infected 33 million Americans and resulted in more than 600,000 deaths as of late Spring 2021.

We review the racial/ethnic health disparities in COVID-19 illness and vaccination rates and what inequities contribute to these disparities. We use evidence from the seasonal influenza vaccination efforts to inform potential strategies to attenuate these inequities. The development of effective and sustainable strategies to improve vaccination rates and reduce factors that result in health inequities is essential in managing current and future pandemics and promoting improved health for all communities.","output":"COVID-19 Healthcare Inequity: Lessons Learned from Annual Influenza Vaccination Rates to Mitigate COVID-19 Vaccine Disparities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background: Medical publications about anosmia with COVID-19 are scarce.

Although the HC sector is growing rapidly in the USA, there is high job turnover among the HC aide workforce. HC provides an important alternative to facility-based care, yet it has often been overlooked within the larger health care system: most recently, in COVID-19 pandemic planning. The objective of the study was to characterize qualitatively the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on three key HC stakeholders: clients, aides, and agency managers. METHODS: The study included 37 phone interviews conducted during April C November 2020: HC clients (n = 9), aides (n = 16), and agency managers (n = 12). All interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Qualitative analysis of the transcripts followed the grounded theory approach. The interview transcriptions were coded line-by-line into hierarchical themes with NVivo 12 software which allowed weighting of themes based on the number of interviews where they were coded. RESULTS: Fear of infection and transmission among HC clients and aides were strong themes. Infection prevention and control became the top priority guiding day-to-day business operations at agencies; sourcing adequate personal protective equipment for staff was the most urgent task. HC aides expressed concerns for their clients who showed signs of depression, due to increased isolation during the pandemic. The disappearance of comforting touch C resulting from physical distancing practices C altered the expression of compassion in the HC aide-client care relationship. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the pandemic has further increased psychosocial job demands of HC aides. Increased isolation of clients may be contributing to a wider public health problem of elder loneliness and depression. To support the HC stakeholders during the on-going COVID-19 pandemic, for future pandemic planning or other health emergencies, it is important to improve HC aide job retention. This action could also ease the serious care services shortage among the growing population of older adults.

During the first year of the pandemic, affected countries implemented a variety of non-pharmaceutical interventions to control virus transmission. In December 2020, countries started administering several authorised vaccines under a limited supply scenario. In this context, a SEIR-type continuous-time deterministic disease model was developed to explore the effect of vaccination in terms of vaccination rate and efficacy, together with varying non-pharmaceutical protection measures, on disease incidence in the initial phase of vaccination. For this, the model incorporates (i) a protection measure including low (self-protection), medium (mobility limitation), high (closure of indoor facilities) and very high (lockdown) protection levels, (ii) quarantine for confirmed cases, and (iii) vaccination rate and efficacy of four type of vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna, Astra Zeneca or Janssen). The model was verified and evaluated using the response timeline and vaccination strategies and rates in the Basque Country (N. Spain). Once the model performance was validated, different initial phase (when 30% of the population is vaccinated) vaccination scenarios were simulated, including (i) a realistic vaccine limited supply scenario, and (ii) four potential full vaccine supply scenarios where a unique vaccine type is administered. The Pfizer scenario resulted in the lowest prevalence of infection and cumulative mortality, particularly for low- and medium-level protection rates. However, regardless of the administered vaccine, a high-level protection scenario is the most effective to control the virus transmission and disease mortality in the studied initial phase of vaccination. The model here, which is based on this example, could be easily applied to other regions or countries, modifying the strategies implemented and initial conditions.","output":"Modelling the effect of the interaction between vaccination and non-pharmaceutical measures on COVID-19 incidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This book is part of the Human Centered Book Trilogy, the 2021 volumes of the Routledge Human Centered Management HCM Series HCM books are pioneering transformation from the traditional humans-as-a-resource approach of the industrial past, to the humans at the center management and organizational paradigm of the 21st century HCM is built on talent and wellbeing of people in the workplace driving work engagement, quality standards, high performance and productivity for long-term organizational sustainability in the global VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex, ambiguous) environment This book was carefully crafted by recognized international human centered scholars from four continents Although all organizations seek to have an optimal culture, unstoppable disruptions in the VUCA environment easily derail even the best efforts Conventional assumptions of culture as a unifying organizational force are hardly defendable today HCM maintains that culture is not only about cohesiveness and consensus but effective management of conflict and disagreements continuously testing the capacity of people to work together This book is about organizational transformation positioning people at the center Complementary chapters integrate as antidotes to overcome disruptions in the VUCA environment and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic affecting people and organizations worldwide This and its two complementary titles Soft Skills for Human Centered Management and Global Sustainability and Sensible Leadership: Human Centered, Insightful and Prudent are timely readings for leaders, managers, researchers, academics, practitioners, students and the general public responsible for organizations across industries and sectors worldwide pursuing quality standards and organizational transformation to attain sustainability ?

METHODS: This study combines the multi-source data from the health data platform DXY, the airline data platform Airsavvi, the China Economic Internet Statistical Database and the China Railway website. The megacities whose airports have a passenger throughput of over 30 million per year (11 megacities: Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Shenzhen, Kunming, Xi'an, Chongqing, Hangzhou, Nanjing) are included in the analysis. The regression analysis is conducted in this study. RESULTS: The curvilinear relationship between the limitation on air traffic and confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus disease is identified (coefficient of the linear term = ?4.650, p-value < 0.01; coefficient of the quadratic term = 4.089, p-value < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the effectiveness of airline transport regulation in suppressing the development of this pandemic. The limitation on air traffic is found to negatively affect the confirmed cases in China's megacities. However, such effect marginally recedes as the strength of limitation intensifies.

For this reason, COVID-19 vaccine administration in pregnancy has been endorsed by multiple professional societies including ACOG and SMFM despite exclusion of pregnant women from initial clinical trials of vaccine safety and efficacy. However, to date little data exists regarding outcomes after COVID-19 vaccination of pregnant patients. STUDY DESIGN: : A comprehensive vaccine registry was combined with a delivery database for an integrated healthcare system to create a delivery cohort including vaccinated patients. Maternal sociodemographic data were examined to identify factors associated with COVID-19 vaccination. Pregnancy and birth outcomes were analyzed, including a composite measure of maternal and neonatal pregnancy complications, the Adverse Outcome Index. RESULTS: : Of 2002 patients in the delivery cohort, 140 (7.0%) received a COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy and 212 (10.6%) experienced a COVID-19 infection during pregnancy. The median gestational age at first vaccination was 32 weeks (range 13 6/7-40 4/7), and patients vaccinated during pregnancy were less likely than unvaccinated patients to experience COVID-19 infection prior to delivery (1.4% (2/140) vs. 11.3% (210/1862), P<0.001). No maternal COVID-19 infections occurred after vaccination during pregnancy. Factors significantly associated with increased likelihood of vaccination in a multivariable logistic regression model included older age, higher level of maternal education, being a non-smoker, use of infertility treatment for the current pregnancy, and lower gravidity. No significant difference in the composite adverse outcome (5.0% (7/140) vs. 4.9% (91/1862), P=0.95) or other maternal or neonatal complications, including thromboembolic events and preterm birth, was observed in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated patients. CONCLUSIONS: : Vaccinated pregnant women in this birth cohort were less likely to experience COVID-19 infection compared to unvaccinated pregnant patients, and COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy was not associated with increased pregnancy or delivery complications.

One-third of participants reported a lack of communication with the patients and a decrease in desire to work (31.1%, 35.6%). A-moderate-severe anxiety was detected in 24.6%. Physical contact with infected people, being physically harmed by -preventive measures, decreased desire to work, and a lack of communication with the patients were found to be -significantly more in participants with anxiety (P = .036, P &lt; .001, P &lt; .001, P &lt; .001). In multivariate analyzes, being -physically harmed by preventive measures was the only risk factor for anxiety (OR = 7.423, CI: 2.050-26.877, P = .002). Conclusion: During the pandemic period, anxiety was observed in one-fourth of HCPs. Being physically harmed by preventive measures is the only risk factor for anxiety.","output":"Prevalence and Influencing Factors of Anxiety in Healthcare Professionals in Hemodialysis During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron1 Variant of Concern (B.1.1.529) has spread rapidly in many countries. With a spike that is highly diverged from that of the pandemic founder, it escapes most available monoclonal antibody therapeutics2,3 and erodes vaccine protection4. A public class of IGHV3-53-using SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies5,6 typically fails to neutralize variants carrying mutations in the receptor-binding motif7C11, including Omicron. As antibodies from this class are likely elicited in most people following SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination, their subsequent affinity maturation is of particular interest. Here, we isolated IGHV3-53-using antibodies from an individual seven months after infection and identified several antibodies capable of broad and potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, extending to Omicron without loss of potency. By introducing select somatic hypermutations into a germline-reverted form of one such antibody, CAB-A17, we demonstrate the potential for commonly elicited antibodies to develop broad cross-neutralization through affinity maturation. Further, we resolved the structure of CAB-A17 Fab in complex with Omicron spike at an overall resolution of 2.6 ? by cryo-electron microscopy and defined the structural basis for this breadth. Thus, public SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies can, without modified spike vaccines, mature to cross-neutralize exceptionally antigenically diverged SARS-CoV-2 variants.","output":"Structural basis of Omicron neutralization by affinity-matured public antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immunomonitoring is the study of an individual's immune responses over the course of vaccination or infection In the infectious context, exploring the innate and adaptive immune responses will help to investigate their contribution to viral control or toxicity After vaccination, immunomonitoring of the correlate(s) and surrogate(s) of protection is a major asset for measuring vaccine immune efficacy Conventional immunomonitoring methods include antibody-based technologies that are easy to use However, promising sensitive high-throughput technologies allowed the emergence of holistic approaches This raises the question of data integration methods and tools These approaches allow us to increase our knowledge on immune mechanisms as well as the identification of key effectors of the immune response However, the depiction of relevant findings requires a well-rounded consideration beforehand about the hypotheses, conception, organization and objectives of the immunomonitoring Therefore, well-standardized and comprehensive studies fuel insight to design more efficient, rationale-based vaccines and therapeutics to fight against infectious diseases Hence, we will illustrate this review with examples of the immunomonitoring approaches used during vaccination and the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"Strategies for Immunomonitoring after Vaccination and during Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ACE2 has emerged as a double agent in the COVID-19 ordeal being physiologically protective yet conducive of viral infection The identification of ACE2 in as many as 72 tissues suggests that extra-pulmonary invasion and damage is likely, which indeed has already been demonstrated by cardiovascular and gastro-intestinal symptoms On the other hand, identifying ACE2 dysregulation in patients with co-morbidities may offer insight as to why COVID-19 symptoms are often more severe in these individuals This may be attributed to a pre-existing pro-inflammatory state that is further propelled with the cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection or the loss of functional ACE2 expression as a result of viral internalization Here, we aim to characterize the distribution and role of ACE2 in various organs in order to highlight the scope of damage that may arise upon SARS-CoV-2 invasion Furthermore, by examining the disruption of ACE2 in several co-morbid diseases, we offer insight into potential causes of increased severity of COVID-19 symptoms in certain individuals Significance Statement Cell surface expression of ACE2 determines the tissue susceptibility for COVID-19 infection Co-morbid disease conditions altering ACE2 expression could increase the patient's vulnerability for the disease and its complications directly through modulation of viral infection, or indirectly through alteration of inflammatory status","output":"Dysregulation of ACE2 Expression and Function in Co-morbid Disease Conditions Possibly Contributes to COVID-19 Complication Severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Undergraduate biology students often graduate without exposure to authentic research experiences.

We prepare students to carry-out scientific protocols that can be applied to a future workforce setting. Students are immersed in a 10-week series of labs with the objective to use molecular cloning to make a novel gene therapy vector; therapies are designed to inhibit the expression of genes of the virus that causes Covid-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Students are introduced to PubMed and GenBank to research the background of SARS-CoV-2 and its target genes; the Spike gene (S), the membrane gene (M) the nucleocapsid gene (N) and the envelope gene (E). Students use the DNA software, Serial Cloner, as a tool to evaluate DNA sequences and mFOLD to analyze RNA structure. Students generate and visualize the design of an antisense gene therapy directed against one of the target viral genes. Using our gene therapy platform, students generate a vector with a unique target. Subsequently student-generated vectors were transfected into mammalian tissue culture cells that express one of the target genes (S, M, N or E) and RNA and protein was collected to measure the efficacy of the gene therapy vector to reduce the expression of the target viral gene.

In this study, statistical analyses of the literature were performed to clarify the application and research status of PCT in respiratory diseases. Future research directions are discussed. METHODS A literature search was conducted using the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) database in the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC). Published literature between 1995 and February 6, 2021 were searched using the following strategies: subject term = procalcitonin; and Web of Science categories = Respiratory System. Using the Citespace software, the literature on the application of PCT in patients with respiratory diseases was analyzed in terms of annual publication status, subject distribution, country/institution distribution, journal distribution, author distribution, and keywords. RESULTS A total of 542 related research literatures were identified, with the number of published papers and the number of literature citations increasing yearly. Research was mainly concentrated in the United States, China, Switzerland, and other countries, with countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada being involved in international collaborations. Research institutions were mainly universities or hospitals such as the University Hospital of Basel, University of Barcelona, and Northwestern University. In particular, the University Hospital of Basel had extensive inter-hospital collaborations. Stolz et al. published many related papers, but the centrality value was low. Authors including Christ-Crain M, Schuetz P, and Stolz D were highly cited. Journals such as the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Chest, and the European Respiratory Journal were more influential.

Whether it had any impact on coronary angiography (CA) volume or on mechanical support device use for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and post-STEMI mechanical complications in Canada is unknown. Methods We administered a Canada-wide survey to all Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory Directors seeking the volume of CA for STEMI performed during 01/03/2020-31/05/2020 (pandemic period) and from two control periods (01/03/2019-31/05/2019 and 01/03/2018-31/05/2018). The number of left ventricular support devices used, as well as the number of ventricular septal defects or papillary muscle rupture cases diagnosed, were also recorded. We also assessed if the number of COVID-19 cases recorded in each province was associated with STEMI CA volume. Results Forty-one out of 42 Canadian catheterization laboratories (98%) provided data. There was a modest but statistically significant 16% reduction (Incidence Rate Ratio or IRR 0.84; 95%CI 0.80-0.87) in CA for STEMI during the first wave of the pandemic compared to control periods. IRR was not associated with provincial COVID-19 caseload. We observed a 26% reduction (IRR 0.74; 95%CI 0.61-0.89) in the use of intra-aortic balloon pump in STEMI.

Demographic and clinical features, treatments, laboratory results, imaging findings, and clinical outcomes of the patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and/or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) were retrieved from the medical records. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was made based on the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test. RESULTS: The most common rheumatic diseases were juvenile idiopathic arthritis and familial Mediterranean fever (35.6% and 34.5%, respectively). Twenty-six of these patients were treated with biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. SARS-CoV-2 infection was tested as positive in 84 (96.5%) patients. Also, 51 (58.6%) patients had an epidemiological contact to a person with COVID-19. Eighteen patients met the clinical criteria and diagnosed with MIS-C. The COVID-19 outbreak also caused exacerbation of systemic disease in 56 children due to medication cessation, postponed drug switch, or recurrent viral infection. CONCLUSION: Children with rheumatic disease do not appear to present a higher risk of severe COVID-19.

Most research to-date on this topic focuses on either: (a) identifying individuals at risk or with a certain mental health condition given a batch of posts or (b) providing equivalent labels at the post level. A disadvantage of such work is the lack of a strong temporal component and the inability to make longitudinal assessments following an individual's trajectory and allowing timely interventions. Here we define a new task, that of identifying moments of change in individuals on the basis of their shared content online. The changes we consider are sudden shifts in mood (switches) or gradual mood progression (escalations). We have created detailed guidelines for capturing moments of change and a corpus of 500 manually annotated user timelines (18.7K posts). We have developed a variety of baseline models drawing inspiration from related tasks and show that the best performance is obtained through context aware sequential modelling.

PATIENT CONCERNS: A 77-year-old female with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia who presented as a transfer to our hospital facility with worsening fevers, cough, and respiratory distress. DIAGNOSIS: Chest X-rays revealed bilateral infiltrates worse at the lung bases and CT scan of the chest showed bilateral ground-glass opacities consistent with COVID-19. While our testing revealed a negative COVID-19 result at our institution, the result at a previous hospital returned a positive result. INTERVENTIONS: She was being treated aggressively in the intensive care unit with high dose intravenous ascorbic acid, hydroxychloroquine, and anti-interleukin-6 monoclonal antibody. She also received a loading dose of remdesivir however was unable to complete the course due to organ failure and requirement of vasopressors for hemodynamic stability. OUTCOMES: She remained critically ill and was eventually placed on comfort care as per the family's wishes and passed away. LESSONS: With a rapidly growing death rate and more than 200,000 confirmed cases worldwide, COVID-19 has become a global pandemic and major hit to our healthcare systems. While several companies have already begun vaccine trials and healthcare facilities have been using a wide-range of medications to treat the virus and symptoms, there is not yet an approved medication regimen for COVID-19 infections.

Delirium risk is highest in elderly populations, whose surgical health care resource consumption (50%) exceeds their demographic proportion (15% to 18%) in high-resource countries. Effective nonpharmacologic delirium prevention could safely improve care in these vulnerable patients, but data from procedure-specific studies are insufficiently compelling to drive changes in practice. Delirium prevention approaches applicable to different surgical settings remain unexplored. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether a multifaceted prevention intervention is effective in reducing postoperative delirium incidence and prevalence after various major surgical procedures. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial recruited 1470 patients 70 years and older undergoing elective orthopedic, general, or cardiac surgery from November 2017 to April 2019 from 5 German tertiary medical centers. Data were analyzed from December 2019 to July 2021. INTERVENTIONS: First, structured delirium education was provided to clinical caregivers at each site. Then, the study delirium prevention team assessed patient delirium risk factors and symptoms daily. Prevention was tailored to individual patient needs and could include: cognitive, motor, and sensory stimulation; meal companionship; accompaniment during diagnostic procedures; stress relaxation; and sleep promotion. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Postoperative delirium incidence and duration. RESULTS: Of 1470 included patients, 763 (51.9%) were male, and the median (IQR) age was 77 (74-81) years. Overall, the intervention reduced postoperative delirium incidence (odds ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77-0.98; P = .02) and percentage of days with delirium (intervention, 5.3%; control, 6.9%; P = .03).

Tissue factor (TF) is the primary cellular initiator of coagulation. Most of the TF expressed on cell surfaces remains cryptic. Sphingomyelin (SM) is responsible for maintaining TF in the encrypted state, and hydrolysis of SM by acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) increases TF activity. ASMase was shown to play a role in virus infection biology. In the present study, we investigated the role of ASMase in SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced TF procoagulant activity. Infection of human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) with SARs-CoV-2 spike protein pseudovirus (SARS-CoV-2-SP-PV) markedly increased TF procoagulant activity at the cell surface and released TF+ extracellular vesicles (EVs). The pseudovirus infection did not increase either TF protein expression or phosphatidylserine externalization. SARS-CoV-2-SP-PV infection induced the translocation of ASMase to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, which led to the hydrolysis of SM in the membrane. Pharmacological inhibitors or genetic silencing of ASMase attenuated SARS-CoV-2-SP-PV-induced increased TF activity. Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2, attenuated SARS-CoV-2-SP-PV-induced increased TF activity.

SETTING: General practices in the Midlands, South East and South West England. Interviews were conducted in February and March 2021, as England began to unlock from its third national lockdown. PARTICIPANTS: Practice nurses (n=12), healthcare assistants (n=7), advanced nurse practitioners (n=4) and nursing associates (n=1) recruited using convenience and snowball sampling. RESULTS: Three themes were identified. Difficult changes describes dramatic changes made to general practice at the onset of the pandemic, creating confusion and anxiety. Dealing with change characterises how negative emotions were intensified by fear of infection, problematic government guidance, personal protective equipment (PPE) shortages and friction with doctors; but could be mitigated through effective practice communication, peer support and individual coping strategies. An opportunity for improvement highlights certain changes (eg, the increased use of telehealth) that participants believed could be adopted long term to improve efficiency. CONCLUSION: General practice should learn from the COVID-19 pandemic to nurture the clinical role and resilience of nurses and healthcare assistants in the postpandemic new normal. Robust PPE provision could enable them to undertake their patient-facing duties safely and confidently. Judicious implementation of telehealth could help preserve the practical and caring nature of nursing. Improving channels of communication and interprofessional collaboration could help realise their potential within the primary care team.","output":"What can general practice learn from primary care nurses and healthcare assistants experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic?

Due to its far-reaching effect on human health, there is an urgent and growing need to understand the viral molecular biology of SARS-CoV-2 and its interaction with the host cell. SARS-CoV-2 encodes 9 predicted accessory proteins, which are presumed to be dispensable for in vitro replication, most likely having a role in modulating the host cell environment to aid viral replication. Here we show that the ORF6 accessory protein interacts with cellular Rae1 to inhibit cellular protein production by blocking mRNA export. We utilised cell fractionation coupled with mRNAseq to explore which cellular mRNA species are affected by ORF6 expression and show that ORF6 can inhibit the export of many mRNA including those encoding antiviral factors such as IRF1 and RIG-I. We also show that export of these mRNA is blocked in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Together, our studies identify a novel mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 can manipulate the host cell environment to supress antiviral responses, providing further understanding to the replication strategies of a virus that has caused an unprecedented global health crisis. Author Summary SARS-CoV-2 is the virus responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic. Coronaviruses, like SARS-CoV-2, replicate their genome in the cytoplasm of the host cell by hijacking the cellular machinery. In addition to structural proteins and viral enzymes, SARS-CoV-2 encodes 9 accessory proteins. Although these are not required for in vitro replication, they are thought to modulate the host cell environment to favour viral replication. In this work, we show that the ORF6 accessory protein can supress cellular protein production by blocking mRNA nuclear export through interacting with the cellular protein Rae1, a known mRNA export factor. We also investigated which cellular mRNAs were retained in the nucleus when ORF6 was overexpressed. Interestingly, we found that ORF6 inhibited the export of many different mRNAs, including those encoding antiviral factors, like IRF1 and RIG-I, even in the absence of stimulation by interferon. Importantly, we found that the export of these mRNAs was similarly affected in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, we believe we have identified a novel mechanism that SARS-CoV-2 uses to suppress antiviral responses in order to make the cell more permissive to infection.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 disrupts innate immune signalling by inhibiting cellular mRNA export"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Observation of gravitational waves (GWs) in two different frequency bands is referred to as {\\\\it multiband GW astronomy}. With the planned Laser Interferometric Space Antenna (LISA) operating in the $10^{-4}-0.1$ Hz range, and third generation (3G) ground-based detectors such as the Cosmic Explorer (CE) and Einstein Telescope (ET), operating in the $1$--$10^4$ Hz range, multiband GW astronomy could be a reality in about a decade. In this paper we present the potential of multiband observations of intermediate mass binary black holes (IMBBHs) of component masses \${\\\\sim}10^2$--$10^3M_{\\\\odot}$ to test general relativity (GR). We show that mutiband observations of IMBBHs would permit multiparameter tests of GR---tests where more than one post-Newtonian (PN) coefficient is simultaneously measured yielding more rigorous constraints on possible modifications to GR. We also find that the improvement due to multibanding can often be much larger than the best of the bounds from either of the two observatories. The origin of this result, as we shall demonstrate, can be traced to the lifting of degeneracies among the various parameters when the information from LISA and 3G are taken together. We obtain the best multiband bounds for an IMBBH with a total redshifted mass of $200M_{\\\\odot}$ and a mass ratio of 2. For single-parameter tests, this system at 1 Gpc would allow us to constrain the deviations on all the PN coefficients to below 10\\\\% and derive simultaneous bounds on the first seven PN coefficients to below 50\\\\% (with low spins).","output":"Tests of general relativity using multiband observations of intermediate mass binary black hole mergers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this work, we consider an epidemic model for corona-virus (COVID-19) with random perturbations as well as time delay, composed of four different classes of susceptible population, the exposed population, the infectious population and the quarantine population.

Materials: /methods: We tested 176 NOS samples of COVID-19 recovered patients who were followed up at the Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli IRCCS in Rome from 21 April to 18 June 2020, according to our COVID-19 care protocol. The RT-PCR tests were performed using the Allplex? 2019-nCoV and the Quanty COVID-19 assays (for total RNA detection and quantification, respectively) and an in-house assay (for replicative RNA detection). Results: : Of 176 NOS samples studied, 32 (18.2%) tested positive for total RNA, with C T values ranging from 29.3 to 38.8 for E, RdRP, and N genes (9 samples), 32.2 to 39.3 for RdRP and N genes (7 samples) or 35.8 to 39.8 for the N gene (16 samples). Consistently, viral loads ranged from 1.6  10 1 to 1.3  10 4 RNA copies/mL. Interestingly, we found replicative RNA in only one of 32 positive samples based on the presence of E-gene sub-genomic RNA ( C T value of 39.1). The C T value (29.3) of E-gene genomic RNA in this sample was the lowest among the C T values of all 9 samples in which the E gene was detected. Testing samples obtained from the 32 patients at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis showed that the C T values ranged from 17.1 to 38.1 for E, RdRP, and N genes. Of note, the mean C T value of E-gene sub-genomic RNA (34.9) in these samples differed of 9.0  2.8 from the mean C T value of E-gene genomic RNA (25.9). Finally, all but one of the 32 patients had positive serology results against SARS-CoV-2.

While dysregulated or inadequate IFN responses have been associated with severe coronavirus infection, the extent to which the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 activates or antagonizes these pathways is relatively unknown. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infects patient-derived nasal epithelial cells, present at the initial site of infection; induced pluripotent stem cell-derived alveolar type 2 cells (iAT2), the major cell type infected in the lung; and cardiomyocytes (iCM), consistent with cardiovascular consequences of COVID-19 disease. Robust activation of IFN or OAS-RNase L is not observed in these cell types, whereas PKR activation is evident in iAT2 and iCM. In SARS-CoV-2Cinfected Calu-3 and A549(ACE2) lung-derived cell lines, IFN induction remains relatively weak; however, activation of OAS-RNase L and PKR is observed. This is in contrast to Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, which effectively inhibits IFN signaling and OAS-RNase L and PKR pathways, but is similar to mutant MERS-CoV lacking innate immune antagonists. Remarkably, OAS-RNase L and PKR are activated in MAVS knockout A549(ACE2) cells, demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 can induce these host antiviral pathways despite minimal IFN production. Moreover, increased replication and cytopathic effect in RNASEL knockout A549(ACE2) cells implicates OAS-RNase L in restricting SARS-CoV-2.

According to research, early prediction and prevention can effectively reduce the incidence rate of the disease. However, it is difficult to predict the ischaemic stroke because the data related to the disease are multi-modal. To achieve high accuracy of prediction and combine the stroke risk predictors obtained by previous researchers, a method for predicting the probability of stroke occurrence based on a multi-model fusion convolutional neural network structure is proposed. In such a way, the accuracy of ischaemic stroke prediction is improved by processing multi-modal data through multiple end-to-end neural networks. In this method, the feature extraction of structured data (age, gender, history of hypertension, etc.) and streaming data (heart rate, blood pressure, etc.) based on a convolutional neural network is first realized. A neural network model for feature fusion is then constructed to realize the feature fusion of structured data and streaming data. Finally, a predictive model for predicting the probability of stroke is obtained by training. As shown in the experimental results, the accuracy of ischaemic stroke prediction reached 98.53%. Such a high prediction accuracy will be helpful for preventing the occurrence of stroke.","output":"The Probability of Ischaemic Stroke Prediction with a Multi-Neural-Network Model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Cytomegalovirus [CMV] is a frequent infection in solid organ transplant recipients and the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine has been associated with transient lymphopenia, which could be a risk factor to consider for CMV replication. Case Report A 51-year-old man with arterial hypertension and a history of repaired complex congenital heart disease, which required a heart transplant [HT] in 2019. He had a high risk CMV missmatch (D+/R-). Routine HT follow up tests after the first year were normal, with neither signs of rejection nor allograft vascular disease. His immunosuppressive treatment consisted in Tacrolimus 5 mg once a day, Mycophelonate 500 mg twice a day, and Prednisone 5 mg a day. 77 weeks after his heart transplant, two doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine were inoculated separated by 28 days. After 4 days of the second dose, he developed fever, diarrhea, and general malaise. The physical findings were abdominal pain, slight hepatomegaly and several painful gum lesions. Laboratory tests showed severe lymphopenia; and elevated C-reactive protein. CMV by polymerase chain reaction was tested positive with 228.356 copies/ml. The decision was to admit him and to initiate intravenous ganciclovir 5 mg/kg twice a day and to reduce the immunosuppressive treatment. He completed a course of 15 days with ganciclovir, and then continued with valganciclovir 900 mg twice a day. Early after ganciclovir start, clinical manifestations gradually disappeared. Due to persistent lymphopenia, mycophenolate was switched to everolimus. After 60 days of antiviral treatment, CMV loading was below detection range (Image 1). Summary The probability of favoring CMV replicability after mRNA COVID-19 vaccine has not been yet described. We here present a case of CMV primoinfection closely related in time with a full mRNA COVID-19 vaccine administration. We hypothesize that lymphopenia and a high risk CMV could be factors to consider at the time of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine administration.

SAMPLE 550 respondent veterinarian members of the Veterinary Information Network (VIN). PROCEDURES An anonymous online survey was used to gather data from VIN-member veterinarians in small animal general practice regarding their perceptions and use of synchronous video-based telemedicine. Two emails to all VIN members were used to distribute the web-based questionnaire. For consistency, only responses from North American veterinarians who reported working in small animal general practice were included in analyses. Responses were collected between September 28, 2020, and October 21, 2020. RESULTS There were 69,488 recipients and 680 respondents (1.0% response rate), 550 of whom had North American internet protocol addresses and reported working in small animal general practice. Not all respondents answered all questions. Use of video-based telemedicine substantially increased among respondents during the COVID-19 pandemic, and most (86/130 [66.2%]) reported little to no difficulty in adopting videoconferencing. Respondents also reported that telemedicine took less time (61/135 [45.2%]) and resulted in less financial compensation (103/135 [76.3%]) than in-person consultation.

Adapting to new technologies can be difficult for older people. Thus, to better apply these technologies to older adults lives, many studies have analyzed the acceptance factors for this particular population. However, there is not yet a consensual framework that can be used in further development and to search for solutions. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to present an integrated acceptance framework (IAF) for older users acceptance of eHealth based on 43 studies selected through a systematic review. METHODS: We conducted a 4-step study. First, through a systematic review in the field of eHealth from 2010 to 2020, the acceptance factors and basic data for analysis were extracted. Second, we conducted a thematic analysis to group the factors into themes to propose an integrated framework for acceptance. Third, we defined a metric to evaluate the impact of the factors addressed in the studies. Finally, the differences among the important IAF factors were analyzed according to the participants health conditions, verification time, and year. RESULTS: Through a systematic review, 731 studies were found in 5 major databases, resulting in 43 (5.9%) selected studies using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) methodology. First, the research methods and acceptance factors for eHealth were compared and analyzed, extracting a total of 105 acceptance factors, which were grouped later, resulting in an IAF. A total of 5 dimensions (ie, personal, userCtechnology relational, technological, service-related, and environmental) emerged, with a total of 23 factors. In addition, we assessed the quality of evidence and then conducted a stratification analysis to reveal the more appropriate factors depending on the health condition and assessment time. Finally, we assessed the factors and dimensions that have recently become more important. CONCLUSIONS: The result of this investigation is a framework for conducting research on eHealth acceptance. To elaborately analyze the impact of the factors of the proposed framework, the criteria for evaluating the evidence from the studies that have the extracted factors are presented. Through this process, the impact of each factor in the IAF has been presented, in addition to the framework proposal.

This case report describes the duration of viable SARS-CoV-2 in two immunocompromised patients with completely different clinical courses and further addresses the immunological aspects. CASE PRESENTATIONS: Oropharyngeal swaps were collected continuously during hospitalization for two immunocompromised patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and sent for analysis to real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), viral culture assessed by plaque assay and full genome sequencing. Blood samples for flow cytometry and further immunological analysis were taken once during admission. One patient was without symptoms of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) whereas the other had severe respiratory symptoms requiring a stay at an intensive care unit (ICU) and treatment with remdesivir and dexamethasone. Despite their difference in clinical courses, they both continuously shed SARS-CoV-2 with high viral loads in culture. Both patients had undetectable anti SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels about 2 weeks after the first positive real time RT-PCR test of SARS-CoV-2, marked expansions of virus reactive CD8+ T cells but cellular markers indicative of attenuated humoral immunity.

Cases were defined as asymptomatic contacts of COVID-19 patients who later tested positive for SARS-CoV-2; controls were asymptomatic contacts who never tested positive. Wearing masks all the time during contact was independently associated with lower risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with not wearing masks; wearing a mask sometimes during contact did not lower infection risk. We found the type of mask worn was not independently associated with infection and that contacts who always wore masks were more likely to practice social distancing. Maintaining >1 m distance from a person with COVID-19, having close contact for <15 minutes, and frequent handwashing were independently associated with lower risk for infection. Our findings support consistent wearing of masks, handwashing, and social distancing to protect against COVID-19.","output":"Case-Control Study of Use of Personal Protective Measures and Risk for SARS-CoV 2 Infection, Thailand"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The authors report the case of an otherwise healthy 65-year-old man who presented with an acute right abducens nerve palsy 3 days after receiving the second dose of the AstraZeneca coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine.

Thus, any attempt at a quantitative time-geographic analysis must consider the actual velocity with respect to space. In a trip, individuals tend to pass through structurally varying spaces, such as linear traffic networks and planar walking surfaces, which are not suitable for use in a single GIS spatial data model (i.e., network, raster) that is only applicable to a single spatial structure (i.e., point, line, polygon). In this study, a velocity model is developed for a traffic network and walking surface-constrained travel environment through the divide-and-conquer principle. The construction of this model can be divided into three basic steps: the spatial layering of the dual-constrained travel environment; independent modelling of each layer using different spatial data models; and generation of layer-based time-geographic framework by merging models of each layer.

HLH is characterised by a decreased capacity of interferon gamma production with an activated NK phenotype profile similar to other hyperinflammatory syndromes. Viruses are closely linked to the development of HLH as infectious triggers, and the break of tolerance to self-antigens is considered a critical mechanism involved in the development of immune-mediated conditions triggered by viral infections. Emerging studies in patients with COVID-19 are suggesting a key role of monocytes/macrophages in the pathogenesis of this viral infection, and there is a significant overlap between several features reported in severe COVID-19 and the features included in the HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria. Therefore, SARS-Cov-2, as other respiratory viruses, may also be considered a potential etiological trigger of HLH. The frequency of HLH in adult patients with severe COVID-19 is lower than 5%, although this figure could be underestimated considering that most reported cases lacked information about some specific criteria (mainly the histopathological criteria and the measurement of NK cell function and sCD25 levels). Because HLH is a multi-organ syndrome, the diagnostic approach in a patient with severe COVID-19 in whom HLH is suspected must be carried out in a syndromic and holistic way, and not in the light of isolated clinical or laboratory features. In COVID-19 patients presenting with persistent high fever, progressive pancytopenia, and hepatosplenic involvement, together with the characteristic triad of laboratory abnormalities (hyperferritinaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia, and hypofibrinogenaemia), the suspicion of HLH is high, and the diagnostic workup must be completed with specific immunological and histopathological studies.

However, several questions arise around their mechanism of action in this disease, as well as how, when, and at which dose they should be used. IL-6 has both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects, which may modulate the course of COVID-19, whose immunopathogenesis is driven by the innate immune system, autoantibodies, and interferon. Given that patients with delayed seroconversion against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein would be at the highest risk of complications beyond the second week of disease, we propose that considering patient serostatus at admission could optimize the use of IL-6 inhibitors in COVID-19.

The extent to which this model of care has been adopted in the United Kingdom (UK) is unknown. METHODS The Society for Acute Medicine Benchmarking Audit is a day of care survey undertaken annually within the UK. Participation is open to all hospital in the UK receiving acutely unwell medical patients. A questionnaire is used to collect hospital-level data on the structure and organisation of acute care delivery. The survey included questions designed to quantify the number of hospitals that offered HaH. When present, further questions were asked to clarify the characteristics of the HaH service in terms of workforce, range of diagnostic test and interventions. This information was used to build a picture of HaH service provision at a national scale. RESULTS A total of 130 hospitals contributed organisational data to SAMBA19. The capability to refer to a hospital at home service was recognised by 46.9% (n = 61) of units. The majority of these services, 83.3% (n = 50) were nurse-led. The capability to provide a physician review at home was reported in 23.3% (n = 14). The majority of services could provide intravenous antibiotics at home, but access to other simple interventions, such as intravenous diuretics or acute supplemental oxygen, is limited. CONCLUSION At present, few Acute Medical Units in the UK have access to a hospital at home service capable of replicating essential elements of inpatient care.

To solve the proposed DRO models, we propose a decomposition-based algorithm. In addition, we derive valid lower bound inequalities that efficiently strengthen the master problem in the decomposition algorithm, thus improving convergence. We also derive two families of symmetry-breaking constraints that improve the solvability of the proposed models. Finally, we present extensive computational experiments comparing the operational and computational performance of the proposed models and a stochastic programming model, demonstrating where significant performance improvements could be gained and derive insights into the MFRSP.","output":"Distributionally Robust Optimization Approaches for a Stochastic Mobile Facility Fleet Sizing, Routing, and Scheduling Problem"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) has been recognized for over 40 years as a cause of inflammation and necrosis of the small and large intestine of infants born at less than 36 weeks of gestation.

The sequence of events leading to NEC is complex and multifactorial, although damage to the intestinal epithelium and invasion by bacteria are known to play central roles in disease pathogenesis. STUDY DESIGN: Bacteria initiate a cascade of inflammation that may progress to intestinal necrosis and perforation with sepsis and death. RESULT: Treatment of infants at risk for NEC with probiotic bacteria may be an area of great potential, as probiotic bacteria may promote maturation of the epithelial barrier and function to exclude bacterial pathogens from critical niches in the intestine, thereby disrupting a primary pathway in disease pathogenesis.

PARTICIPANTS Residents and staff in the residential care home who had contact with three patients with SARS (residents A and B, and staff C). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Blood samples were tested for total antibodies to SARS-CoV by immunofluorescence antibody test. The transmission of SARS was elucidated based on information from standardised questionnaires, and records of investigation and surveillance by the Department of Health. RESULTS Among the 90 eligible residents, three died, one moved out, and 19 refused to participate. Of the 32 eligible staff, six refused to participate. None of the remaining 93 participants tested positive for antibody to SARS-CoV. Based on the chronological order, resident A might have transmitted infection to resident B and staff C. Sitting close to the bathroom doorway while resident A took a shower was the only contact of resident B with resident A. The only opportunity for staff C to have contact with body fluids/excreta of resident A was in the handling of rubbish from the resident's room.

In addition to BioBERT, an unsupervised feature-based approach making use of only the encoder output embedding representations for the outcomes and labels was utilized. Finally, cosine similarity was calculated across the vectors to obtain the semantic similarity. This method was able to both harness the domain-specific context of each of the tokens from the learned embeddings of the BioBERT model as well as a more stable metric of sentence similarity.

The efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of a bivalent RSV prefusion F protein-based (RSVpreF) vaccine in pregnant women and their infants are uncertain. METHODS: In a phase 2b trial, we randomly assigned pregnant women, at 24 through 36 weeks' gestation, to receive either 120 or 240 g of RSVpreF vaccine (with or without aluminum hydroxide) or placebo. The trial included safety end points and immunogenicity end points that, in this interim analysis, included 50% titers of RSV A, B, and combined A/B neutralizing antibodies in maternal serum at delivery and in umbilical-cord blood, as well as maternal-to-infant transplacental transfer ratios. RESULTS: This planned interim analysis included 406 women and 403 infants; 327 women (80.5%) received RSVpreF vaccine. Most postvaccination reactions were mild to moderate; the incidence of local reactions was higher among women who received RSVpreF vaccine containing aluminum hydroxide than among those who received RSVpreF vaccine without aluminum hydroxide. The incidences of adverse events in the women and infants were similar in the vaccine and placebo groups; the type and frequency of these events were consistent with the background incidences among pregnant women and infants. The geometric mean ratios of 50% neutralizing titers between the infants of vaccine recipients and those of placebo recipients ranged from 9.7 to 11.7 among those with RSV A neutralizing antibodies and from 13.6 to 16.8 among those with RSV B neutralizing antibodies. Transplacental neutralizing antibody transfer ratios ranged from 1.41 to 2.10 and were higher with nonaluminum formulations than with aluminum formulations.

We investigated feasibility and effects of self-administered body acupressure as a self-care technique that stimulates acupuncture points with manual pressure in SAR patients. METHODS: We conducted a two-armed randomized controlled exploratory trial to compare effects of self-administered acupressure over 4 weeks at five acupuncture points plus rescue medication (RM) with cetirizine compared to RM alone in SAR patients. Among other outcome parameters, we assessed disease-related quality of life (Rhinitis Quality of Life Questionnaire [RQLQ]), overall SAR symptoms by a visual analogue scale (VAS) and a rescue medication score (RMS) after 4 and 8 weeks. RESULTS: Forty-one SAR patients (mean age 38.5  10.0 years, n = 21, 51.2% women) were randomized. Compared to RM alone (n = 21), acupressure plus RM (n = 20) was associated with relevant improvements after 4 weeks, shown by the difference between groups in adjusted means of RQLQ: ? 0.9 points (95% CI ? 1.6 to ? 0.2; p = 0.011) and VAS overall SAR symptoms: ? 21.6 mm (95% CI ? 36.3 to ? 6.8; p = 0.005).

In recent years, the rapid technological advancements have had a significant impact on human existence. One major field for collecting data is satellite technology. With the fast development of various satellite sensor equipment, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images have become an important source of data for a variety of research subjects, including environmental studies, urban studies, coastal extraction, water sources, etc. Change detection and coastline detection are both achieved using SAR pictures. However, speckle noise is a major problem in SAR imaging. Several solutions have been offered to address this issue. One solution is to expose SAR images to spatial fuzzy clustering. Another solution is to separate speech. This study utilises the spatial function to overcome speckle noise and cluster the SAR images with the highest achieved accuracy. The spatial function is proposed in this work since the likelihood of data falling into one cluster is what this function is all about. When the spatial function is employed to cluster data in fuzzy logic, the clustering outcomes improve.

A number of studies before the COVID-19 pandemic have shown that the primary caregivers of the ED patients are subjected to great burden, psychological pressure, and serious emotional problems. This study aimed to investigate the psychological distress level of the primary caregivers of ED offspring during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: From March 6 to April 20, 2020, 378 questionnaires for primary caregivers of ED offspring and 1163 questionnaires for primary caregivers of healthy offspring were collected through an online crowdsourcing platform in mainland China. Valid questionnaires that met the criteria included 343 (90.74%) primary caregivers of ED offspring and 1085 (93.29%) primary caregivers of healthy offspring. Using Propensity Score Matching (PSM), 315 (83.33%) primary caregivers of ED offspring and 315 matched primary caregivers of healthy offspring were included in the statistical analysis. Depression, anxiety, perceived stress and social support were measured by Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Perceived Stress Scale-10 and Social Support Rating Scale, respectively. RESULTS: The rates of depression and anxiety of the primary caregivers of ED offspring were 20.6 and 16.5%, which were significantly higher than those of primary caregivers of healthy offspring (4.1 and 2.2%), all P < 0.001. Regression analysis found that perceived stress, social support, previous or present mental illness, family conflicts during the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the severity of depression (P < 0.001, P = 0.002, P = 0.041, P = 0.014); Perceived stress, social support, family conflicts during the COVID-19 pandemic and years of education had a significant impact on the severity of anxiety (P < 0.001, P = 0.002, P = 0.002, P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, primary caregivers of ED offspring experienced more psychological distress than that of primary caregivers of healthy offspring. ED caregivers with high perceived stress may have higher levels of depression and anxiety. ED caregivers with high social support, no mental illness and no family conflicts may have lower levels of depression. ED caregivers with high social support, no family conflicts, and high years of education may have lower levels of anxiety.","output":"Psychological distress and associated factors of the primary caregivers of offspring with eating disorder during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Amsterdam and other UNAIDS Fast-Track cities aim for zero new HIV infections. Utilising molecular and clinical data of the ATHENA observational HIV cohort, our primary aims are to estimate the proportion of undiagnosed HIV infections and the proportion of locally acquired infections in Amsterdam in 2014-2018, both in MSM and heterosexuals and Dutch-born and foreign-born individuals. We located diagnosed HIV infections in Amsterdam using postcode data at time of registration to the cohort, and estimated their date of infection using clinical HIV data. We then inferred the proportion undiagnosed from the estimated times to diagnosis. To determine sources of Amsterdam infections, we used HIV sequences of people living with HIV (PLHIV) within a background of other Dutch and international sequences to phylogenetically reconstruct transmission chains. Frequent late diagnoses indicate that more recent phylogenetically observed chains are increasingly incomplete, and we use a Bayesian model to estimate the actual growth of Amsterdam transmission chains, and the proportion of locally acquired infections. We estimate that 20% [95% CrI 18-22%] of infections acquired among MSM between 2014-2018 were undiagnosed by the start of 2019, and 44% [37-50%] among heterosexuals, with variation by place of birth. The estimated proportion of MSM infections in 2014-2018 that were locally acquired was 68% [61-74%], with no substantial differences by region of birth. In heterosexuals, this was 57% [41-71%] overall, with heterogeneity by place of birth. The data indicate substantial potential to further curb local transmission, in both MSM and heterosexual Amsterdam residents. In 2014-2018 the largest proportion of local transmissions in Amsterdam are estimated to have occurred in foreign-born MSM, who would likely benefit most from intensified interventions.","output":"Estimating the potential to prevent locally acquired HIV infections in a UNAIDS Fast-Track City, Amsterdam"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an urgent requirement for novel diagnostic tests that determine infection with SARS-CoV-2 and the development of an immune response against it. The perspective of end users on the characteristics and clinical use of these assays has not been previously considered. Methods: We surveyed 17,186 health care professions (HCPs) in 29 countries to gauge opinion on the design, use, diagnostic impact and diagnostic accuracy of COVID-19 tests. Results were correlated with national statistics on the burden of disease and testing in individual countries. Results: HCPs overwhelmingly recognized the importance of COVID-19 tests but 37.1% were unsure of the appropriate timing of investigations relative to disease symptoms. Confidence in the diagnostic accuracy of assays varied inversely with COVID-19-related mortality in individual countries but had no relationship with the total number of tests performed. There was global consensus that the most important impact of positive antigen and antibody testing was confidence in returning to work following recovery. Saliva was the preferred sampling fluid for COVID-19 diagnostic tests in all groups surveyed. Conclusions: HCP input can ensure novel assays are fit for purpose in varied global health care settings, but HCPs may require support to effectively use novel diagnostics thus minimizing waste when supplies are limited.","output":"Health Care Professionals' Confidence and Preferences for Diagnostic Assays for SARS-CoV-2: A Global Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate patient satisfaction with telemedicine appointments as an alternative to in-person appointments at an Andrology-focused academic urology practice during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. METHODS: Between March and June 2020, all appointments at the practice of a single Andrology-focused academic urologist were conducted by telephone. Consecutive patients were contacted by telephone following their appointment to complete a telephone questionnaire. Baseline demographic information was obtained, and perceptions regarding telephone appointments were assessed using a Likert scale. RESULTS: Ninety-six patients completed the telephone questionnaire. Median age was 48.5 years (interquartile range 37.3-62.8 years) with 55 of 96 (57.3%) of the appointments Andrology-focused. Mean distance of residence from the hospital was 8.4 km (interquartile range 4.7-25.2 km). Only 9 of 96 (9.3%) of the patients felt that the telephone format did not adequately address their needs. However, 26 of 96 (27.1%) of patients said they would prefer an in-person appointment. On multivariable analysis adjusting for age, gender, presenting complaint, type of appointment, education level, and employment status, no factors were associated with feeling that the telephone appointment adequately addressed needs or preference for an in-person appointment in the future. CONCLUSION: Patients were generally satisfied with telephone appointments as an alternative to in-person appointments during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.

Within this new recovery movement, there has been a recognition of the importance of the social environment in which individuals are situated and the relationship of this to mental health and wellbeing. Included in this is the importance of an individuals role within society and the ways in which knowledge, such as experts by experience, can hold an important value. The argument then, is that social connectedness forms part of the recovery journey and that relationships can help us develop or re-connect with who we are in powerful ways. Such a view has only been strengthened by the recent and ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic. Within the UK, discussions of the importance of our wellbeing have become commonplace within the context of restricted social contact. With this heightened awareness of how the social contributes to wellbeing, it is important to consider the environments in which those in receipt of mental healthcare are situated. One of which is institutionalised care, where it is commonplace to restrict social contact. For example, by virtue of being within a locked environment, individuals freedom of movement is often non-existent and thus contacts with those not residing or working within the institution is restricted. While such restrictions may be deemed necessary to protect the individuals mental health, such environments can be unintentionally toxic. Data are presented from an ethnography that was conducted within an inpatient forensic mental health hospital in the UK to highlight the problematic social environment which some individuals experience. Key interpersonal issues are presented, such as, trust, racism, the threat of physical violence and bullying that was experienced by staff and residents at the hospital.

In this study, the Solitaire Flow Restoration System and the Trevo retriever were used in a histopathological comparison of vascular injuries caused by stent retriever thrombectomy devices. METHODS Rabbit carotid arteries were used in the experiments with stent retriever thrombectomy devices. Carotid artery samples were harvested either 1 or 2 weeks postoperatively for histological examination. RESULTS Histological changes caused by the use of stent retriever thrombectomy devices were observed from the intimal to medial layers. With the Solitaire FR 4 mm, intimal and medial thickening was observed 1 week postoperatively, and progression of intimal thickening was observed 2 weeks postoperatively. The extent of intimal thickening tended to be greater with the Solitaire FR 6 mm than with the Solitaire FR 4 mm, but this difference was not significant. Compared with the Solitaire FR 4 mm, the Trevo had a significantly smaller area of intimal thickening.

An elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is considered a prognostic indicator for patients with cancer. Neutrophils are no longer regarded as innate immune cells with a single function, let alone bystanders in the pathological process of cancer. Their diversity and plasticity are being increasingly recognized. This review summarizes previous studies assessing the roles and mechanisms of neutrophils in cancer initiation, progression, metastasis and relapse. Although the findings are controversial, the fact that neutrophils play a dual role in promoting and suppressing cancer is undeniable. The plasticity of neutrophils allows them to adapt to different cancer microenvironments and exert different effects on cancer. Given the findings from our own research, we propose a reasonable hypothesis that neutrophils may be reprogrammed into a cancer-promoting state in the cancer microenvironment. This new perspective indicates that neutrophil reprogramming in the course of cancer treatment is a problem worthy of attention. Preventing or reversing the reprogramming of neutrophils may be a potential strategy for adjuvant cancer therapy.","output":"Neutrophils in cancer carcinogenesis and metastasis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used for the diagnosis of COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2. RT-PCR is a method that detects the virus by amplifying two regions of the target viral genome, namely the nuclear (N) and envelope (E) encoding sequences. However, no reports have shown a relationship between the symptoms and the gene expression patterns, especially in asymptomatic patients. Herein, we validated the characteristics of E and N gene expression patterns using RT-PCR on samples obtained from asymptomatic COVID-19-positive patients. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, conducted at Juntendo University Nerima Hospital, Tokyo, Japan, SARS-Cov-2 RT-PCR positive patients whose specimens had been obtained and analyzed by our laboratory technicians from September 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 were enrolled. For RT-PCR, the LightMix Modular SARS-CoV-2 reagent (TIB MOLBIOL company) was used. After excluding patients who had symptoms, background, demographic, laboratory, and gene expression pattern data were collected from RT-PCR-positive asymptomatic patients. We also investigated patients who met the release criteria of the Center for Disease Control and prevention. Continuous and categorical variables were analyzed, with p< 0.05 set as statistical significance using the student-t test, chi-square test, or Fishers exact test, respectively. RESULTS: Of 92 RT-PCR-positive asymptomatic patients, 57 comprised the expression E only group (Group E) and 35 comprised the E+N group (Group E+N). Significantly more patients in Group E met the release criteria compared to those in Group E+N [41 (71%) vs 10 (28%), p< 0.001]. Among patients who met the release criteria, those in Group E+N had significantly more immunosuppression [7 (70%) vs 8 (30%), p=0.004]. Moreover, among the patients who underwent RT-PCR screening, no patients in Group E developed symptoms [0 vs 6 (42%), p=0.02]. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that RT-PCR-positive asymptomatic patients can be divided into three patterns: pre-symptomatic, gene E+N-positive patients; post-symptomatic covid-19-recovered patients, regardless of gene E and N expression patterns; and false positive, gene E-positive patients.

Mitosis cells detection is a challenging task due to the heterogeneous microenvironment of breast histopathology images. Recognition of complex and inconsistent objects in the medical images could be achieved by incorporating domain knowledge in the field of interest. In this study, the strategies of the histopathologist and domain knowledge approach were used to guide the development of the image processing framework for automated mitosis cells detection in breast histopathology images. The detection framework starts with color normalization and hyperchromatic nucleus segmentation. Then, a knowledge-assisted false positive reduction method is proposed to eliminate the false positive (i.e., non-mitosis cells). This stage aims to minimize the percentage of false positive and thus increase the F1-score. Next, features extraction was performed. The mitosis candidates were classified using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. For evaluation purposes, the knowledge-assisted detection framework was tested using two datasets: a custom dataset and a publicly available dataset (i.e., MITOS dataset). The proposed knowledge-assisted false positive reduction method was found promising by eliminating at least 87.1% of false positive in both the dataset producing promising results in the F1-score. Experimental results demonstrate that the knowledge-assisted detection framework can achieve promising results in F1-score (custom dataset: 89.1%; MITOS dataset: 88.9%) and outperforms the recent works.","output":"Automated knowledge-assisted mitosis cells detection framework in breast histopathology images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Opioid-related overdose deaths have been increasing in the United States (U.S.) in the last twenty years, creating a public health challenge. Take-home naloxone is an effective strategy for preventing opioid-related overdose death, but its widespread use is particularly challenging in smaller cities, towns, and rural areas where it may be stigmatized and/or poorly understood. METHODS: We analyzed data on knowledge and beliefs about drug use and naloxone among the general public in Nebraska, a largely rural state in the Great Plains region of the U.S., drawing on the 2020 Nebraska Annual Social Indicators Survey. RESULTS: Respondents reported negative beliefs about people who use drugs (PWUD) and little knowledge of naloxone. Over half reported that members of their community view PWUD as blameworthy, untrustworthy, and dangerous. Approximately 31% reported being unaware of naloxone. Only 15% reported knowing where to obtain naloxone and less than a quarter reported knowing how to use it. Knowing where to obtain naloxone is associated with access to opioids and knowing someone who has recently overdosed, but having ever used opioids or being close to someone who uses opioids is not associated with naloxone knowledge. Finally, almost a quarter of respondents endorsed the belief that people who use opioids will use more if they have access to naloxone. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight stigmatizing beliefs about PWUD and underscore the need for further education on naloxone as an effective strategy to reduce opioid-related overdose death.

PATIENTS Demographics, operative and perioperative outcomes, and reoperative data were collected. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Five- and 10-year Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for survival from proctectomy and Crohn's-related revisional surgery. Cox proportional hazards models were used to model the hazards of proctectomy and Crohn's-related revision on the clinical characteristics of patients. RESULTS Eighty-one patients had an ileorectal anastomosis for Crohn's disease from 1982 to 2010. The most common indications for surgery were failed medical management (60/81, 74.1%) and a stricture causing obstruction (14/81, 17.3%). Seventy-seven percent (n = 62) had a 1-stage procedure, whereas 23% (n = 19) had a 2-stage procedure (colectomy followed by ileorectal anastomosis). The overall anastomotic leak rate was 7.4% (n = 6). Fifty-six patients had a functioning ileorectal anastomosis at the time of follow-up. At 5 and 10 years, 87% (95% CI: 75.5-93.3) and 72.2% (95% CI: 55.8-83.4) of individuals had a functioning ileorectal anastomosis. Eighteen patients required proctectomy for poor symptom control, whereas 11 patients required a small-bowel resection plus redo-ileorectal anastomosis. The mean time to proctectomy from the original ileorectal anastomosis was 88.3 months (SD = 62.1). Smoking was associated with both proctectomy (HR 3.93 (95% CI: 1.46-10.55)) and reoperative surgery (HR 2.12 (95% CI: 0.96-4.72)). LIMITATIONS : This study was retrospective. CONCLUSIONS Ileorectal anastomosis is an appropriate operation for selected patients with Crohn's colitis with sparing of the rectum. However, patients must be counseled that the reoperation rate and/or proctectomy rate is approximately 30%.","output":"Long-term outcome of colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis for Crohn's colitis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), tremendous efforts have been made to sequence the viral genome from samples collected throughout the world.

It has created an urgent need to monitor and forecast COVID-19 spread behavior to better control this spread. Among all the popular models for COVID-19 forecasting, statistical models are receiving much attention in media. However, statistical models are showing less accuracy for long term forecasting, as there is high level of uncertainty and required data is also not sufficiently available. In this paper, we propose a comparative analysis of deep learning models to forecast the COVID-19 outbreak as an alternative to statistical models. We propose a new Attention-based encoder-decoder model, named Attention-Long Short Term Memory (AttentionLSTM). LSTM based neural network layer architecture incorporates the idea of fine-grained attention mechanism i.e., attention on hidden state dimensions instead of hidden state vector itself, which is capable of highlighting the importance and contribution of each hidden state dimension. It helps in detection on crucial temporal information, resulting in a highly interpretable network. Additionally, we implement a learnable vector embedding for time. As, time in a vector representation can be easily added with many architectures. This vector representation is called Time2Vec. We have used COVID-19 data repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University to assess the proposed model's performance.

There has been scarce information to understand the future dynamics of influenza  and under different hypothesis on relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in particular  after the disruptions to seasonal patterns. METHODS: We collected data from public sources in China, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and forecasted the influenza dynamics in the incoming 2021C2022 season under different NPIs. We considered Northern China and Southern China separately, due to the sharp difference in the patterns of seasonal influenza. For the United Kingdom, data were collected for England only. RESULTS: Compared to the epidemics in 2017C2019, longer and blunter influenza outbreaks could occur should NPIs be fully lifted, with percent positivity varying from 10.5 to 18.6 in the studying regions. The rebounds would be smaller if the mask-wearing intervention continued or the international mobility stayed low, but sharper if the mask-wearing intervention was lifted in the middle of influenza season. Further, influenza activity could stay low under a much less stringent mask-wearing intervention coordinated with influenza vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: The results added to our understandings of future influenza dynamics after the global decline during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In light of the uncertainty on the incoming circulation strains and the relatively low negative impacts of mask wearing on society, our findings suggested that wearing mask could be considered as an accompanying mitigation measure in influenza prevention and control, especially for seasons after long periods of low-exposure to influenza viruses.","output":"The Incoming Influenza Season  China, the United Kingdom, and the United States, 2021C2022"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intravital microscopy (IVM) is an essential experimental approach for evaluating, in real time, cell interactions in the blood and rheological parameters in the microcirculation of the living animals.

The paper is dipped in a buffer solution containing aptamers designed to bind to the capsid proteins on Zika. We then added the Zika (in its own buffer) to the region close to one of the silver-paint contacts. The Zika virus (40 nm diameter with 43 kDa or 7.1x10-20 gm weight) became immobilized in the paper's pores and bonded with the resident aptamers creating a concentration gradient. Atomic force microscopy and Raman spectroscopy were carried out to verify that both the aptamer and Zika become immobilized in the paper. The potential measured between the two silver paint contacts reproducibly became more negative upon adding the Zika.

They have the big picture as well as focus on the details to understand the causes and find a solution to the problem. Great leaders trust the people who work with them by listening actively and attentively to understand the situation. They listen, respond, and not react. They delegate and instill confidence to act independently and decisively.Great leaders will give the respect due to the experts and try to get the best out of them. They cannot be whimsical. They will never ridicule or berate others or speak ill of the previous leaders. Great Leaders will readily admit their mistakes and open for suggestions to improve. They never can be arrogant at any time. People who do not have leadership skills are good at making jibes and blaming others.Leaders must have the ability to visualize the path to see the light at the end of the tunnel before others can see it. They need to be transparent and innovative, ready to learn from early setbacks and consolidate. Leaders need to have fortitude, the mental and emotional strength to face the adversity. Trust involves being trustful and trustworthy. A virtuous leader tends to trust others, and is trustworthy.Leaders must have the ability to inspire, motivate, and foster commitment to a shared purpose Leaders need to embrace complexity as opportunity, value collaboration, and develop a network mind-set.

The growing global problem of antibiotic resistance of microbial pathogens wherein microbes become resistant to the very antibiotics used against them during infection is linked not only to our health uses but also to agribusiness practices and the changing environment. Here we review mechanisms of microbial iron acquisition and host iron withdrawal defense, and the influence of iron withdrawal on the antimicrobial activity of antibiotics. Antibiotic-resistant microbes are unaltered in their iron requirements, but iron withdrawal from microbes enhances the activities of various antibiotics and importantly suppresses outgrowth of antibiotic-exposed resistant microbial survivors. Of the three therapeutic approaches available to exploit microbial iron susceptibility, including (1) use of gallium as a non-functional iron analogue, (2) Trojan horse conjugates of microbial siderophores carrying antibiotics, and (3) new generation iron chelators, purposely designed as anti-microbials, the latter offers various advantages. For instance, these novel anti-microbial chelators overcome the limitations of conventional clinically-used hematological chelators which display host toxicity and are not useful antimicrobials. 3-Hydroxypyridin-4-one-containing polymeric chelators appear to have the highest potential. DIBI (developmental code name) is a well-developed lead candidate, being a low molecular weight, water-soluble copolymer with enhanced iron binding characteristics, strong anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory activities, low toxicity for animals and demonstrated freedom from microbial resistance development. DIBI has been shown to enhance antibiotic efficacy for antibiotic-resistant microbes during infection, and it also prevents recovery growth and resistance development during microbe exposure to various antibiotics.

We begin by analyzing the vector model dynamics and by determining the offspring reproductive number denoted by N as well as the trivial and nontrivial equilibria. Using theory of cooperative systems and the general theory of Lyapunov, we prove that, although there is a possibility that the trivial equilibrium coexists with a positive equilibrium, it remains globally asymptotically stable whenever N1. The fact that the non-trivial equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable permits us to reduce the study of the full model to the study of a reduced model whenever N&gt;1. Thus, we analyze the reduced model by computing the basic reproduction number R0, equilibrium points as well as asymptotic stability of each equilibrium point. We also explore the nature of the bifurcation for the disease-free equilibrium from R0=1. By the application of the centre manifold theory, we prove that the backward bifurcation phenomenon can occur in our model, which means that the necessary condition R0&lt;1 is not sufficient to guarantee the final extinction of the disease in human populations. To calibrate our model, we estimate model parameters on clinical data from the last Chikungunya epidemic which occurred in Chad, using the non-linear least-square method. We find out that R0=1.8519, which means that we are in an endemic state since R0&gt;1. To determine model parameters that are responsible for disease spread in the human community, we perform sensitivity analysis (SA) using a global method. It follows that the density-dependent death rate of mosquitoes and the average number of mosquito bites are key parameters in the disease dynamics. Following this, we thus formulate an optimal control model by including in the autonomous model, four time-dependent control functions to fight the disease spread. Pontryagins maximum principle is used to characterize our optimal controls. Numerical simulations, using parameter values of Chikungunya transmission dynamics, and efficiency analysis, are conducted to determine the better control strategy which guaranteed the final extinction of the disease in human populations.","output":"Mathematical modeling and projections of a vector-borne disease with optimal control strategies: A case study of the Chikungunya in Chad"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Technological advances have provided alternatives to traditional handwritten note taking that are changing the classroom learning environment in higher education for nursing students.

METHODS: This retrospective study included patients diagnosed with GI-CMV infection at Siriraj Hospital (Bangkok, Thailand) during 2008C2017. Baseline characteristics, presentations, comorbid conditions, endoscopic findings, treatments, and outcomes were compared between immunocompetent and immunocompromised. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-three patients (56 immunocompetent, 117 immunocompromised) were included. Immunocompetent patients were significantly older than immunocompromised patients (73 vs. 48.6 years, p < 0.0001). Significantly more immunocompetent patients were in the ICU at the time of diagnosis (21.0% vs. 8.6%, p = 0.024). GI bleeding was the leading presentation in immunocompetent, while diarrhea and abdominal pain were more common in immunocompromised. Blood CMV viral load was negative in significantly more immunocompetent than immunocompromised (40.7% vs. 12.9%, p = 0.002). Ganciclovir was the main treatment in both groups.

RESULTS: A higher RDW-CV level and neutrophil percentage and lower levels of total proteins, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and MCH were found in COVID-19 patients compared with those in controls from the clinical recovery to the postdischarge recovery stages. Further analysis showed that decreases in lymphocytes, total proteins, and SOD and elevations in neutrophils, FDP, CRP, and ESR were more common in severe than moderate cases of COVID-19 during hospitalization; however, differences in these indicators, except total proteins, were not observed in the postdischarge recovery stages. Additionally, only 76.9% of COVID-19 patients were positive for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in the convalescence stage, and one patient that was negative for specific IgG was reinfected. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that patients recovering from COVID-19 might need better care than that patients with other viral pneumonias due to the possibility of having poor immunity and nutritional conditions. These findings provide new insights to improve the understanding of COVID-19 and improve care for patients affected by these kinds of pandemics in the future.","output":"A comparative study of the laboratory features of COVID-19 and other viral pneumonias in the recovery stage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human Interleukin-6 (hIL-6) is a multifunctional cytokine that regulates immune and inflammatory responses in addition to metabolic and regenerative processes and cancer. hIL-6 binding to the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) induces homodimerization and recruitment of the glycoprotein (gp130) to form a hexameric signalling complex. Anti-IL-6 and IL-6R antibodies are clinically approved inhibitors of IL-6 signalling pathway for treating rheumatoid arthritis and Castleman's disease, respectively. There is a potential to develop novel small molecule IL-6 antagonists derived from understanding the structural basis for IL-6/IL-6R interactions. Here, we combine homology modelling with extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to examine the association of hIL-6 with IL-6R. A comparison with MD of apo hIL-6 reveals that the binding of hIL-6 to IL-6R induces structural and dynamic rearrangements in the AB loop region of hIL-6, disrupting intra-protein contacts and increasing the flexibility of residues 48-58 of the AB loop. In contrast, due to the involvement of residues 59-78 in forming contacts with the receptor, these residues of the AB loop are observed to rigidify in the presence of the receptor. The binary complex is primarily stabilized by two pairs of salt bridges, Arg181 (hIL-6)- Glu182 (IL-6R) and Arg184 (hIL-6)- Glu183 (IL-6R) as well as hydrophobic and aromatic stacking interactions mediated essentially by Phe residues in both proteins. An interplay of electrostatic, hydrophobic, hydrogen bonding and aromatic stacking interactions facilitates the formation of the hIL-6/IL-6R complex. This article is protected by copyright.

The S-PDMS masters were used to replicate microfluidic devices in PMMA based on soft embossing at 220-230C and thermal sealing at 140C. Both embossing and sealing stages were performed by using binder clips. The proposed protocol has ensured the replication of microfluidic devices in PMMA with great fidelity (> 94%). Examples of ME devices, droplet generator devices and spot test array were successfully demonstrated. For testing ME devices, a mixture containing inorganic cations was selected as model and the achieved analytical performance did not reveal significant difference from commercial PMMA devices. Water droplets were successfully generated in an oil phase at rate of ca. 60 droplets/min (fixing the continuous phase flow rate at 100 L/h) with size of ca. 322  6 m. Glucose colorimetric assay was performed on spot test devices and good detectability level was achieved.

Results: Between 19 March 2020 and 30 April 2020, 455 non-critically ill patients with symptoms suspect for COVID-19 were admitted. The initial NFS for SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR yielded 66.9%, the second NFS 25.4% and bronchoscopy with BAL 5.9% of total COVID-19 diagnoses. In the BAL fluid, other respiratory pathogens were detected in 65% (13/20) of the COVID-19 negative patients and only in 1/7 COVID-19 positive patients. Retrospective antibody testing at the time around BAL sampling showed a positive IgA or IgG in 42.9 % of the COVID-19 positive and 10.5% of the COVID-19 negative group. Follow-up serology showed 100% COVID-19 positivity in the COVID-19 positive group and 100% IgG negativity in the COVID-19 negative group. Conclusion: In our experience, bronchoscopy with BAL can have an added value to rule-in or rule-out COVID-19 in patients with clinical and radiographical high-likelihood of COVID-19 and repeated negative NFS testing. Furthermore, culture and respiratory multiplex PCR on BAL fluid can aid to identify alternative microbial etiological agents in this group.

This has been particularly evident in tourism, one of the sectors most affected by uncoordinated mobility restrictions. The impact of this interdependence on the tendency to adopt less or more restrictive measures is hard to evaluate, more so if diversity in economic exposures to citizens' mobility are considered. Here, we address this problem by developing an analytical and computational game-theoretical model encompassing the conflicts arising from the need to control the economic effects of global risks, such as in the COVID-19 pandemic. The model includes the individual costs derived from severe restrictions imposed by governments, including the resulting economic interdependence among all the parties involved in the game. By using tourism-based data, the model is enriched with actual heterogeneous income losses, such that every player has a different economic cost when applying restrictions. We show that economic interdependence enhances cooperation because of the decline in the expected payoffs by free-riding parties (i.e., those neglecting the application of mobility restrictions). Furthermore, we show (analytically and through numerical simulations) that these cross-exposures can transform the nature of the cooperation dilemma each region or country faces, modifying the position of the fixed points and the size of the basins of attraction that characterize this class of games. Finally, our results suggest that heterogeneity among regions may be used to leverage the impact of intervention policies by ensuring an agreement among the most relevant initial set of cooperators.","output":"Cooperation dynamics under pandemic risks and heterogeneous economic interdependence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is considered a worldwide pandemic. Rapidly rising numbers of patients have been reported in almost every country, along with the growing mortality rates. Uncontrolled growth in patient numbers may be due to reasons such as treatment options and vaccine availabilities and unidentified targets of SARS-CoV-2. Previous study has revealed that the molecular target of SARS-CoV-2 is analogous to SARS (2003), i.e. angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2). Therefore, the determination of ACE-2 may enrich existing information and facilitate development of drugs targeted toward SARS-CoV-2. This study aims to screen the expression of ACE-2 genes and their relationship to the types of SNP variants in SARS-CoV-2. We explored a series of observations using powerful databases, e.g. GTEx portal, HaploReg, 1000 Genome and Ensembl, to identify the gene variant of ACE-2. We showed that ACE-2 is highly expressed in the testes and small intestine, while its lowest level is observed in lymphocytes. Subsequently, we observed 17 gene variants containing a missense mutation potentially damaging protein level. Among these genes, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs370187012 shows the highest damage-level score, while the lowest effect is in SNP rs4646116. The highest frequency of the C allele was observed in European populations (1%). In addition to showing that ACE-2 is expressed in several organs, we concluded that the ACE-2 gene variation can be found in African, American, Southeast and East Asian, and European populations. The polymorphisms of ACE-2 impact on the ACE2 protein structure and the binding capacity of the ACE-2 receptor with the S-Protein of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Identification of gene expression location of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 SNPs as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in different populations by using various databases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the face of the sudden outbreak of new type of coronavirus, the virus is spreading at a faster rate than expected, which seriously threatens peoples life and health and national security.

AIM OF STUDY To identify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the structure of acute poisonings based on their comparative analysis for March-May in 2019 and 2020. MATERIAl AND METHODS Hospital patient cards of patients who were treated in the Department of Acute Toxicosis and Somatopsychiatric Disorders of the N. V. Sklifosovsky Research Institute for Emergency Medicine in MarchCMay, 2019 and 2020. The Statistica 10.0 program was used for data processing. RESUlTS The total number and gender composition of patients with acute poisonings (AP) did not differ significantly in the compared periods. In 2020, the share of people aged 30C39 increased by 23%, while patients over 50 decreased by 7%. In 2020, the frequency of AP caused by medicines decreased by 10%, with sedatives and antidepressants prevailing. There has been an increase in cases of overdose with NSAIDs, antibiotics and antiviral drugs, probably as a result of self-treatment for Covid-19. The share of drug and psychoactive substance poisoning increased by 5%, mainly due to overdoses of synthetic drugs and combinations of drugs of different groups. At the same time, the number of cases of recreational drug use decreased 2.4-fold. In March-May 2020, the number of patients with severe AP caused by alcohol increased 4-fold, and the number of people with other forms of AP hospitalized with alcohol intoxication grew 2.7-fold. Additionally, twice as many household AP have been caused by chlorine vapor, as well as poisoning with isopropyl alcohol, which can be associated with frequent improper use of disinfectants.

In this study, an in silico strategy involving ADMET property screening, receptor-ligand docking and molecular dynamic (MD) simulation was employed to screen potential tea bio-active inhibitors against three selected targets (RdRp, 3CLpro and PLpro) of SARS-CoV-2. Among the 70 tea bioactives screened, theaflavin 3,3'-di-gallate (TF3), Procyanidin B2 and Theaflavin 3-gallate (TF2a) exhibited highest binding affinities towards RdRp, 3CLpro/Mpro and PLpro targets of SARS-CoV-2 with low docking scores of -14.92, -11.68 and -10.90 kcal/mol, respectively. All of them showed a substantial number of hydrogen bonds along with other interactions in and around the active sites. Interestingly, the top bioactives in our study showed higher binding affinities compared with known antiviral drugs.

Methods A standardized protocol for managing COVID-19 patients and ICU admissions was implemented through accurate Early Warning Score (EWS) monitoring and thromboembolism prophylaxis at hospital admission. Dyspnea, mental confusion or SpO2 less than 85% were criteria for ICU admission. Ventilation approach employed low PEEP values (about 10 cmH2O in presence of lung compliance > 40 mL/cmH2O) and FiO2 as needed. In presence of lower lung compliance (< 40 mL/cmH2O) PEEP value was increased to about 14 cmH2O.

Similarly, children with ID, and to a lesser extent their siblings, are reported to show comparatively higher levels of behaviour and emotional problems. Psychological problems may be accentuated by restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, due to increased social, caring and economic stressors and reduced social support. However, existing studies have not been able to examine the impact of COVID-19 restrictions accounting for pre-COVID levels of well-being in these families. In a naturalistic design, we examined outcomes for parents, siblings and children with ID in a two-wave longitudinal study where Wave 2 data were gathered for some families before and some during COVID-19 restrictions. METHODS: Parents of children with ID who took part in a Wave 2 survey pre-lockdown (n = 294) and during/post-lockdown (n = 103) completed a number of measures about their well-being and the behaviour and emotional problems of both their child with ID and their nearest-in-age sibling. These same measures had also been completed for all families 2-3 years previously in Wave 1 of the study.

This cross-sectional study aimed to identify factors associated with older adults participation in community-based health promotion activities. The Older Adults Health Promotion Activity Questionnaire was developed to collect data, and a total of 139 older adults were recruited from a community care center in Taoyuan City. Participants mean age was 72.7 years (SD = 6.0 years), 74.8% were females, 64.7% were married, 59% had a lower level of education, 51.8% had lower income, 59% reported their health status not good, and 76.3% had chronic disease. Our findings indicated that age, perceived benefits, and self-efficacy were identified as significant predictors of participation in health promotion activities. Among them, perceived benefits were found to have the strongest association with participation in health promotion activities ( = 0.305; p < 0.05). The findings showed that the Penders Health Promotion Model is useful to provide information for predicting and detecting significant factors related to older adults participation in community-based health promotion activities.

A syndemic approach has been suggested to understand the excess burden in vulnerable populations. However, this has not stopped the unequal burden of disease in Norway. Initially, the disease was mainly imported by Norwegians returning from skiing holidays in the Alps, and the prevalence of infection among migrants in Norway, defined as people born abroad to foreign parents, was low. Later, confirmed cases in migrants increased and have remained stable at 35-50% - more than twice the proportion of the migrant population (15%). To change this pattern, we need to understand the complex mechanisms underlying inequities in health and their relative and multiplying impacts on disease inequalities and to test the effect of counterfactual policies in order to reduce inequalities in disease burden. Yet, the current paradigm in the field of migration and health research, that is, the theories, research methods and explanatory models commonly applied, fail to fully understand the differences in health outcomes between international migrants and the host population.

Survey data were collected from a convenience sample of representatives from 427 SBHCs, representing approximately one sixth of SBHCs nationwide. When schools closed in spring 2020, 77% of SBHCs closed temporarily, 5% closed permanently, and 12% remained physically open. Telehealth was a crucial strategy used to continue delivering essential services. The percentage reporting any telehealth service offering before and after school closures increased by over 200%. Yet they also reported challenges, including financial and policy restraints. Many SBHCs that closed temporarily did so because their host schools closed, suggesting that making arrangements to remain open if a similar situation to the COVID-19 pandemic should arise might be beneficial. SBHCs are a proven cost-effective model to deliver health care in resource-limited communities.

The demand for these services is increasing worldwide. Rapid response clinics have been developed as a means to streamline the palliative RT radiotherapy process and increase efficiency and improve patient experiences. Key components to successful rapid response palliative RT are access to care, streamlined services and innovation. To successfully implement a rapid response RT programme, it is essential to identify gaps between currently provided care and ideal or enhanced care. The aims of this work are to audit the current palliative RT workflow at our institution both prior to and during the coronavirus pandemic. This work reports the impact of covid-19 on rate of palliative RT referrals and proposes a radiographer led, MR guided rapid response workflow to reduce wait times METHODS: A retrospective audit of palliative radiotherapy booking forms was completed over a two yearperiod (2019-2020) to assess the current pathway both prior to and during the covid-19 pandemic. This audit identified patients who had received urgent/emergency spinal RT in the specified timeframe. Further data on these patients was collected using departmental oncology information systems to form a detailed analysis of the pathway and wait times. Data was recorded and analysed using Microsoft Excel. RESULTS A total of 813 patients met the inclusion criteria for this audit. Data was reported for 2019 and 2020 separately to determine any significant impact caused by the covid-19 pandemic. In 2020 there was an 11.5% increase in referrals for palliative radiotherapy with an equal portion (81%) of total referrals in each year being for single fractions. Timelines from referral to treatment delivery were reported, with those patients receiving same day single fraction RT palliative radiotherapy undergoing further analysis to determine the amount of time spent in the department. Mean wait time for these patients was 5 hours and 20 minutes in 2019 but increased by 20.9% in 2020. CONCLUSIONS The increasing demand for palliative RT due to rising global cancer rates and extended life expectancy due to advanced systemic treatments may lead to increased wait times. An increase in both referrals and mean wait time was seen during the covid-19 pandemic. Improving efficiency and access to care is essential for this population. The MR Linac could play a role in streamlining palliative RT workflows due to its ability to employ a scan, plan and treat model in a single session.

Nevertheless, the superiority of language-specific models has already been proven for languages having access to large amounts of data. In this work, we focus on Catalan with the aim to explore to what extent a medium-sized monolingual language model is competitive with state-of-the-art large multilingual models. For this, we: (1) build a clean, high-quality textual Catalan corpus (CaText), the largest to date (but only a fraction of the usual size of the previous work in monolingual language models), (2) train a Transformer-based language model for Catalan (BERTa), and (3) devise a thorough evaluation in a diversity of settings, comprising a complete array of downstream tasks, namely, Part of Speech Tagging, Named Entity Recognition and Classification, Text Classification, Question Answering, and Semantic Textual Similarity, with most of the corresponding datasets being created ex novo. The result is a new benchmark, the Catalan Language Understanding Benchmark (CLUB), which we publish as an open resource, together with the clean textual corpus, the language model, and the cleaning pipeline.

TDT systems aim to cluster a corpus of news articles by event, and in that context, stories that describe the same event are likely to have been written at around the same time. Prior work on time modeling for TDT takes this into account, but does not well capture how time interacts with the semantic nature of the event. For example, stories about a tropical storm are likely to be written within a short time interval, while stories about a movie release may appear over weeks or months. In our work, we design a neural method that fuses temporal and textual information into a single representation of news documents for event detection. We fine-tune these time-aware document embeddings with a triplet loss architecture, integrate the model into downstream TDT systems, and evaluate the systems on two benchmark TDT data sets in English. In the retrospective setting, we apply clustering algorithms to the time-aware embeddings and show substantial improvements over baselines on the News2013 data set. In the online streaming setting, we add our document encoder to an existing state-of-the-art TDT pipeline and demonstrate that it can benefit the overall performance.

(ii) What lessons can be drawn more broadly from the role of university policy in the process of institutionalizing transdisciplinarity? To address these questions, we take the Universidad de Chile as a case study and apply a qualitative methodology of content analysis of university policy documents in the period 2006C2021. Grounded on empirical data, we elaborate on the concept of situated transdisciplinarity that emerges from the interplay between practices and policy at the Universidad de Chile and serves as a tool for future institutionalizing processes.

A stochastic model is purposely developed to explicitly account for the entire population ( 400000 inhabitants) of Guadeloupe. The available data for Guadeloupe are analysed and combined with general characteristics of the COVID-19 to constrain the parameters of the model. The time-evolution of the number of cases follows the well-known exponential-like model observed at the very beginning of a pandemic outbreak. The exponential growth of the number of infected individuals is controlled by the so-called basic reproductive number, R0, defined as the likely number of additional cases generated by a single infectious case during its infectious period TI. Because of the rather long duration of infectious period ( 14 days) a high rate of contamination is sustained during several weeks after the beginning of the containment period. This may constitute a source of discouragement for people restrained to respect strict containment rules. It is then unlikely that, during the containment period, R0 falls to zero. Fortunately, our models shows that the containment effects are not much sensitive to the exact value of R0 provided we have R0 < 0.6. For such conditions, we show that the number of severe and critical cases is highly tempered about 4 to 6 weeks after the beginning of the containment. Also, the maximum number of critical cases (i.e. the cases that may exceed the hospital intensive care capacity) remains near 30 when R0 < 0.6. For a larger R0 = 0.8 a slower decrease of the number of critical cases occurs, leading to a larger number of deceased patients. This last example illustrates the great importance to maintain an as low as possible R0 during and after the containment period. The rather long delay between the beginning of the containment and the appearance of the slowing-down of the rate of contamination puts a particular strength on the communication and sanitary education of people. To be mostly efficient, this communication must be done by a locally recognised medical staff. We believe that this point is a crucial matter of success.","output":"Prediction of the time evolution of the COVID-19 disease in Guadeloupe with a stochastic evolutionary model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The family flaviviridae and alphaviridae contain a diverse group of pathogens that cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Diagnosis of the virus responsible for disease is essential to ensure patients receive appropriate clinical management. Very few real-time RT-PCR based assays are able to detect the presence of all members of these families using a single primer and probe set. We have developed a novel chemistry, 3base, which simplifies the viral nucleic acids allowing the design of RT-PCR assays capable of pan-family identification. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING: Synthetic constructs, viral nucleic acids, intact viral particles and characterised reference materials were used to determine the specificity and sensitivity of the assays. Synthetic constructs demonstrated the sensitivities of the pan-flavivirus detection component were in the range of 13 copies per PCR. The pan-alphavirus assay had a sensitivity range of 10C25 copies per reaction depending on the viral strain. Lower limit of detection studies using whole virus particles demonstrated that sensitivity for assays was in the range of 1C2 copies per reaction. No cross reactivity was observed with a number of commonly encountered viral strains. Proficiency panels showed 100% concordance with the expected results and the assays performed as well as, if not better than, other assays used in laboratories worldwide. After initial assay validation the pan-viral assays were then tested during the 2016C2017 Vanuatu dengue-2 outbreak. Positive results were detected in 116 positives from a total of 187 suspected dengue samples. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The pan-viral screening assays described here utilise a novel 3base technology and are shown to provide a sensitive and specific method to screen and thereafter speciate flavi- and/or alpha- viruses in clinical samples. The assays performed well in an outbreak situation and can be used to detect positive clinical samples containing any flavivirus or alphavirus in approximately 3 hours 30 minutes.","output":"Validation of the easyscreen flavivirus dengue alphavirus detection kit based on 3base amplification technology and its application to the 2016/17 Vanuatu dengue outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To curb the spread of COVID-19, many governments around the world have implemented tiered lockdowns with varying degrees of stringency.

By validating our model to the data on notified cases from five different states and overall India, we estimated several epidemiologically important parameters as well as the basic reproduction number ($R_{0}$). Combining the mechanistic mathematical model with different statistical forecast models, we projected notified cases in the six locations for the period May 17, 2020, till May 31, 2020.

Furthermore, a large scale COVID-19 mass testing is required to reduce community infection. Ensemble model forecast suggested a high rise in the COVID-19 notified cases in most of the locations in the coming days. Furthermore, the trend of the effective reproduction number ($R_{t}$) during the projection period indicates if the lockdown measures are completely removed after May 17, 2020, a high spike in notified cases may be seen in those locations.

Early detection of COVID-19 positive patients and timely isolation of the patients are essential to prevent its spread. Chest X-ray images of COVID-19 patients often show the characteristics of multifocality, bilateral hairy glass turbidity, patchy network turbidity, etc. It is crucial to design a method to automatically identify COVID-19 from chest X-ray images to help diagnosis and prognosis. Existing studies for the classification of COVID-19 rarely consider the role of attention mechanisms on the classification of chest X-ray images and fail to capture the cross-channel and cross-spatial interrelationships in multiple scopes. This paper proposes a multi-kernel-size spatial-channel attention method to detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. Our proposed method consists of three stages. The first stage is feature extraction. The second stage contains two parallel multi-kernel-size attention modules: multi-kernel-size spatial attention and multi-kernel-size channel attention. The two modules capture the cross-channel and cross-spatial interrelationships in multiple scopes using multiple 1D and 2D convolutional kernels of different sizes to obtain channel and spatial attention feature maps. The third stage is the classification module. We integrate the chest X-ray images from three public datasets: COVID-19 Chest X-ray Dataset Initiative, ActualMed COVID-19 Chest X-ray Dataset Initiative, and COVID-19 radiography database for evaluation.

This led to the shutdown of educational institutes throughout the country, restricting all activities to online mediums. The shift has affected how students engage with each other, where rather than in-person interaction, they meet through a variety of online tools. In this paper, we discuss how the normal everyday routine of hanging out with friends has been transformed during a prolonged lockdown of over ten months and counting. We investigate the opportunities and challenges students encounter when socializing online through various online modes including video calls, communal movie watching and social media. We discuss how social interaction;in particular, hanging out with friends has been transformed through these technologies and its implications for facilitating spontaneous interaction, negotiating intimacy, mutual understanding, and accessibility to different social groups. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of how these factors impact the transition from in-person to online modes of casual social interaction. ? 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","output":"Hanging Out Online: Social Life During the Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Detecting all asymptomatic or presymptomatic COVID-19 virus spreaders at a workplace requires daily testing of employees by RT-PCR, which is not practical. Over a two week period, 9 Europe and USA workplace locations were chosen to test employees for SARS-CoV-2 infection (841 tests) and high-frequency-touch point environmental surfaces (5,500 tests) for Coronavirus by RT-PCR. Of the 9 locations, 3 had one or more employees infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the two week study period. None of the employees who tested positive had symptoms at the time of testing and none developed symptoms during subsequent 14 day quarantine. Locations with significant prevalence of Coronavirus contaminated environmental surfaces were 10 times more likely to have a positive employees than locations with no or very few environmental surfaces positive for Coronavirus. Break room chairs, workbenches, and break room door handles were the most frequently contaminated environmental surfaces. Surface Coronavirus RNA was detected at very low concentrations (RT-PCR 34 to 38 Cq).

Based on the ethnomedicinal survey data, commonly used nine formulations were selected (Aru-18, Basam, Dadue, Dashel, Mutik-25, Raab Ga Yangzin Tea, Serdok-11, Sugmel-10, and Yungwa-4) to test biological activities. Antioxidant activity was evaluated using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging method. The cytotoxicity was examined by using the Allium cepa L. root tip meristem model. Similarly, the antibacterial effect was assessed by using well diffusion and broth dilution methods. RESULTS: An ethnomedicinal survey showed a total of 52 Tibetan formulations were generally used by respondents for common diseases such as stomach disorders, diabetes, and migraine. From the antioxidant activity test, Sugmel-10 showed the highest DPPH free-radical-scavenging activity (IC(50) 1.8 g/ml) and Yungwa-4 showed the lowest activity (IC(50) 5.2 g/ml). Also, from the cytotoxic activity, the A. cepa root meristem model exhibited significant dose- and time-dependent growth suppression in Basam, Dadue, Mutik-25, and Serdok-11 as compared with cyclophosphamide standard drug. Similarly, Basam showed a good antibacterial effect having MIC 20 mg/ml and MBC 100 mg/ml against Enterococci faecalis. Conclusion.

This study examined the prevalence of anxiety and depression, and their association with some less explored factors like perceived and relative health status, having elderly members in the family, fear for own and family future, and others from the Asian context.Methods: Using a cross-sectional online survey, data were collected from the population aged 18 and above years, on socio-demographic and economic attributes, and two separate twelve-item scales were used to assess the level of anxiety and depression. The score of anxiety (x=21.74 and s=8.20;=0.897) and depression (x=24.38 and s =10.30;=0.937) were ranges from 12 to 60. High scores of anxiety and depression scales indicate higher levels of anxiety and depression. Both descriptive and multivariate analyses were performed to report the level of anxiety and depression by socio-demographic and other attributes;multivariate linear regression (forwarded method) was used to analyze the effects of each predictor on the anxiety and depression scores.Results: The findings revealed that respondents' concern for their family's future has a significant positive effect on anxiety scores but has a significant negative effect on depression scores;On the other hand, having elderly family members has a significant association with lower anxiety scores but higher depression scores. Poor conditions of (1) perceived physical health status in comparison with others, (2) self-evaluated physical health status, and (3) perceived physical health status in comparison to before COVID-19 lead to significantly higher anxiety scores. Anxiety score remained the most critical factor among all the predictors in explaining depression score. Limitations: Anxiety and depression of all people are not reflected in the results as we used online platforms to collect data. Some misclassifications might occur for using self-reported outcome measures and socially desirable responses collected through the cross-sectional survey.

With limited testing kits, it is impossible for every patient with respiratory illness to be tested using conventional techniques (RT-PCR). The tests also have long turn-around time, and limited sensitivity. Detecting possible COVID-19 infections on Chest X-Ray may help quarantine high risk patients while test results are awaited. X-Ray machines are already available in most healthcare systems, and with most modern X-Ray systems already digitized, there is no transportation time involved for the samples either. In this work we propose the use of chest X-Ray to prioritize the selection of patients for further RT-PCR testing. This may be useful in an inpatient setting where the present systems are struggling to decide whether to keep the patient in the ward along with other patients or isolate them in COVID-19 areas. It would also help in identifying patients with high likelihood of COVID with a false negative RT-PCR who would need repeat testing. Further, we propose the use of modern AI techniques to detect the COVID-19 patients using X-Ray images in an automated manner, particularly in settings where radiologists are not available, and help make the proposed testing technology scalable.

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of different levels of PEEP on the incidence of atelectasis after heart surgery. Methods: This is a double-blind randomized controlled trial that was adopted from a research project recorded in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials. This paper is the result of a research project undertaken at Fatemeh Zahra Hospital (Mazandaran Heart Center) in 2015. 180 patients underwent open heart surgery were selected and were divided randomly into three groups: control, PEEP=8, and PEEP=10 (60 in each group). The patients in the two PEEP8 and PEEP10 intervention groups separately received 8 cm H2O and 10 cm H2O PEEP, respectively, 30 minutes after admission to the ICU for 4 hours and then received 5 cm H2O PEEP until extubation. Atelectasis was examined two hours after the extubation and on the third day after surgery. Results: The incidence rates of atelectasis two hours after extubation on the first day of surgery were 22 (36.7%), 20 (33.3%) and 10 (16.7%) patients in the control, PEEP8 and PEEP10 groups, respectively. The differences were statistically significant among the three groups (p=0.035). The incidence rates of atelectasis on the third day after surgery were 39 (65%), 36 (60%) and 21 (35%) patients in the control, PEEP8 and PEEP10 groups, respectively. The differences were also statistically significant among the three groups (p=0.003). Conclusion: The use of 10 cm H2O PEEP can lead to a reduction in the incidence of atelectasis, intubation time at the ICU and length of ICU and hospital stay. Given that this level of PEEP is effective, this method is recommended to be used in postoperative care of patients.","output":"The prophylactic effect of different levels of positive endexpiratory pressure on the incidence rate of atelectasis after cardiac surgery: A Randomized Controlled Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, has been declared a pandemic by the WHO in March 2020.

In this process, model quality assessment (MQA), which estimates the accuracy of the predicted structure, is also practically important. Currently, the most commonly used dataset to evaluate the performance of MQA is the critical assessment of the protein structure prediction (CASP) dataset. However, the CASP dataset does not contain enough targets with high-quality models, and thus cannot sufficiently evaluate the MQA performance in practical use. Additionally, most application studies employ homology modeling because of its reliability. However, the CASP dataset includes models generated by de novo methods, which may lead to the mis-estimation of MQA performance. In this study, we created new benchmark datasets, named a homology models dataset for model quality assessment (HMDM), that contain targets with high-quality models derived using homology modeling. We then benchmarked the performance of the MQA methods using the new datasets and compared their performance to that of the classical selection based on the sequence identity of the template proteins. The results showed that model selection by the latest MQA methods using deep learning is better than selection by template sequence identity and classical statistical potentials.

MethodsCOVID-19 cases and locations were curated for geostatistical analyses from March 2020 through June 2021, corresponding to the first, second, and third waves of infections. Daily cases were aggregated according to designated forward sortation area [FSA], and postal codes [PC] in municipal regions covering Hamilton, Kitchener/Waterloo, London, Ottawa, Toronto, and Windsor/Essex county. Hotspots were identified with area-to-area tests including Getis-Ord Gi*, Global Morans I spatial autocorrelation, and Local Morans I asymmetric clustering and outlier analyses. Case counts were also interpolated across geographic regions by Empirical Bayesian Kriging, which localizes high concentrations of COVID-19 positive tests, independent of FSA or PC boundaries.

Municipal and provincial results were validated by comparisons with known outbreaks at long-term care and other high density residences and on farms. PC-level analyses revealed hotspots at higher geospatial resolution than public reports of FSAs, and often sooner. Results of different tests and kriging were compared to determine consistency among hotspot assignments. Concurrent or consecutive hotspots in close proximity suggested potential community transmission of COVID-19 from cluster and outlier analysis of neighboring PCs and by kriging.

Flexible cystoscopy confirmed the imaging findings, showing two endourethral clips, partly obstructing the VUR. Firstly, a serial wire-guided dilation took place, followed by left ureteral double-J stent placement. Unfortunately, the clips could not be concurrently removed due to their firm attachment to the bladder neck. Hence, our patient was scheduled for transurethral resection of the bladder neck and simultaneous endoscopic clip removal. CONCLUSIONS To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to highlight such a delayed incidental finding, 10 years after open retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP), during a JJ stent insertion for obstructive uropathy without previous clip-induced lower urinary tract symptoms. Although rare, physicians should be aware of the potential clip-related complications arising either in the short- or long-term postprostatectomy setting.","output":"Incidental discovery of endourethral clip migration 10 years after radical prostatectomy: A case report and review of the literature."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Every medical product requires additional study even after regulatory approval.

We describe three patients who independently acquired their infection. These three patients experienced mild COVID\\\\19 and completely recovered symptomatically within 10 days, but remained PCR\\\\positive in deep pharyngeal samples for at least 38 days. We attempted to isolate virus from pharyngeal swabs to investigate whether these patients still carried infectious virus. METHODS: Infectious virus was amplified in Vero E6 cells and characterized by electron microscopy and WGS. The immune response was investigated by ELISA and peptide arrays. RESULTS: In all three cases, infectious and replication\\\\competent virus was isolated and amplified in Vero E6 cells. Virus replication was detected by RT\\\\PCR and immunofluorescence microscopy. Electron microscopy confirmed the formation of intact SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 particles. For a more detailed analysis, all three isolates were characterized by whole\\\\genome sequencing (WGS). The sequence data revealed that the isolates belonged to the 20A or 20C clade, and two mutations in ORF8 were identified among other mutations that could be relevant for establishing a long\\\\term infection. Characterization of the humoral immune response in comparison to patients that had fully recovered from mild COVID\\\\19 revealed a lack of antibodies binding to sequential epitopes of the receptor\\\\binding domain (RBD) for the long\\\\term infected patients.

A cross-sectional study was carried out with 116 individuals aged 20 to 59, with normal body mass index (BMI) and high percentage of body fat. Anthropometric and body composition measures, glycaemic control and serum lipid markers, SNP PLIN1 11482 G>A, and nutrient intake were evaluated. Interactions between nutrient intake and the SNP were determined by regression models and adjusted for potential confounders. The SNP frequency was 56.0% GG, 38.8% GA and 5.2% AA. Anthropometric measures and biochemical markers were not different according to genotype, except for total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-HDL-C concentrations. However, important interactions between the SNP and dietary intake were observed. Carbohydrate intake interacted with the SNP PLIN1 11482 G>A to modulate waist circumference (WC) and the Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance index. Interaction of lipid intake and the SNP modulated TC and LDL-C concentrations, and the interaction between protein intake and the SNP tended to modulate weight, WC and BMI.

Despite several control efforts invested in breaking the transmission chain of the disease, there is a rise in the number of reported infected and death cases around the world. Hence, there is the need for a mathematical model that can reliably describe the real nature of the transmission behaviour and control of the disease. This study presents an appropriately developed deterministic compartmental model to investigate the effect of different pharmaceutical (treatment therapies) and non-pharmaceutical (particularly, human personal protection and contact tracing and testing on the exposed individuals) control measures on COVID-19 population dynamics in Malaysia. The data from daily reported cases of COVID-19 between 3 March and 31 December 2020 are used to parameterize the model. The basic reproduction number of the model is estimated. Numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate the effect of various control combination strategies involving the use of personal protection, contact tracing and testing, and treatment control measures on the disease spread. Numerical simulations reveal that the implementation of each strategy analysed can significantly reduce COVID-19 incidence and prevalence in the population. However, the results of effectiveness analysis suggest that a strategy that combines both the pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical control measures averts the highest number of infections in the population.","output":"Impact of control interventions on COVID-19 population dynamics in Malaysia: a mathematical study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As an emergent and fulminant infectious disease, Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a worldwide pandemic. The early identification and timely treatment of severe patients are crucial to reducing the mortality of COVID-19. This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and early predictors for severe COVID-19, and to establish a prediction model for the identification and triage of severe patients. METHODS: All confirmed patients with COVID-19 admitted by the Second Affiliated Hospital of Air Force Medical University were enrolled in this retrospective non-interventional study. The patients were divided into a mild group and a severe group, and the clinical data were compared between the two groups. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used to identify the independent early predictors for severe COVID-19, and the prediction model was constructed by multivariate logistic regression analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the predictive value of the prediction model and each early predictor. RESULTS: A total of 40 patients were enrolled in this study, of whom 19 were mild and 21 were severe. The proportions of patients with venerable age (60 years old), comorbidities, and hypertension in severe patients were higher than that of the mild (P < 0.05). The duration of fever and respiratory symptoms, and the interval from illness onset to viral clearance were longer in severe patients (P < 0.05). Most patients received at least one form of oxygen treatments, while severe patients required more mechanical ventilation (P < 0.05). Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that venerable age, hypertension, lymphopenia, hypoalbuminemia and elevated neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were the independent high-risk factors for severe COVID-19. ROC curves demonstrated significant predictive value of age, lymphocyte count, albumin and NLR for severe COVID-19. The sensitivity and specificity of the newly constructed prediction model for predicting severe COVID-19 was 90.5% and 84.2%, respectively, and whose positive predictive value, negative predictive value and crude agreement were all over 85%. CONCLUSIONS: The severe COVID-19 risk model might help clinicians quickly identify severe patients at an early stage and timely take optimal therapeutic schedule for them.","output":"Early prediction and identification for severe patients during the pandemic of COVID-19: A severe COVID-19 risk model constructed by multivariate logistic regression analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a horse-riding simulator (HRS) with virtual reality (VR) on gross motor function, balance control, and body composition in children with spastic cerebral palsy (CP).

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 raised an extremely serious concern, because its most frequent clinical presentation was pneumonia. Features such as sex play an active role in the incidence and outcomes of pneumonia. This study aimed to evaluate differences between sexes concerning COVID-19-related pneumonia. METHODS This was a retrospective, multicentre study that enrolled 340 consecutive adult patients admitted to hospital for COVID-19-related pneumonia. Of these patients, 219 were males (64.4%) and 121, females (35.6%). Primary endpoints were differences between both sexes as per clinical features, laboratory and radiologic results, and inhospital and 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included differences between both sexes and factors associated with mortality. RESULTS Males admitted to the COVID-19 Unit were older than females (74.5  15.7 vs. 64.5  11.9). Cardiovascular disorders were more frequent in males (19.17% vs 13.25%), whereas obesity was more common in females (54.5% vs 37.45%). In-hospital and 30-day mortality were higher in males than in females (23.3% vs 15.7%; 24.6% vs 19.8%, respectively). No differences were observed in hospital stay; however, males had a longer ICU stay when compared with females (11.045.4 vs 7.053.4). Variables associated with a higher mortality rate included older age, a lower number of lymphocytes upon admission and higher levels of ferritin and troponin upon admission. CONCLUSIONS Males had significantly higher mortality and longer ICU stay than females. More comorbidities in males than in females could explain the difference in mortality rates. The protective role of genetic factors can partially explain the better outcomes observed in female patients with COVID-19.","output":"Differences between sexes concerning COVID-19-related pneumonia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Millions of Americans lost their jobs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, placing immeasurable stress on families and making it difficult for parents to support their children's basic needs. Research shows that screening for social determinants of health is an important part of a child's well visit, noting that awareness of these factors leads to more holistic and improved quality of care. Due to increased precautions during the COVID-19 pandemic and a significant decrease in well-child visits and in-person appointments, there was a marked decrease in the number of face-to-face opportunities for these screenings. In a time of increased need, methods such as telephone screenings represent an opportunity to assess needs and connect patients and families with helpful resources. METHODS: This study occurred in Baltimore, Maryland at the University of Maryland Pediatrics at Midtown outpatient practice (PAM). Five pediatric resident physicians and 17 medical students developed a telephone welfare screening tool and called families receiving primary care at the clinic over a 9-week period. The team documented identified needs and used a community resources database to provide resources to families over the phone. Data regarding the identified needs was collected and analyzed throughout the screening process. RESULTS: Volunteers contacted 671 families using our finalized screening tool. Of those, 349 answered the telephone call (52%) and 328 (49%) agreed to participate in the screening. Results showed that families commonly identified food insecurity (20%) and symptoms of depression (18%). This was consistent across families' home locations as analyzed by postal ZIP code. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that telephone screening is a feasible and informative method for identifying and addressing the social needs of pediatric primary care patients and their families.

The aim of this study was to analyze the value of hypoalbuminemia on admission as a predictor of mortality and adverse events in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We analyzed retrospective data from a cohort of 609 consecutive patients, with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, discharged from hospital (deceased or alive). Demographic characteristics, previous comorbidities, symptoms and laboratory findings on admission were collected. Comorbidities were assessed by Charlson-Age Comorbidity Index. RESULTS: Hypoalbuminemia on admission (<34g/L) was more frequent in nonsurvivors than survivors (65.6% vs. 38%, p<0.001) and was significantly associated with the development of sepsis, macrophage activation syndrome, acute heart failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute kidney injury, regardless of Charlson-Age Comorbidity Index. Hypoalbuminemia was a predictor of mortality in multivariable Cox regression analysis (HR 1.537, 95% CI 1.050-2.250, p=0.027), independently of Charlson-Age Index, gender, lymphocyte count <800/L, creatinine, high-sensitivity C- reactive protein >8mg/L, lactate dehydrogenase >250U/L, bilateral infiltration on chest X-ray and q-SOFA &#8805;2.

Given the widespread disruption caused by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, it is important to evaluate its impact on children with chronic health conditions. This study examines the health of paediatric patients with obesity enrolled in a tertiary hospital weight management program, before and 1 year into the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This is a retrospective chart review of patients aged 2 to 17 years enrolled in a paediatric weight management clinic. Mental health outcomes (i.e., new referrals to psychologist, social work, eating disorder program, incidence of dysregulated eating, suicidal ideation, and/or self-harm) and physical health (anthropometric measures) were compared before and 1 year into the pandemic. Results Among the 334 children seen in either period, there was an increase in referrals to psychologist (12.4% versus 26.5%; P=0.002) and the composite mental health outcome (17.2% versus 30.2%; P=0.005) during the pandemic compared with pre-pandemic. In a subset of children (n=30) with anthropometric measures in both periods, there was a lower rate of decline in BMIz score (-1.5 [2.00] versus -0.3 [0.73]/year; P=0.002) and an increase in adiposity (-0.8 [4.64] versus 2.7 [5.54]%/year; P=0.043) during the pandemic. Discussion The pandemic has impacted the mental and physical health of children with obesity engaged in a weight management clinic.

Although the factors influencing HIVDR are known and well-studied, HIVDR remains a threat to the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy. To understand the complexity of HIVDR, a comprehensive, systems approach is needed. Therefore, a local systems map was developed integrating all reported factors influencing HIVDR in the Dar es Salaam Urban Cohort Study area in Tanzania. The map was designed based on semi-structured interviews and workshops with people living with HIV and local actors who encounter people living with HIV during their daily activities. We visualized the feedback loops driving HIVDR, compared the local map with a systems map for Sub-Saharan Africa, previously constructed from interviews with international HIVDR experts, and suggest potential interventions to prevent HIVDR. We found several interconnected balancing and reinforcing feedback loops related to poverty, stigmatization, status disclosure, self-esteem, knowledge about HIVDR and healthcare system workload, among others, and identified three potential leverage points. Insights from this local systems map were complementary to the insights from the Sub-Saharan systems map showing that both viewpoints are needed to fully understand the system.

With NET, the nodal pCR rate was 11% (4/38) of biopsy-proven cases, and the breast pCR rate was 1.6% (2/126). Nodal-dowstaging rates with NET and NAC were not significantly different (11% vs 18%; P = 0.37). Patients achieving nodal pCR with NET versus NAC were older (median age 70 vs 50, P = 0.004) and had greater progesterone receptor (PR) expression (85% vs 13%, P = 0.031), respectively. Of patients not candidates for BCS due to a large tumor relative to breast size, 36/47 (77%) became BCS-eligible with NET (median PR expression 55% vs 5% in those remaining ineligible, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION Although nodal pCR is more frequent than breast pCR, NET is more likely to de-escalate breast surgery than axillary surgery. However, with a nodal pCR rate of 11%, NET remains an option for downstaging node-positive patients without clear indications for NAC.","output":"How Effective is Neoadjuvant Endocrine Therapy (NET) in Downstaging the Axilla and Achieving Breast-Conserving Surgery?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Online learning is an educational process which takes place over the Internet as a form of distance education.

We bench-tested the triggering, battery duration, and tidal volume (V(T)) of 7 portable ventilators: LTV 1000, LTV 1200, Puritan Bennett 540, Trilogy, Vela, iVent 101, and HT50. METHODS We tested triggering with a modified dual-chamber test lung to simulate spontaneous breathing with weak, normal, and strong inspiratory effort. We measured battery duration by fully charging the battery and operating the ventilator with a V(T) of 500 mL, a respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min, and PEEP of 5 cm H(2)O until breath-delivery ceased. We tested V(T) accuracy with pediatric ventilation scenarios (V(T) 50 mL or 100 mL, respiratory rate 50 breaths/min, inspiratory time 0.3 s, and PEEP 5 cm H(2)O) and an adult ventilation scenario (V(T) 400 mL, respiratory rate 30 breaths/min, inspiratory time 0.5 s, and PEEP 5 cm H(2)O). We measured and analyzed airway pressure, volume, and flow signals. RESULTS At the adult settings the measured V(T) range was 362-426 mL. On the pediatric settings the measured V(T) range was 51-182 mL at the set V(T) of 50 mL, and 90-141 mL at the set V(T) of 100 mL. The V(T) delivered by the Vela at both the 50 mL and 100 mL, and by the HT50 at 100 mL, did not meet the American Society for Testing and Materials standard for V(T) accuracy. Triggering response and battery duration ranged widely among the tested ventilators. CONCLUSIONS There was wide variability in battery duration and triggering sensitivity. Five of the ventilators performed adequately in V(T) delivery across several settings.

METHODS: Retrospective single-center cohort study involving all late TOPs preceded by feticide between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2019 at a tertiary referral hospital in Austria. Outcome variables were retrieved and a time trend assessed between two 8-year intervals (2004C2011 versus 2012C2019). RESULTS: Between January 2004 and December 2019, a total of 209 singleton pregnancies (50.7% male; 46.9% female fetuses, 2.4% no disclosed sex) were terminated medically at a median gestational age of 25(+1) (17(+3)C37(+1)) weeks at our institution. Predominant conditions legally justifying the late medical abortion were abnormaltities of the brain/central nervous system (n = 83; 39.7%), chromosomal aberrations (n = 33; 15.8%), complex malformations (n = 31; 4.8%) and abnormaltities of the musculosceletal system including diaphragmatic hernias (n = 18; 8.6%), as reflected by the ICD-10-categories Congenital malformation of the central nervous system, Other congenital malformations and Chromosomal abnormalities.

Besides few reports from stray and pet dogs from localised geographical regions (cities/towns/small states), a comprehensive study on prevalence of Ehrlichia canis (E. canis) among working dogs from different geo-climatic zones of India was pertinently lacking. Study of CME among these dog populations was thus carried out, encompassing clinical aspects and different diagnostic methodologies viz., microscopy, serology and molecular biology. During the two-year study period, clinical specimens from 225 cases suspected of canine ehrlichiosis were examined for clinical pathology and presence of the haemoparasites. Overall prevalence of ehrlichiosis by microscopic examination, commercial dot-ELISA kit and nested PCR assay was estimated to be 1.3%, 19.1% and 5.8%, respectively, which were found to be statistically significant by McNemar Chi squared test (p < 0.05). It was also observed that possibly due to widespread use of doxycycline therapy in field, CME presently does not remain a potential threat which it uses to pose earlier. However, concurrent infections of E. canis and Babesia gibsoni were found to be mostly fatal. Keeping in view of high number of apparently healthy dogs (24) out of total positive cases (46) observed during the study, it is recommended that prevalence studies on CME should also involve screening of apparently healthy dogs. Phylogenetic analysis carried on partial sequencing of 16S rRNA of E. canis strains revealed that all of the Indian strains clustered in a single clade with other E. canis species from India and rest of the world. Molecular divergence was observed among the sequences of Brazilian and American isolates which were also included in the present study.

There is controversy regarding whether first-line treatment should be endoscopic therapy with cyanoacrylate glue or placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). We compared these methods on the basis of rebleeding, survival, and complications. DESIGN, SETTING, PATIENTS, AND INTERVENTIONS: This was a retrospective cohort analysis of cirrhotic patients with gastric variceal hemorrhage treated with endoscopic cyanoacrylate therapy or TIPS placement at a single U.S. center from 1997 to 2007. The groups were compared for rebleeding at 72 hours, 3 months, and 1 year; survival rates at 3 months and 1 year; and acute and extended complications and morbidity. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS A total of 105 patients were included. There were no significant pretreatment differences between the 2 groups in age, sex, MELD (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease) score at the time of admission, or cause of liver disease. There were no significant differences in rebleeding at 72 hours, 3 months, and 1 year; survival at 3 months and 1 year; and aggregate long-term survival or acute complications. However, the TIPS group had a higher rate of long-term morbidity requiring hospitalization (41% with a TIPS and 1.6% in the cyanoacrylate arm, P < .0001). LIMITATIONS Retrospective and uncontrolled samples. CONCLUSION In patients with similar characteristics, cyanoacrylate therapy performed as well as a TIPS in controlling and preventing gastric variceal hemorrhage with no significant differences in survival. Patients receiving cyanoacrylate therapy experienced significantly less long-term morbidity related to therapy than patients who received a TIPS. Cyanoacrylate therapy appears to be safe and effective and compares favorably with TIPS therapy.","output":"Endoscopic cyanoacrylate versus transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt for gastric variceal bleeding: a single-center U.S. analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, in Wuhan (PRC), there was an outbreak of a new coronavirus infection (COVID-19) caused by coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has a zoonotic origin. The World Health Organization announced the COVID-19 pandemic on March 11, 2020. In most cases, the disease is asymptomatic or mild. However, up to 15% of patients require hospitalization, and 5% develop a critical condition. To date, no effective antiviral drug COVID-19 has been found that can reduce mortality. Pathological changes in the lungs are manifested by diffuse alveolar damage, which is clinically manifested by increasing respiratory failure, accompanied by a decrease in saturation and oxygen concentration in arterial blood. It is assumed that autoimmune reactions play an important role in the development of multiple organ failure. Generalized inflammation is characterized by an increase in the concentration of C-reactive protein, ferritin, interleukin-1 and interleukin-6, and other markers. At the stage of development of infection in the form of a cytokine storm, proinflammatory cytokines can themselves become pathogenetic factors in the development of critical conditions, multiple organ failure and deaths. Therefore, a key challenge in treating hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is to control generalized inflammation. Glucocorticosteroid hormones (GCS) are widely used as anti-inflammatory drugs in the clinic of infectious diseases. However, until recently, there was no convincing data on the effectiveness of GCS in patients with COVID-19. Recently published results of a large randomized clinical trial (RECOVERY) showing the efficacy of GCS (dexamethasone) in the treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19. At the same time, the feasibility and effectiveness of GCS in patients with COVID-19 outside critical conditions, the pathogenetic mechanisms that determine the effectiveness/ineffectiveness of these drugs and the validity of their use remain insufficiently studied. ? 2021 Consilium Medikum.

In this review, we focus on an NADP(H) sensor, HSCARG (also named NMRAL1), which is a NmrA-like protein that is widely present in mammals, and provide a comprehensive overview of the current knowledge of its structure and physiological functions. HSCARG selectively binds to the reduced form of type II coenzyme NADPH via its Rossmann fold domain. In response to reduction of intracellular NADPH concentration, HSCARG transforms from homodimer to monomer and exhibits enhanced interactions with its binding partners. In the cytoplasm, HSCARG negatively regulates innate immunity through impairing the activities of NF-B and RLR pathways. Besides, HSCARG regulates redox homeostasis via suppression of ROS and NO generation. Intensive and persistent oxidative stress leads to translocation of HSCARG from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where it regulates the DNA damage response. Taken together, HSCARG functions as a linkage between cellular redox status and other signaling pathways and fine-tunes cellular response to redox changes.","output":"Structure and Functions of cellular redox sensor HSCARG/NMRAL1, a linkage among redox status, innate immunity, DNA damage response, and cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nano-enabled sensing is an expanding interdisciplinary field of emerging science with dynamic multifunctional detecting capabilities, equipped with a wide range of multi-faceted nanomaterial having diverse dimensions and composition.

Nanobodies are successful new biologics in treating mucosal infectious disease as they recognize conserved epitopes on hypervariable pathogens.

This study evaluated the impact of the pandemic on colorectal cancer (CRC) patients at our center and aimed to share the lessons we learned with clinics currently experiencing this impact. METHODS: We retrospectively collected data on CRC patients admitted between January 1, 2020 and May 3, 2020; the control group comprised patients admitted between January 1, 2019 and May 3, 2019. RESULTS: During the pandemic, outpatient volumes decreased significantly, especially those of nonlocal and elderly patients, whereas the number of patients who received chemotherapy and surgery remained the same. During the pandemic, 710 CRC patients underwent curative resection. The proportion of patients who received laparoscopic surgeries was 49.4%, significantly higher than the 39.5% during the same period in 2019. The proportion of major complication during the pandemic was not significantly different from that of the control group. The mean hospital stay was significantly longer than that of the control group. CONCLUSIONS: CRC patients confirmed to be infection-free can receive routine treatment. Using online medical counseling and appropriate identification, treatment and follow-up can be effectively maintained. Adjuvant and palliative chemotherapy should not be discontinued. Endoscopic polypectomy, elective, palliative, and multidisciplinary surgeries can be postponed, while curative surgery should proceed as usual.

Additional safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines are needed in a timely manner to adequately address the pandemic on an international scale. Such safe and effective vaccines would be especially appealing for international deployment if they also have favorable stability, supply, and potential for implementation in mass vaccination campaigns. Randomized trials provide particularly reliable insights about vaccine efficacy and safety. While enhanced efficiency and interpretability can be obtained from placebo-controlled trials, in settings where their conduct is no longer possible, randomized non-inferiority trials may enable obtaining reliable evaluations of experimental vaccines through direct comparison with active comparator vaccines established to have worthwhile efficacy. METHODS: The usual objective of non-inferiority trials is to reliably assess whether the efficacy of an experimental vaccine is not unacceptably worse than that of an active control vaccine previously established to be effective, likely in a placebo-controlled trial. This is formally achieved by ruling out a non-inferiority margin identified to be the minimum threshold for what would constitute an unacceptable loss of efficacy. This article not only investigates non-inferiority margins, denoted by , that address the usual objective of determining whether the experimental vaccine is at least similarly effective to the active comparator vaccine in the non-inferiority trial, but also develops non-inferiority margins, denoted by (o), intended to address the worldwide need for multiple safe and effective vaccines by satisfying the less stringent requirement that the experimental vaccine be at least similarly effective to an active comparator vaccine having efficacy that satisfies the widely accepted World Health OrganizationCFood and Drug Administration criteria for worthwhile vaccine efficacy. RESULTS: Using the margin  enables non-inferiority trials to reliably evaluate experimental vaccines that truly are similarly effective to an active comparator vaccine having any level of worthwhile efficacy. When active comparator vaccines have efficacy in the range of 50%C70%, non-inferiority trials designed to use the margin (o) have appealing properties, especially for experimental vaccines having true efficacy of approximately 60%. CONCLUSION: Non-inferiority trials using the proposed margins may enable reliable randomized evaluations of efficacy and safety of experimental COVID-19 vaccines. Such trials often require approximately two- to three-fold the person-years follow-up than a placebo-controlled trial. This could be achieved, without substantive increases in sample size, by increasing the average duration of follow-up from 2 months to approximately 4C6 months, assuming efficacy of the active comparator vaccine has been reliably evaluated over that longer duration.","output":"COVID-19 vaccine trials: The use of active controls and non-inferiority studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We called by telephone a representative sample of 600 households in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia to assess household food and nutrition security status during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Despite the continually increasing number of COVID-19 cases reported to CDC, at national level, the percentage of visits to outpatient providers and emergency departments has decreased and mortality rates attributed to COVID-19 have declined compared to the previous weeks, still above the baseline. It is common knowledge that the coronavirus pandemic has reshaped societies and economies around the globe, affecting all aspects of everyday life. Public health systems as a whole have been globally affected since they had to face extraordinary demands over a long period of time, which, in turn, required rapid adjustments in the operating procedures that were already in use, in order to provide high-standard health services, while respecting patients quality of life. Over half of deaths in low-income countries are caused by communicable diseases, maternal causes, conditions arising during pregnancy and childbirth, and nutritional deficiencies. On the contrary, this percentage is less than 7% in high-income countries. Noncommunicable diseases cause 71% of deaths globally, ranging from 37% in low-income countries to 88% in high-income countries. However, in terms of absolute number of deaths, 78% of global NCD deaths occurred in low-and middle-income countries.

This study aimed to explore how widespread and severe moral distress is amongst intensive care professionals in the UK. Methods: Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, a paper questionnaire that quantitatively assessed moral distress using the validated Measure of Moral Distress for Healthcare Professionals (MMD-HP) was distributed at four intensive care units of varying size and speciality facilities. Results: 227 questionnaires were returned, including 165 nurses and 40 doctors with a mean age and ICU experience of 38.1 and 10.1 years, respectively. The median moral distress score was 108 (IQR = 78.2, range 0 to 288). Moral distress was greatest in situations related to delivering aggressive treatment that was perceived as futile or not in the patients best interests, closely followed by situations related to lack of resources compromising care. Moral distress was independently influenced by profession ( p = 0.02) (nurses 117.0 vs doctors 78.0) and had no relationship with participant age and ICU experience. One-third indicated their intention to leave their current post due to moral distress and this was greater amongst nurses than doctors (37.0% vs 15.0%). Multiple logistic regression models included profession, gender, hospital type, age and ICU experience as covariates and had good discrimination and ability to predict intention to leave. Moral distress was associated with an intention to leave their current post in unadjusted and adjusted analyses (adjOR = 1.011 per 1 unit increase in moral distress, 1.006C1.017, p < 0.0001) and a previous post (adjOR = 1.009, 1.004C1.014, p = 0.001).

Its relationship with an intention to leave a post and the high proportion of ICU nurses considering leaving their current post due to moral distress is concerning, particularly as this study was performed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Addressing moral distress should be a priority, however the ideal interventions remain unclear.","output":"A multi-centre quantitative assessment of moral distress amongst intensive care unit professions in the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses are large, enveloped viruses with a single-stranded RNA genome, infecting both humans and a wide range of wild and domestic animals. SARS-CoV-2, the agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, has 80% sequence homology with SARS-CoV-1 and 96C98% homology with coronaviruses isolated from bats. The spread of infection is favored by prolonged exposure to high densities of aerosols indoors. Current studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is much more stable than other coronaviruses and viral respiratory pathogens. The severe forms of infection are associated with several risk factors, including advanced age, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, obesity, chronic inflammatory or autoimmune disease, and other preexisting infectious diseases, all having in common the pre-existence of a pro-inflammatory condition. Consequently, it is essential to understand the relationship between the inflammatory process and the specific immune response in SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this review, we present a general characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (origin, sensitivity to chemical and physical factors, multiplication cycle, genetic variability), the molecular mechanisms of COVID-19 pathology, the host immune response and discuss how the inflammatory conditions associated with different diseases could increase the risk of COVID-19. Last, but not least, we briefly review the SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics, pharmacology, and future approaches toward vaccine development.","output":"SARS-CoV-2: From Structure to Pathology, Host Immune Response and Therapeutic Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIM: to gain experience and highlight any margins for improvement, we outlined the role played by specialist surgeons (with particular reference to orthopedic surgeons), redeployed in treating COVID-19 patients in the Emergency Department of a general hospital, with severe overcrowding due to the massive and continuous arrival of patients Methods: \\"on the field\\" experience of the Authors is reported, followed by a narrative review of the literature, mainly on the topic of health-personnel redeployment during an emergency Results: a brief chronological discussion of the progressive reorganization of the hospital, in relation to the progress of the epidemic in the area, is reported, with specific reference to the experience of orthopedic and other branches specialist surgeons, that was characterized by a high degree of uncertainty about what to do, worsened by organizational difficulties due to the incessant arrival of patients and subsequent overcrowding.

CONCLUSIONS: The most significant aspect that we have tried to outline is the organizational difficulty, due to the rapid and unpredictable change in the situation: greater efficiency and flexibility, seen as the ability to overcome bureaucratic, logistical, regulatory or budgetary obstacles that prevent the rapid changes made necessary by the epidemic, could perhaps help to face better any subsequent pandemic wave, like the fierce one ongoing at the present moment.","output":"Redeployment of specialist surgeons in the COVID-19 pandemic in a general hospital: critical issues and suggestions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"EK1 peptide is a membrane fusion inhibitor with broad-spectrum activity against human coronaviruses (CoVs). In the outbreak of COVID-19, we generated a lipopeptide EK1V1 by modifying EK1 with cholesterol, which exhibited significantly improved antiviral activity. In this study, we surprisingly found that EK1V1 also displayed potent cross-inhibitory activities against divergent HIV-1, HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) isolates. Consistently, the recently reported EK1 derivative EK1C4 and SARS-CoV-2 derived fusion inhibitor lipopeptides (IPB02 a IPB09) also inhibited HIV-1 Env-mediated cell-cell fusion and infection efficiently. In the inhibition of a panel of HIV-1 mutants resistant to HIV-1 fusion inhibitors, EK1V1 and IPB02-based inhibitors exhibited significantly decreased or increased activities, suggesting the heptad repeat-1 region (HR1) of HIV-1 gp41 being their target. Furthermore, the sequence alignment and molecular docking analyses verified the target site and revealed the mechanism underlying the resistance. Combined, we conclude that this serendipitous discovery provides a proof-of-concept for a common mechanism of viral fusion and critical information for the development of broad-spectrum antivirals.","output":"Pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitors possess potent inhibitory activity against HIV-1, HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are three classes of antiviral drugs approved for the treatment of influenza: the M2 ion channel inhibitors (amantadine, rimantadine), neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (laninamivir, oseltamivir, peramivir, zanamivir), and the protease inhibitor (favipiravir); some of the agents are only available in selected countries [1, 2]. These agents are effective at treating the signs and symptoms of influenza in patients infected with susceptible viruses. Clinical failure has been demonstrated in patients infected with viruses with primary resistance, i.e., antivirals can be present in the virus initially infecting the patient, or resistance may emerge during the course of therapy [3C5]. NA inhibitors are active against all nine NA subtypes recognized in nature [6], including highly pathogenic avian influenza A/H5N1 and recent low-pathogenic avian influenza A/H7N9 viruses [7]. Since seasonal influenza is usually an acute, self-limited illness in which viral clearance usually occurs rapidly due to innate and adaptive host immune responses, the emergence of drug-resistant variants would be anticipated to have limited effect on clinical recovery in otherwise healthy patients, as has been demonstrated clinically [3, 8, 9]. Unfortunately, immunocompromised or immunologically na?ve hosts, such as young children and infants or those exposed to novel strains, are more likely to have mutations that confer resistance emergence during therapy; such resistant variants may also result in clinically significant adverse outcomes [10C13].","output":"Antiviral Resistance in Influenza Viruses: Clinical and Epidemiological Aspects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The lead article in this January-February 2021 issue-the first of the Hastings Center Report's fiftieth year of publication-does not set out to change medicine.

The over-hoarding of toilet paper has received a lot of negative public attention. In this work, we used Twitter data to qualitatively analyse tweets related to panic buying of toilet paper during the crisis. Methods: A total of 255,171 tweets were collected. Of these 4081 met our inclusion criteria and 100 tweets were randomly selected to develop a coding scheme in the initial phase. Random samples of tweets in folds of 100 were then qualitatively analysed in the focused coding phase until saturation was met at 500 tweets analysed. Results: Five key themes emerged: (1) humour or sarcasm, (2) marketing or profiteering, (3) opinion and emotions, (4) personal experience, and (5) support or information. About half of the tweets carried negative sentiments, expressing anger or frustration towards the deficiency of toilet paper and the frantic situation of toilet paper hoarding, which were among the most influential tweets. Discussion: Panic buying of toilet paper was seen during the 2020 pandemic period with a mass amount of related content spread across social media. The spontaneous contagion of fear and panic through social media could fuel psychological reactions in midst of crises. The high level of negative social media posts regarding the toilet paper crisis acts as an emotional trigger of public anxiety and panic.

As a respiratory infection, Covid-19 is known to have a dominant airborne transmission modality, wherein fluid flow plays a central role. Quantification of complex non-intuitive dynamics and transport of pathogen laden respiratory particles in indoor flows has been of specific interest. Here we present a Lagrangian computational approach towards quantification of human-to-human exposure quantifiers, and identification of pathways by which flow organizes transmission. We develop a Lagrangian viral exposure index in a parametric form, accounting for key parameters such as building and layout, ventilation, occupancy, biological variables. We also employ a Lagrangian computation of the Finite Time Lyapunov Exponent field to identify hidden patterns of transport. A systematic parametric study comprising a set of 120 simulations, yielding a total of 1,320 different exposure index computations are presented. Results from these simulations enable: (a) understanding the otherwise hidden ways in which air flow organizes the long-range transport of such particles; and (b) translating the micro-particle transport data into a quantifier for understanding infection exposure risks.","output":"A Lagrangian Approach Towards Quantitative Analysis Of Flow-mediated Infection Transmission In Indoor Spaces With Application To SARS-COV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When DNA from a suspect is detected in a sample collected at a crime scene, there can be alternative explanations about the activity that may have led to the transfer, persistence and recovery of his/her DNA.

Objective To evaluate patient satisfaction, patient and physician impression of encounter completeness, and reimbursement between in-person, video, and telephone encounters. This study also assessed factors influencing patient satisfaction, perception of completeness, and choice of future evaluation type. Methods This was a prospective study of all encounters at a healthcare-system owned practice. Encounter type, encounter modality, patient demographics, primary diagnoses, reimbursement data, and physician assessment of encounter completeness were tracked. Patient satisfaction was assessed via standardized questions. Results There were 447 encounters, with 303 (67.8%) in-person, 98 (21.9%) video, and 46 (10.3%) telephone. Patient satisfaction data was obtained from 251 patients. There was similar patient satisfaction among all encounter modalities. Both patients and physicians were more likely to deem an in-person encounter as complete. Physicians were more likely to report an in-person encounter to be complete for food allergy (p<0.001) and chronic rhinitis (p=0.001) as compared to video or telephone, whereas patients reported in-person encounters for food allergy to be complete as compared to other modalities (p=0.002). Patients reported that future encounter types should depend on the clinical situation. Conclusions There was similar patient satisfaction with in-person, video, and telephone encounters in an allergy/immunology practice during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Notably, the process of capturing objective behavioral coping data can be labor- and personnel-intensive. OBJECTIVE: The primary aims of this pilot trial were to assess the feasibility of conducting a trial of VR in a pediatric emergency department and the feasibility of documenting observed coping behaviors during pediatric procedures. Secondarily, this study examined whether VR affects child and caregiver coping and distress during venipuncture in the pediatric emergency department. METHODS: This stratified, randomized, controlled pilot trial compared coping and distress between child lifeCsupported VR engagement and child life specialist support without VR during painful procedures in children aged 7-22 years in the pediatric emergency department. An external control (reference group) received no standardized support. Primary feasibility outcomes included rates of recruitment, rates of withdrawal from VR, and rates of completed Child Adult Medical Procedure Interaction Scale-Short Form (CAMPIS-SF) observations. Secondary clinical outcomes were applied to venipuncture procedures and included CAMPIS-SF coping and distress (range 0-1.0), pain and anxiety on a visual analog scale (range 0-10), and cybersickness symptoms. RESULTS: Overall recruitment was 93% (66/71), VR withdrawal rate was 27% (4/15), and of the completed procedures, 100% (63/63) CAMPIS-SF observations were completed. A total of 55 patients undergoing venipuncture in the pediatric emergency department were included in the analyses of clinical outcomes: 15 patients (15 caregivers) randomized to VR, 20 patients (15 caregivers) randomized to child life specialist support, and 20 patients (17 caregivers) in the reference group. Patient coping differed across groups with higher coping in the VR group and child life specialist group than in the reference group (P=.046). There were no significant differences in the distress and pain ratings for patients and caregivers between the groups. Caregivers rated the lowest perceived anxiety in the child life specialist group (P=.03). There was no apparent change in cybersickness symptoms before and after VR use (P=.37). CONCLUSIONS: Real-time documentation of observed behaviors in patients and caregivers was feasible during medical procedures in which VR was utilized, particularly with the availability of research staff. VR and child life specialists improved coping in children during venipuncture procedures. Given the high participation rate, future studies to evaluate the efficacy of VR are recommended to determine whether an off-the-shelf VR headset can be a low-cost and low-risk tool to improve childrens coping during venipuncture or other related procedures.

METHODS: In this IRB-approved study, 22 technologists were trained in pancreas segmentation on portal venous phase CT through radiologist-led interactive videoconferencing sessions based on an image-rich curriculum. Technologists segmented pancreas in 188 CTs using freehand tools on custom image-viewing software. Subsequent supplementary training included multimedia videos focused on common errors, which were followed by second batch of 159 segmentations. Two radiologists reviewed all cases and corrected inaccurate segmentations. Technologists' segmentations were compared against radiologists' segmentations using Dice-Sorenson coefficient (DSC), Jaccard coefficient (JC), and Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS: Corrections were made in 71 (38%) cases from first batch [26 (37%) oversegmentations and 45 (63%) undersegmentations] and in 77 (48%) cases from second batch [12 (16%) oversegmentations and 65 (84%) undersegmentations].

Currently, increasing amounts of attention have been focused on the epidemiologic profiling of ADHD in children, viewed as a continuously distributed risk dimension throughout the whole lifespan. This study aimed to identify and characterize potential influential factors susceptible to ADHD-related symptoms among preschool-aged children. A comprehensive questionnaire was self-designed for both children and their parents or guardians and was distributed to 30 kindergartens from Beijing and Hebei, collecting potential influential factors in susceptibility to ADHD. ADHD was assessed by the Conner's Abbreviated Symptom Questionnaire (C-ASQ), and 7,938 children were analyzed. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and hierarchical degree of adjustment were used to control possible covariates.

However, 20% HPC led to tabletability loss, attributable to the high mechanical strength of APAP granules. The over-granulated APAP granules had thick connected HPC scaffold and low porosity. Consequently, these granules were so strong that they underwent a lower degree of fracture under compression and higher elastic recovery during decompression.

Hence in this study, we have aimed to identify criteria for monitoring Knowledge Translation (KT) capacity within countries. METHODS: We conducted a web-based Delphi with over 120 public health professionals from 45 countries to reach agreement on criteria to monitor KT at the level of national HIS. Public health professionals participated in three survey rounds, in which they ranked 85 preselected criteria and could suggest additional criteria. RESULTS: Experts working in national (public) health agencies and statistical offices, as well as in health policy and care agreed on 29 criteria which constitute the Health Information (HI)-Impact Index. The criteria cover four essential domains of evaluation: the production of high-quality evidence, broad access and dissemination, stakeholder engagement and knowledge integration across sectors and in civil society. The HI-Impact Index was pretested by officials working in ministries of health and public health agencies in eight countries; they found the tool acceptable and user-friendly. CONCLUSIONS: The HI-Impact Index provides benchmarks to monitor KT so that countries can assess whether high-quality evidence can be easily accessed and used by the relevant stakeholders in health policy and practice, by civil society and across sectors. Next steps include further refining the procedure for conducting the assessment in routine, and sharing experiences from HIS evaluations using the HI-Impact Index.","output":"Developing a tool to monitor knowledge translation in the health system: results from an international Delphi study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tim Knott, The Equine Eye Clinic At the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, model teaching eyes with words and numbers along the path of retinal vessels C the latter converging on an optic disc C have been used to replace standard glass issue in stuffed toy dogs The offset light source of a smartphone camera highlights the myelinated nerve fibre layer adjacent to the equine optic nerve head, which aids in the assessment of retinal health While these headsets are likely to be cost-prohibitive for non-specialist use, hand-held condensing lens and a focal light source held at the temple provide a cheap and satisfactory alternative 3 The use of smartphones in combination with a handheld condensing lens to further increase the field of view has also been described in the literature 6 Indeed, the use of the smartphone for fundoscopy, and ophthalmic photography more generally, has become increasingly widespread in recent years Tim Knott, The Equine Eye Clinic In an article summarised on p 532 of this issue of Vet Record, Shipman and colleagues describe the use of the smartphone to assist in teaching examination of the equine fundus to veterinary students at the University of Nottingham 8 The greater understanding of fundoscopic anatomy provided by the larger field of view of the smartphone proved useful when direct ophthalmoscopy was subsequently performed","output":"Improving the teaching of fundoscopy in veterinary medicine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research addresses the intersection of two key domains of adolescents' lives: religion and peer networks.

These symptoms and behaviors strongly correlate with functional and cognitive impairment and contribute to ~30% of overall dementia costs. As decisions regarding care and strategies for BPSD are generally based on professional frames of reference, this study investigates whether the perspectives of PLWD and families/care partner on BPSD terminology can inform a more nuanced conceptualization of BPSD. Methods: PLWD and families/care partners participated in one-on-one semi-structured interviews. A thematic iterative approach was used to code the data and identify common themes until theoretical saturation was reached. Themes were compared between groups. Data were analyzed deductively in relation to pre-existing terminology regarding BPSD, and inductively to discover new ideas on use of such terminology as perceived by PLWD and others. Results: Forty-one volunteers were interviewed: 21 PLWD, mean age 71 yrs, mean Mini-Mental State Examination score 25, and 20 family members/care partners. Three main themes emerged from the data: (1) descriptions of BPSD from people with lived experience compared to clinical terms, (2) viewpoints on interpreting causes, and (3) experiences of concurrent BPSD. The experiences described and terms used by PLWD and families/care partners differed from terms used in existing professional frameworks (e.g., disinhibition described as loss of filter') and there were differences between PLWD and family members' interpretations of BPSD causes. Discussion/Conclusion: Reports from PLWD and families/carers describing their experiences of BPSD suggest a reconceptualization of BPSD terminology is needed to understand and de-stigmatize these symptoms and behaviors. For example, the term agitated/hard to handle would benefit by clearer, contextualized description, such as frustrated with cognitive decline, discriminatory behavior and inadequate support systems. In better understanding individual expressions of BPSD, families, professionals and societies will be able to respond in ways that are helpful for PLWD. An informed, integrated understanding of BPSD and improved terminology use will have the potential to improve the quality of care and support for PLWD.","output":"Reconceptualising Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia: Views of People Living With Dementia and Families/Care Partners"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Experimental simulation of cerebrovascular system would be very beneficial tool to evaluate millions of human body cascade sequence.

We investigated whether such changes depended on the amount and quality of a person's social activity. We also evaluated the popular idea that effects of pandemic-related restrictions would depend on introversion; to this end, we used self-described introversion as a proxy for preferred frequency of social activity. Methods Between September 2020 and March 2021, we obtained online-survey data from 2,615 respondents who retrospectively reported alcohol, opioid, or psychostimulant use. We analyzed (1) changes in drug use and entrapment (a psychological construct linked to suicidality) as a function of introversion and the frequency and quality of social activity, and (2) changes in drug use as a function of change in entrapment. Results Most felt more entrapped during the pandemic, but only a minority increased drug use. Generally: (1) entrapment and drug use increased in respondents unsatisfied with their social activity, (2) introversion and frequency of activity had less influence than satisfaction, (3) introverts reported more symptoms of entrapment, anxiety, depression, and loneliness than non-introverts, (4) when social activity was frequent and unsatisfying, psychostimulant use increased in introverts and opioid use increased in extraverts, (5) alcohol use increased in those who felt increased entrapment, and (6) alcohol and opioid use decreased in those who felt decreased entrapment.

This increase in turn, has been related, in part, to concurrent increases in carbon dioxide (CO2) and temperature on pollen production and allergic disease generated from plant-based sources of pollen. Such links to anthropogenic climate change has suggested three significant and interrelated consequences associated with respiratory allergies or disease. First, warmer temperatures and a longer frost-free growing season can influence pollen season length and temporal exposure to airborne aeroallergens. Second, both warmer temperatures and additional CO2 can increase the amount of pollen, the seasonal intensity, from spring through fall. Thirdly, there is evidence from oak and ragweed that rising levels of CO2 could increase the allergen concentration of the pollen and symptom severity. However, while these outcomes are of obvious consequence, they do not fully encompass all of the plant derived changes that could, directly or indirectly, influence aeroallergen production, exposure, and consequences for public health. In this overview, I will delve deeper into other plant-based links to climate/CO2 that are consequential either directly or indirectly to allergic rhinitis and associated disease.

AIM: The aim is to evaluate the impact of an early assisted rehabilitation program on the functional status of an acutely hospitalized population affected by COVID-19. DESIGN: Single-institution retrospective longitudinal study. SETTING: Inpatient Intensive Care Units (ICU) and Medical Care Units (MCU). POPULATION: Acute COVID-19 Patients. METHODS: General information was collected; age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index was used for comorbidities. Duration of hospital stay, the length of stay in ICU and/or MCU, the length of the rehabilitative treatment, and the destination at the discharge were collected. Evaluation was performed when patients were clinically stable (T0), and at hospital discharge (T1); for subjects enrolled in ICU functional status was assessed at the time of transfer to the MCU. Muscle strength of the four limbs was measured with the Medical Research Council (MRC) sum-score. Functional status was assessed using the 3-item Barthel index (BI-3) and the General physical mobility score (GPMS). Early assisted-tailored rehabilitation protocol was applied in ICU and in MCU: the aims were the maintenance (or recovery) of the range of motion and of the strength and the recovery of sitting/standing position and gait. RESULTS: we evaluated 116 patients (mean age 65, SD 11) (65% male) , 68 in ICU (mean age 60,SD 10), 48 in MCU (mean age 73,SD 9). At discharge, BI-3 and GPMS significantly improved in both ICU (p<0,001) and MCU (p<0,001) subgroups of patients. MRC sum-score significantly improved in ICU patients (p<0.001). Patients hospitalized in ICU had a significantly longer hospital stay. At discharge, patients admitted to the ICU reach a functional state that is close to that of patients admitted to the MCU. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that an early assisted rehabilitation program may be helpful in improving the short-term functional status of an acutely hospitalized population affected by COVID-19, with discharge at home of 48%.

The innate immune system forms the first line of defense against pathogenic organisms like these and is responsible for detecting pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Viral RNA is a potent inducer of antiviral innate immune signaling, provoking an antiviral state by directing expression of interferons (IFNs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, +RNA viruses developed various methods to avoid detection and downstream signaling, including isolation of viral RNA replication in membranous viral replication organelles (ROs). These structures therefore play a central role in infection, and consequently, loss of RO integrity might simultaneously result in impaired viral replication and enhanced antiviral signaling. This review summarizes the first indications that the innate immune system indeed has tools to disrupt viral ROs and other non- or aberrant-self membrane structures, and may do this by marking these membranes with proteins such as microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3) and ubiquitin, resulting in the recruitment of IFN-inducible GTPases.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a computerized Relational Agent programmed to provide alcohol screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment. We hypothesized that participants in the experimental condition would report greater reductions in their drinking and higher rates of brief intervention and referrals to specialty care compared to those in treatment as usual (TAU). DESIGN: This was a Hybrid I implementation design and stratified RCT. Participants were randomized to TAU or Relational Agent + TAU and assessed at baseline and 3-month follow-up. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 178 veteran participants were recruited by referral from primary care staff after a positive alcohol screen, or via letter sent do patients screening positive during recent visit. INTERVENTION(S): TAU involved yearly reminders to screen alcohol use and provide brief intervention and treatment referrals, as needed. The Relational Agent added an automated brief intervention, a 1-month follow-up Relational Agent visit, and referral to treatment if needed. MAIN MEASURES: We measured average drinks per day, drinking days per week, number of brief interventions, and number of referrals over 3 months. KEY RESULTS: Participants decreased their drinking in both study conditions, with no significant between-group differences on primary alcohol measures.

Twelve healthy control and eighteen diarrheic calves were fed lactose or D-xylose on consecutive days at 1.15 g/kg body weight and a concentration of 46 g/L. Breath and blood samples were collected at 1 h intervals from 0 to 7 h. After administration of lactose, there was a significant increase in breath hydrogen excretion in diarrheic versus control calves. The increase in plasma glucose concentrations was delayed in diarrheic calves but the area under the absorption curve was similar in control and diarrheic calves. After administration of D-xylose, breath hydrogen excretion did not increase significantly but plasma D-xylose concentrations were significantly reduced in diarrheic calves. The pathogens commonly isolated from the feces were Cryptosporidium species, rotavirus and coronavirus. The number of pathogens and the severity of the calves' acid-base deficit were not related to the severity of carbohydrate malabsorption. Decreased absorption of lactose and D-xylose may be the result of intestinal villous atrophy caused by viral or parasite infection. It was concluded that carbohydrate malabsorption rather than a specific lactose maldigestion is a significant problem in diarrheic calves.

Rex1 promoter-Red Fluorescence Protein reporter ESC were tested by RNAseq after 72hr exposures to control stress hyperosmotic sorbitol under stemness culture (NS) to quantify stress-forced differentiation (SFD) transcriptomic programs. Control ESC cultured with stemness factor removal produced normal differentiation (ND). Bulk RNAseq transcriptomic analysis showed significant upregulation of two genes involved in Covid-19 cell uptake, Vimentin (VIM) and Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2). SFD increased the hepatitis A virus receptor (Havcr1) and the transplacental Herpes simplex 1 (HSV1) virus receptor (Pvrl1) compared with ESC undergoing ND. Several other coronavirus receptors, Glutamyl Aminopeptidase (ENPEP) and Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 (DPP4) were upregulated significantly in SFD>ND. Although stressed ESC are more susceptible to infection due to increased expression of viral receptors and decreased resistance, the necessary Covid-19 receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)2, was not expressed in our experiments. TMPRSS2, ENPEP, and DPP4 mediate Coronavirus uptake, but are also markers of extra-embryonic endoderm (XEN), which arise from ESC undergoing ND or SFD. Mouse and human ESCs differentiated to XEN increase TMPRSS2 and other Covid-19 uptake-mediating gene expression, but only some lines express ACE2. Covid-19 susceptibility appears to be genotype-specific and not ubiquitous. Of the 30 gene ontology (GO) groups for viral susceptibility, 15 underwent significant stress-forced changes. Of these, 4 GO groups mediated negative viral regulation and most genes in these increase in ND and decrease with SFD, thus suggesting that stress increases ESC viral susceptibility. Taken together, the data suggest that a control hyperosmotic stress can increase Covid-19 susceptibility and decrease viral host resistance in mouse ESC. However, this limited pilot study should be followed with studies in human ESC, tests of environmental, hormonal, and pharmaceutical stressors and direct tests for infection of stressed, cultured ESC and embryos by Covid-19.

Orthopaedic departments have adopted business continuity models and guidelines for essential and non-essential surgeries to preserve hospital resources as well as protect patients and staff. These guidelines broadly encompass reduction of ambulatory care with a move towards telemedicine, redeployment of orthopaedic surgeons/residents to the frontline battle against COVID-19, continuation of education and research through web-based means, and cancellation of non-essential elective procedures. However, if containment of COVID-19 community spread is achieved, resumption of elective orthopaedic procedures and transition plans to return to normalcy must be considered for orthopaedic departments. The COVID-19 pandemic also presents a moral dilemma to the orthopaedic surgeon considering elective procedures. What is the best treatment for our patients and how does the fear of COVID-19 influence the risk-benefit discussion during a pandemic? Surgeons must deliberate the fine balance between elective surgery for a patients wellbeing versus risks to the operating team and utilization of precious hospital resources. Attrition of healthcare workers or Orthopaedic surgeons from restarting elective procedures prematurely or in an unsafe manner may render us ill-equipped to handle the second wave of infections. This highlights the need to develop effective screening protocols or preoperative COVID-19 testing before elective procedures in high-risk, elderly individuals with comorbidities. Alternatively, high-risk individuals should be postponed until the risk of nosocomial COVID-19 infection is minimal. In addition, given the higher mortality and perioperative morbidity of patients with COVID-19 undergoing surgery, the decision to operate must be carefully deliberated.

This study aimed to investigate whether training on a laparoscopic simulator enables trainees to perform a thoracoscopic lobectomy. METHODS Twenty-eight surgical residents were randomized to either virtual-reality training on a nephrectomy module or traditional black-box simulator training.

To be used for clinical pulse oximetry the embedded PPG system must be paired with an application (app) and meet US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) requirements. RESEARCH QUESTION: Does this smartphone sensor with app meet FDA/ISO requirements? Are measurements obtained using this system comparable to those of hospital reference devices, across a wide range of people? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed laboratory testing addressing ISO and FDA requirements in 10 participants using the smartphone sensor with app. Subsequently, we performed an open-label clinical study on 320 participants with widely varying characteristics, to compare the accuracy and precision of readings obtained by patients with those of hospital reference devices, using rigorous statistical methodology. RESULTS: \\"Breathe down\\" testing in the laboratory showed that the total root-mean-square deviation of oxygen saturation (Spo2) measurement was 2.02%, meeting FDA/ISO standards. Clinical comparison of the smartphone sensor with app vs hospital reference devices determined that Spo2 and heart rate accuracy were 0.48% points (95% CI, 0.38-0.58; P < .001) and 0.73 bpm (95% CI, 0.33-1.14; P < .001), respectively; Spo2 and heart rate precision were 1.25 vs reference 0.95 points (P < .001) and 5.99 vs reference 3.80 bpm (P < .001), respectively.

Since the emotional distress and the social restrictions caused by this epidemic, it must be expected that its impact will also extend to sexual health. The purpose of this study, the first including a large sample of the Spanish general population, was to analyze sexual behavior during the 99 days of confinement in Spain (INSIDE Project). Method: 1,448 Spanish people, between 18 and 60 years old, were evaluated through an online survey during April 2020. The variables analyzed were the physical and social environment during confinement, sexual desire, type of sexual activity, masturbation, sexual intercourse, online sexual activity, general sexual frequency, sexual fantasies, degree of self-control over sexual drive, sexual abuse, general impact of confinement on sexuality and emotional mood. Results: . Confinement has affected the sexual life of half of the Spanish population (47.7%), especially women. Those who reported a worsening of their sexual life are almost three times more (37.9%) than those who reported an improvement (14.4%). Conclusions: . Different factors have been significant predictors of the positive or negative valoration about the impact of this confinement on sexual life, such as gender, couple life, privacy, stress level and the perception of confinement as unbearable. Policy Implications . These results have important implications for the public health and more especially sexual health of the Spanish population.","output":"INSIDE Project on Sexual Health in Spain: The Impact of the Lockdown Caused by COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Introduction The risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 in a hospital setting and the need of reorganizing the Emergency Departments (EDs) to cope with infected patients have led to a reduction of ED attendances for non-infectious acute conditions and to a different management of chronic disorders. Methods We performed a retrospective study evaluating the frequency and features of ED attendances for seizures during the lockdown period (March 10th - April 30th 2020) in the University Hospital of Trieste, Italy. We studied the possible pandemic impact on the way patients with seizures sought for medical assistance by comparing the lockdown period to a matched period in 2019 and to a period of identical length preceding the lockdown (January 18th C March 9th 2020). Results A striking decrease in total ED attendances was observed during lockdown (4664) compared to the matched control (10424) and to the pre-lockdown (9522) periods. A similar reduction, although to a lesser extent, was detected for seizure attendances to the ED: there were 37 during lockdown and 63 and 44 respectively during the two other periods. Intriguingly, during the lockdown a higher number of patients attended the ED with first seizures (p=0.013), and more EEGs (p=0.008) and CT brain scans (p=0.018) were performed; there was a trend towards more frequent transport to the ED by ambulance (p=0.061) in the lockdown period.

Relevant studies have shown that ambient temperature may influence the spread of novel coronavirus. However, the effect of ambient temperature on COVID-19 remains controversial. Human mobility is also closely related to the pandemic of COVID-19, which could be affected by temperature at the same time. The purpose of this study is to explore the underlying mechanism of the association of temperature with COVID-19 transmission rate by linking human mobility. The effective reproductive number, meteorological conditions and human mobility data in 47 countries are collected. Panel data models with fixed effects are used to analyze the association of ambient temperature with COVID-19 transmission rate, and the mediation by human mobility. Our results show that there is a negative relationship between temperature and COVID-19 transmission rate. We also observe that temperature is positively associated with human mobility and human mobility is positively related to COVID-19 transmission rate. Thus, the suppression effect (also known as the inconsistent mediation effect) of human mobility is confirmed, which remains robust when different lag structures are used. These findings provide evidence that temperature can influence the spread of COVID-19 by affecting human mobility. Therefore, although temperature is negatively related to COVID-19 transmission rate, governments and the public should pay more attention to control measures since people are more likely to go out when temperature rising. Our results could partially explain the reason why COVID-19 is not prevented by warm weather in some countries.","output":"Mediation by human mobility of the association between temperature and COVID-19 transmission rate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Osimertinib is an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of PC pts who tested positive for Covid-19 between 3/16/2020 and 5/21/2020 at the Cleveland Clinic. Additional information including prostate specific antigen (PSA), Gleason score, disease extent, and current treatment were also obtained. Severe Covid-19 infection was defined as any pt requiring hospitalization, ICU care, and/or death. PSA values from prior to Covid-19 infection or first available after Covid-19 infected were collected. Analysis was carried out with Fisher's exact test and Wilcoxon rank sum test, as applicable, and overall survival (OS) by log rank test. Results: A total of 54 pts with prostate cancer that tested positive for Covid-19 were identified, of which 4 were receiving active treatment (2 with metastatic disease and 2 with localized disease). Of the 2 pts with metastatic disease, 1 was on docetaxel with ADT and other on abiraterone/prednisone with ADT. Of the 2 pts with localized disease, 1 was on ADT and bicalutamide and other on ADT alone. A total of 40 patients had severe Covid-19 disease.

However, how these risk variants affect deeper phenotypes such as disease progression and immune response remains elusive. Also, our understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms from disease risk variants to various phenotypes is still limited. To address these problems, we performed an integrative multi-omics analysis of genotype, transcriptomics, and epigenomics for revealing gene regulatory mechanisms from disease variants to AD phenotypes. Method First, given the population gene expression data of a cohort, we construct and cluster its gene co-expression network to identify gene co-expression modules for various AD phenotypes. Next, we predict transcription factors (TFs) regulating co-expressed genes and AD risk SNPs that interrupt TF binding sites on regulatory elements. Finally, we construct a gene regulatory network (GRN) linking SNPs, interrupted TFs, and regulatory elements to target genes and gene modules for each phenotype in the cohort. This network thus provides systematic insights into gene regulatory mechanisms from risk variants to AD phenotypes. Results Our analysis predicted GRNs in three major AD-relevant regions: Hippocampus, Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC), Lateral Temporal Lobe (LTL). Comparative analyses revealed cross-region-conserved and region-specific GRNs, in which many immunological genes are present. For instance, SNPs rs13404184 and rs61068452 disrupt SPI1 binding and regulation of AD gene INPP5D in the Hippocampus and LTL. However, SNP rs117863556 interrupts bindings of REST to regulate GAB2 in DLPFC only. Driven by emerging neuroinflammation in AD, we used Covid-19 as a proxy to identify possible regulatory mechanisms for neuroimmunology in AD. To this end, we looked at the GRN subnetworks relating to genes from shared AD-Covid pathways. From those subnetworks, our machine learning analysis prioritized the AD-Covid genes for predicting Covid-19 severity. Decision Curve Analysis also validated our AD-Covid genes outperform known Covid-19 genes for classifying severe Covid-19 patients. This suggests AD-Covid genes along with linked SNPs can be potential novel biomarkers for neuroimmunology in AD. Finally, our results are open-source available as a comprehensive functional genomic map for AD, providing a deeper mechanistic understanding of the interplay among multi-omics, brain regions, gene functions like neuroimmunology, and phenotypes.","output":"Predicting gene regulatory networks from multi-omics to link genetic risk variants and neuroimmunology to Alzheimers disease phenotypes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Goal: The aim of this study is to conduct a systematic literature review to identify opportunities to minimize Covid-19 impacts on businesses.

By releasing these small molecular weight peptides, the source cells can influence numerous intracellular processes in the target cells, including the secretion of other cytokines downstream. However, there are no readily available bioinformatic resources that can model cytokine - cytokine interactions. In this effort, we built a communication map between major tissues and blood cells that reveals how cytokine-mediated intercellular networks form during homeostatic conditions. We collated the most prevalent cytokines from literature, and assigned the proteins and their corresponding receptors to source tissue and blood cell types based on enriched consensus RNA-Seq data from the Human Protein Atlas database. To assign more confidence to the interactions, we integrated literature information on cell - cytokine interactions from two systems immunology databases, immuneXpresso and ImmunoGlobe. From the collated information, we defined two metanetworks: a cell-cell communication network connected by cytokines; and a cytokine-cytokine interaction network depicting the potential ways in which cytokines can affect the activity of each other. Using expression data from disease states, we then applied this resource to reveal perturbations in cytokine-mediated intercellular signalling in inflammatory and infectious diseases (ulcerative colitis and COVID-19, respectively).

The loss of March Madness is treated as a moment of creative tension, when disruptions can facilitate reflection and lead to positive change. We discuss the economic, socio-cultural, and environmental effects of shuttering the tournament and suggest that an understanding of the impacts of COVID-19 offers an opportunity to bring about an alternative, more sustainable sports tourism economy. The cancellation of March Madness resulted in the loss of millions of dollars in tourism revenue for local economies and deprived traveler-fans of pilgrimages to arenas, important socio-cultural gathering spaces for American basketball fans. However, it also prevented the emission of a sizable quantity of greenhouse gasses based on our carbon footprint calculated from the previous years tournament. Ultimately, from the disruptive closing down of sport and event tourism, a post-pandemic sports tourism landscape should emerge that takes more seriously the triple-bottom line notion of balancing a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions with the creation and maintenance of resilient local economies all while both acknowledging the important role sport plays in society and keeping tourism actors healthy.","output":"Cancelling March Madness exposes opportunities for a more sustainable sports tourism economy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are an underappreciated cause of critical illness in adults.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a total of 637 cases were reported in fifteen countries, including 378 deaths, corresponding to a case fatality rate of nearly 60% [19]. Avian influenza continues to be one of the deadliest diseases that jumps from animals to humans. Epidemiologists believe that it is likely to cause the next major global pandemic that could kill millions of people. The 2002 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) demonstrated that international air travel can significantly influence the global spread of an infectious disease. This paper studies the effects of air travel on the spread of avian influenza from Asian and Australian cities to the United States. A two-city mathematical model involving a pandemic strain is used to derive the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ), which determines if the disease will spread and persist ( R 0 > 1 ) or go extinct ( R 0 < 1 ). Real air travel data is used to model the disease spread by individuals who are susceptible to or are infected with pandemic avian influenza. Analysis of the two-city model helps understand the dynamics of the spread of pandemic influenza when the cities are connected by air travel. Understanding these effects can help public health officials and policy-makers select the appropriate disease control measures. Also, it can provide guidance to decision-makers on where to implement control measures while conserving precious resources.","output":"Effect of air travel on the spread of an avian influenza pandemic to the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To identify diagnoses which were missing amongst paediatric inpatients during the UKs first national lockdown, compared with the same period over the past five years. Study design : A retrospective observational cohort study of all children (0-15 years) attending for urgent care across Oxfordshire, during the first UK lockdown in 2020, compared to matched dates in 2015-2019. This covers two paediatric hospitals providing secondary care, one with tertiary services. Main outcomes: Changes in numbers of patients attending and inpatient diagnoses (using ICD-10 classification) during the first 2020 lockdown, compared with the previous five years. Results: Total ED attendances (n=4030) and hospital admissions (n=1416) during the first UK lockdown were reduced by 56.8% and 59.4%, respectively, compared to attendances/admissions in 2015-2019 (5-year mean n=7446.8 and n=2491.6, respectively). Proportions of patients admitted from ED and length of stay were similar in lockdown to 2015-2019. Significantly greater numbers of neoplasms were diagnosed during lockdown than the same period in 2015-2019 (p= 0.0123). 80% of diagnoses missing during lockdown were categorised as infectious diseases or their sequelae, whilst 20% were non-specific pains/aches/malaise and accidental injury/poisonings. Conclusions: Using standardised ICD-10 codes as a measure of diagnostic activity between years;missing diagnoses can be identified. Our findings may suggest parents are supervising infectious illness at home or had anxieties about hospital attendance, with self-limited low-morbidity disease. Prospective studies should establish if parents/carers are adequately supported in caring for their children at home, and that access and referral pathways are appropriate where children have concerning clinical features.","output":"Using ICD-10 Diagnostic Codes to Identify Missing Paediatric Patients During Nationwide COVID-19 Lockdown in Oxfordshire, UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The current pandemic coronavirus (COVID-19) is a novel disease with no standardized course of treatment and cure. This novelty, origin, and dispersion of COVID-19 have been reported to cause chaos, anxiety, and fear among the general population. AIM: The present study aimed to explore the correlation between different age groups, in relation to their general coping strategies, fear, and anxiety due to COVID-19. METHODOLOGY: The research study employed a total sample of 135 participants. The sample was divided into four age groups: 12C18, 19C25, 26C55, and 56C85. Participants were selected through convenience sampling. General coping strategies employed by these participants were assessed using a brief COPE scale, the COVID-19 fear scale was used to assess fear, and coronavirus anxiety scale was used to screen anxiety. RESULTS: Our results indicated that age has a negative correlation with adaptive coping and positive correlation with problem-focused coping, emotion-focused coping, and fear of COVID-19. The most used coping strategy among the age groups 12C18 and 19C25 age group was adaptive coping; for the 26C55 age group, it was problem-focused coping; and for the age group 56C85, emotion-focused coping was used the most.

This study aims to explore the potential use of lung lesion features in the management of COVID-19, based on the assumption that lesion features may carry important diagnostic and prognostic information for quantifying infection severity and forecasting disease progression. A novel LesionEncoder framework is proposed to detect lesions in chest CT scans and to encode lesion features for automatic severity assessment and progression prediction. The LesionEncoder framework consists of a U-Net module for detecting lesions and extracting features from individual CT slices, and a recurrent neural network (RNN) module for learning the relationship between feature vectors and collectively classifying the sequence of feature vectors. Chest CT scans of two cohorts of COVID-19 patients from two hospitals in China were used for training and testing the proposed framework. When applied to assessing severity, this framework outperformed baseline methods achieving a sensitivity of 0.818, specificity of 0.952, accuracy of 0.940, and AUC of 0.903. It also outperformed the other tested methods in disease progression prediction with a sensitivity of 0.667, specificity of 0.838, accuracy of 0.829, and AUC of 0.736. The LesionEncoder framework demonstrates a strong potential for clinical application in current COVID-19 management, particularly in automatic severity assessment of COVID-19 patients.

Here, we used electron microscopy to show that actin filaments convert directly into globular material. A monomer trap assay also shows that the combination of all three factors produces actin monomers faster than any two factors alone. We show that coronin accelerates the release of inorganic phosphate from actin filaments and promotes highly cooperative cofilin binding to actin to create long stretches of polymer with a hypertwisted morphology. Aip1 attacks these hypertwisted regions along their sides, disintegrating them into monomers or short oligomers.

Social media platforms enable individuals to share their day-to-day concerns with others and thereby can function as unobtrusive, large-scale, and naturalistic data sources to study the longitudinal behavior of individuals taking antidepressants. OBJECTIVE: We aim to understand the side effects of antidepressants from naturalistic expressions of individuals on social media. METHODS: On a large-scale Twitter data set of individuals who self-reported using antidepressants, a quasi-experimental study using unsupervised language analysis was conducted to extract keywords that distinguish individuals who improved and who did not improve following the use of antidepressants. The net data set consists of over 8 million Twitter posts made by over 300,000 users in a 4-year period between January 1, 2014, and February 15, 2018. RESULTS: Five major side effects of antidepressants were studied: sleep, weight, eating, pain, and sexual issues. Social media language revealed keywords related to these side effects. In particular, antidepressants were found to show a spectrum of effects from decrease to increase in each of these side effects. CONCLUSIONS: This work enhances the understanding of the side effects of antidepressants by identifying distinct linguistic markers in the longitudinal social media data of individuals showing the most and least improvement following the self-reported intake of antidepressants. One implication of this work concerns the potential of social media data as an effective means to support digital pharmacovigilance and digital therapeutics. These results can inform clinicians in tailoring their discussion and assessment of side effects and inform patients about what to potentially expect and what may or may not be within the realm of normal aftereffects of antidepressants.","output":"Understanding Side Effects of Antidepressants: Large-scale Longitudinal Study on Social Media Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus and the influenza virus have similarities and differences.

Temperance refers to the capacity to manage habits and protect against excess and is composed of forgiveness, humility, and (we include) patience. Specifically, we examine the current state-of-the-science in the conceptualization of temperance, explore the efficacy of temperance interventions, and reflect upon what the future may hold in this research domain. In this paper, we first highlight the challenges and opportunities for expanding the theoretical conceptualization of temperance and reflect upon the challenges in temperance-related PPIs. For each aspect of temperance, we propose a specific research agenda. Second, we explore what is needed for PPIs to promote temperance and how growth in temperance intervention research can be fostered. Generally, while forgiveness interventions are well established, we recommended that both humility and patience interventions need more viable evidence-based research on existing and new interventions. Third, we advanced several recommendations regarding how to promote more research in new interventions. These recommendations included attracting more funders to the area, developing new interventions, and employing new technology.

Utilization data were used to estimate cumulative effective doses of radiation from imaging procedures and to calculate population-based rates of exposure, with annual effective doses defined as low (< or = 3 mSv), moderate (> 3 to 20 mSv), high (> 20 to 50 mSv), or very high (> 50 mSv). RESULTS During the study period, 655,613 enrollees (68.8%) underwent at least one imaging procedure associated with radiation exposure. The mean (+/-SD) cumulative effective dose from imaging procedures was 2.4+/-6.0 mSv per enrollee per year; however, a wide distribution was noted, with a median effective dose of 0.1 mSv per enrollee per year (interquartile range, 0.0 to 1.7). Overall, moderate effective doses of radiation were incurred in 193.8 enrollees per 1000 per year, whereas high and very high doses were incurred in 18.6 and 1.9 enrollees per 1000 per year, respectively. In general, cumulative effective doses of radiation from imaging procedures increased with advancing age and were higher in women than in men. Computed tomographic and nuclear imaging accounted for 75.4% of the cumulative effective dose, with 81.8% of the total administered in outpatient settings.

The aim of the study is to assess the students knowledge as an initial stage to the implementation of further preventive strategies against the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus infections and to the evaluation of the effectiveness of the implemented preventive measures by continuous monitoring of the number of implemented administrative procedures. METHODS: The study involved 482 students of medical faculties. Participants completed a questionnaire based on knowledge about the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Additionally, a number of preventive measures were introduced, including vaccination against COVID-19. During the entire period of the study, the number of administrative procedures (isolation and quarantine) were monitored. RESULTS: The results of the knowledge test about COVID-19 were generally low and amounted to 11.0 (SD = 2.2). Significant differences in knowledge about COVID-19 between students of particular medical faculties were found. The most appropriate answers to questions about the incubation time of the SARS-CoV-2 virus were given by students of medicine (55%), followed by nursing (42.14%) and pharmacy (26%) students.

Aspirin affects platelet function through irreversibly inhibiting the activity of cyclooxygenase, and it reduces the risk of thrombosis. The current systematic review was aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of aspirin in preventing prothrombotic states in COVID-19 hospitalized patients. METHODS: The systematic search was done in PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, and Medrxiv up to September 27, 2021. The following keywords were used: \\"COVID-19\\", \\"SARS-CoV-2\\", \\"2019 Novel Coronavirus\\", \\"Aspirin\\", and \\"Acetylsalicylic Acid\\". RESULTS: Twelve studies were included. In COVID-19 patients, aspirin can reduce CRP, IL-6 levels, and platelet aggregation by inhibiting thromboxane A2. It can also improve antiviral immunity by hindering the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and lipoxin. Eight out of twelve articles indicated that aspirin provided a beneficial effect in COVID-19. Most studies consider lowered mechanical ventilation needs, ICU admission, illness severity, overt thrombosis, and clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients receiving aspirin.

Methods: High-risk contacts recorded by Phuket Provincial Public Health Office were analysed using the Probit model to investigate the risk factors for transmission from confirmed COVID-19 cases to their high-risk contacts. The analysis was further focused on the impact of quarantine measures in state provided facilities on contacts' probability of infection. Findings: 15.6% of 1108 high-risk contacts were found to be infected, and they accounted for 80% of 214 confirmed cases in Phuket till 29th April 2020. Moreover, 10.68% of all high-risk contacts were confirmed to be infected before the quarantine, and 4.55% after the policy was enforced. In addition, a contact who lived within the same household with a confirmed case was 25% more exposed to infection when compared to a contact who did not share a household. Interpretation: Results confirmed that the quarantine policy, which mandated individual isolation in the state provided facilities for all high-risk contacts, diminished contact's chance of infection from the confirmed cases, especially in the epicenter districts. Our findings confirmed that sharing accommodation with an infected case, and exposure to a case with several documented secondary transmission, generally increased the SARS-CoV-2 infection probability. Finally, some confirmed cases do exhibit a higher risk of spreading SARS-CoV-2 to their contacts compared to a typical confirmed case.

As it is generally the case with other versions of Traditional Medicine, rather than a coherent research program Traditional Chinese Medicine constitutes an array of various techniques and practices coupled with a diversity of very different speculative doctrines regarding the physiological structure of certain body parts as well as the purported etiology of disease and malfunction. This chapter starts off by describing some of the theoretical assumptions on which TCM relies with the aim of casting light on whether they, alongside the clinical techniques TCM encompasses, can significantly be considered as a scientific theory comparable with that of conventional medicine. In so doing the chapter examines a plurality of demarcation criteria between science and non-science coming from various existing philosophical frameworks old and new. While, as will be shown, a wealth of research based on RCTs (randomized control trials) points out that TCMs degree of effectiveness is low, that is not the point this paper intends to make. Instead of such an empirical criticism, the author sustains a comparably stronger epistemic contention, namely: even if the clinical results of TCM fared better than they actually do, that observation alone would not be a good reason to consider this branch of traditional medicine as a scientifically respectable endeavor.","output":"The Universality of Science and Traditional Chinese Medicine: A Philosophical Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus pneumonia COVID-19 is caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which is highly contagious, has a long incubation period, and can be detected in patients' tears and conjunctival secretions In this study, we describe our experience regarding the necessary protective measures that need to be taken during ophthalmic examination and treatment The authors reviewed the clinical work arrangements during the epidemic situation at the Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University in China and analyzed the prevention and control measures that were applied during the laser corneal refractive surgery process The comprehensive protection protocol, which was established throughout the entire process, included both horizontal (medical staff-patient, medical staff-medical staff, and patient-patient) and vertical (preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative transmission assessment) approach and was mainly focused on strengthening the protection against potential aerosol transmission that may occur during intraocular pressure measurements and laser ablation The described and proposed protocol, along with the further guidelines followed by the medical personnel, proved to be efficacious and contributed significantly to the control of the COVID-19 outbreak and the protection of both the patients and the medical staff [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Journal of Ophthalmology is the property of Hindawi Limited and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"A Comprehensive Strategy for Laser Corneal Refractive Surgery during the COVID-19 Epidemic in a Tertiary Teaching Hospital in Wenzhou, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper draws upon the concept of recreancy to examine the mental well-being of university students during the Covid-19 pandemic. Briefly, recreancy is loss of societal trust that results when institutional actors can no longer be counted on to perform their responsibilities. Our study of mental well-being and recreancy focuses on the role of universities and government regulators within the education sector. We surveyed 600 UK students attending 161 different public higher education providers in October 2020 during a time when many UK students were isolated in their residences and engaged in online learning. We assessed student well-being using the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (scored 7-35) and found the mean score to be 19.9 [95% confidence interval (CI) 19.6, 20.2]. This level of well-being indicates that a significant proportion of UK students face low levels of mental well-being. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis indicates that high recreancy-measured as a low trust in universities and the government-is associated with low levels of mental well-being across the student sample. While these findings are suggestive, they are also important and we suggest that government and university leaders should not only work to increase food and housing security during the Covid-19 pandemic, but also consider how to combat various sector trends that might intensify recreancy.","output":"Mental Well-Being in UK Higher Education During Covid-19: Do Students Trust Universities and the Government?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The unprecedented modern pandemic that Is COVID-19 has awakened a global fear of viral disease and an activation of viral targeted drug discovery not seen before In modern times.

A comprehensive view of vaccine shortages and stockouts in the EU/EEA is missing in the published literature. This study was conducted in the framework of the European Joint Action on Vaccination (EU-JAV). Twenty-eight countries, including 20 EU-JAV consortium member states and an additional 8 EU/EEA countries, were invited to participate in a survey aimed at collecting information on vaccine shortages and stock-outs experienced from 2016 to 2019, their main causes, actions taken, and other aspects of vaccine supply. Twenty-one countries completed the survey (response rate 75%), of which 19 reported at least one shortage/stock-out event. Overall, 115 events were reported, 28 of which led to a change in the national immunisation programme. The most frequently involved vaccines were DT- and dT-containing combination vaccines, hepatitis B, hepatitis A, and BCG vaccines. The median duration of shortages/stock-outs was five months (range <1 month-39 months). Interruption in supply and global shortage were the most frequently indicated causes. Only about half of countries reported having an immunization supply chain improvement plan. Similarly, only about half of countries had recommendations or procedures in place to address shortages/stockouts. The survey also identified the occurrence of shortages/stockouts of other biological products (e.g. diphtheria antitoxin in 12 countries). Public health strategies to assure a stable and adequate vaccine supply for immunization programmes require coordinated actions from all stakeholders, harmonized definitions, strengthening of reporting and monitoring systems, the presence of an immunization supply chain improvement plan in all countries, and procedures or recommendations in place regarding the use of alternative vaccines or vaccination schedules in case of shortages/stockouts.","output":"Are vaccine shortages a relevant public health issue in Europe?

METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing TCZ versus placebo/control, for treatment of adults with COVID-19. Primary outcome was 28-30 days all-cause mortality. Search was conducted up to April 1st 2021. Two independent reviewers screened citations, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were pooled. We performed subgroup analysis for patients with critical illness and sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Eight RCTs were included, assessing 6,481 patients with mostly severe non-critical COVID-19 infection. TCZ was associated with a reduction in all-cause 28-30-day mortality compared to placebo/control (RR = 0.89, 95%CI 0.82-0.96). Among the subgroup of critically ill patients no reduced mortality was demonstrated (RR = 0.94, 95%CI 0.74-1.19). No mortality benefit with TCZ was demonstrated in trials that used steroids for >80% of patients. TCZ was associated with significantly reduced risk for mechanical ventilation (MV); for combined endpoint of death or MV; and for intensive care unit (ICU) admission. No significant difference in adverse events was demonstrated. Risk of serious superinfection was significantly lower with TCZ (RR = 0.57, 95%CI 0.35-0.93). CONCLUSION: The treatment with TCZ reduces 28-30 days all-cause mortality, ICU admission, superinfections, MV and the combined endpoint of death or MV. Among critically ill patients, and when steroids were used for most patients, no mortality benefit was demonstrated.

We explored the association of serum selenium levels in early pregnancy with the risk of GDM and preterm birth among Chinese women. We included 398 women with a singleton pregnancy, who were followed up prospectively from the first prenatal visit until delivery. Serum selenium levels were measured in the first trimester. After delivery, data concerning mothers and their children were sourced from medical records by researchers who were blind to the participants' selenium status. Of the 398 women, 71 (17.8%) had GDM, 21(5.3%) had preterm birth, and 266 (66.8%) had selenium deficiency (serum selenium < 70 g/L). Women in the upper three quartiles of serum selenium level did not have a significantly lower risk of GDM or preterm birth than those in the lowest quartile after adjustment for covariates (all p > 0.05). When serum selenium levels were classified as normal or deficient, the risk of GDM or preterm birth among women with normal serum selenium levels was still not lower than that of women with deficient serum selenium levels after adjustment for covariates (all p > 0.05).

New online business models are adopting open innovation practices focused on improving their sales channels through their technological capacity. In this paper, we analyze the purchase intentions in a business context to identify consumer needs through the proper purchase decision process. We must also observe the internal and external factors that influence consumer behavior. More exactly, electronic commerce is facing challenges and opportunities manifested by online consumers, such as design, security, trust, risk, uncertainty, and satisfaction with online purchases. Many external factors (economic, political, social, environmental, and health) influence buyers intentions and behaviors. The objectives of this study are to (1) determine the influence of the security level of websites on purchasing behaviors (socially responsible and panic buyers), (2) determine the effect of website security on consumer satisfaction, (3) determine the effect of buyers (socially responsible and panic buyers) on the level of satisfaction, and (4) examine if the buyer experience has a moderating effect between the variables (socially responsible and panic buyers) and the dependent variable (customer satisfaction). We focus on a sample of 663 socially responsible online buyers and panic buyers from the Sonora, Baja California, and Sinaloa regions in Mexico. Data were collected from the months of April to August 2020, and an online questionnaire was used address to each of the residents of these regions aged between 20 and 55 and who were economically active. The data were analyzed using the structural equation modelCpartial least squares (SEM-PLS) model based on variance. The findings show that website security has significant positive effects on socially responsible buyers, panic buyers, and the level of customer satisfaction. Socially responsible buyers also have positive effects on customer satisfaction. However, the relationship between panic buyers and customer satisfaction is not supported.

Its objective and subjective dimensions are important to distinguish as each stands in a different relation with health. The first aim of the present study is the validation of three scales measuring objective and subjective isolation in an Italian elderly population. The second aim is to analyze subjective and objective social isolation and to appraise their association with health among seniors. METHODS This cross-sectional survey collected data from 306 over 65 s participants. Questionnaires were administered face-to-face by one author and encompassed: social disconnectedness scale; perceived isolation scale; abbreviated Lubben Social Network Scale; measures of general and mental health, and depression. RESULTS The three scales measuring social isolation demonstrated acceptable psychometric properties and validity. Objective and subjective social isolation were not directly associated with physical health, whereas subjective isolation is strongly linked to worse mental health and depression. Higher level of subjective isolation was associated with lower level of physical health through the mediation of mental health. Subjective isolation served as a mediator in the relation between objective isolation and health. Moderation analysis demonstrated that low values of objective isolation predicted high values of mental health but only when subjective isolation was low. None of these relations were moderated by socio-demographic variables. CONCLUSION Subjective and objective isolation are clearly two separate dimensions and the scales validated in this paper showed to be potentially culturally invariant.

Aim. The aim of the study was to perform the structural-dynamic analysis and assessment of survival rates and life expectancy in the population of Angarsk, a large industrial city in the Irkutsk region, for the post-Soviet period. Material and Methods. The short tables of population mortality rates for the period of 1990-2019 were calculated based on official data from the Federal State Statistic Service. The epidemiological analysis of survival rates, life expectancy, and its component composition was carried out according to the method of C. Chandra Sekar. Results. The population aged under 29 years had the highest survival rates in 2016-2019 and the lowest survival rates in the first half of the 1990s. Older working age cohorts demonstrated the highest survival rates in 1990-1991 and the lowest survival rates in 2003-2004. Cohorts of retirement-age men showed the highest survival rates in the mid-2010s whereas female cohorts had the highest rates mostly in 2018-2019;the lowest survival rates were observed in 1994-1996. The life expectancy rates decreased in men of almost all age groups in 1995;the most significant decreases were observed in the groups of 30-54 year-old men and 40-54, 60-69, and 85-89 year-old women. The second pronounced decrease in the life expectancy rates occurred in 2005: the rates significantly decreased (by 6.8 years) in the cohorts of men aged 20-44 and 50-54 years. The most pronounced decreases in life expectancy of women were observed in age groups of 15-34, 40-44, 50-54, and 85-89 year-olds in 2001. Conclusion. In the 1990s and during the first half of the 2000s, the systemic socio-economic crisis caused pronounced decreases in the rates of survival and life expectancy in various age groups of the population of Angarsk.

Long-term experiments are needed to assess potential benefits. The feasibility of a 24-hour experiment in a complex large animal trauma model remains unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anesthetized swine were subjected to controlled hemorrhage, blunt thoracic trauma, and tibial fractures. Animals were then randomized (N = 3/group) to control (No balloon support), 90 minutes of complete supraceliac REBOA, or 10 minutes of supraceliac REBOA followed by 80 minutes of EVAC. One hundred ten minutes after injury, animals were resuscitated with shed blood, the REBOA catheter was removed. Automated critical care under general anesthesia was maintained for 24 hours. RESULTS: Animals in the control and EVAC groups survived to the end of the experiment. Animals in the REBOA group survived for 120, 130, and 660 minutes, respectively. Animals in the EVAC group displayed similar mean arterial pressure and plasma lactate concentration as the control group by the end of the experiment. Histologic analysis suggested myocardial injury in the REBOA group when compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility of intermediate-term experiments in a complex swine model of polytrauma with 90 minutes of REBOA. EVAC may be associated with improved survival at 24 hours when compared with complete REBOA.

Although these models have been commonly used for high-throughput screening of xenobiotics in preclinical studies, they do not fully recapitulate the morphology and functionality of enterocytes found in the human intestine in vivo. Efforts to improve the physiological and functional relevance of in vitro intestinal models have led to the development of enteroids/intestinal organoids and microphysiological systems. These models leverage advances in three-dimensional cell culture techniques and stem cell technology (in addition to microfluidics for microphysiological systems), to mimic the architecture and microenvironment of the in vivo intestine more accurately.

In particular, the \\"loss of heterochromatin\\" phenotype in cellular senescence is associated with the process of aging and age-related disorders. Although biological processes of senescent cells, including senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF) formation, chromosome compaction, and redistribution of key proteins, have been closely associated with high-order chromatin structure, the relationship between the high-order chromatin reorganization and the loss of heterochromatin phenotype during senescence has not been fully understood. By using senescent and deep senescent fibroblasts induced by DNA damage harboring the \\"loss of heterochromatin\\" phenotype, we observed progressive 3D reorganization of heterochromatin during senescence. Facultative and constitutive heterochromatin marked by H3K27me3 and H3K9me3, respectively, show different alterations. Facultative heterochromatin tends to switch from the repressive B-compartment to the active A-compartment, whereas constitutive heterochromatin shows no significant changes at the compartment level but enhanced interactions between themselves. Both types of heterochromatin show increased chromatin accessibility and gene expression leakage during senescence. Furthermore, increased chromatin accessibility in potential CTCF binding sites accompanies the establishment of novel loops in constitutive heterochromatin. Finally, we also observed aberrant expression of repetitive elements, including LTR (long terminal repeat) and satellite classes. Overall, facultative and constitutive heterochromatin show both similar and distinct multiscale alterations in the 3D map, chromatin accessibility, and gene expression leakage. This study provides an epigenomic map of heterochromatin reorganization during senescence.","output":"The loss of heterochromatin is associated with multiscale three-dimensional genome reorganization and aberrant transcription during cellular senescence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Slow coronary flow (SCF) is defined as late opacification in the epicardial coronary arteries without significant stenosis. The underlying mechanism of SCF is similar to coronary atherosclerosis. Free radical damage may be responsible for the pathology. In this study, we aimed to investigate ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) levels and differences with regard to total antioxidant status (TAS) between patients with normal coronary arteries and patients with SCF without significant stenosis. METHODS Thirty patients who were diagnosed with SCF using coronary angiography were included in this cross-sectional observational study (13 male; mean age, 5610 years). The control group consisted of 30 patients who had normal coronary arteries as shown by coronary angiography (13 male; mean age, 5311 years). In this study, we assessed serum IMA levels, albumin-adjusted IMA and TAS. The Student t-test was used to compare serum IMA levels and TAS between the two groups. Pearson's correlation test was used to explore the relationship between TAS and serum IMA levels. RESULTS Serum IMA levels and albumin-adjusted IMA were similar in both groups (p=0.432, p=0.349). The mean value of TAS was significantly lower in the SCF group compared to control group (p=0.011). The TAS was negatively correlated with the levels of IMA and albumin-adjusted IMA in the SCF group (r=-0.457, p=0.011; r=-0.509, p=0.004). CONCLUSION This study shows that serum IMA levels and albumin-adjusted IMA were similar between the groups, however the mean value of TAS was significantly lower in the SCF group compared to control group and negatively correlated with IMA.

Nevertheless, some patients lack confidence in or access to AS. Focal therapy (FT) is a possible alternative to radical treatment for such patients. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated dominant tumor (DT) progression across serial biopsies to determine whether men on AS could be reasonable candidates for FT. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Men enrolled in AS at University of California, San Francisco between 1996 and 2017 with low/intermediate risk were included. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Changes in biopsy grade, volume, and focality of the DT over time were assessed. Focality (good or poor for FT) was defined by the number of cores, laterality, and contiguity of prostate sites containing tumor (based on pathology reports). Candidates (either for targeted/quadrant ablation or for hemigland ablation) were defined based on good focality, grade group (GG) &#8804;2, and low-volume disease. Patients were classified as favorable (GG &#8804; 2 with good focality and concordant multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging [mpMRI]) or unfavorable (poor focality or high-volume disease or discordant mpMRI) for FT at surveillance biopsies. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 1057 men met the inclusion criteria. The median number of biopsies per patient was three (interquartile range 2-4), and 196 patients (18.5%) underwent five or more biopsies. At confirmatory biopsy, 43% remained candidates for FT (67% for targeted/quadrant ablation and 33% for hemigland ablation) and 20% had a negative biopsy. Of the candidates for FT at initial biopsy, 11% had less favorable characteristics at confirmatory biopsy. Among candidates for FT based on both initial and confirmatory biopsies, 70% remained favorable for hemigland ablation at subsequent biopsies. Limitations include retrospective design and mpMRI information only at surveillance biopsy. CONCLUSIONS: Serial biopsy findings in men with early-stage cancer on AS show that tumor location remains relatively stable and significant changes in grade and/or volume occur largely in the DT. Combined diagnostic and confirmatory biopsy findings help better select patients for FT than the use of the diagnostic biopsy alone. PATIENT SUMMARY: In a large cohort of patients on active surveillance for prostate cancer, we evaluated changes across serial biopsies to identify potential candidates for focal therapy (FT). Our findings showed that the dominant tumor remained stable over time and the majority of men were favorable candidates for FT.","output":"Characteristics of Cancer Progression on Serial Biopsy in Men on Active Surveillance for Early-stage Prostate Cancer: Implications for Focal Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To report historical patterns of pharmaceutical expenditures, to identify factors that may influence future spending, and to predict growth in drug spending in 2021 in the United States, with a focus on the nonfederal hospital and clinic sectors. METHODS: Historical patterns were assessed by examining data on drug purchases from manufacturers using the IQVIA National Sales Perspectives database. Factors that may influence drug spending in hospitals and clinics in 2021 were reviewed-including new drug approvals, patent expirations, and potential new policies or legislation. Focused analyses were conducted for biosimilars, cancer drugs, generics, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic influence, and specialty drugs. For nonfederal hospitals, clinics, and overall (all sectors), estimates of growth of pharmaceutical expenditures in 2021 were based on a combination of quantitative analyses and expert opinion. RESULTS: In 2020, overall pharmaceutical expenditures in the United States grew 4.9% compared to 2019, for a total of $535.3 billion. Utilization (a 2.9% increase) and new drugs (a 1.8% increase) drove this increase, with price changes having minimal influence (a 0.3% increase). Adalimumab was the top drug in 2020, followed by apixaban and insulin glargine. Drug expenditures were $35.3 billion (a 4.6% decrease) and $98.4 billion (an 8.1% increase) in nonfederal hospitals and clinics, respectively. In clinics, growth was driven by new products and increased utilization, whereas in hospitals the decrease in expenditures was driven by reduced utilization. Several new drugs that will influence spending are expected to be approved in 2021. Specialty and cancer drugs will continue to drive expenditures along with the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: For 2021, we expect overall prescription drug spending to rise by 4% to 6%, whereas in clinics and hospitals we anticipate increases of 7% to 9% and 3% to 5%, respectively, compared to 2020. These national estimates of future pharmaceutical expenditure growth may not be representative of any particular health system because of the myriad of local factors that influence actual spending.","output":"National trends in prescription drug expenditures and projections for 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the field of motor development, the perception of motor competence is considered one of the most important underlying mechanisms that influence the adherence to the practice of physical activity, where Physical Education dasses are one of the most relevant instances for its development.

On imaging, computed tomography (CT) manifestations resemble those seen in viral pneumonias, with multifocal ground-glass opacities and consolidation in a peripheral distribution being the most common findings. Although these findings lack specificity for COVID-19 diagnosis on imaging grounds, CT could be used to provide objective assessment about the extension of the lung opacities, which could be used as an imaging surrogate for disease burden. Chest CT scan may be helpful in early diagnosing of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The current study investigated the diagnostic accuracy and false-positive rate of chest CT in detecting COVID-19 pneumoniain a population with clinical suspicion using RT-PCR testing as reference standard. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective single centerstudy performed on 612 cases with clinical suspicion of COVID-19, all adult symptomatic ED patients had both a CT scan and a PCR upon arrival at the hospital. CT results were compared with PCR test (s) and diagnostic accuracy was calculated. RESULTS: Between February 15, 2020 to July 15, 2020, 612 symptomatic ED patients were included. In total, 78.5% of patients had a positive PCR and 82.8% a positive CT, resulting in a sensitivity of 94.2%, specificity 76.4%, likelihood ratio (LR) + 2.94 and (LR) - 0.18. The PPV was 76.7% and NPV 94.1%. The sensitivity of the CT tended to be higher (100.0%) in those with severe risk pneumonia than in patients with low/medium risk pneumonia (90.3%, P = 0.42). In patients with sepsis, sensitivity was significantly higher than in those without sepsis (99.5 vs. 63.5%, P < 0.001). The diagnostic ability of chest CT was found to be rather high with 92.1%, concordance rate between findings of CT and PCR. In 48 (7.8%) patients discordant findings between CT and PCR were observed. The positive predictive values (PPV) and accuracy of chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19 were higher in patients 60 years than that in patients <60 years (P = 0.001 and 0.004, respectively). The specificity and NPV of chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19 were greater for women than that for men (P = 0.007 and 0.03, respectively); and no difference existed for sensitivity, PPV and accuracy (P = 0.43, 0.69 and 0.31, respectively). In most cases, the CT scan was considered suspicious for COVID-19, while the PCR was negative (37/48, 70.8%). In the majority of these, the diagnosis at discharge was pulmonary infection (n = 26; 74.3%). The current study included repeated PCRs and explored discordant test results, which showed that in about 45.9% of patients with false-positive CT scans, other viral pathogens were detected. The false-positive rate of CT findings in the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia was 7.2%. CONCLUSION: High diagnostic accuracy of chest CT findings with typical and relatively atypical CT manifestations of COVID-19 leads to a low rate of missed diagnosis. Normal chest CT can be found in RT-PCR positive COVID-19 cases, and typical CT manifestations can be found in RT-PCR negative cases. Therefore, a combination of both CT and RT-PCR for future follow-up, management and medical surveillance is recommended considering the false-positive results of chest CT in the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.","output":"Diagnostic accuracy and false-positive rate of chest CT as compared to RT-PCR in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia: A prospective cohort of 612 cases from India and review of literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is believed that the term asthma was coined by Hippocrates around 450 bc.

Three general categories of allergen exposure models currently exist for the study of cat allergen-induced AR: natural exposure cat rooms, allergen exposure chambers (AEC), and nasal allergen challenges (NAC). We evaluated existing literature surrounding the use of these models to study cat allergen induced AR using online research databases, including OVID Medline, Embase, and Web of Science. We report that natural exposure cat rooms have been important in establishing the foundation for our understanding of cat allergen-induced AR. Major limitations, including variable allergen ranges and differing study designs highlight the need for a more standardized protocol. In comparison, AECs are an exceptional model to mimic real-world allergen exposure and study long-term implications of AR with large sample sizes. Existing AECs are limited by heterogeneous facility designs, differing methods of cat allergen distribution, and issues surrounding cost and accessibility. Conversely, NACs allow for smaller participant cohorts for easier biological sampling and are ideal for phase I, phase 2 or proof-of-concept studies. NACs generally have a standardized protocol and are less expensive compared to AECs. Nevertheless, NACs solely capture acute allergen exposure and have the further limitation of using allergen extracts rather than natural allergen. As the use of combined controlled methodologies is sparse, we recommend concurrent use of AECs and NACs to study short- and long-term effects of AR, thereby providing a more holistic representation of cat allergen-induced AR.","output":"Study of Cat Allergy Using Controlled MethodologyA Review of the Literature and a Call to Action"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The natural sciences include the life and physical sciences and study nature through observing and understanding phenomena, testing hypotheses, and performing experiments.

Although the benefits of PA for CF populations are well-established, adherence to PA programmes within this population remains low. This study aimed to investigate the factors that influence engagement in physical activity, and to explore exercise preferences, among adults with cystic fibrosis (CF). METHODS: Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted. Participants were twenty-one adults (mean age 35 years, SD  8) with an established diagnosis of CF, living in Ireland. Interview scripts were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. RESULTS: Four main themes emerged: barriers, motives, value of exercise-related outcomes, and exercise preferences. The main barriers included: low energy levels, time, the weather, and exercise-related confidence. Enjoyment and perceived competence underpinned autonomous motivation. Participants who self-identified as being regularly active valued personally identified exercise-related outcomes such as, accomplishment and affect regulation. Participants indicated a preference for home-based physical activity programs compared to gym- or facility-based programs.

The objective function of our method consists of a loss deviation term and a loss stabilization term. The loss deviation term increases the divergence between the CNN prediction of an adversarial example and its ground truth label. Meanwhile, the loss stabilization term ensures similar CNN predictions of this example and its smoothed input. From the perspective of the whole iterations for perturbation generation, the proposed loss stabilization term exhaustively searches the perturbation space to smooth the single spot for local optimum escape. We further analyze the KL-divergence of the proposed loss function and find that the loss stabilization term makes the perturbations updated towards a fixed objective spot while deviating from the ground truth. This stabilization ensures the proposed medical attack effective for different types of medical images while producing perturbations in small variance. Experiments on several medical image analysis benchmarks including the recent COVID-19 dataset show the stability of the proposed method.","output":"Stabilized Medical Image Attacks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic is marked not only by rapid spread of the causative virus, SARS CoV-2, but also by the spread of war-like narratives.

The pandemics have led to contemporary practice-related questions, such as: does professionalism entail that health care providers (HCP) be compelled to treat patients without PPE or if patients refuse to wear masks? And what role do HCP play in society when confronted with glaring health disparities and police brutality? The authors propose using care ethics as a theory to view professionalism, as it takes into account broadly encompassing relationships between HCP and society, history and context. Professionalism viewed through a care ethics lens would require professionalism definitions to be expanded to allow for interventions, i.e., not just refrain from doing harm but actively interfere or take action if wrong is being witnessed. Principles related to the primacy of patient welfare need to be re-addressed to prevent systematic self-sacrifice which results in harm to HCP and burnout. Mature care should be a characteristic of professionalism ensuring that HCP care for the sick but be practically wise, highlighting the importance of balancing too little and too much care for self and others. Professionalism needs to be viewed as a bi-directional relational exchange, with society demonstrating solidarity with those providing care. Additionally, given the scale of health disparities, simply stating that HCP need to work towards social justice oversimplifies the problem. Professionalism needs to encompass incorporating critical action and critical pedagogy into health care training and the health care profession to demonstrate solidarity with those impacted by racism.","output":"Professionalism revisited during the pandemics of our time: COVID-19 and racism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study evaluated the effect of global budgeting on health service utilization, health care expenditures, and the quality of care among patients with pneumonia in Taiwan.

However, there is paucity of data about its effect in Indian patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). METHODS: Seven hundred forty-eight patients underwent off-pump CABG from January 2015 to December 2016 (24 months). One hundred twenty-seven patients (16.7%) developed POAF. In an effort to mitigate the effects of wider risk factors on perioperative outcomes, a separate sub-analysis of patients based on risks quantified by EuroSCORE II (<> 3) was also performed. RESULTS: Age > 60 years and development of sepsis were the independent predictors for the development of POAF. Thirty-day/mortality rate was higher in the POAF group (7.1% vs. 1.4%; p value < 0.001). POAF was associated with increased ICU and hospital stay and increased incidence of stroke and renal dysfunction. The survival was significantly lower in the POAF group compared with the normal sinus rhythm (NSR) (3-year survival in POAF was 81.3% vs. 94.4% in the NSR group; Hazard ratio (HR) 3.867 (1.989C7.516)).

Digital notch filters (DNFs) have been widely used to remove the PLI such that actual features, which are weak in energy and strongly connected to brain states, can be extracted explicitly. However, DNFs are mathematically implemented via discrete Fourier analysis, the problem of overlapping between spectral counterparts of PLI and those of EEG features is inevitable. In spite of their effectiveness, DNFs usually cause distortions on the extracted EEG features, which may lead to incorrect diagnostic results. To address this problem, we investigate an adaptive sparse detector for reducing PLI. This novel approach is proposed based on sparse representation inspired by self-adaptive machine learning. In the coding phase, an overcomplete dictionary, which consists of redundant harmonic waves with equally spaced frequencies, is employed to represent the corrupted EEG signal. A strategy based on the split augmented Lagrangian shrinkage algorithm is employed to optimize the associated representation coefficients. It is verified that spectral components related to PLI are compressed into a narrow area in the frequency domain, thus reducing overlapping with features of interest. In the decoding phase, eliminating of coefficients within the narrow band area can remove the PLI from the reconstructed signal. The sparsity of the signal in the dictionary domain is determined by the redundancy factor. A selection criteria of the redundancy factor is suggested via numerical simulations. Experiments have shown the proposed approach can ensure less distortions on actual EEG features.","output":"Adaptive Sparse Detector for Suppressing Powerline Component in EEG Measurements"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne alphavirus that recently re-emerged in many parts of the world causing large-scale outbreaks.

CASE PRESENTATION: A 19-year-old male with no known past medical history presented to the emergency room with myalgia, headache, fever, photophobia, and rash on bilateral upper and lower extremities for more than one week. He tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR 6 weeks prior to the presentation. Symptoms worsened with the development of a maculopapular skin rash, high-grade fevers, diarrhea, and vomiting. On admission he was afebrile (97.6 F), had tachycardia (133/min) and tachypnea (48/min) along with hypotension (78/33 mmHg), and saturating 85% on 4L/min. Lab abnormalities included WBC of 28.2 k/uL with 55% bands, procalcitonin 42.91 ng/mL, lactic acid 4 mmol/L, BUN 65 mg/dl, serum creatinine 7 mg/dl and elevated D-dimer of 3.1 mg/L. Cardiac labs were remarkable for proBNP 76,275 pg/mL, and peak troponin 31.10ng/mL in 12 hours. EKG consistent with myopericarditis. CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis found edema of the cecum and ascending colon with pericolonic fat stranding of ascending colon possible mesenteric adenitis. He initially required 3 vasopressors to maintain his MAP>65mmHg. Echocardiography revealed a left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20% with moderate global hypokinesis of the left ventricle. Cardiac catheterization revealed elevated wedge pressure and had clean coronaries with no aneurysms. MIS-C was suspected and was started on 1g/kg IVIG, high dose aspirin, methylprednisolone, and anakinra. Rash dissipated in days after starting steroids. His LVEF recovered to 55-60% prior to discharge from the hospital. He was kept on Anakinra, continued for 4 weeks till normalization of ferritin. DISCUSSION: MIS-C is a rare sequela of COVID-19 manifesting 2-8 weeks after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. In severe cases, cardiac involvement leads to cardiogenic shock. The echocardiographic findings of myocarditis and pericarditis have been frequently reported[1]. Inflammatory markers including ESR, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and IL-6 are reported to be elevated in all the cases [2]. Though its pathogenesis is not well defined, proposed hypotheses include hyper-immune response, macrophage activation, and T cell stimulation with a delayed cytokine storm. Various case have reported clinical outcomes with the use of intravenous immunoglobulin, corticosteroids, IL-1 inhibitor (anakinra), or IL-6 receptor inhibitor (tocilizumab) [3]. However, further research is needed to define clinical predictors and treatment modalities to manage MIS-C. CONCLUSIONS: Our case emphasizes the complexity of MIS-C with multisystem involvement, and it highlights a timely use of IVIG, high dose aspirin, anakinra, and methylprednisolone as potential therapeutics for this hyperinflammatory condition.

To make pre-diagnosis of COVID-19 as soon as possible, and reduce the work pressure of medical staff, making use of deep learning networks to detect positive CXR images of infected patients is a critical step. However, there are complex edge structures and rich texture details in the CXR images susceptible to noise that can interfere with the diagnosis of the machines and the doctors. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a novel multi-resolution parallel residual CNN (named MPR-CNN) for CXR images denoising and special application for COVID-19 which can improve the image quality. The core of MPR-CNN consists of several essential modules. (a) Multi-resolution parallel convolution streams are utilized for extracting more reliable spatial and semantic information in multi-scale features. (b) Efficient channel and spatial attention can let the network focus more on texture details in CXR images with fewer parameters. (c) The adaptive multi-resolution feature fusion method based on attention is utilized to improve the expression of the network. On the whole, MPR-CNN can simultaneously retain spatial information in the shallow layers with high resolution and semantic information in the deep layers with low resolution. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our MPR-CNN can better retain the texture structure details in CXR images.

After the strict lockdown the pollutants rate has reduced by more than 40% from the pre-lockdown period in the Kolkata megacity. So, decreases of PM10, NO2, SO2, O3 and AC have a greater effect on cloud lightning flashes in the pre-monsoon period. In the previous year (2019), the pre-monsoon average result shows a strong positive relation between the lightning and air pollutants; PM10 (R2 = 0.63), NO2 (R2 = 0.63), SO2 (R2 = 0.76), O3 (R2 = 0.68) and AC (R2 = 0.83). The association was relatively low during the lock-down period (pre-monsoon 2020) and the R2 values were 0.62, 0.60, 0.71, 0.64 and 0.80 respectively. Another thing is that the pre-monsoon (2020) lightning strikes decreased by 49.16% compared to the average of previous years (2010 to 2019).

Data collection and analysis builds on the methodology and content in the COVID-19 Health System Response Monitor (HSRM) up to November 2020. We find that SHI funds were, in general, neither foreseen as major stakeholders in crisis management, nor were they represented in crisis management teams. Further, responsibilities in some countries shifted from SHI funds to federal governments. The overall organisation and governance of SHI systems shaped how countries responded to the challenges of the pandemic. For instance, coordinated ambulatory care often helped avoid overburdening hospitals. Decentralisation among local authorities may however represent challenges with the coordination of policies, i.e. coordination costs. At the same time, bottom-up self-organisation of ambulatory care providers is supported by decentralised structures.

We introduce a 2-parameter generalized-growth model to characterize the ascending phase of an outbreak and capture epidemic profiles ranging from sub-exponential to exponential growth. We test the model against empirical outbreak data representing a variety of viral pathogens and provide simulations highlighting the importance of sub-exponential growth for forecasting purposes. We applied the generalized-growth model to 20 infectious disease outbreaks representing a range of transmission routes. We uncovered epidemic profiles ranging from very slow growth (p=0.14 for the Ebola outbreak in Bomi, Liberia (2014)) to near exponential (p>0.9 for the smallpox outbreak in Khulna (1972), and the 1918 pandemic influenza in San Francisco). The foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in Uruguay displayed a profile of slower growth while the growth pattern of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Japan was approximately linear. The West African Ebola epidemic provided a unique opportunity to explore how growth profiles vary by geography; analysis of the largest district-level outbreaks revealed substantial growth variations (mean p=0.59, range: 0.14-0.97). Our findings reveal significant variation in epidemic growth patterns across different infectious disease outbreaks and highlights that sub-exponential growth is a common phenomenon. Sub-exponential growth profiles may result from heterogeneity in contact structures or risk groups, reactive behavior changes, or the early onset of interventions strategies, and consideration of\\"deceleration parameters\\"may be useful to refine existing mathematical transmission models and improve disease forecasts.","output":"A generalized-growth model to characterize the early ascending phase of infectious disease outbreaks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In today's ever-growing concerns about the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, many experience sleep insufficiencies, such as difficulty falling or staying asleep, sleep-related behavioral symptoms, and out-of-phase circadian rhythmicity despite the lack of history of earlier such symptoms. Meanwhile, the disruption in sleep bioparameters is experienced more in people with a history of sleep disorders. The behavioral sleep disorders in the current situations are prevalent given the today's amount of anxiety everyone is feeling about COVID-19. On the other hand, evidences indicated that the cross-link between impaired sleep efficiency and disrupted innate immunity makes people susceptible to viral infections. The present brief review highlights the links between psychosocial stress, sleep insufficiency, and susceptibility to viral infections in relevance to COVID-19 situation. The stress management measures, including addressing sleep-related disorders and sleep hygiene, will have a notable impact by harnessing immune response and thus reducing the susceptibility to viral infections.","output":"A New Hypothesis on Anxiety, Sleep Insufficiency, and Viral Infections; Reciprocal Links to Consider in Today's World vs. COVID-19 Endeavors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To offer pragmatic, evidence-informed advice on administering corticosteroids in otolaryngology during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, considering therapeutic efficacy, potential adverse effects, susceptibility to COVID-19, and potential effects on efficacy of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19. DATA SOURCES PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CINAHL, and guideline databases. REVIEW METHODS Guideline search strategies, supplemented by database searches on sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL), idiopathic facial nerve paralysis (Bell's palsy), sinonasal polyposis, laryngotracheal disorders, head and neck oncology, and pediatric otolaryngology, prioritizing systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, and COVID-19-specific findings. CONCLUSIONS Systemic corticosteroids (SCSs) reduce long-term morbidity in individuals with SSNHL and Bell's palsy, reduce acute laryngotracheal edema, and have benefit in perioperative management for some procedures. Topical or locally injected corticosteroids are preferable for most other otolaryngologic indications. SCSs have not shown long-term benefit for sinonasal disorders. SCSs are not a contraindication to vaccination with COVID-19 vaccines approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted that these vaccines are safe for immunocompromised patients. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE SCS use for SSNHL, Bell's palsy, laryngotracheal edema, and perioperative care should follow prepandemic standards. Local or topical corticosteroids are preferable for most other otolaryngologic indications. Whether SCSs attenuate response to vaccination against COVID-19 or increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown. Immunosuppression may lower vaccine efficacy, so immunocompromised patients should adhere to recommended infection control practices.

METHODS: We monetized the changes in mortality risk for communicable and non-communicable diseases (CD and NCD, respectively) between 2017 and 2030 for low-income, lower-middle-income, and upper-middle-income countries (LICs, LMICs, and UMICs, respectively). We modeled three mortality trajectories (base-case, high-performance, and low-performance) using Global Burden of Disease study forecasts and estimated disease-specific mortality risk changes relative to the base-case. We assigned monetary values to changes in mortality risk using value of a statistical life (VSL) methods and conducted multiple sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: In terms of NCDs, the absolute monetary value associated with changing mortality risk was highest for cardiovascular diseases in older age groups. For example, being on the low-performance trajectory relative to the base-case in 2030 was valued at $9100 (95% uncertainty range $6800; $11,400), $28,300 ($24,200; $32,400), and $30,300 ($27,200; $33,300) for females aged 70C74 years in LICs, LMICs, and UMICs, respectively. Changing the mortality rate from the base-case to the high-performance trajectory was associated with high monetary value for CDs as well, especially among younger age groups. Estimates were sensitive to assumptions made in calculating VSL. CONCLUSIONS: Our framework provides a priority setting paradigm to best allocate investments toward the health sector and enables intersectoral comparisons of returns on investments from health interventions.

A thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) unit as an electron-deficient unit has been used to construct conjugated polymers for application in fullerene and non-fullerene based OSCs. TPD-based monomers can be simply prepared and TPD-polymers can be synthesized via environmentally friendly direct (hetero)arylation polymerization, providing a possibility for large quantity preparation. TPD-polymers usually have deep frontier energy levels, wide band gaps with absorption onset around 700 nm and good charge transport properties, showing the advantages of high open-circuit voltage, high fill-factor and excellent spectral matching with a small band gap non-fullerene acceptor. From the material design and synthesis and their optoelectrical properties, TPD-polymers have great potential applications in OSCs toward large-area devices. In this review, we provide an overview of TPD-polymers for OSCs in the last ten years, including the design and synthesis of TPD-polymers, and their application in fullerene and non-fullerene OSCs.

Methods: IBD patients and control subjects at 39 institutes were invited to participate in the study from March to October 2021. Blood sample collections to measure anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG antibody titers were planned pre-1st vaccination, pre-2nd vaccination, and at 4 weeks, 3 months and 6 months post-2nd vaccination. Immune responses were compared between groups, considering baseline characteristics and IMD treatments. (UMIN000043545) The interim analyses presented here include mainly data from the 4-weeks post-2nd vaccination time-point. Results: In total, 679 IBD patients and 203 controls were enrolled (Table 1). The IBD group received the BNT162b2 vaccine (86.2%) and the mRNA-1273 vaccine (12.5%), and the control group received the BNT162b2 vaccine (86.9%) and the mRNA-1273 vaccine (12.1%). Only 4 cases (0.7%) in the IBD group and 2 (1.0%) in the control group were infected with COVID-19. Adverse events of 2nd vaccination occurred in 48.4% of the IBD group and 35.1% of the control group. Comparison between administrated and nonadministrated IBD patients for each IMD revealed an attenuated genomic mean titer (GMT [U/mL]) in those taking systemic steroids (18.85 vs 31.24), anti-TNF monotherapy (28.31 vs 42.99), anti-TNF therapy+ immunomodulator (IM) (12.86 vs 35.26), vedolizumab+IM (19.49 vs 30.39), ustekinumab+IM (20.44 vs 30.79), and tofacitinib (9.54 vs 32.08), but not in those taking oral 5-ASA (29.50 vs 32.40), or vedolizumab (41.85 vs 40.20) and ustekinumab (55.56 vs 39.26) monotherapies. Estimated least square means of the GMT by a multiple linear regression model are shown in Table 2.

Emerging evidence suggests that a subset of COVID-19 is characterized by the development of a cytokine storm syndrome (CSS), and interleukin (IL)-6 levels are predictors of COVID-19 severity and in-hospital mortality. Targeting hyper-inflammation in COVID-19 may be critical for reducing mortality. Catecholamines enhance inflammatory injury by augmenting the production of IL-6 and other cytokines through a self-amplifying feed-forward loop in immune cells that requires alpha-1 adrenergic receptor (1-AR) signaling. Prophylactic inhibition of catecholamine synthesis with the 1-AR antagonist prazosin reduced catecholamines and cytokine responses in mice, and resulted in markedly increased survival following various hyper-inflammatory stimuli. These findings offer a rationale for studying 1-AR antagonists in the prophylaxis of patients with COVID-19-CSS and ARDS. As high infection rates threaten to overwhelm hospital capacity during this pandemic, preventative approaches that ameliorate COVID-19 severity and reduce excessive mortality are desperately needed. We hypothesize that treatment with prazosin of individuals who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 could reduce catecholamine surges, secondary cytokine dysregulation, and mortality. To investigate a potential role for 1-AR antagonists in preventing poor outcomes in ARDS, we conducted a retrospective analysis of hospitalized patients diagnosed with ARDS. Using data from the Truven Health MarketScan Research Database (2010-2017), we identified 13,125 men (age 45-64) with ARDS, of whom 655 patients (5.0%) were prescribed 1-AR antagonists in the previous year. Applying logistic regression models, we found that patients with prior use of 1-AR antagonists had lower odds of invasive mechanical ventilation compared to non-users (adjusted OR=0.75, 95% CI 0.59-0.95, p=0.019). Perhaps more importantly, those patients had a ~36% lower incidence of both being ventilated and dying in the hospital (adjusted OR=0.59, 95% CI 0.34-0.95, p=0.042). By contrast, prior use of beta-adrenergic receptor (-AR) antagonists was not correlated with either outcome. We extended these analyses to patients admitted with pneumonia. Of 108,956 subjects in this cohort, 5,498 patients (5.0%) were taking 1-AR antagonist. Similar to ARDS, patients with pneumonia on 1-AR antagonists (but no -AR antagonists) had a lower odds of mechanical ventilation (adjusted OR=0.83, 95% CI 0.75-0.92, p<0.001) and of both being ventilated and dying in the hospital (adjusted OR=0.77, 95% CI 0.62-0.94, p=0.014) compared to non-users. Mirroring findings from pre-clinical models, these data support a clinical rationale to study 1-AR antagonists in the prevention of severe complications of pneumonia, ARDS, and COVID-19. Prospective, randomized clinical trials of alpha-1 receptor antagonists (e.g. prazosin) administered prior to the onset of severe symptoms are needed to assess their efficacy in preventing CSS and reducing mortality in COVID-19.","output":"Targeting the catecholamine-cytokine axis to prevent SARS-CoV-2 cytokine storm syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Behavioral differences in responding to tactile and auditory stimuli are widely reported in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, the neural mechanisms underlying distinct tactile and auditory reactivity patterns in ASD remain unclear with theories implicating differences in both perceptual and attentional processes. The current study sought to investigate (1) the neural indices of early perceptual and later attentional factors underlying tactile and auditory processing in children with and without ASD, and (2) the relationship between neural indices of tactile and auditory processing and ASD symptomatology. Participants included 14, 6C12-year-olds with ASD and 14 age- and non-verbal IQ matched typically developing (TD) children. Children participated in an event-related potential (ERP) oddball paradigm during which they watched a silent video while being presented with tactile and auditory stimuli (i.e., 80% standard speech sound/a/; 10% oddball speech sound/i/; 10% novel vibrotactile stimuli on the fingertip with standard speech sound/a/). Childrens early and later ERP responses to tactile (P1 and N2) and auditory stimuli (P1, P3a, and P3b) were examined. Non-parametric analyses showed that children with ASD displayed differences in early perceptual processing of auditory (i.e., lower amplitudes at central region of interest), but not tactile, stimuli. Analysis of later attentional components did not show differences in response to tactile and auditory stimuli in the ASD and TD groups. Together, these results suggest that differences in auditory responsivity patterns could be related to perceptual factors in children with ASD. However, despite differences in caregiver-reported sensory measures, children with ASD did not differ in their neural reactivity to infrequent touch-speech stimuli compared to TD children. Nevertheless, correlational analyses confirmed that inter-individual differences in neural responsivity to tactile and auditory stimuli were related to social skills in all children. Finally, we discuss how the paradigm and stimulus type used in the current study may have impacted our results. These findings have implications for everyday life, where individual differences in responding to tactile and auditory stimuli may impact social functioning.","output":"Electrophysiological Measures of Tactile and Auditory Processing in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Donna Haraway's 1992 A Cyborg Manifesto, the medical anthropologist describes the cyborg as a \\"hybrid of machine and organism\\" living \\"on the boundary between fact and fiction\\": \\"We are all chimeras, theorized and fabricated hybrids of machine and organism.\\" In 2020, the world that Haraway imagined has arrived, accelerated by the isolation and surveillance enforced in the COVID-19 pandemic.

Neutralizing antibodies are powerful tools for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Antibody CR3022, a SARS-CoV neutralizing antibody, was found to cross-react with SARS-CoV-2, but its affinity was lower than that of its binding with SARS-CoV, which greatly limited the further development of CR3022 against SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, it is necessary to improve its affinity to SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. In this study, the structure-based molecular simulations were utilized to virtually mutate the possible key residues in the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of the CR3022 antibody. According to the criteria of mutation energy, the mutation sites that have the potential to impact the antibody affinity were then selected. Then optimized CR3022 mutants with the enhanced affinity were further identified and verified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), surface plasma resonance (SPR) and autoimmune reactivity experiments. Finally, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and binding free energy calculation (MM/PBSA) were performed on the wild-type CR3022 and its two double-site mutants to understand in more detail the contribution of these sites to the higher affinity. It was found that the binding affinity of the CR3022 antibody could be significantly enhanced more than ten times after the introduction of the S103F/Y mutation in HCDRC3 and the S33R mutation in LCDRC1. The additional hydrogen-bonding, hydrophobic interactions, as well as salt-bridges formed between the modified double-site mutated antibody and SARS-CoV-2 RBD were identified. The computational and experimental results clearly demonstrated that the affinity of the modified antibody has been greatly enhanced. This study indicates that CR3022 as a neutralizing antibody recognizing the conserved region of RBD against SARS-CoV with cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2, a different member in a large family of coronaviruses, could be improved by the computational and experimental approaches which provided insights for developing antibody drugs against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Structure Based Affinity Maturation and Characterizing of SARS-CoV Antibody CR3022 against SARS-CoV-2 by Computational and Experimental Approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Beane and Brynjolfsson discuss the need to work with robots especially with post-pandemic world Whether you turn to news outlets, tech magazines, or academic sources for insight, you're likely to hear that the COVID-19 pandemic is going to drive massive growth in automation like robots What's more, access to the technology is getting less expensive, with \\"robots as a service\\" models allowing companies to pay per touch rather than dipping into precious capital reserves And robots are becoming more capable In just the past few years, companies are building and selling AI-enabled robots to pick things out of bins, handle parts, tend machines, and test the latest electronics This is impressive because it's high-mix work -- that is, the products, the work conditions, the processes, and the final output shift regularly but also in surprising ways Until recently, this made automation via robotics a nonstarter, because previous approaches to things like object detection, grasp detection, and placement verification relied on stable products, conditions, processes, and outcomes Robotics companies are also making similar advances in automating other physical jobs, such as materials transport, sorting, and palletizing","output":"Working With Robots in a Post-Pandemic World"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A common development observed during the COVID-19 pandemic is the renewed reliance on digital health technologies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Articles published from March 2020 to January 2021 were reviewed. We selected those that provided the highest levels of evidence regarding risk in different aspects: screening, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of prostate cancer. RESULTS: We developed a classification system based on priorities, at different stages of the disease (screening, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up) to which the type of care given, in-person or telephone visits, was adapted. We established 4 options, as follows: in priority A or low, care will be given by telephone in all cases; in priority B or intermediate, if patients are considered subsidiary of an in-person visit after telephone consultation, they will be scheduled within 3 months; in priority C or high, patients will be seen in person within a margin from 1 to 3 months and in priority D or very high, patients must always be seen in person within a margin of up to 48 hours and considered very preferential.

Given the scale and widespread geographical distribution of the current pandemic, the question emerges whether human-to-animal transmission is possible and if so, which animal species are most at risk. Here, we investigated the structural properties of several ACE2 orthologs bound to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We found that species known not to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection have non-conservative mutations in several ACE2 amino acid residues that disrupt key polar and charged contacts with the viral spike protein. Our models also predict affinity-enhancing mutations that could be used to design ACE2 variants for therapeutic purposes.

Virtual tourism has a strong influence on people's on-site destination choices and can be used as an effective marketing tool to promote destinations and a platform to sell souvenirs and products. Virtual tourism can be an entertainment activity to bring immersed experience to people without being actually in the destinations, and thus reinforce stay-at-home order and help contain COVID-19.

We sought to evaluate the variability of crSO(2) in a cohort of neonates following cardiac surgery with brief or no exposure to DHCA. METHODS: Variability of averaged 1-min crSO(2) values was calculated for the first 48 h following cardiac surgery in consecutive neonates over a 30-month period. Neonates requiring aortic arch repair underwent antegrade cerebral perfusion with either brief or no exposure to DHCA. RESULTS: There were 115 neonates included in the study. Reduced crSO(2) variability was observed in neonates with aortic arch obstruction (p = 0.02) and non-survivors (p = 0.02). Post hoc analysis demonstrated that the reduction in crSO(2) variability was not as marked as in previously studied neonates with aortic arch obstruction who received DHCA alone (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Neonates with aortic arch obstruction have reduced crSO(2) variability following cardiac surgery. The reduction in crSO(2) variability observed in aortic arch obstruction is likely influenced by a number of factors, including perioperative perfusion technique. The impact of interventions on crSO(2) variability and resultant influence on neurodevelopmental outcomes requires further study. IMPACT: Neonates with aortic arch obstruction have reduced crSO(2) variability following cardiac surgery, which has been associated with poor neurodevelopmental outcomes, and is likely influenced by a number of factors, including perioperative perfusion technique. The contribution of perioperative perfusion technique to crSO(2) variability following neonatal cardiac surgery is significant.

PATIENTS Veterans 65 or older who received primary care at 2 VA facilities who consented to HIE and had a non-VA hospital admission or emergency department visit between 2016 and 2019. INTERVENTIONS For all subjects, real-time HIE notification of the non-VA acute care encounter was sent to the VA primary care provider. Subjects assigned to HIE plus CTI received home visits and telephone calls from a VA social worker for 30 days after arrival home, focused on patient activation, medication and condition knowledge, patient-centered record-keeping, and follow-up. MEASURES Primary outcome: 90-day hospital admission or readmission. SECONDARY OUTCOMES emergency department visits, timely VA primary care team telephone and in-person follow-up, patients' understanding of their condition(s) and medication(s) using the Care Transitions Measure, and high-risk medication discrepancies. KEY RESULTS A total of 347 non-VA acute care encounters were included and assigned: 159 to HIE plus CTI and 188 to HIE alone. Veterans were 76.9 years old on average, 98.5% male, 67.8% White, 17.1% Black, and 15.1% other (including Hispanic).

OBJECTIVE: To compare the relationship between comorbid burden and adverse outcomes in adults with SARS-CoV-2 of different ages (18C64, 65C79 and  80 years). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Observational longitudinal cohort study of 170,528 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Care System between 2/28/20 and 12/31/2020 who were followed through 01/31/2021. MEASUREMENTS: Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI); Incidence of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and death within 30 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. RESULTS: The cumulative 30-day incidence of death was 0.8% in cohort members < 65 years, 7.1% in those aged 65C79 years and 20.6% in those aged 80 years. The respective 30-day incidences of hospitalization were 8.2, 21.7 and 29.5%, of ICU admission were 2.7, 8.6, and 11% and of mechanical ventilation were 1, 3.9 and 3.2%. Median CCI (interquartile range) ranged from 0.0 (0.0, 2.0) in the youngest, to 4 (2.0, 7.0) in the oldest age group. The adjusted association of CCI with all outcomes was attenuated at older ages such that the threshold level of CCI above which the risk for each outcome exceeded the reference group (1st quartile) was lower in younger than in older cohort members (p < 0.001 for all age group interactions). LIMITATIONS: The CCI is calculated based on diagnostic codes, which may not provide an accurate assessment of comorbid burden. CONCLUSIONS: Age differences in the distribution and prognostic significance of overall comorbid burden could inform clinical management, vaccination prioritization and population health during the pandemic and argue for more work to understand the role of age and comorbidity in shaping the care of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2.

METHODS: In this community-based cohort study, we included 96,275 participants of the UK Biobank who had available SARS-CoV-2 test results in Public Health England. Of these, 2617 had a clinical diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases in the UK Biobank inpatient hospital data before the outbreak of COVID-19 (defined as January 31st, 2020), while the remaining participants constituted the reference group. We then followed both groups from January 31st, 2020 to June 14th, 2021 for ascertainment of COVID-19 outcomes, including any COVID-19, inpatient care for COVID-19, and COVID-19 related death. Logistic regression was applied to estimate the association between neurogenerative disease and risks of COVID-19 outcomes, adjusted for multiple confounders and somatic comorbidities. RESULTS: We observed an elevated risk of COVID-19 outcomes among individuals with a neurodegenerative disease compared with the reference group, corresponding to a fully adjusted odds ratio of 2.47 (95%CI 2.25C2.71) for any COVID-19, 2.18 (95%CI 1.94C2.45) for inpatient COVID-19, and 3.67 (95%CI 3.11C4.34) for COVID-19 related death. Among individuals with a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2, individuals with neurodegenerative diseases had also a higher risk of COVID-19 related death than others (fully adjusted odds ratio 2.08; 95%CI 1.71C2.53).

In such conditions, public interest in theme parks is growing. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of service quality, innovation, price, promotion on customer satisfaction. In this study, customer satisfaction is considered as the intervening variable that has an impact on customer loyalty. The object of study is Ancol Dreamland Park - a top-rated theme park for traveling in Jakarta (Indonesia). Participants in this study were visitors who had come to the Ancol Dreamland Park during the Covid-19 p ndemic more than once, were 17 years old and over, and were domiciled in Greater Jakarta. The sample consisted of 200 respondents: 101 females (50.5%) and 99 males (49.5%). The research methodology is based on the use of the quantitative method and causal research. For data analysis, the authors use the SEM (Structural Equation Model), SPSS (Statistical Program for Social Science), and Amos 26 software. The results of this study show that service quality, innovation, price perception, promotion have a significant positive effect on customer satisfaction. Along with this, customer satisfaction has a significant positive effect on customer loyalty. So, the increase in customer satisfaction leads to an increase in customer loyalty, although this increase may not be felt immediately. However, customer satisfaction is a good strategy for the future, because customers will want to visit this theme park again and share their positive feedback with other people. These findings should guide the management of such amusement parks to improve the quality of services. In particular, the quality of service can be improved by paying attention to cleanliness, health, and visitor safety, which are very much needed during this COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Influence of Service Quality, Innovation, Price, Promotion on Customer Satisfaction and Customer Loyalty"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using the SRQR EQUATOR checklist, we review the gendered burdens and impacts of SARS-CoV-2. Although men are primarily detected to be slightly more vulnerable in succumbing to the ongoing COVID-19 contagion, many researchers have recognized that women are facing more of the devastating brunt in secondary terms. Aside gendered health and social impacts, women are more disproportionately disadvantaged than men in economic terms, as they are predominantly found in the part-time and informal occupations, which have been closed down for months now since the emergence of the current global crisis. Also, since women form the vast proportion of the caregivers within the health sector, their role in handling the pandemic as frontline respondents at the hospitals put them in higher risks of contracting the disease. Despite this higher risk of infection, the peculiar attentions to women's health in the planning and rolling out of actions to contain the virus have been overlooked. Additionally, their unpaid domestic care works have also increased due to closure of schools and businesses, which have forced family members to stay at home for as long as movement control orders remain in place. In this confined state, the domestic violence against women have been recorded to be on the increase. To recommend measures that consider gendered dimensions of the current crisis, we have reviewed the various sex-based burdens and impacts of the pandemic, and proceeded to suggest necessary response actions to handle the situation. Particular emphasis is placed on the effects of the outbreak on women, and how the gendered flaws in the current response strategies could be avoided in managing future global crises.","output":"Gendered burdens and impacts of SARS-CoV-2: a review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has substantially changed our daily lives, career trajectories, and sense of safety.

However, young adults are often in unstable places in their careers, education, and social lives, which may be more disrupted by policy changes than those of older adults. Thus, it is imperative to identify young adult subgroups who are at increased risk for mental health difficulties to develop targeted interventions to mitigate emotional distress. This study recruited 620 young adults, Ages 18-35 (M = 26.59; SD = 5.24), to determine whether there were differences in self-reported anxiety and depression in the weeks following the pandemic declaration by gender (male, female, or nonbinary) and health status (i.e., the absence of health conditions, the presence of either physical or mental health conditions, and the presence of both physical and mental health conditions) using a 3  4 analysis of variance. For both depression and anxiety, nonbinary participants reported the highest levels, followed by female participants. For health status, those with both mental and physical health conditions reported the highest anxiety and depression, followed by those with mental health conditions, physical health conditions, and no health conditions. These findings call for resources to be directed toward individuals who fall into groups reporting greater emotional distress, so that clinicians can intervene as early as possible to prevent mental health decline.

SETTING: Five fertility centers in Missouri, Texas, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. PATIENTS: Four hundred sixty-three patients undergoing 526 cycles. INTERVENTION: IVC using INVOCELL. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cumulative pregnancy rate and live births. Secondary outcomes of interest included percent good quality embryos. RESULTS: IVC with INVOCELL was primarily used in women <38 years with anti-Mullerian hormone level >0.8 ng/mL. The mean numbers of retrieved oocytes ranged from 9.2 to 16. Mean numbers of oocytes and sperm-injected oocytes loaded per INVOCELL ranged from a mean of 6.4C9.5 with a reported maximum of 34 oocytes loaded into the device.

However, most positive-strand RNA viruses replicate within a modified organelle co-opted from intracellular membranes of the endomembrane system, which shields viral products from host cell innate immune sensors. Targeting innate RNA sensors to the endomembrane system may enhance their ability to sense viral RNA generated by viruses that use these compartments for replication. Here, we reveal that an isoform of oligoadenylate synthetase 1, OAS1 p46, is prenylated and targeted to the endomembrane system. Membrane localization of OAS1 p46 confers enhanced access to viral replication sites and results in increased antiviral activity against a subset of RNA viruses including flavivirus, picornavirus, and SARS-CoV-2. Finally, our human genetic analysis shows that the OAS1 splice-site SNP responsible for production of the OAS1 p46 isoform strongly associates with COVID-19 severity. This study highlights the importance of endomembrane targeting for the antiviral specificity of OAS1 and suggests early control of SARS-CoV-2 replication through OAS1-p46 is an important determinant of COVID-19 severity.","output":"Endomembrane targeting of human OAS1 p46 augments antiviral activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social influence pervades our everyday lives and lays the foundation for complex social phenomena. In a crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic, social influence can determine whether life-saving information is adopted. Existing literature studying online social influence suffers from several drawbacks. First, a disconnect appears between psychology approaches, which are generally performed and tested in controlled lab experiments, and the quantitative methods, which are usually data-driven and rely on network and event analysis. The former are slow, expensive to deploy, and typically do not generalize well to topical issues (such as an ongoing pandemic);the latter often oversimplify the complexities of social influence and ignore psychosocial literature. This work bridges this gap and presents three contributions towards modeling and empirically quantifying online influence. The first contribution is a data-driven Generalized Influence Model that incorporates two novel psychosocial-inspired mechanisms: the conductance of the diffusion network and the social capital distribution. The second contribution is a framework to empirically rank users' social influence using a human-in-the-loop active learning method combined with crowdsourced pairwise influence comparisons. We build a human-labeled ground truth, calibrate our generalized influence model and perform a large-scale evaluation of influence. We find that our generalized model outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches and corrects the inherent biases introduced by the widely used follower count. As the third contribution, we apply the influence model to discussions around COVID-19. We quantify users' influence, and we tabulate it against their professions.

New digital technology in education and its constantly evolving paradigm have completely transformed the model of learning and the learning methods. E-learning has become an important tool for teaching and learning environments. Moreover, virtual learning has become a required alternative teaching method in educational system change during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for learners in elementary schools. Aim. This research aimed to explore the necessities, lack, and want of learning English, which is done virtually at home. Methodology and research methods. This research employs descriptive methods using questionnaires and interviews as instruments to get responses from teachers and students about their learning needs. In the course of the needs analysis process, the importance and priority of teachers' and students' needs are discussed. The participants of this study were second-grade elementary school students, and the sample was 40 students and 2 English teachers for 10 months. Results. The research results demonstrate a gap between the needs of learners and current conditions;therefore, the whole language approach, the multimedia, and technology-based English teaching materials will become an inevitable need and even become a solution in the world of education. Scientific novelty. Further research is needed to study educational system change during the COVID-19 pandemic or after, especially in designing teaching materials in various disciplines and at different educational stages. Future studies could be generalised by these research findings to other populations in different learning contexts, and the findings presented in this article should be further explored. In particular, technology-based and multimedia-based teaching materials must be explored more deeply. Furthermore, further research should focus on utilising a different model for needs analysis in language education to verify the need for effective English learning in changing the education system during the pandemic and after.

Cancer BioPortal (cBioPortal) is an open-access collective cancer research resource for storing and exploring clinical, genomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic data. cBioPortal eliminates the computational barrier of interpreting complex genomic data by providing easily understandable visualization that can be interpreted and translated into relevant biological insights. Because no prior computational knowledge is required, cBioPortal is an ideal educational tool for either in-person or distance learning environments. We developed a pedagogical approach, video tutorials, and data analysis workflows centered on using cBioPortal. Pedagogically, students develop an initial research outline that is continually updated and graded throughout the project. Progress during the project or course is assessed by a series of student presentations that are 5 to 15 minutes in length and are aimed at explaining the approach used in data acquisition, interpretation of the data, and relevance to the initial hypothesis.

The authors use ethical lens to develop a conceptual framework to inform and reduce conflicts of Web-based messaging associated with COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach This paper provides a comprehensive review of three different ethical schools and identifies the cohesive theme of common good across them. Common good leading to a greater good serves as the overarching ethical construct for Web-based messages that focus on society and not the singular individual, business or political ideology. Findings The findings suggest that the ethical construct of common good focuses on prioritizing the society over the individual and draws upon utilitarian principles focused on consequences, Kantian principles focused on intentions and Aristotelian principles focused on the definition of good. Web-based messaging on COVID-19 originates from diverse public and private sources and ethically can be governed by adherence to achieving the greatest good for society. Pervasive conflicts with COVID-19 messaging can be mitigated by pursuing a more ethical agenda with messages. Originality/value This manuscript provides a conceptual framework, based on ethical principles, to serve as a blueprint for Web-based messaging during a pandemic. This work offers an ethical perspective for communication during a pandemic and it is original in conceptualizing the components of Web-based messaging and decomposing them into the different levels where conflicts can occur.

To understand the potential for recognition of different modifications of sialic acid by MVM, three types of capsids, virus-like particles, wild type empty (no DNA) capsids, and DNA packaged virions, were screened on a sialylated glycan microarray (SGM). Both viruses demonstrated a preference for binding to 9-O-methylated sialic acid derivatives, while MVMp showed additional binding to 9-O-acetylated and 9-O-lactoylated sialic acid derivatives, indicating recognition differences. The glycans recognized contained a type-2 Gal1-4GlcNAc motif (Neu5Ac2-3Gal1-4GlcNAc or 3SIA-LN) and were biantennary complex-type N-glycans with the exception of one. To correlate the recognition of the 3SIA-LN glycan motif as well as the biantennary structures to their natural expression in cell lines permissive for MVMp, MVMi, or both strains, the N- and O-glycans, and polar glycolipids present in three cell lines used for in vitro studies, A9 fibroblasts, EL4 T lymphocytes, and the SV40 transformed NB324K cells, were analyzed by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. The cells showed an abundance of the sialylated glycan motifs recognized by the viruses in the SGM and previous glycan microarrays supporting their role in cellular recognition by MVM. Significantly, the NB324K showed fucosylation at the non-reducing end of their biantennary glycans, suggesting that recognition of these cells is possibly mediated by the Lewis X motif as in 3SIA-Le(X) identified in a previous glycan microarray screen.","output":"Profiling of Glycan Receptors for Minute Virus of Mice in Permissive Cell Lines Towards Understanding the Mechanism of Cell Recognition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduo A vacinao ainda  a principal forma de reduo de novos casos de infeco por SARS COV2.

METHODS We analyzed combined individual patient data from 3 multicenter cohorts of consecutive patients with CeAD (the Cervical Artery Dissection and Ischemic Stroke Patients [CADISP]-Plus consortium dataset). Patients with data on DAO and functional outcome were included. We compared patients with DAO to those without DAO. Primary outcome was favorable functional outcome (i.e., modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score 0-1) measured 3-6 months from baseline. Secondary outcomes included delayed cerebral ischemia, major hemorrhage, recurrent CeAD, and death. We performed univariate and multivariable binary logistic regression analyses and calculated odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), with adjustment for potential confounders. RESULTS Of 2,148 patients (median age 45 years [interquartile range (IQR) 38-52], 43.6% women), 728 (33.9%) had DAO. Patients with DAO more frequently presented with cerebral ischemia (84.6% vs 58.5%, p < 0.001). Patients with DAO were less likely to have favorable outcome when compared to patients without DAO (mRS 0-1: 59.6% vs 80.1%, p unadjusted < 0.001).

ObjectivesAssess the risk of contracting COVID-19 through exposure to SARS-CoV-2 via cash acting as a fomite in payment transactions. MethodsA quantitative microbial risk assessment was conducted for a worst-case scenario assuming an infectious person at the onset of symptoms, when virion concentrations in coughed droplets are at their highest. This person then contaminates a banknote by coughing on it and immediately hands it over to another person, who might then be infected by transferring the virions with a finger from the contaminated banknote to a facial mucous membrane. The scenario considered transfer efficiency of virions on the banknote to fingertips when droplets were still wet and after having dried up and subsequently being touched by finger printing or rubbing the object. ResultsAccounting for the likelihood of the worst-case scenario to occur by considering 1) a local prevalence of 100 COVID-19 cases/100,000 persons, 2) a maximum of about 1/5th of infected persons transmit high virus loads and 3) the numbers of cash transactions/person/day, the risk of contracting COVID-19 via person-to-person cash transactions was estimated to be much lower than once per 39,000 days (107 years) for a single person.

AIMS To cross-sectionally examine the dose-response relationship between accelerometer-measured SB or PA and NAFLD using cubic spline analysis and the interdependence of movement behaviours over 24 hours with compositional data analysis. METHODS Data were obtained between May 2017 and February 2020 from 1914 people who were not heavy alcohol drinkers using health check-ups at the Meiji Yasuda Shinjuku Medical Center, Tokyo. SB, light-intensity PA (LPA) and moderate- to vigorous-intensity PA (MVPA) were evaluated using a triaxial accelerometer. Fatty liver was diagnosed by ultrasonography. RESULTS A multivariable-adjusted logistic model showed an inverse association between MVPA and NAFLD (odds ratio [OR] per 600 metabolic equivalents [MET]-min/week = 0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.76-0.96). MVPA showed rapidly decreasing odds of NAFLD to approximately 1800 MET-min/week in cubic spline analysis and then a moderate decline. Although SB was significantly associated with NAFLD in a body mass index (BMI)-unadjusted model, it was not significant in a BMI-adjusted model. In the compositional isotemporal substitution, reallocating 60 min/day of SB to MVPA decreased the odds of NAFLD by 22% (OR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.65-0.93), whereas reallocating 60 min/day of MVPA to SB increased it by 69% (OR = 1.69, 95% CI: 1.12-2.38).

Yet, pandemic-related policy decisions cannot be made on health information alone. Decisions need to consider the broader impacts on people and their needs. Quantifying human needs across the population is challenging as it requires high geo-temporal granularity, high coverage across the population, and appropriate adjustment for seasonal and other external effects. Here, we propose a computational methodology, building on Maslow's hierarchy of needs, that can capture a holistic view of relative changes in needs following the pandemic through a difference-in-differences approach that corrects for seasonality and volume variations. We apply this approach to characterize changes in human needs across physiological, socioeconomic, and psychological realms in the US, based on more than 35 billion search interactions spanning over 36,000 ZIP codes over a period of 14 months. The analyses reveal that the expression of basic human needs has increased exponentially while higher-level aspirations declined during the pandemic in comparison to the pre-pandemic period. In exploring the timing and variations in statewide policies, we find that the durations of shelter-in-place mandates have influenced social and emotional needs significantly. We demonstrate that potential barriers to addressing critical needs, such as support for unemployment and domestic violence, can be identified through web search interactions.

We analyzed trends in -cfDNA level immediately preceding and during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic with implemented \\"shelter in place\\" and a tele-health strategy with remote home phlebotomy to limit COVID-19 exposure. Methods: During COVID-19 in the United States (US), we surveyed weekly (January 6, 2020-May 25, 2020) metrics for -cfDNA corresponding to both a low risk for active rejection (-cfDNA < 0.5%) and cohorts with indeterminate levels of 0.5% to 1.0% and > 1.0%. During the study timeframe, over 11,000 patient samples (67%) from 150 kidney transplantation centers were transitioned from standard facility-based to remote phlebotomy. Results: The proportion of -cfDNA samples, analyzed in 21 weekly aggregated cohorts by risk-stratification category, was unchanged during the COVID-19 escalation in the US. Linearized slopes for numbers of samples corresponding to indeterminate risk for AR cohorts of > 1.0% and 0.5% to 1.0% were -0.31 and -0.12, respectively; indicating that prevalence of these \\"at risk for AR cohorts\\" decreased during remote surveillance.

However, evidence from previous controlled studies is mixed. METHOD: In this study, we examined the effects of acute delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) versus placebo on a task measuring willingness to exert effort for rewards. This is a secondary analysis of a larger study examining interactions between ovarian hormones and THC. In this within-subjects study, oral THC and placebo were administered under double-blind conditions in counterbalanced order to healthy young adult (M age = 24 years) women with previous cannabis experience who were not regular users. Forty subjects completed three 4-h sessions with PL, 7.5 and 15 mg THC, while an additional 18 completed only PL and 15 mg THC sessions (design abridged due to pandemic). At each session, they completed a task consisting of making repeated choices between a hard and an easy task, which were worth varying amounts of money at varying probabilities. RESULTS: THC dose-dependently decreased hard task choices (drug effect, b = ? 0.79, SE = 0.29, z = ? 2.67, p < 0.01), especially at moderate to high expected values of reward (drug  probability  amount interaction, b = 0.77, SE = 0.38, z = 1.99, p = 0.04). THC also slowed task performance (drug effect, b = 0.01, SE = 0.005, t(5.24) = 2.11, p = 0.04), but the effect of THC on choice was still significant after controlling for this psychomotor slowing.

MSCs-lung and MSCs-CPAM do not express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TRMPSS2). SARS-CoV-2 appears to be unable to replicate in MSCs-CPAM and MSCs-lung. MSCs-lung and MSCs-CPAM maintained the expression of stemness markers MSCs-lung show an inflammatory response (IL6, IL1B, CXCL8, and CXCL10), and the activation of Notch3 non-canonical pathway; this route appears silent in MSCs-CPAM, and cytokine genes expression is reduced. Decreased value of p21 in MSCs-lung suggested no cell cycle block, and cells did not undergo apoptosis. MSCs-lung appears to increase genes associated with immunomodulatory function but could contribute to inflammation, while MSCs-CPAM keeps stable or reduce the immunomodulatory receptors expression, but they also reduce their cytokines expression. These data indicated that, independently from their perilesional or cystic origin, the MSCs populations already present in a patient affected with CPAM are not permissive for SARS-CoV-2 entry, and they will not spread the disease in case of infection. Moreover, these MSCs will not undergo apoptosis when they come in contact with SARS-CoV-2; on the contrary, they maintain their staminality profile.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Exposed Mesenchymal Stromal Cell from Congenital Pulmonary Airway Malformations: Transcriptomic Analysis and the Expression of Immunomodulatory Genes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has placed additional challenges on mental health services.

METHODS: We collected data on 402 adult patients with positive COVID-19 PCR testing admitted to hospitals within our health system from March 1, 2020 until July 10, 2020. Patient characteristics including age, tobacco use, coronary artery disease, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, malignancy, vital signs on admission, PCT levels upon admission, peak PCT levels, and CT chest results were collected. Clinical outcomes including hospital length of stay, ICU length of stay, and in-hospital mortality were also obtained. A PCT measurement on admission of 0.25 ng/mL was used to stratify patients into two mutually exclusive groups. Comparisons of the two groups were made with Mann-Whitney for continuous variables and Chi-square or Fishers exact test based on expected frequencies. Multivariable binary logistic regression models were used to model mortality. Kaplan-Meier was used to examine potential differences in overall length of stay as well as ICU length of stay while considering death to be a censoring event. SAS v. 9.4 was used for all analyses;P < 0.05 was deemed significant. RESULTS: Results of the multivariable analysis demonstrated elevated PCT level on hospital admission was not associated with increased odds of mortality (OR = 1.00;95% Cl: 0.97 to 1.02;P = 0.713). Results of the Kaplan-Meier curve revealed no evidence of a significant difference between PCT groups for hospital length of stay (P = 0.144) or ICU length of stay (P = 0.260). Results from the mortality model demonstrated every additional ten years of age was associated with increased odds of mortality (OR = 2.42;95% CI: 1.59 to 4.09;P < 0.001) after adjusting for all other variables. Increased duration of mechanical ventilation was also associated with increased odds of mortality (OR = 2.67;95% CI: 1.52 to 5.10;P = 0.001).

The global data of COVID-19 showed that men have a higher mortality rate than women. We further observed that the proportion of mortality of female increases starting from around the age of 55 significantly. Thus, sex is an essential factor associated with COVID-19 mortality, and sex related genetic factors could be interesting mechanisms and targets for COVID-19 treatment. However, the associated sex factors and signaling pathways remain unclear. Here, we propose to uncover the potential sex associated factors using systematic and integrative network analysis. The unique results indicated that estrogen hormones (ER), e.g., estrone and estriol, 1) interacting with ESR1/2 receptors, 2) can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 caused inflammation and immune response signaling in host cells; and 3) estrogen hormone is associated with the distinct fatality rates between male and female COVID-19 patients. Specifically, a high level of estradiol protecting young female COVID-19 patients, and estrogen loss to an extremely low level in females after about 55 years of age causing the increased fatality rate of women. In conclusion, estrogen hormone, interacting with ESR1/2 receptors, is an essential sex factor that protects COVID-19 patients by inhibiting inflammation and immune response caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Medications perturb the down-stream of ESR1/ESR2 to inhibit the inflammation and immune response can be effective or synergistic combined with other existing drugs for COVID-19 treatment.","output":"Estrogen Hormone Is an Essential Sex Factor Inhibiting Inflammation and Immune Response in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Near-field communication emerged as a high-security, wireless, short-range, data exchange technology nearly two decades ago; its ability to simultaneously transfer power and data between devices offers exciting opportunities for the design of miniature, battery-free and disposable sensing systems in health care and food quality monitoring.","output":"The future of near-field communication-based wireless sensing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Japan, the first case of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported on 15th January 2020 In India, on 30th January 2020, the first case of COVID-19 in India was reported in Kerala and the number of reported cases has increased rapidly The main purpose of this work is to study numerically the epidemic peak for COVID-19 disease along with transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Japan and India 2020 Taking into account the uncertainty due to the incomplete information about the coronavirus (COVID-19), we have taken the Susceptible-Asymptomatic-Infectious-Recovered (SAIR) compartmental model under fractional order framework for our study We have also studied the effects of fractional order along with other parameters in transfer dynamics and epidemic peak control for both the countries An optimal control problem has been studied by controlling social distancing parameter [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Biophysical Reviews & Letters is the property of World Scientific Publishing Company and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Optimal Control of Fractional Order COVID-19 Epidemic Spreading in Japan and India 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2020 COVID pandemic has posed an unprecedented challenge to Europes economies, societies and political institutions Finding solutions for the immediate and longer-term impact of the pandemic requires collaboration between the European Unions (EU) member states and leadership from their governments at both national and European levels The President of the European Council is central to this process, as he leads and facilitates the collaboration between the heads of states and governments Looking back at the lessons from Donald Tusks time as President of the European Council from 2014 to 2019, this article argues that Tusk made an immensely important political contribution to the EU as he set the tone for a liberal and progressive agenda at a time of significant threat from populist and pro-Russian voices in Europe However, with the recent political and institutional developments in the EU, and based on the insights from Mr Tusks successes and challenges, the article also argues that the role of the European Council President today requires strong brokering skills and leadership behind the scenes more than an openly political and public figure","output":"Politics and Diplomacy: Lessons from Donald Tusks Time as President of the European Council"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An 85-year-old man was referred for an MRI scan of the pelvis for further evaluation of a suspected left neck of femur fracture, which was regarded as equivocal on plain radiograph and CT.

The robot was remotely controlled by a radiologist operating a joystick at the master site. The telesonography system was used to scan participants' forearms, and all participants were conventionally scanned for comparison. Participants and radiologists were surveyed regarding their experience. Images from both scanning methods were independently assessed by an MSK radiologist. RESULTS All ten ultrasound exams were successfully performed using our developed MSK telesonography system, with no significant delay in movement. The duration (mean  standard deviation) of telerobotic and conventional exams was 4.6  0.9 and 1.4  0.5 min, respectively (p = 0.039). An MSK radiologist rated quality of real-time ultrasound images transmitted over an internet connection as \\"very good\\" for all telesonography exams, and participants rated communication with the radiologist as \\"very good\\" or \\"good\\" for all exams. Visualisation of anatomic structures was similar between telerobotic and conventional methods, with no statistically significant differences.

We evaluated the apps feasibility, acceptability, validity and safety in a proof-of-concept study. METHODS: Pregnant women ( 36 weeks gestation) and partners were recruited from antenatal services and invited to complete daily EPDS assessments via the ClinTouch DAWN-P app until 6 weeks postpartum. Participants completed standard paper-based EPDS at two time points for validity comparisons. We examined app acceptability and usability at 6 weeks postpartum with qualitative interviews, examined using framework analysis, and the abridged Mobile App Rating Scale (convergent mixed methods design). RESULTS: Most (96%) eligible pregnant women approached were keen to try the app. Participating mothers (n = 15) and partners/fathers (n = 8) found the app easy to use, and 91% continued to use it for the full study period. Overall, 67% of daily app-based assessments were completed, with a history of depression predicting lower app usage. Participants suggested modifications to the app and its deployment to improve usability (e.g., extending the response window and including feedback and parenting advice). The validity of app-based responses was confirmed by high agreement with standard EPDS. App-based and paper-based ratings showed perfect agreement in identifying cases of likely PND. There were no serious adverse events relating to app use. CONCLUSIONS: Digital PND screening appears feasible, acceptable, valid and safe. It also benefits from being remotely delivered: we enrolled all participants remotely during the first COVID-19 lockdown. Use of digital screening could address known shortcomings of conventional health visitor-delivered screening such as limited staff time, parental unwillingness to disclose difficulties to a professional, lack of partner/father screening, and language barriers.

However, although 61.5% of the patients achieved the highest detectable IgG titers, this proportion remained significantly lower than what was observed in healthy controls, where 100% reached these highest antibody titers. Here, we investigated whether a third dose of vaccine would improve the anti- SARS-CoV-2 response in Allo-HSCT recipients. Methods This monocentric retrospective study aimed at evaluating the efficacy of a third vaccine (V3) of BNT162b2 in a cohort of Allo-HSCT adult recipients. Patients with previous clinical or asymptomatic biological COVID-19 infection at V1 were excluded from the study. A cohort of healthy volunteers (caregivers from the Clinical Hematology Department) who had also already received V1 and V2 was considered as controls. All participants were vaccinated between January 20 and June 1, 2021. Analyses were performed in July 2021. Antibody response to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain was tested after V2 for all subjects (Serology post V2, SpV2) using the Roche Elecsys? assay. All subjects benefited later from another evaluation of specific serum antibodies as monitoring (Serology post V2+, SpV2+) or after V3 (Serology post V3, SpV3). Various serological methods were used for these later assays because performed outside of our hospital for some patients. Considering thresholds of negativity and positivity as well as highest values for each test, we were able nevertheless to distinguish 4 sub-groups: i) negativity at both SpV2 & SpV2+/SpV3, ii) increase of the IgG titer between SpV2 & SpV2+/SpV3, including patients showing seroconversion, iii) decreased or stable IgG titer between SpV2 & SpV2+/SpV3 and iv) highest IgG titers at both SpV2 and SpV2+/SpV3. Results A cohort of 25 controls and 114 patients, including 91 who received V3 (V3+) and 23 who did not (V3-) was considered for the purpose of this study. The characteristics of participants and delays from SpV2 to SpV2+ or SpV2 to SpV3 are reported in Tables 1 and 2. The serological methods used for the latest assays are reported in Table 2 with criteria of negativity, positivity and highest IgG titer values. V3- patients were younger, with less myeloid disease than V3+ cases and had not received myeloablative conditioning. However, both V3+ and V3- groups shared similar median intervals between Allo-HSCT and V1, incidence of previous graft versus host disease (GVHD), proportions of patients under chemotherapy or immunosuppressive drugs and median lymphocyte counts at V1, suggesting similar immune status. The reasons for not receiving V3 were forgetting, refusal or surveillance after detection of the highest IgG titer at SV2. Samples from controls, all evaluated by Roche Elecsys?, showed the highest anti-spike antibody value (>250U/mL) at both SpV2 and SpV2+, suggesting a persistent response without the need of a third vaccine in this healthy population. The proportion of patients still negative at SpV2+/SpV3 was similar between V3- and V3+ patients (17% vs 12%, p=0.74). However, the proportion of patients showing a decreased/stable IgG titer between SpV2 and SpV2+/SpV3 was significantly higher for V3- cases (35% vs 4%, p=0.0001) (Table 2). Moreover, the proportion of patients with the highest IgG titer at SpV2+/SpV3 was significantly higher in the V3+ sub-group (80% vs 43%, p=0.001), even if it remained significantly lower than in controls (p=0.03). The proportion of patients showing an IgG titer increase between SpV2 and SpV2+/SpV3 was higher in V3+ vs V3- patients (24% vs 4%, p=0.06). The difference was not significant as surprisingly one V3- case showed a seroconversion without any argument for SARS-CoV-2 infection between SpV2 and SpV2+. Three patients out of 14 (21%), with a negative SpV2, showed a seroconversion after V3. Finally, with a median follow up from V1 of 106 days in V3+ patients, 138 days in V3- patients and 154 days in controls, no COVID-19 infection was documented in any participant. Conclusion This study shows the interest of a third dose of BNT162b2 anti-SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA vaccine after allograft as more patients are documented with less decrease of IgG titers and the highest IgG values after V3.

We explored the relationship between ACEs and suicidal ideation (SI) with special attention to patterns according to generation cohort (millennials: 22C37 years old, generation X: 38C53 years old, and baby boomers: 54C72 years old), and assessed the extent to which mood and anxiety disorders account for the relationship between ACEs and suicidal ideation. Patients in behavioral healthcare services of a large federally qualified health center (n = 4,392) were assessed at baseline on ACEs, SI, and mood and anxiety disorders. Logistic regression modeling was used to examine the data. Emotional neglect was the strongest predictor of SI among Millennials (OR = 1.59), Generation X (OR = 1.81), and Baby Boomers (OR = 1.88) after controlling for mood and anxiety disorders, race/ethnicity, and gender. Findings suggest ACEs predict an increased likelihood of having SI over and above the influence of mood and anxiety disorders, in models adjusted for gender and race/ethnicity. Across generations, the association with suicidal ideation was strongest for any child abuse and neglect, but not for household dysfunction. The observed association of ACEs with suicidal ideation suggests that ACEs should be considered as a risk factor and incorporated into screening assessments for suicidal ideation. Lastly, additional research on the association of ACEs and suicidality in individuals not actively being managed in behavioral healthcare settings is also warranted.","output":"Evaluating the association of adverse childhood experiences, mood and anxiety disorders, and suicidal ideation among behavioral health patients at a large federally qualified health center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The maturation of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which is the etiological agent at the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic, requires a main protease M(pro) to cleave the virus-encoded polyproteins.

Since the functional unit of M(pro) is a homodimer, the detailed knowledge of the thermodynamics of this equilibrium is a key piece of information for possible therapeutic intervention, with small molecules interfering with dimerization being potential broad-spectrum antiviral drug leads. In the present study, we exploit Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) to investigate the structural features of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) in solution as a function of protein concentration and temperature. A detailed thermodynamic picture of the monomer-dimer equilibrium is derived, together with the temperature-dependent value of the dissociation constant. SAXS is also used to study how the M(pro) dissociation process is affected by small inhibitors selected by virtual screening. We find that these inhibitors affect dimerization and enzymatic activity to a different extent and sometimes in an opposite way, likely due to the different molecular mechanisms underlying the two processes.

The present study aimed to compare the prevalence and associated factors of anxiety between high-risk and low-risk nurses 1 year after the COVID-19 outbreak, and examine the association between resilience and anxiety and its underlying mechanisms. Method: Connor-Davidson Resilience scale, Perceived Social Support Scale and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale were administrated to 701 nurses from Jiangsu Province, China, 1 year after the COVID-19 outbreak. The mediating effect was examined by Mackinnon's four-step procedure, while the moderated mediation model was tested by Hayes PROCESS macro. Results: The findings presented the prevalence of anxiety among nurses was 21.4% 1 year after the COVID-19 pandemic. High-risk nurses presented a higher prevalence of anxiety (24.5 vs. 19.3%) than low-risk nurses. Age and professional title were significantly associated with anxiety only in high-risk nurses (all P < 0.05). Perceived social support mediated the association between resilience and anxiety and the indirect effect was stronger for high-risk nurses than low-risk nurses. Conclusion: Anxiety remains prevalent among nurses 1 year after the COVID-19 outbreak, and resilience plays a protective role against anxiety.

We thus aimed to investigate changes in different training modalities in elite and amateur football players following COVID-19 lockdown in March 2020. METHODS In this cross-sectional study we applied a Likert scale-based questionnaire with 20 items to quantify and classify time spent at standard training methods in 47 professional and 54 amateur football players from 12 Austrian clubs before and during lockdown. Additionally, McLean score was calculated to assess perceived training fatigue. RESULTS Weekly amount of training time at endurance exercises (cycling) increased in both professional (37.5 [IQR 46.5] min/week vs. 187.5 [IQR 127.5] min/week, p<0.001), and amateur players (0.0 [IQR 45.0] min/week vs. 37.5 [IQR 112.5] min/week, p=0.015) during COVID-19 lockdown. Time on diverse muscle strengthening workouts was significantly elevated in both cohorts. Total training time at ball declined for professionals (from 472.5 [IQR 150] min/week to 15.0 [IQR 112.5] min/week, p<0.001) and amateurs (from 337.5 [IQR 285] min/week to 0.0 [IQR 37.5] min/week, p<0.001).

Overall McLean score remained unchanged in amateurs (p=0.42) while elite players showed a trend towards an increase (p=0.056). CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 lockdown compromised football training, especially training concepts with ball. Consequently, resulting changes in exercise loads and muscular burden might impact susceptibility for injuries and impair performances especially in amateur players, especially as they lacked training supervision and professional training plans.

Over the total observation period of 4 winter seasons, 780 children were screened with a nasal swab for the presence of viruses. Of those, 230 (29.5%) had a positive viral culture. The viruses identified were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B virus, parain-fluenza virus, coronavirus, rhinovirus, adenovirus and enterovirus. During that time, 83 epidemic events in 47 DCC were recorded. A particular virus was judged to be causally related to an epidemic if the identical virus was isolated in  3 children during the same outbreak of respiratory diseases. Thus, in 51 cases (61.4%) of all epidemics, the following viruses were responsible for an epidemic: RSV (n = 23), coronavirus (n = 10) (only during the season of 1993-1994), influenza A virus (n = 6), rhinovirus (n = 4), enterovirus (n = 4), adenovirus (n = 3) and parainfluenza virus (n = 1). Except for the somewhat surprising accumulation of coronavirus epidemics during the winter of 1993-1994, there were only minor seasonal variations from one year to another. As expected, RSV accounted for about one third of all respiratory tract infections in children attending DCCs and was therefore the most important single causative agent. These results are compared with data from children who did not attend a DCC and were cared for in a private practice. During the winter of 1989-1990, the viral epidemiological survey was performed at the same time and in parallel to a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study investigating the efficacy of OM-85 BV, an immunoactive bacterial extract. This study, enrolling 423 children attending DCCs demonstrated a protective effect of OM-85 BV in significantly reducing the risk of recurrent infections of the upper respiratory tract during the treatment period with the compound. 34% of all participating children (75 in the verum group, 70 in the placebo group) were enrolled in an additional virological study. In these patients, RSV was isolated 10 times in the placebo group, but only 5 times in the treated group (p < 0.05) and influenza A virus was present in 4 children in the placebo group, but only in 1 infant in the verum group giving a total of 14 positive virologie results in the placebo group versus 6 in the verum group (p < 0.05).

The full-length cDNA of EcIFITM3 was 737 bp, which was composed of a 16 bp 5-UTR, a 274 bp 3-UTR, and a 447 bp ORF. EcIFITM3 encodes a 148-amino-acid polypeptide, which contains five domains, i.e., the N-terminal domain (aa 1C65), TM1 (aa 66C90), the cytoplasmic domain (aa 91C110), TM2 (aa 111C140), and the C-terminal domain (aa 141C148), and shares 78% and 47% identity with IFITM3 of gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) and human (Homo sapiens), respectively. EcIFITM3 mRNA was detected in 12 tissues of healthy groupers, with the highest expression levels in the head kidney. Additionally, the in vitro mRNA levels of EcIFITM3 were significantly upregulated by infection with Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) or red spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV), or treatment with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Subcellular localization analysis showed that EcIFITM3 was mainly distributed in the cell membrane of grouper cells. In vitro, the ectopic expression of EcIFITM3 inhibited SGIV and RGNNV infection, as demonstrated by the reduced severity of the cytopathic effect, decreased virus production, and low levels of viral mRNA and proteins. Consistently, knockdown of EcIFITM3 by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) enhanced SGIV and RGNNV replication. EcIFITM3 overexpression and knockdown experiments both suggested that EcIFITM3 inhibits the infection of SGIV and RGNNV by restricting virus entry.","output":"Grouper interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) inhibits the infectivity of iridovirus and nodavirus by restricting viral entry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of the proposed review is to refer the contemporary capability of automated analytical systems, in particular batch injection analysis (BIA) in connection with electrochemical detection, for widespread applications in analytical chemistry.

In particular, it is unclear how specific the interactions are and what role is played by amino acid charge and polarity patterns. Here, we address these questions in the RNA chaperone StpA. By adapting direct coupling analysis (DCA) to treat in tandem sequences written in two alphabets, nucleotides and amino acids, we could analyze StpA-RNA interactions and show consistency with a previously proposed two-pronged mechanism: StpA disrupts specific positions in the group I intron while globally and loosely binding to the entire structure. Moreover, the interactions are strongly associated with the charge pattern: negatively charged regions in the destabilizing StpA N-terminal affect a few specific positions in the RNA, located in stems and in the pseudoknot. In contrast, positive regions in the C-terminal contain strongly coupled amino acids that promote non-specific or weakly-specific binding to the RNA.

Selected biomarkers were further explored and entered into an unsupervised longitudinal clustering machine learning algorithm to identify trends and targets that may be used for future predictive modelling efforts. RESULTS: Elevated D-dimer was the strongest contributor in distinguishing COVID-19 status; however, D-dimer was not associated with survival. Variable selection identified clot lysis time, and antigen levels of soluble thrombomodulin (sTM), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and plasminogen as biomarkers associated with death. Longitudinal multivariate k-means clustering on these biomarkers alone identified two clusters of COVID-19(+) patients: low (30%) and high (100%) mortality groups. Biomarker trajectories that characterized the high mortality cluster were higher clot lysis times (inhibited fibrinolysis), higher sTM and PAI-1 levels, and lower plasminogen levels. CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal trajectories of clot lysis time, sTM, PAI-1, and plasminogen may have predictive ability for mortality in COVID-19.","output":"Biomarkers of coagulation, endothelial function, and fibrinolysis in critically ill patients with COVID-19: A single-center prospective longitudinal study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Nurses exposed to COVID-19 could be psychologically stressed.

Method: This cross-sectional study was performed on 432 nurses in 27 hospitals working in Guilan province, north of Iran, between April 29, to May 14, 2020. Mental health and resilience were measured using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) and the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10). Hierarchical multiple linear regression model was used to identify factors associated with mental health. Results: The mean GHQ-12 and CD-RISC-10 scores were 15.72 (SD, 5.67) and 25.97 (SD, 6.88), respectively. Probable psychological distress (GHQ-12 score  15) was present in 57.2% of nurses. Among demographic and COVID-19-related variables, only educational level was significantly and negatively correlated with mental health. After controlling the variables, hierarchical regression analyses results showed that lower resilience was associated with poor mental health ( = -0.49; P < 0.001).

The exact pathophysiology is still unknown. Of the many proposed causes, an infectious or immune-mediated process seems to be the most supported.

Extant research indicates that biased reasoning and conspiracist ideation discourage vaccination. However, causal pathways from these constructs to vaccine hesitancy and refusal remain underspecified, impeding efforts to intervene and increase vaccine uptake. METHOD: 554 participants who denied prior SARS-CoV-2 vaccination completed self-report measures of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine intentions, conspiracist ideation, and constructs from the Health Belief Model of medical decision-making (such as perceived vaccine dangerousness) along with tasks measuring reasoning biases (such as those concerning data gathering behavior). Cutting-edge machine learning algorithms (Greedy Fast Causal Inference) and psychometric network analysis were used to elucidate causal pathways to (and from) vaccine intentions. RESULTS: Results indicated that a bias toward reduced data gathering during reasoning may cause paranoia, increasing the perceived dangerousness of vaccines and thereby reducing willingness to vaccinate. Existing interventions that target data gathering and paranoia therefore hold promise for encouraging vaccination. Additionally, reduced willingness to vaccinate was identified as a likely cause of belief in conspiracy theories, subverting the common assumption that the opposite causal relation exists. Finally, perceived severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection and perceived vaccine dangerousness (but not effectiveness) were potential direct causes of willingness to vaccinate, providing partial support for the Health Belief Models applicability to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine decisions. CONCLUSIONS: These insights significantly advance our understanding of the underpinnings of vaccine intentions and should scaffold efforts to prepare more effective interventions on hesitancy for deployment during future pandemics.","output":"Willingness to Vaccinate Against SARS-CoV-2: The Role of Reasoning Biases and Conspiracist Ideation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the healthcare system as it put the system under intense pressure. Family planning (FP) programs were not exempted from the disruptions caused by the health crisis. In different countries, FP programs were affected by disruptions which led to the inaccessibility of FP services. In the Philippines, the National Family Planning Program (NFPP) is being carried out to achieve universal access to FP information and services. As part of this, the program has two targets set for 2022: (1) to increase the modern contraceptive prevalence rate (mCPR) for all women to 30%;and (2) to reduce the unmet needs for modern family planning by 8%. However, difficulties and challenges concerning the implementation of the program arose due to the pandemic which led to inaccessibility and lower demand for FP services. This paper seeks to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Philippines NFPP by using quantitative and qualitative methods. Based on the trend analysis, the national total fertility rate (TFR) was decreasing before the pandemic. However, TFR for 2020 and 2021 is expected to increase. Meanwhile, there was also a projected decrease in the mCPR in 2020. Aside from this, short-term forecasts using a logarithmic trend model showed that projected mCPR in 2022 is similar to mCPR levels three years prior. This increase in fertility and decrease in the mCPR may be partially attributed to the challenges in FP implementation during the pandemic. The following were the most prominent challenges to the NFPP: (1) decrease in staffing;(2) reduction in the number of health facilities offering FP services;(3) limited mobility of clients;(4) discontinuation of demand generation activities;and (5) supply management issues. While there were responses enacted to mitigate the effect of the pandemic on the FP program, disruptions still happened which led to the decrease in the provision of FP services in the country.","output":"A Preliminary Assessment of the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the Implementation of the Philippines National Family Planning Program (NFPP) (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus Diseases-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic leads many researchers around the world to study the SARS-CoV-s2 infection and pathology to find a treatment for it.

Meanwhile, like other coronavirus infections, COVID-19 leads to the cytokine storm syndrome resulting in hyperinflammation, exacerbated immune response and multiple organ dysfunctions indicating that drugs that modulate this response, as glucocorticoids could be a treatment option. However glucocorticoids have several side effects or usage limitations. In this sense a drug with anti-inflammatory effects and capable to reduce inflammation but with less after-effects could be a powerful tool to combat COVID-19. Thus the Ac2-26 Mimetic Peptide of Annexin A1 emerges as a possible therapy.

Phagocytosis is a vital cellular mechanism in which pathogens are engulfed in a phagosome to be eliminated. Once taken inside the cell, the pathogen is subject to a cytotoxic environment inside the phagolysosome. While neutrophils are critical in suppressing the spread of infection, too much activity has been linked to tissue damage. Inflammatory lung conditions such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can occur, often leading to death. Our aim is to determine whether the rate of phagocytosis is associated with disease severity among patients with COVID-19. Methods: Neutrophils were isolated from the peripheral blood of 20 COVID-19 human subjects. Neutrophils were isolated with Polymorphoprep and mixed in a 1:1 ratio with pHrodo TM Red Staphylococcus aureus Bioparticles TM (Invitrogen) in a 96-well plate and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 6 min. Fluorescence was quantified via plate reader (Infinite M200, TECAN) every 15min for 2 hours to define the rate of phagocytosis, with excitation at 560nm and emission at 585nm. Cells were incubated at 37C with 5% CO2 in-between reads. Statistical analysis was performed via simple linear regression with detection of significant differences in slopes. Paired two-tailed non-parametric t-tests (Wilcoxon) were conducted for each time point. Results: Rates of phagocytosis were significantly higher in neutrophils from critically ill COVID-19 patients relative to neutrophils from healthy controls (487.5 versus 374.5 at 120min;p&lt;0.05 at 75, 90, 105 and 120 min). Conclusion: Despite the functional role of neutrophils in suppression of foreign pathogens, increased activity of neutrophils can lead to collateral damage and thus exacerbated lung injury. We found that neutrophils from COVID-19 patients have higher rates of phagocytosis than those from healthy subjects. These findings suggest that neutrophils circulating in COVID-19 patients have an elevated activation state and may contribute to increased severity of disease. However, the elevation in phagocytosis may also suggest that neutrophils in critically ill COVID patients are well able to phagocytose and kill pathogens which cause secondary infections in this at-risk cohort.

However, several reports have demonstrated that the prognosis of patients with pleural carcinomatosis first detected at thoracotomy is relatively favorable. The aim of this study was to describe the results of surgical intervention in NSCLC patients with pleural carcinomatosis in Japan. METHODS In 2010, the Japanese Joint Committee of Lung Cancer Registry conducted a nationwide registration of lung cancer patients who underwent surgery in 2004. Using this database, we performed a retrospective study focused on pleural carcinomatosis. We examined the clinicopathological features, the current status of therapy, and surgical outcomes in patients with pleural carcinomatosis. RESULTS Among the 11,420 registered NSCLC patients, 329 (2.9%) patients had pleural carcinomatosis. The median survival time and 5-year survival rate of 313 patients without other metastatic disease were 34.0 months and 29.3%, respectively. Primary tumor resection was performed in 256 (81.8%) patients, and macroscopic complete resection was achieved in 152 (48.6%) patients, with 5-year survival rates of 33.1% and 37.1%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (p < 0.001), best stage nodal status (p = 0.002), and the presence or absence of gross residual tumor (p = 0.013) were independent predictors of survival. CONCLUSION In our surgical registry for NSCLC, patients with pleural carcinomatosis accounted for 2.9%, and macroscopic complete resection for them was associated with better survival.","output":"Surgical Intervention for Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Patients with Pleural Carcinomatosis: Results From the Japanese Lung Cancer Registry in 2004."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Software, and software source code in particular, is widely used in modern research.

The accelerated weathering test applied consecutive steps of UV irradiation (at 340 nm and 0.76 W m-2 irradiance) and moisture at 50 C following the ASTM D4329 standard for up to 2000 h of exposure time. The morphology, chemical structure, crystallization, as well as the mechanical and thermal properties were studied. Samples were characterized after 500, 1000, and 2000 h of exposure time. Different degradation mechanisms were proposed to occur during the weathering exposure and were confirmed based on the experimental data. The PHBV surface revealed cracks and increasing roughness with the increasing exposure time, whereas the PHBV/TiO2 nanocomposites showed surface changes only after 2000 h of accelerated weathering. The degradation of neat PHBV under moisture and UV exposure occurred preferentially in the amorphous phase. In contrast, the presence of TiO2 in the nanocomposites retarded this process, but the degradation would occur simultaneously in both the amorphous and crystalline segments of the polymer after long exposure times. The thermal stability, as well as the temperature and rate of crystallization, decreased in the absence of TiO2. TiO2 not only provided UV protection, but also restricted the physical mobility of the polymer chains, acting as a nucleating agent during the crystallization process. It also slowed down the decrease in mechanical properties. The mechanical properties were shown to gradually decrease for the PHBV/TiO2 nanocomposites, whereas a sharp drop was observed for the neat PHBV after an accelerated weathering exposure. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), using the amplitude modulation-frequency modulation (AM-FM) tool, also confirmed the mechanical changes in the surface area of the PHBV and PHBV/TiO2 samples after accelerated weathering exposure.

Cytokines are key regulators of the immune response and virus clearance, and, as such, are linked to thepossibly alteredresponse to the SARS-CoV-2. They act via a family of more than 40 transmembrane receptors that are coupled to one or several of the 4 Janus kinases (JAKs) coded by the human genome, namely JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2. Once activated, JAKs act on pathways for either survival, proliferation, differentiation, immune regulation or, in the case of type I interferons, antiviral and antiproliferative effects. Studies of graft-versus-host and systemic rheumatic diseases indicated that JAK inhibitors (JAKi) exert immunosuppressive effects that are non-redundant with those of corticotherapy. Therefore, they hold the potential to cut-off pathological reactions in COVID-19. Significant clinical experience already exists with several JAKi in COVID-19, such as baricitinib, ruxolitinib, tofacitinib, and nezulcitinib, which were suggested by a meta-analysis (Patoulias et al.) to exert a benefit in terms of risk reduction concerning major outcomes when added to standard of care in patients with COVID-19. Yet, only baricitinib is recommended in first line for severe COVID-19 treatment by the WHO, as it is the only JAKi that has proven efficient to reduce mortality in individual randomized clinical trials (RCT), especially the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT-2) and COV-BARRIER phase 3 trials. As for secondary effects of JAKi treatment, the main caution with baricitinib consists in the induced immunosuppression as long-term side effects should not be an issue in patients treated for COVID-19. We discuss whether a class effect of JAKi may be emerging in COVID-19 treatment, although at the moment the convincing data are for baricitinib only. Given the key role of JAK1 in both type I IFN action and signaling by cytokines involved in pathogenic effects, establishing the precise timing of treatment will be very important in future trials, along with the control of viral replication by associating antiviral molecules.","output":"JAK inhibitors and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Community water fluoridation is a population health program that is in a unique position to equitably prevent dental caries across all socioeconomic groups.

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases were searched for publications reporting the primary outcome of the presence of viral particles in SS and secondary outcomes of indices suggesting transmission of viable virus particles in SS producing clinically important infection. All human, animal, and in vitro studies which used accepted analytic techniques for viral detection were included. A meta-analysis was not complete due to methodologic heterogeneity and inconsistent reporting of outcomes of interest. RESULTS: 23 publications addressed the presence of viral components in SS, and 19 (83%) found the presence of viral particles in SS. 21 publications additionally studied the ability of SS to induce clinically relevant infection in host cells, with 9 (43%) demonstrating potential for viral transmission. CONCLUSION: Evidence exists for viral transmission via SS. However, HPV remains the only virus with documented transmission to humans via SS. While meaningful translation into practical guidelines during the COVID pandemic remains challenging, no evidence exists to suggest increased risk in MIS.

Here we used a simple adapted N95 mask sampling method to demonstrate the impact of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants and vaccination on 92 COVID-19 patients to expel virus into the air translating to a transmission risk. Between July and September 2021, when the Delta was the dominant circulating strain in Mumbai, we noted a two-fold increase in the proportion of people expelling virus (95%), about an eighty-fold increase in median viral load and a three-fold increase in high emitter type (41%; people expelling >1000 viral copy numbers in 30 minutes) compared to initial strains of 2020. Eight percent of these patients continued to be high emitters even after eight days of symptom onset, suggesting a probable increased transmission risk for Delta strain even at this stage. There was no significant difference in expelling pattern between partial, full and un-vaccinated individuals suggesting similar transmission risk. We noted significantly more infections among vaccinated study patients and their household members than unvaccinated, probably due to increased duration from vaccination and/or increased risk behaviour upon vaccination due to lower perceived threat. This study provides biological evidence for possible continued transmission of the Delta strain even with vaccination, emphasizing the need to continue COVID-19 appropriate behaviour. The study also indicates that the mask method may be useful for screening future vaccine candidates, therapeutics or interventions for their ability to block transmission.","output":"Impact of Delta and Vaccination on SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk: Lessons for Emerging Breakthrough infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objetivo: Conocer la percepcin de las enfermeras sobre los factores que influyen en la administracin segura de medicamentos durante el periodo Covid-19, en el contexto laboral en un departamento de salud de atencin primaria del sistema nacional de salud de Espa?a.

In our renal service we reduced HD frequency from thrice to twice-weekly in selected patients with the primary aim of reducing COVID 19 exposure and transmission between HD patients. METHODS: Dialysis unit nephrologists identified 166 suitable patients (38.4% of our HD population) to temporarily convert to twice-weekly haemodialysis immediately prior to the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in our area. Changes in pre-dialysis weight, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and biochemistry were recorded weekly throughout the 4-week project. Hyperkalaemic patients (serum potassium > 6.0 mmol/L) were treated with a potassium binder, sodium bicarbonate and received responsive dietary advice. RESULTS: There were 12 deaths (5 due to COVID-19) in the HD population, 6 of which were in the twice weekly HD group; no deaths were definitively associated with change of dialysis protocol. A further 19 patients were either hospitalised and/or developed COVID-19 and thus transferred back to thrice weekly dialysis as per protocol. 113 (68.1%) were still receiving twice-weekly HD by the end of the 4-week project. Indications for transfer back to thrice weekly were; fluid overload (19), persistent hyperkalaemia (4), patient request (4) and compliance (1). There were statistically significant increases in SBP and pre-dialysis potassium during the project. CONCLUSIONS: Short term conversion of a large but selected HD population to twice-weekly dialysis sessions was possible and safe.

All studies were independently reviewed by four referees and those that included a population-based incidence of IE in patients, irrespective of age, in Europe were included. Least squares regression was used to estimate pooled temporal trends in IE incidence. RESULTS: Of 9138 articles screened, 18 studies were included in the review. Elderly men predominated in all studies. IE incidence increased 4.1% per year (95% CI 1.8% to 6.4%) in the pooled regression analysis of eight studies that included comprehensive and consistent trends data.

However, the association of such absolute prohibition of alcohol sales on population drinking, including hazardous drinking, during the COVID-19 period has not yet been determined. This study investigated changes in retrospectively recalled alcohol use and hazardous drinking pre (prior 5th August 2020), during (5th August to 3rd September 2020) and post (after 4th September) the second alcohol sales ban in Botswana. Predictors of hazardous drinking across the three time points were also investigated. METHODS: An online cross-sectional study involving a convenience sample of 1318 adults with a past 12 months drinking history in Botswana was conducted in October 2020 following a month long alcohol sales prohibition. Participants completed a modified Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C) alongside demographic questions. Participants were expected to retrospectively recall their alcohol use pre, during and post the second alcohol sales ban. RESULTS: The prevalence of alcohol use among participants with a past 12 months drinking history was 91.7% (95%CI= 90.1C93.1) before the second ban, 62.3% (95%CI= 59.7C64.9) during the second ban, and 90.4% (95%CI= 88.7C91.8) after the ban.. Hazardous drinking temporarily decreased by 30% during the second alcohol sales ban, and rose to the pre-ban levels of about 60% after the ban. Significant predictors of hazardous drinking at any of the three time points (pre, during and post the second ban) were being male (AOR ranging from 1.50 to 2.13 for all time points), earning between P3000-P6000 (AOR= 1.69 prior sales ban), being a student (AOR=0.56 during the sales ban), and being employed (AOR= 1.45 post the sales ban). CONCLUSION: The alcohol sales ban was associated with short-lived changes in alcohol consumption and hazardous drinking thereby likely contributed in providing the anticipated and much needed temporary relief to the health system sought by COVID-19 pandemic measures.","output":"Changes in retrospectively recalled alcohol use pre, during and post alcohol sales prohibition during COVID pandemic in Botswana"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Psoriasis is an immune-mediated dermatosis usually associated with comorbidities.

Many persons with active SARS-CoV-2 infection experience mild or no symptoms, presenting barriers to COVID-19 prevention. Regular temperature screening is nonetheless used in some settings, including University campuses, to reduce transmission potential. We evaluated the potential impact of this strategy using a prospective University-affiliated cohort. Methods. Between June and August 2020, 2,912 participants were enrolled and tested for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR at least once (median: 3, range: 1-9). Participants reported temperature and symptoms daily via electronic survey using a previously owned or study-provided thermometer. We assessed feasibility and acceptability of daily temperature monitoring, calculated sensitivity and specificity of various fever-based strategies for restricting campus access to reduce transmission, and estimated the association between measured temperature and SARS-CoV-2 test positivity using a longitudinal binomial mixed model. Results. Most participants (70.2%) did not initially have a thermometer for taking their temperature daily. Across 5481 total person months, the average daily completion rate of temperature values was 61.6% (IQR: 41.8%-86.2%). Sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 ranged from 0% (95% CI 0-9.7%) to 40.5% (95% CI 25.6-56.7%) across all strategies for self-report of possible COVID-19 symptoms on day of specimen collection, with corresponding specificity of 99.9% (95% CI 99.8-100%) to 95.3% (95% CI 94.7-95.9%).

OBJECTIVES To describe the impact of the WHO Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance (GAP-AMR) on antimicrobial consumption pre-pandemic and to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on antimicrobial consumption worldwide. METHODS A cross-sectional time-series analysis using a dataset of monthly purchases of antimicrobials (antibiotics, antivirals and antifungals) from August 2014 to August 2020. Antimicrobial consumption per 1000 population was assessed pre-pandemic by economic development status using linear regression models. Interventional autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models tested for significant changes with pandemic declaration (March 2020) and during its first stage from April to August 2020, worldwide and by country development status. RESULTS Prior to the pandemic, antimicrobial consumption decreased worldwide, with a greater apparent decrease in developed versus developing countries (-8.4%, P = 0.020 versus -1.2%, P = 0.660). Relative to 2019, antimicrobial consumption increased by 11.2%, P < 0.001 in March 2020. The greatest increase was for antivirals in both developed and developing countries (48.2%, P < 0.001; 110.0%, P < 0.001) followed by antibiotics (6.9%, P < 0.001; 5.9%, P = 0.003). From April to August 2020, antimicrobial consumption decreased worldwide by 18.7% (P < 0.001) compared with the previous year. Specifically, antibiotic consumption significantly decreased in both developed and developing countries (-28.0%, P < 0.001; -16.8%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The global decrease in antimicrobial consumption pre-pandemic suggests a positive impact of the WHO GAP-AMR.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: ICUs at Washington University-Barnes Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, MO. PARTICIPANTS: All consecutive patients admitted to the medical ICU and requiring mechanical ventilation from March 12, 2020, to April 21, 2020, were included. INTERVENTIONS: Tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 receptor blocker, was prescribed at the discretion of the treating physicians to patients with a clinical picture compatible with cytokine release syndrome. MEASUREMENTS: All the patients were followed to death or hospital discharge. Demographic and laboratory data were collected retrospectively from the electronic medical record. Interleukin-6 levels were measured at days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 21. Infections were divided into culture positive and culture negative (clinically suspected and treated). The main outcomes were infectious complications and interleukin-6 levels at different points in time. RESULTS: Forty-three patients with respiratory failure secondary to coronavirus disease 2019 were on mechanical ventilation during the study period. Twenty-seven (68%) were male, and 31 (72.1%) were African-American. Median Charlson score was 2 (interquartile range, 0C4). Median Pao2/Fio2 was 171.5 (122C221) on the day of mechanical ventilation initiation, and 13 patients (30.2%) required vasopressors. C-reactive protein was 142.7 (97.7C213.7), d-dimer 1,621 (559C13,434), and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-II 11 (9C15). Interleukin-6 levels at admission were 61 pg/mL (interquartile range, 28.6C439 pg/mL). Patients treated with tocilizumab had higher levels of interleukin-6 at each measurement (days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 21) compared with patients receiving standard of care. Both groups reached peak interleukin-6 levels at day 7. Administration of tocilizumab was associated with a trend toward increased risk of infection. CONCLUSIONS: Interleukin-6 levels peak at day 7 in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation and follows a similar trajectory in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation irrespective of treatment with interleukin-6R blockers. Interleukin-6 levels continued to rise in nonsurvivors, in comparison with survivors, where the rise in interleukin-6 levels was followed by a decline.","output":"Interleukin-6 Trajectory and Secondary Infections in Mechanically Ventilated Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Treated With Interleukin-6 Receptor Blocker"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Failure to incorporate the beliefs and attitudes of the public into theoretical models of preparedness has been identified as a weakness in strategies to mitigate infectious disease outbreaks. We administered a cross-sectional telephone survey to a representative sample (n = 443) of the Swedish adult population to examine whether self-reported intentions to improve personal hygiene and increase social distancing during influenza outbreaks could be explained by trust in official information, self-reported health (SF-8), sociodemographic factors, and determinants postulated in protection motivation theory, namely threat appraisal and coping appraisal. The interviewees were asked to make their appraisals for two scenarios: a) an influenza with low case fatality and mild lifestyle impact; b) severe influenza with high case fatality and serious disturbances of societal functions. Every second respondent (50.0%) reported high trust in official information about influenza. The proportion that reported intentions to take deliberate actions to improve personal hygiene during outbreaks ranged between 45C85%, while less than 25% said that they intended to increase social distancing. Multiple logistic regression models with coping appraisal as the explanatory factor most frequently contributing to the explanation of the variance in intentions showed strong discriminatory performance for staying home while not ill (mild outbreaks: Area under the curve [AUC] 0.85 (95% confidence interval 0.82;0.89), severe outbreaks AUC 0.82 (95% CI 0.77;0.85)) and acceptable performance with regard to avoiding public transportation (AUC 0.78 (0.74;0.82), AUC 0.77 (0.72;0.82)), using handwash products (AUC 0.70 (0.65;0.75), AUC 0.76 (0.71;0.80)), and frequently washing hands (AUC 0.71 (0.66;0.76), AUC 0.75 (0.71;0.80)). We conclude that coping appraisal was the explanatory factor most frequently included in statistical models explaining self-reported intentions to carry out non-pharmaceutical health actions in the Swedish outlined context, and that variations in threat appraisal played a smaller role in these models despite scientific uncertainties surrounding a recent mass vaccination campaign.","output":"Intentions to Perform Non-Pharmaceutical Protective Behaviors during Influenza Outbreaks in Sweden: A Cross-Sectional Study following a Mass Vaccination Campaign"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The formation of inhibitory antibodies directed against coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) is a severe complication in the treatment of hemophilia A patients. The induction of anti-FVIII antibodies is a CD4(+) T cell-dependent process. Activation of FVIII-specific CD4(+) T cells is dependent on the presentation of FVIII-derived peptides on MHC class II by antigen-presenting cells. Previously, we have shown that FVIII-pulsed human monocyte-derived dendritic cells can present peptides from several FVIII domains. In this study we show that FVIII peptides are presented on immature as well as mature dendritic cells. In immature dendritic cells half of the FVIII-loaded MHC class II molecules are retained within the cell, whereas in LPS-matured dendritic cells the majority of MHC class II/peptide complexes is present on the plasma membrane. Time-course studies revealed that presentation of FVIII-derived peptides was optimal between 12 and 24 hours after maturation but persisted for at least 96 hours. We also show that macrophages are able to internalize FVIII as efficiently as dendritic cells, however FVIII was presented on MHC class II with a lower efficiency and with different epitopes compared to dendritic cells. In total, 48 FVIII core-peptides were identified using a DCs derived of 8 different donors. Five HLA-promiscuous FVIII peptide regions were found C these were presented by at least 4 out of 8 donors. The remaining 42 peptide core regions in FVIII were presented by DCs derived from a single (30 peptides) or two to three donors (12 peptides). Overall, our findings show that a broad repertoire of FVIII peptides can be presented on HLA-DR.","output":"Limited Promiscuity of HLA-DRB1 Presented Peptides Derived of Blood Coagulation Factor VIII"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Symptoms of serious mental illness are multidimensional and often interact in complex ways. Generative models offer value in elucidating the underlying relationships that characterise these networks of symptoms. AIMS: In this paper we use generative models to find unique interactions of schizophrenia symptoms as experienced on a moment-by-moment basis. METHOD: Self-reported mood, anxiety and psychosis symptoms, self-reported measurements of sleep quality and social function, cognitive assessment, and smartphone touch screen data from two assessments modelled after the Trail Making A and B tests were collected with a digital phenotyping app for 47 patients in active treatment for schizophrenia over a 90-day period. Patients were retrospectively divided up into various non-exclusive subgroups based on measurements of depression, anxiety, sleep duration, cognition and psychosis symptoms taken in the clinic. Associated transition probabilities for the patient cohort and for the clinical subgroups were calculated using state transitions between adjacent 3-day timesteps of pairwise survey domains. RESULTS: The three highest probabilities for associated transitions across all patients were anxiety-inducing mood (0.357, P < 0.001), psychosis-inducing mood (0.276, P < 0.001), and anxiety-inducing poor sleep (0.268, P < 0.001). These transition probabilities were compared against a validation set of 17 patients from a pilot study, and no significant differences were found. Unique symptom networks were found for clinical subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Using a generative model using digital phenotyping data, we show that certain symptoms of schizophrenia may play a role in elevating other schizophrenia symptoms in future timesteps. Symptom networks show that it is feasible to create clinically interpretable models that reflect the unique symptom interactions of psychosis-spectrum illness. These results offer a framework for researchers capturing temporal dynamics, for clinicians seeking to move towards preventative care, and for patients to better understand their lived experience.","output":"Deriving symptom networks from digital phenotyping data in serious mental illness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This brief comment aims to discuss some errors of the Brazilian government in combating the pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 in contributing to the expansion of knowledge not only about what should be done by governments, but also about what should not be done in coping with the health crisis.

With adults, humidification and actual FIO2 are known to vary according to inspiratory and HFNC gas flow, tidal volume (VT), and ambient temperature. There have been few studies focused on humidification and FIO2 in HFNC settings for neonates/infants, so we performed a bench study to investigate the influence of gas flow, ambient temperature, and respiratory parameters on humidification and actual FIO2 in a neonate/infant simulation. METHODS HFNC gas flow was set at 3, 5, and 7 L/min, and FIO2 was set at 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7. Spontaneous breathing was simulated using a 2-bellows-in-a-box model of a neonate lung. Tests were conducted with VT settings of 20, 30, and 40 mL and breathing frequencies of 20 and 30 breaths/min. Inspiratory time was 0.8 s with decelerating flow waveform. The HFNC tube was placed in an incubator, which was either set at 37C or turned off. Absolute humidity (AH) and actual FIO2 were measured for 1 min using a hygrometer and an oxygen analyzer, and data for the final 3 breaths were extracted. RESULTS At all settings, when the incubator was turned on, AH was greater than when it was turned off (P < .001). When the incubator was turned off, as gas flow increased, AH increased (P < .001); however, VT did not affect AH (P = .16). As gas flow increased, actual FIO2 more closely corresponded to set FIO2 . When gas flow was 3 L/min, measured FIO2 decreased proportionally more at each FIO2 setting increment (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AH was affected by ambient temperature and HFNC gas flow. Actual FIO2 depended on VT when gas flow was 3 L/min.","output":"Humidity and Inspired Oxygen Concentration During High-Flow Nasal Cannula Therapy in Neonatal and Infant Lung Models."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The economic resilience - the flexibility of the economy and also the capability of resistance to shocks - is a central category of European reform processes.

Fifty-six participants who received ChAdOx1 and forty-two participants who received BNT162b2 were enrolled into this study, which evaluated immune responses, including anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike total antibodies (Elecsys(?)), surrogated viral neutralization test (sVNT) to ancestral strain (cPass?; GenScript), five variants of concern (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron) (Luminex; multiplex sVNT) and the ELISpot with spike (S1 and S2) peptide pool against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain. The samples were analyzed at baseline, 4, and 12 weeks after primary immunization, as well as 4 and 12 weeks after receiving the booster. This study showed a significant increase in anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike total antibodies, sVNT, and T-cell immune response after the booster, including against the Omicron variant. Immune responses rapidly decreased in the booster group at 12 weeks after booster but were still higher than post-primary vaccination.

A sample of 1172 individuals (mean age = 22.9 years, 54.5% females) participated in the online survey. Correlation analysis revealed that preventive health behavior has a positive relationship with fear of COVID-19 and post-traumatic stress symptomology but a negative relationship with psychological distress. Further analysis indicated that post-traumatic stress symptomology and psychological distress mediated the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and preventive health behavior. Post-traumatic stress symptomology caused by the fear of COVID-19 could contribute to improving preventive health behavior while psychological distress caused by the fear of COVID-19 tends to hinder preventive health behavior.

METHODS: Clinical data of 12 patients with COVID-19 admitted to Shantou Central Hospital from January 23 to February 5 in 2020 were retrospectively analyzed, including gender, age, symptoms, lab test and clinical outcomes, to analyze the change trend of blood Na+ level in the patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Among the 12 patients with COVID-19, there were 8 males and 4 females with the mean age of (38.016.3) years old, most of them were admitted to the hospital with cough and/or fever. All patients had a positive nucleic acid test for 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and were discharged after clinical treatment with oxygen therapy, antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and nutritional support. All patients were of ordinary type when they were admitted to the hospital. Among them, 1 patient turned into a severe case during the course of the disease, and 1 patient showed a tendency to become severe case. It was found that 10 patients without severe conversion had an average blood Na+ of (138.31.3) mmol/L at admission, and the lowest blood Na+ during the course of disease was (135.93.1) mmol/L. However, 2 patients who became severe and had a tendency to become severe disease (Na+ levels at admission were 140.0 mmol/L and 138.0 mmol/L, respectively) experienced hyponatremia during the course of the disease (the lowest blood Na+ levels were 129.0 mmol/L and 122.0 mmol/L). Further analysis showed that the lower serum Na+ level, the higher level of white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP), but serum Na+ level was consistent with the change trend of lymphocytes, suggesting that hyponatremia was closely correlated with severe inflammation reaction. CONCLUSIONS: Serum Na+ showed decreasing tendency during the development of COVID-19, and hyponatremia was closely related to the severity of COVID-19. It was necessary to pay great attention to the change trend of blood Na+ level.

Multivariable analysis examined the effects of sleep and dietary changes, COVID-19 exposure, anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2), and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-2) on employment status and job changes. Respondents' open-ended descriptions of pandemic-related changes in employment were analyzed using the constant comparative method. RESULTS: Two-thirds (65%) were employed, only 4% became unemployed, and 29% reported changes in their jobs as a result of the pandemic. In logistic regression analysis controlling for age, race, education and gender, workers were more likely than nonworkers to report altered eating and sleeping habits, but not greater anxiety or depression. However, those whose jobs changed were more likely to report COVID-19 exposure, altered sleep patterns, clinically significant anxiety symptoms, and both anxiety and depressive symptoms compared to those whose jobs had not changed. Qualitative analysis revealed work's positive impact (pride in job performance, using new skills, feeling safer working from home) and its negative effects (lifestyle disruption, worry about job security, isolation from coworkers).

It is associated with different clinical manifestations and a high mortality rate. Predicting mortality and identifying outcome predictors are crucial for COVID patients who are critically ill. Multivariate and machine learning methods may be used for developing prediction models and reduce the complexity of clinical phenotypes. METHODS: Multivariate predictive analysis was applied to 108 out of 250 clinical features, comorbidities, and blood markers captured at the admission time from a hospitalized cohort of patients (N = 250) with COVID-19. Inspired modification of partial least square (SIMPLS)-based model was developed to predict hospital mortality. Prediction accuracy was randomly assigned to training and validation sets. Predictive partition analysis was performed to obtain cutting value for either continuous or categorical variables. Latent class analysis (LCA) was carried to cluster the patients with COVID-19 to identify low- and high-risk patients. Principal component analysis and LCA were used to find a subgroup of survivors that tends to die. RESULTS: SIMPLS-based model was able to predict hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 with moderate predictive power (Q(2) = 0.24) and high accuracy (AUC > 0.85) through separating non-survivors from survivors developed using training and validation sets. This model was obtained by the 18 clinical and comorbidities predictors and 3 blood biochemical markers. Coronary artery disease, diabetes, Altered Mental Status, age > 65, and dementia were the topmost differentiating mortality predictors. CRP, prothrombin, and lactate were the most differentiating biochemical markers in the mortality prediction model. Clustering analysis identified high- and low-risk patients among COVID-19 survivors. CONCLUSIONS: An accurate COVID-19 mortality prediction model among hospitalized patients based on the clinical features and comorbidities may play a beneficial role in the clinical setting to better management of patients with COVID-19.

Group assignments were dictated by COVID restrictions on each of our three medical school campuses: Salina, Wichita, and Kansas City. Pre- and post-surveys with a 14-question multiple-choice assessment of surgical knowledge were distributed to participants. Paired Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests and Mann-Whitney-U tests were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: There were 14 participants in Group A and 7 participants in Group B. Both groups improved significantly from pre- to post-assessment score. (Group A, p = 0.01; Group B, p = 0.04). There was no difference between groups in the magnitude of score improvement from pre- to post-assessment (p = 0.59). CONCLUSIONS: This pilot program demonstrated that virtual platforms can be a method to provide meaningful clinical experiences in surgery to preclinical medical students restricted from clinical activities. Further development of mentorship in virtual surgical programs and assessment of subjective experience is needed.","output":"Is a Video Worth a Thousand Words?

Patients with substance use disorders (SUD) have long and costly hospitalisations and higher readmission rates compared to those without SUD. Hospitalisation presents an opportunity to diagnose and treat individuals with SUD and connect them to ongoing care. However, SUD care often remains unaddressed by hospital providers due to lack of a systems approach and addiction medicine knowledge, and is compounded by stigma. We present a blueprint to launching an interprofessional inpatient addiction care team embedded in the hospital medicine division of an urban, safety-net integrated health system. We describe key factors for successful implementation including: (1) demonstrating the scope and impact of SUD in our health system via a needs assessment; (2) aligning improvement areas with health system leadership priorities; (3) involving executive leadership to create goal and initiative alignment; and (4) obtaining seed funding for a pilot programme from our Medicaid health plan partner.

Increasingly, donors prefer to direct their funds through international non-governmental organizations instead of direct donations to the State budget. In the current climate of increased emphasis on health system strengthening, a strong and stable partnership between government and international non-governmental organizations is pivotal for health system strengthening in Mozambique. METHODS: the study evaluates the current partnership through a standardized survey to healthcare workers employed by international non-governmental organizations in health (INGO, private) and the ministry of health (MOH, public). Results of the survey have been analyzed only descriptively and no statistical evaluations have been performed. RESULTS: out of the valid 109 responses obtained 55.1% were from MOH cadres and 45.0% from INGO cadres. Most have been in the health sector for more than 5 years. Most of the respondents recognize that INGOs assist the government in strengthening the health system (71.6%), see the internal brain drain to INGOs and salary scale difference as major problems (70.6% and 78.0%); 87.2% reported that the coordination between INGOs and government needs to be improved. MOH cadres perceived the migration of cadres to INGOs and the need for improving coordination as major issues more acutely than their INGO counterparts (80.0% vs. 59.2% and 88.3% vs. 85.7% respectively). INGOs were perceived to offer better quality health services by 51.4% of respondents (of these 69.4% were INGO respondents). The quality of health services was alike between INGOs and MOH for 33% of the respondents. CONCLUSION: through the various efforts outlined the MOH and INGOs are moving towards an environment of mutual accountability, joint planning and coordination as well as harmonization of activities; but there are still challenges to be addressed. Prioritization and increased funding of the planning unit and planning and cooperation directorate as well as strategies for workforce retention are urgently needed.","output":"Evaluation of the partnership between international non-governmental organizations and the State in the health sector in Mozambique"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 1964, Korlipara travelled to London from India for the first time and boldly walked into the office of the medical director at Guys Hospital and asked him for a job Alongside his GP work, he maintained his interest in cardiology by working as an associate specialist at Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester, where he was also cofounder, president, and fundraiser for the New Heart New Start appeal, raising vital funds for patients in need of transplants Despite, or perhaps because of, controversies surrounding the GMCrevalidation, the Shipman report, international medical graduates, to name but threethere was surprisingly little dissent within the council itself, and Krishna was a valuable aid in providing inside information to the press and public that allowed some light into otherwise opaque discussions","output":"Krishna Korlipara: founder of the National Association of GP Cooperatives and longest serving elected member of the GMC"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The battle against SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is the focal point for the global pandemic that has affected millions of lives worldwide.

Influenza disease presents as a relatively mild and self-limiting although highly pathogenic forms exist. Neutrophils increase in the respiratory tract during infection with mild seasonal IAV, moderate and severe epidemic IAV infection, and emerging highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). During severe influenza pneumonia and HPAI infection, the number of neutrophils in the lower respiratory tract is correlated with disease severity.

NE has an incidence in the range of 2.5 to 3.5 per 1000 live births carrying a considerable burden for neurological outcomes such as epilepsy, cerebral palsy, cognitive impairments, and hydrocephaly. Many scoring systems based on different risk factor combinations in regression models have been proposed to predict abnormal outcomes. Birthweight, gestational age, Apgar scores, pH, ultrasound and MRI biomarkers, seizures onset, EEG pattern, and seizure duration were the most referred predictors in the literature. Our study proposes a decision-tree approach based on clinical risk factors for abnormal outcomes in newborns with the neurological syndrome to assist in neonatal encephalopathy prognosis as a complementary tool to the acknowledged scoring systems. We retrospectively studied 188 newborns with associated encephalopathy and seizures in the perinatal period. Etiology and abnormal outcomes were assessed through correlations with the risk factors. We computed mean, median, odds ratios values for birth weight, gestational age, 1-min Apgar Score, 5-min Apgar score, seizures onset, and seizures duration monitoring, applying standard statistical methods first. Subsequently, CART (classification and regression trees) and cluster analysis were employed, further adjusting the medians. Out of 188 cases, 84 were associated to abnormal outcomes. The hierarchy on etiology frequencies was dominated by cerebrovascular impairments, metabolic anomalies, and infections. Both preterms and full-terms at risk were bundled in specific categories defined as high-risk 75C100%, intermediate risk 52.9%, and low risk 0C25% after CART algorithm implementation. Cluster analysis illustrated the median values, profiling at a glance the preterm model in high-risk groups and a full-term model in the inter-mediate-risk category.

The objective of this study was to support business educators' and students' mental health against coronavirus trauma using trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT). METHODS: The participants (na=a74 - educators and students) who indicated PTSD symptoms based on the self-reporting questionnaire they filled, were randomly assigned to treatment and waitlist control groups. The TF-CBT manual was used for the intervention. The intervention was a 14-week treatment with 2aweeks follow-up meeting. Using repeated measures of Analysis of Variance, we determined the level of improvement of each participant in the treatment group against Coronavirus trauma at the end of the intervention. RESULTS: The study established that gender has no significant difference in determining the effects of Coronavirus trauma on participants. Through intervention, the PTSDs and depression arising from Coronavirus event were significantly reduced in the treatment group. Again, there was a significant improvement in the participants' general mental health at the end of the intervention. Hence, we established the implication for research and practice in line with the outcome of the study. The study advocates that TF-CBT should be employed by educational institutions in Nigeria to cushion the traumatic effects of coronavirus and future disasters on both workers and students. CONCLUSION: We conclude that mental health problems remain a serious challenge among business educators and students in this COVID-19 pandemic era. The study established that low educational qualifications, PTSD symptoms and negative coping strategies are the factors aggravating the general low mental health of the study participants. Finally, we advocate that the educational institutions in Nigeria should adopt TF-CBT interventions to support staff and students' mental health against adverse effects of COVID-19.","output":"Supporting business educators and students against COVID-19 trauma using trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Owing to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic and emerging data regarding immunosuppressant therapies for inflammatory cutaneous diseases, dermatologists are being encouraged to reevaluate their patients' treatment regimens to minimize any potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

There are however a growing number of female gamers and we need to learn more about how gender affects gaming. The aim of this study is to both quantify gaming among Norwegian adolescents and explore how gender differences are perceived. A mixed method approach was used to capture gaming experiences among boys and girls. Survey data (N = 5607) was analyzed descriptively, and five focus groups were conducted, applying thematic analysis. Statistics showed that boys from the age of 14 use video games up to 5 times more than girls, while girls are much more on social media. From the focus groups, we found that boys did not view social media as socially significant as gaming and that there is a greater social acceptance of gaming among boys than among girls. Gender differences in video gaming are not necessarily a problem per se, as they may reflect gender-specific motivations and interests. However, the study also finds that girls feel less encouraged than boys to play video games due to different gender-related experiences of video gaming. Therefore, gendered barriers in video gaming must be explored in future research.","output":"Are There Differences in Video Gaming and Use of Social Media among Boys and Girls?-A Mixed Methods Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Melatonin is a pleotropic molecule with numerous biological activities.

However, such a vaccine is not available yet although extensive amounts of resources in research and development have been invested over three decades. In light of the recently approved Ebola virus disease vaccine based on a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV-ZEBOV), we present the results of our work on three novel VSV-vectored HIV vaccine candidates.

Patients who could not come to the hospital pharmacy department were provided with a delivery service to the community pharmacy of their choice. RESULTS: A total of 1186 patients requested this service. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents were the most in-demand medication, followed by rheumatoid arthritis and antiretroviral drugs. 125 patients responded to the telephone survey, most of whom stated that they would use the delivery service again, and expressed their desire to continue doing so. DISCUSSION: Without a doubt, telepharmacy and medication delivery services have provided multiple benefits during home quarantine. The delivery service enabled us to provide drugs to patients in their immediate environment through a service that was free for both the patient and the hospital pharmacy service. However, at present, the available evidence of the impact of telepharmacy models is sparse. CONCLUSIONS: This medication delivery service has provided multiple benefits to patients during home quarantine.

However, the development of LAIV has traditionally relied on empirical methods, such as the adaptation of viruses to replicate at low temperatures. These approaches require an extensive investment of time and resources before identifying potential vaccine candidates that can be safely implemented as LAIV to protect humans. In addition, the mechanism of attenuation of these vaccines is poorly understood in some cases. Importantly, LAIV are more efficacious than inactivated vaccines because their ability to mount efficient innate and adaptive humoral and cellular immune responses. Therefore, the design of potential LAIV based on known properties of viral proteins appears to be a highly appropriate option for the treatment of influenza viral infections. For that, the viral RNA synthesis machinery has been a research focus to identify key amino acid substitutions that can lead to viral attenuation and their use in safe, immunogenic, and protective LAIV.

We identified the curricular components of an internal medicine (IM) clerkship that would be compromised if students learned solely from online didactics, case studies, and simulations (i.e., prerounding, oral presentations, diagnostic reasoning, and medical management discussions). Using these guiding principles, we created a virtual rounds (VR) curriculum to provide IM clerkship students with clinical exposure during a virtual learning period. METHODS: Held three times a week for 2 weeks, VR consisted of three curricular components. First, clerkship students prerounded on an assigned hospitalized patient by remotely accessing the electronic health record and calling into hospital rounds. Second, each student prepared an oral presentation on their assigned patient. Third, using videoconferencing, students delivered these oral presentations to telemedicine VR small groups consisting of three to four students and three tele-instructors. Tele-instructors then provided feedback on oral presentations and taught clinical concepts. We assessed the effectiveness of VR by anonymously surveying students and tele-instructors. RESULTS: Twenty-nine students and 34 volunteer tele-instructors participated in VR over four blocks. A majority of students felt VR improved their prerounding abilities (86%), oral presentation abilities (93%), and clinical reasoning skills (62%). All students found small group to be useful. DISCUSSION: VR allowed students to practice rounding skills in a supportive team-based setting.

Paediatric services in particular required adjustment, not only for the paediatric patients but also for their carers and the staff looking after them. Strategies were divided into streams, including the impact of COVID-19 on the hospital and the role of RCWMCH in Western Cape Province, communication strategies, adaptation of clinical services at the hospital, specifically with a paediatric-friendly approach, and staff engagement. Interventions utilised: (i) Specific COVID-19 planning was required at a children's hospital, and lessons were learnt from other international children's hospitals. A similar number of patients and staff were infected by the virus (244 patients and 212 staff members by 21 December 2020). (ii) Measures were put in place to assist creation of capacity at metro hospitals' adult services by accepting children with emergency issues directly to RCWMCH, as well as accepting adolescents up to age 18 years. (iii) The communication strategy was improved to include daily engagement with heads of departments/supervisors by earlymorning structured information meetings. There were also changes in the methods of communication with staff using media such as Zoom, MS Teams and WhatsApp. Hospital-wide information and discussion sessions were held both on social platforms and in the form of smallgroup physical meetings with senior hospital administrators (with appropriate distancing). Labour union representatives were purposefully directly engaged to assess concerns. (iv) Clinical services at the hospital were adapted. These included paediatric-friendly services and physical changes to the hospital environment. (v) Staff engagement was particularly important to assist in allaying staff anxiety, developing a staff screening programme, and provision and training in use of personal protective equipment, as well as focusing on staff wellness. In conclusion, visible management and leadership has allowed for flexibility and adaptability to manage clinical services in various contexts. It is important to utilise staff in different roles during a crisis and to consider the different perspectives of people involved in the services. The key to success, that included very early adoption of the above measures, has been hospital staff taking initiative, searching for answers and identifying and implementing solutions, effective communication, and leadership support.

In both the 50 []g and 100 []g dose groups, a more pronounced response was observed in the younger versus the older age group on Day 15 (2.49-fold and 3.94-fold higher GMC, respectively) and Day 43 (1.35-fold and 1.50-fold higher GMC). Few subjects had a previous or concomitant natural SARS-CoV-2-infection (n=8). Vaccination of pre-infected individuals boosted the immune response to very high ACOV2S results compared to infection-naive vaccine recipients. ACOV2S measurements were strongly correlated with those from the live microneutralization assay (Pearson's r=0.779; p<0.0001) and good qualitative agreement was achieved (100% positive and 91.8% negative percentage agreement; 90.0% positive and 100% negative predictive value). Conclusion: The results from this study confirmed that ACOV2S is a highly valuable assay for the tracking of vaccine-related immune responses. Combined application with ACOV2N enables serologic monitoring for breakthrough infection or stratification of previous natively-infected individuals. The adaptive measuring range and high resolution of ACOV2S allows for the early identification of seroconversion as well as for resolution of very high titers and detection of longitudinal differences between age and dose groups. Additionally, good correlation of ACOV2S with live virus microneutralization indicates the utility of ACOV2S as a reliable estimate of neutralization capacity in routine diagnostic settings.","output":"Quantifying the vaccine-induced humoral immune response to spike-receptor binding domain as a surrogate for neutralization testing following mRNA-1273 (Spikevax) vaccination against COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Voriconazole is one of the first-line therapies for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.

Six weeks prior to evaluation, the patient had reported developing a rash 2 weeks after receiving the first dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (BNT162b2 mRNA, Pfizer, Inc). His primary care provider treated the rash with corticosteroids, leading to partial improvement of the skin lesions. Three weeks after the first vaccine injection, the patient received his scheduled second vaccine injection. Within 2 days, the rash reappeared. This time, the lesions were more severe in nature. Skin biopsy revealed immunoglobulin A (IgA)-dominant leukocytoclastic vasculitis. After the patient completed 2 weeks of oral corticosteroids, urinalysis revealed proteinuria, and consultation with nephrology was requested. On examination, healing papules were noted on his legs. Serum creatinine 2 weeks after the second dose of vaccine was 0.9 mg/dL. Microscopic examination of the urinary sediment revealed acanthocytes. Urine protein to creatinine ratio 3 weeks after the second dose of vaccine was 1.1 g/day. Serum complements were normal, and all pertinent serology was negative. Kidney biopsy findings were consistent with IgA nephropathy.

A structured questionnaire developed by the World Health Organization was administered online to all participants inquiring about a wide range of measures and practices employed at health facility level for an effective IPC approach. Fishers exact test was used to assess potential urban-rural differences in the distribution of characteristics regarding IPC aspects reported by survey participants. Results: About 47% of health facilities did not have a designated focal point for IPC issues;the lack of one patient per bed standard was evident in more than one-third of health facilities (37%);and the lack of an adequate distance between patient beds was reported in a quarter of health facilities (which was twice as high among health facilities in urban areas compared to rural areas). Furthermore, water services were always available only in about two-thirds of health facilities (63%), whereas an adequate number of toilets (at least two) was evident in slightly more than half of the health facilities surveyed (53%). Also, one out of four of the health facilities did not have functional hand hygiene stations and/or sufficient energy/power supply. A completely adequate ventilation was evidenced in slightly more than half of the health facilities (51%).

Until now, the secondary impact of COVID-19 has been little estimated. Our aim was to investigate factors underlying quality of life (QOL) during COVID-19 lockdown among a healthy population, while QOL reduction expands vulnerability to the pandemic secondary impact. METHODS: During the spring lockdown in Israel, 571 healthy adults completed a survey that included standard measurements for psychological distress, participation in daily life activities, a sense of social connectedness, resilience, and QOL. RESULTS: We found a high level of psychological distress, significant reduction in participation dimensions, and in QOL (psychical, psychological, and social). These indices were even lower among women, younger adults, and the unemployed. Path analysis demonstrated that psychological distress, participation dimensions, social connectedness, and self-efficacy explained QOL, while participation dimensions were found to be the mediators. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 has had a wide impact on the general population, with the potential for negative secondary impacts. Women, young adults, and the unemployed are at high risk for secondary effects.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Service (CMS) Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock Bundle (SEP-1) is an evidence-based early management bundle focused on improving sepsis outcomes. It is unknown which quality improvement (QI) practices are associated with SEP-1 compliance and if those practices reduce sepsis mortality. The objectives of this study were to compare sepsis QI practices in SEP-1 reporting and non-reporting hospitals and to measure the association between specific elements of sepsis QI processes and SEP-1 performance and hospital-specific risk-adjusted sepsis mortality. Design, Setting, and Patients: This mixed methods study linked telephone survey data on QI practices from Iowa hospitals to SEP-1 performance data and risk-adjusted mortality from statewide all-payer administrative claims database. The survey assessed sepsis QI practices in eight categories. Characteristics of hospitals and sepsis QI practices were compared by SEP-1 reporting status. Univariable and multivariable logistic and linear regression estimated the association of QI practices with hospital SEP-1 performance and observed-to-expected sepsis mortality ratios. Interventions: None Measurements and Main Results: All 118 Iowa hospitals completed the survey (100% response rate). SEP-1 reporting hospitals were more likely to have sepsis QI practices, including reporting sepsis quality to providers (64% vs. 38%, p = 0.026) and using the case review process to develop sepsis care plans (87% vs. 64%, p = 0.013). Sepsis QI practices were not associated with increased SEP-1 scores. Two were associated with reduced mortality: having a sepsis committee B= -0.11, p = 0.036) and using case review results for sepsis care plans (B= -0.10, p = 0.049). Conclusions: Hospitals reporting SEP-1 compliance to CMS conduct more sepsis QI practices. Most QI practices are not associated with increased SEP-1 performance or decreased sepsis mortality. Future work could explore how to implement these performance improvement practices in hospitals not reporting SEP-1 compliance.","output":"Hospitals That Report Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock Bundle (SEP-1) Compliance Have More Structured Sepsis Performance Improvement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the first severe new infectious disease of this millennium, caused widespread public disruption.

To clarify the role of HCQ in Covid-19 patients, we carried out a retrospective observational study of 4,396 unselected patients hospitalized for Covid-19 in Italy (FebruaryCMay 2020). Patients' characteristics were collected at entry, including age, sex, obesity, smoking status, blood parameters, history of diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular and chronic pulmonary diseases, and medications in use. These were used to identify subtypes of patients with similar characteristics through hierarchical clustering based on Gower distance. Using multivariable Cox regressions, these clusters were then tested for association with mortality and modification of effect by treatment with HCQ. We identified two clusters, one of 3,913 younger patients with lower circulating inflammation levels and better renal function, and one of 483 generally older and more comorbid subjects, more prevalently men and smokers. The latter group was at increased death risk adjusted by HCQ (HR[CI95%] = 3.80[3.08-4.67]), while HCQ showed an independent inverse association (0.51[0.43-0.61]), as well as a significant influence of cluster?HCQ interaction (p < 0.001). This was driven by a differential association of HCQ with mortality between the high (0.89[0.65-1.22]) and the low risk cluster (0.46[0.39-0.54]). These effects survived adjustments for additional medications in use and were concordant with associations with disease severity and outcome. These findings suggest a particularly beneficial effect of HCQ within low risk Covid-19 patients and may contribute to clarifying the current controversy on HCQ efficacy in Covid-19 treatment.","output":"Disentangling the Association of Hydroxychloroquine Treatment with Mortality in Covid-19 Hospitalized Patients through Hierarchical Clustering"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A female in her late 40s presented to the emergency department during the COVID-19 pandemic with shortness of breath, fever and productive cough following a recent diagnosis of bilateral non-massive pulmonary emboli.

We undertook a systematic review of all published case reports and series to analyse the types of air leaks in COVID-19 and their outcomes. METHODS: The literature search from PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar databases was performed from the start of the pandemic till 31 March 2021. The inclusion criteria were case reports or series on (1) laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, (2) with the individual patient details, and (3) reported diagnosis of one or more air leak syndrome (pneumothorax, subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum, pneumoperitoneum, pneumopericardium). RESULTS: A total of 105 studies with 188 patients were included in the final analysis. The median age was 56.02 (SD 15.53) years, 80% males, 11% had previous respiratory disease, and 8% were smokers. Severe or critical COVID-19 was present in 50.6% of the patients. Pneumothorax (68%) was the most common type of air leak. Most patients (56.7%) required intervention with lower mortality (29.1% vs. 44.1%, p = 0.07) and intercostal drain (95.9%) was the preferred interventional management. More than half of the patients developed air leak on spontaneous breathing. The mortality was significantly higher in patients who developed air leak with positive pressure ventilation (49%, p < 0.001) and required escalation of respiratory support (39%, p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Air leak in COVID-19 can occur spontaneously without positive pressure ventilation, higher transpulmonary pressures, and other risk factors like previous respiratory disease or smoking.

The diagnosis of COVID-19 is done by quantitative reverse-transcription polymer chain reaction (qRT-PCR) testing which utilizes different primer-probe sets depending on the assay used. Using in silico analysis we aimed to determine how the secondary structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome affects the interaction between the reverse primer during qRT-PCR and how it relates to the experimental primer-probe test efficiencies. We introduce the program DinoKnot (Duplex Interaction of Nucleic acids with pseudoKnots) that follows the hierarchical folding hypothesis to predict the secondary structure of two interacting nucleic acid strands (DNA/RNA) of similar or different type. DinoKnot is the first program that utilizes stable stems in both strands as a guide to find the structure of their interaction. Using DinoKnot we predicted the interaction of the reverse primers used in four common COVID-19 qRT-PCR tests with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome. In addition, we predicted how 12 mutations in the primer/probe binding region may affect the primer/probe ability and subsequent SARS-CoV-2 detection. While we found all reverse primers are capable of interacting with their target area, we identified partial mismatching between the SARS-CoV-2 genome and some reverse primers. We predicted three mutations that may prevent primer binding, reducing the ability for SARS-CoV-2 detection. We believe our contributions can aid in the design of a more sensitive SARS-CoV-2 test. Author summary The current testing for the disease COVID-19 that is caused by the novel cornonavirus SARS-CoV-2 uses oligonucleotides called primers that bind to specific target regions on the SARS-CoV-2 genome to detect the virus. Our goal was to use computational tools to predict how the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome affects the ability of the primers to bind to their target region. We introduce the program DinoKnot (Duplex interaction of nucleic acids with pseudoknots) that is able to predict the interactions between two DNA or RNA molecules. We used DinoKnot to predict the efficiency of four common COVID-19 tests, and the effect of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus on ability of the COVID-19 tests in detecting those strains. We predict partial mismatching between some primers and the SARS-CoV-2 genome but that all primers are capable of interacting with their target areas. We also predict three mutations that prevent primer binding and thus SARS-CoV-2 detection.

We also examined the factors associated with these behaviors during the declaration of emergency.MethodsAn online survey was conducted from April 26 to 29, 2020, approximately 20 days after the declaration of the emergency, among men and women aged 20-69 years living in Tokyo. The study framework was based on the protection motivation theory, which explains the risk-reducing behaviors, and focus theory of normative conduct, which explains the effect of others' behavior on one's own behavior. The frequency of behaviors like avoiding going out or coming in contact with others and frequent hand-washing, as well as the perception of the risk of COVID-19 during the week preceding the survey, were assessed. Each preventive action was evaluated based on the following factors: perceived effectiveness (response efficacy), perceived practicability (self-efficacy), necessary cost (response cost), and perceptions of how much should be done (injunctive norm) and how well others are doing it (descriptive norm). Hierarchical multiple regression analysis with these behaviors as outcomes were performed.ResultsThis study included 1,034 participants (50.3% male, mean age 44.82 years, standard deviation 14.00 years). The analyses of the frequency of avoiding going out or coming in contact with others showed that the injunctive norm was positively associated with the behavior (standardized partial regression coefficient (?)=0.343, P<0.001), while the descriptive norm was negatively associated with the behavior (?=-0.074, P=0.010). Furthermore, the two-way interaction between risk perception, response efficacy, and self-efficacy was significant (?=0.129, P<0.001), indicating that risk perception was positively associated with the behavior only when either response efficacy or self-efficacy was low. A similar analysis conducted for hand-washing behavior revealed that injunctive norm (?=0.256, P<0.001) and response efficacy (?=0.132, P<0.001) were positively associated with the behavior, while the response cost (?=-0.193, P<0.001) was negatively associated with the behavior.ConclusionSome variables in the protection motivation theory and the focus theory of normative conduct were related to the behavior for the prevention of COVID-19.

Most variants apparently have neutral effects for disease spread and symptoms severity. However, in the viral Spike protein, which is responsible for host cell attachment and invasion, an emergent variant, containing the amino acid substitution D to G in position 614 (D614G), was suggested to increase viral infection capability. To test whether this variant has epidemiological impact, the temporal distributions of the SARS-CoV-2 samples bearing D or G at position 614 were compared in the USA, Asia and Europe. The epidemiological curves were compared at early and late epidemic stages. At early stages, where containment measures were still not fully implemented, the viral variants are supposed to be unconstrained and its growth curves might approximate the free viral dynamics. Our analysis shows that the D614G prevalence and the growth rates of COVID-19 epidemic curves are correlated in the USA, Asia and Europe.

Even so, the successful application of these vectors may benefit from modifications in their design, including their molecular structure, so that specificity for the target cell is increased and off-target effects are minimized. With such improvements, we may find new opportunities for systemic administration of adenoviral vectors as well as the delivery of strategic antigen targets of an antitumor immune response. We propose that the improvement of nonreplicating adenoviral vectors will allow them to continue to hold a key position in cancer gene therapy and immunotherapy. ABSTRACT: Recent preclinical and clinical studies have used viral vectors in gene therapy research, especially nonreplicating adenovirus encoding strategic therapeutic genes for cancer treatment. Adenoviruses were the first DNA viruses to go into therapeutic development, mainly due to well-known biological features: stability in vivo, ease of manufacture, and efficient gene delivery to dividing and nondividing cells. However, there are some limitations for gene therapy using adenoviral vectors, such as nonspecific transduction of normal cells and liver sequestration and neutralization by antibodies, especially when administered systemically. On the other hand, adenoviral vectors are amenable to strategies for the modification of their biological structures, including genetic manipulation of viral proteins, pseudotyping, and conjugation with polymers or biological membranes. Such modifications provide greater specificity to the target cell and better safety in systemic administration; thus, a reduction of antiviral host responses would favor the use of adenoviral vectors in cancer immunotherapy. In this review, we describe the structural and molecular features of nonreplicating adenoviral vectors, the current limitations to their use, and strategies to modify adenoviral tropism, highlighting the approaches that may allow for the systemic administration of gene therapy.","output":"Nonreplicating Adenoviral Vectors: Improving Tropism and Delivery of Cancer Gene Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A severe form of pneumonia, is the leading complication of the respiratory Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), recently renamed SARS-CoV-2.

CONCLUSIONS: The data obtained seems to demonstrate the role of PSP in providing prognostic information in COVID-19 patients, allowing to identify, during the early phase of the monitoring, the patients suffering from a more severe disease which will be hospitalized for a more long time.","output":"Presepsin in risk stratification of SARS-CoV-2 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper introduces a novel theoretical model and measure of strategic thinking in social decision making The model distinguishes four strategic orientations: egocentric (thinking about how ones actions shape ones outcomes), impact (thinking about how ones actions shapes others outcomes), dependency (thinking about how others actions shape ones outcomes), and altercentric (thinking about how others actions shape their outcomes) Applying this model to explain social behavior in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, an exploratory study finds that the more people think about how their actions shape others outcomes, the more likely they are to: (a) comply with social distancing restrictions designed to curb the spread of the virus, and (b) donate money they received in the study to charitable organizations These findings advance understanding of the multifaceted nature of strategic thinking and highlight the usefulness of the Strategic Thinking Scale for explaining social behavior ? 2020 The authors","output":"Strategic thinking and behavior during a pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Early decisions relating to the implementation of virtual care relied on necessity and clinical judgement, but there is a growing need for the generation of evidence to inform policy and practice designs. The need for stronger partnerships between researchers and decision-makers is well recognized, but how these partnerships can be structured and how research can be embedded alongside existing virtual care initiatives remain unclear. We present a series of case studies that illustrate how embedded research can inform policy decisions related to the implementation of virtual care, where decisions are either to (1) discontinue (red light), (2) redesign (yellow light), or (3) scale up existing initiatives (green light). Data were collected through document review and informal interviews with key study personnel. Case 1 involved an evaluation of a mobile diabetes platform that demonstrated a mismatch between the setting and the technology (decision outcome: discontinue). Case 2 involved an evaluation of a mental health support platform that suggested evidence-based modifications to the delivery model (decision outcome: redesign). Case 3 involved an evaluation of video visits that generated evidence to inform the ideal model of implementation at scale (decision outcome: scale up). In this paper, we highlight the characteristics of the partnership and the process that enabled success and use the cases to illustrate how these characteristics were operationalized. Structured communication included monthly check-ins and iterative report development. We also outline key characteristics of the partnership (ie, trust and shared purpose) and the process (ie, timeliness, tailored reporting, and adaptability) that drove the uptake of evidence in decision-making. Across each case, the evaluation was designed to address policy questions articulated by our partners. Furthermore, structured communication provided opportunities for knowledge mobilization. Structured communication was operationalized through monthly meetings as well as the delivery of interim and final reports. These case studies demonstrate the importance of partnering with health system decision-makers to generate and mobilize scientific evidence. Embedded research partnerships founded on a shared purpose of system service provided an effective strategy to bridge the oft-cited gap between science and policy. Structured communication provided a mechanism for collaborative problem-solving and real-time feedback, and it helped contextualize emerging insights.","output":"Closing the Virtual Gap in Health Care: A Series of Case Studies Illustrating the Impact of Embedding Evaluation Alongside System Initiatives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ebben lehet tmasz a stabil rtkrend, az rzelmi httr, a vallsos hit s a szabad akaratbl fakad felelossgtudat, mutathatnak alternatvt Kondorosi Ferenc s Sereg Andrs (szerk.): No galambja - Megjavul-e az emberisg a jrvny utn? nagyszeru szerzoinek rendkvl rtkes tanulmnyai. 2 Worldometers: Current World Population. 3 Worldometers: Covid-19 Coronavirus Pandemic. 4 Tjkoztat oldal a koronavrusrl: https://koronavirus.gov.hu/#/ 5 National Center for Biotechnology Information: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=covid+19.

Detecting people's concerns and attention from online social media platforms has been widely acknowledged as an effective approach to relieve public panic and prevent a social crisis. However, detecting concerns in time from massive information in social media turns out to be a big challenge, especially when sufficient manually labeled data is in the absence of public health emergencies, e.g., COVID-19. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end deep learning model to identify people's concerns and the corresponding relations based on Graph Convolutional Network and Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory integrated with Concern Graph. Except for the sequential features from BERT embeddings, the regional features of tweets can be extracted by the Concern Graph module, which not only benefits the concern detection but also enables our model to be high noise-tolerant. Thus, our model can address the issue of insufficient manually labeled data. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed model by using both manually labeled tweets and automatically labeled tweets. The experimental results show that our model can outperform the state-of-art models on real-world datasets.","output":"Graph-based Joint Pandemic Concern and Relation Extraction on Twitter"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The looming COVID-19 crisis imparts an imminent threat to the healthcare and economic systems of developing countries.

We conducted subgroup analysis according to geographic region. Additionally, we searched United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization to see how different countries act to the education disruption in COVID-19. RESULTS: 29 studies with 4300 pediatric patients were included. The mean age was 7.04 (95% CI: 5.06C9.08) years old. 18.9% of children were asymptomatic (95% CI: 0.121C0.266), 37.4% (95% CI: 0.280C0.474) had no radiographic abnormalities.

It has been shown that mortality in people with underlying diseases including diabetes has been high. The present study aimed to measure diabetes related worries (outcome) and their associations with social support and lifestyle (exposures) amongst people with diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey was completed by 928 respondents (>18 years) between 15-11-2020 and 12-12-2020. The questionnaire comprised four sections: socio-demographic details, diabetic-related worries, social support, and behavioral changes due to COVID-19. Descriptive statistics, correlations and hierarchical regression analysis were performed in the study. RESULTS: Data from 928 respondents (51.61% male; mean age = 52.48 [SD = 11.76]; age range = 18-86 years) were analyzed. The mean score for COVID-19 specific diabetes worries was 3.13 out of 8. Hierarchical regression analysis showed that the mean COVID-19-specific diabetes worries score was significantly associated with lower age, cigarette smoking, perceived poor health status, presence of other diabetic complications. Lack of social support from family, friends, work colleagues and diabetes care team and also eating more than usual were also significantly associated with COVID-19 specific diabetes worry.

A total of 26 patients were recruited for each of the following study groups. Group 1 (G1): patients with a confirmatory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and hospitalized in the ICU. Group 2 (G2): patients with a confirmatory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and hospitalized in regular hospitalization wards. Group 3 (G3): patients with a confirmatory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 who were not hospitalized and had mild or no symptoms. Group 4 (G4): healthy patients with a negative result for SARS-CoV-2. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 was performed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The nasopharyngeal microbiota was characterized using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting 13 representative bacteria genus. Results The detection of some bacteria genus was significantly more frequent in the hospitalized groups compared to healthy subjects. This is the case of Lactobacillus with 96.15% in G1, 96.15% in G2, 23.08% in G3 and 15.38% in G4. Similarly, Prevotella presented 96.15% in G1, 80.77 in G2, 0.00% in G3 and 19.23% in G4. Veilonella, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes presented a similar prevalence. On the other hand, the detection of Eubacterium was more frequent among asymptomatic and healthy subjects, with 3.85% in G1, 19.23% in G2, 50.00% in G3 and 30.77% in G4.

In the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection, viral entry is reported to require a low pH in intracytoplasmic vesicles; however, little is known about how SARS-CoV invades such compartments. Here we demonstrate that SARS-CoV mainly utilizes the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway for its entry to target cells by using infectious SARS-CoV, as well as a SARS-CoV pseudovirus packaged in the SARS-CoV envelope. The SARS-CoV entered caveolin-1-negative HepG2 cells, and the entry was significantly inhibited by treatment with chlorpromazine, an inhibitor for clathrin-dependent endocytosis, and by small interfering RNA-mediated gene silencing for the clathrin heavy chain. Furthermore, the SARS-CoV entered COS7 cells transfected with the mutant of ACE2 with the cytoplasmic tail deleted, SARS-CoV receptor, as well as the wild-type ACE2, and their entries were significantly inhibited by treatment with chlorpromazine. In addition, ACE2 translocated into EEA1-positive early endosomes immediately after the virus attachment to ACE2. These results suggest that when SARS-CoV binds ACE2 it is internalized and penetrates early endosomes in a clathrin-dependent manner and that the cytoplasmic tail of ACE2 is not required for the penetration of SARS-CoV.","output":"Clathrin-dependent entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus into target cells expressing ACE2 with the cytoplasmic tail deleted."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In the absence of antiviral alternatives, interventions under research for COVID-19 might be offered following guidelines from WHO for monitored emergency use of unregistered and experimental interventions (MEURI). Ivermectin is among several drugs explored for its role against SARS-CoV-2, with a well-known safety profile but conflicting data regarding clinical utility for COVID-19. The aim of this report is to inform on the results of a MEURI Program of high-dose ivermectin in COVID-19 carried out by the Ministry of Health of the Province of La Pampa, Argentina. METHODS: COVID-19 subjects, within 5 days of symptoms onset were invited to participate in the program, which consisted in the administration of ivermectin 0.6 mg/kg/day for 5 days plus standard of care. Active pharmacosurveillance was performed for 21 days, and hepatic laboratory assessments were performed in a subset of patients. Frequency of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission and COVID-19-related mortality of subjects in the ivermectin intention to treat group were compared with that observed in inhabitants of the same province during the same period not participating in the program. RESULTS: From 21,232 subjects with COVID-19, 3,266 were offered and agreed to participate in the ivermectin program and 17,966 did not and were considered as controls. A total of 567 participants reported 819 adverse events (AEs); 3.13% discontinued ivermectin due to adverse events. ICU admission was significantly lower in the ivermectin group compared to controls among participants 40 year-old (1.2 vs. 2.0%, odds ratio 0.608; p = 0.024). Similarly, mortality was lower in the ivermectin group in the full group analysis (1.5 vs. 2.1%, odds ratio 0.720; p = 0.029), as well as in subjects  40 year- old (2.7 vs. 4.1%, odds ratio 0.655; p = 0.005).

This study aimed to analyze this approach and its appropriateness in the setting of hospital emergency departments. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Secondary analysis of data from the multicenter observational cross-sectional HERMES-AF study carried out in 124 hospitals representative of the Spanish national health service in 2011. Included were consecutive patients with AF restored to sinus rhythm who were discharged home from emergency care. RESULTS: A total of 449 patients were included;204 (45.4%) were already on sinus rhythm maintenance therapy. Of ,the 245 remaining patients, 107 (43.67%) were prescribed maintenance treatment in the emergency department, as follows: 41, an antiarrhythmic drug;19, upstream therapy;and 49, both treatments. The selection of an antiarrhythmic drug did not follow guideline recommendations in 10 patients (11.8%). Antiarrhythmic drug prescription was associated with having had a prior episode of AF (odds ratio [OR], 2.024;95% CI, 1.196-3.424;P = .009);a heart rate of more than 110 beats/min (OR, 2.147;95% CI, 1.034-4.456, P = 0.40);and prescription of anticoagulation on discharge (OR, 1.862;95% CI, 1.094-3.170;P = .022). Upstream therapy prescription was associated only with a heart rate over 110 beats/min (OR, 2.187;95% CI, 1.005-4.757;P = .018). In total, 311 patients (69.23%) were discharged from the emergency department with sinus rhythm maintenance therapy: 87 with an antiarrhythmic drug, 117 with an upstream therapy, and 107 with both.

They inhibit viral protein synthesis for different RNA viruses by clamping the 5-UTRs of mRNAs onto the surface of the RNA helicase eIF4A. Apart from the natural rocaglate silvestrol, synthetic rocaglates like zotatifin or CR-1-31-B have been developed. Here, we compared the effects of rocaglates on viral 5-UTR-mediated reporter gene expression and binding to an eIF4A-polypurine complex. Furthermore, we analyzed the cytotoxicity of rocaglates on several human immune cells and compared their antiviral activities in coronavirus-infected cells. Finally, the potential for developing viral resistance was evaluated by passaging human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) in the presence of increasing concentrations of rocaglates in MRC-5 cells. Importantly, no decrease in rocaglate-sensitivity was observed, suggesting that virus escape mutants are unlikely to emerge if the host factor eIF4A is targeted. In summary, all three rocaglates are promising antivirals with differences in cytotoxicity against human immune cells, RNA-clamping efficiency, and antiviral activity. In detail, zotatifin showed reduced RNA-clamping efficiency and antiviral activity compared to silvestrol and CR-1-31-B, but was less cytotoxic for immune cells.

However, investigation of the ADCC epitopes on the highly immunogenic influenza hemagglutinin (HA) head region has been rarely reported. In this study, we determined the ADCC and antiviral activities of two putative ADCC epitopes, designated E1 and E2, on the HA head of a pandemic H1N1 influenza virus in vitro and in a lethal mouse model. Our data demonstrated that sera from the E1-vaccinated mice could induce high ADCC activities. Importantly, the induction of ADCC response modestly decreased viral load in the lungs of H1N1-infected mice. However, the elevated ADCC significantly increased mouse alveolar damage and mortality than that of the PBS-vaccinated group (P < 0.0001). The phenotype was potentially due to an exaggerated inflammatory cell infiltration triggered by ADCC, as an upregulated release of cytotoxic granules (perforin) was observed in the lung tissue of E1-vaccinated mice after H1N1 influenza virus challenge. Overall, our data suggested that ADCC elicited by certain domains of HA head region might have a detrimental rather than protective effect during influenza virus infection. Thus, future design of universal influenza vaccine shall strike a balance between the induction of protective immunity and potential side effects of ADCC.","output":"Antibody-Dependent Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity Epitopes on the Hemagglutinin Head Region of Pandemic H1N1 Influenza Virus Play Detrimental Roles in H1N1-Infected Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Miniaturised bioassays permit diagnostic testing near the patient, and the results can be recorded digitally using inexpensive cameras including smartphone and mobile phone cameras. Although digital cameras are now inexpensive and portable, the minimum performance required for microfluidic diagnostic bioassays has not been defined. We present a systematic comparison of a wide range of different digital cameras for capturing and measuring results of microfluidic bioassays and describe a framework to specify performance requirements to quantify immunoassays. Methods: A set of 200 m diameter microchannels was filled with a range of concentrations of dyes used in colorimetric and fluorometric enzyme immunoassays. These were imaged in parallel using cameras of varying cost and performance ranging from <30 to >500. Results: Higher resolution imaging allowed larger numbers of microdevices to be resolved and analysed in a single image. In contrast, low quality cameras were still able to quantify results but for fewer samples. In some cases, an additional macro lens was added to focus closely. If image resolution was sufficient to identify individual microfluidic channels as separate lines, all cameras were able to quantify a similar range of concentrations of both colorimetric and fluorometric dyes. However, the mid-range cameras performed better, with the lowest cost cameras only allowing one or two samples to be quantified per image. Consistent with these findings, we demonstrate that quantitation (to determine endpoint titre) of antibodies against dengue and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viruses is possible using a wide range of digital imaging devices including the mid-range smartphone iPhone 6S and a budget Android smartphone costing <50.

The study period extended from March 23 to April 29. We identified 59 patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation. Of those, 13 patients required ECMO. RESULTS Nine out of 13 ECMO (69.2%) patients were decannulated from ECMO. All-cause ICU mortality was comparable between both ECMO and MV groups (6 patients [46.15%] vs. 22 patients [47.82 %], p = 0.92).

One such complication is the formation of the left ventricular (LV) thrombus. There is a lack of clarity regarding the incidence, risk factors, and management of this complication. Aim: The aim of the study is to identify the clinical presentation, risk factors and outcome of COVID-19 patients with left ventricular thrombus (LVT). Methods: A literature search was conducted to identify all case reports of COVID-19 with LVT in PubMed/Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Results: Among the 65 patients identified, 60 had LVT, either at admission, or during the acute phase of the illness. Six patients with mild symptoms during the acute phase of viral illness had only the COVID-19 antibody test positivity at the time LV thrombus was detected. Few of the patients (23.1%) had no comorbidities. The mean age of the patients was 52.8 years, and the youngest patient was 4 years old. This suggests that LVT formation can occur in young COVID-19 patients with no co-morbid conditions. Most of the patients (69.2%) had more than one site of thrombosis. A mortality rate of 23.1% was observed in our review, and ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) was diagnosed in 33.3% of those who died. Conclusions: A high degree of suspicion for LVT must be maintained in patients with known cardiac disease and those with new-onset arterial or venous thromboembolism, and such patients may benefit from a screening echocardiography at admission. Relevance for Patients: The patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease must take added precautions to prevent acquiring COVID-19 infection as there is a higher risk of developing LV thrombus. In patients who develop LVT in COVID-19, mortality rate is higher.","output":"A review of the presentation and outcome of left ventricular thrombus in coronavirus disease 2019 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 caused a major outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and instigated a widespread fear, threatening global health safety. To date, no licensed antiviral drugs or vaccines are available against COVID-19 although several clinical trials are under way to test possible therapies. During this urgent situation, computational drug discovery methods provide an alternative to tiresome high-throughput screening, particularly in the hit-to-lead-optimization stage. Identification of small molecules that specifically target viral replication apparatus has indicated the highest potential towards antiviral drug discovery. In this work, we present potential compounds that specifically target SARS-CoV-2 vital proteins, including the main protease, Nsp12 RNA polymerase and Nsp13 helicase. An integrative virtual screening and molecular dynamics simulations approach has facilitated the identification of potential binding modes and favourable molecular interaction profile of corresponding compounds. Moreover, the identification of structurally important binding site residues in conserved motifs located inside the active site highlights relative importance of ligand binding based on residual energy decomposition analysis. Although the current study lacks experimental validation, the structural information obtained from this computational study has paved way for the design of targeted inhibitors to combat COVID-19 outbreak.","output":"Structural elucidation of SARS-CoV-2 vital proteins: Computational methods reveal potential drug candidates against main protease, Nsp12 polymerase and Nsp13 helicase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the COVID-19 pandemic, emergency rooms are faced with major challenges because they act as the interface between outpatient and inpatient care.

During initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic patients present with impaired type I/III IFN-mediated antiviral responses. Interestingly, IFNs regulate the cellular entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 on epithelial and endothelial cells. As reported recently, critically ill COVID-19 patients show genetic polymorphisms in one IFN receptor gene (IFNRA2) and in a gene locus near the Janus kinase (JAK) TYK2, which is key for IFN, interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23 signaling, and T helper (Th) 1/Th17 cell-mediated antiviral immune responses. In the advanced stage of the disease, critically ill COVID-19 patients develop a cytokine storm where many inflammatory mediators using the JAK/STAT signaling pathway such as IL-6, IFN-?3, the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or IL-2, and chemokines result in an influx of macrophages and neutrophils damaging the lung tissue. The knowledge on the cytokine and JAK/STAT signaling pathways in severe COVID-19 disease explains the promising first results with JAK inhibitors like baricitinib, which not only dampen the inflammation but in the case of baricitinib also affect virus replication and endocytosis in target cells.

Due to the non-availability of efficient drugs and vaccines at these emergency hours, repurposing existing drugs can effectively treat patients critically infected by SARS-CoV-2. Finding a suitable repurposing drug with inhibitory efficacy to a host-protein is challenging. A detailed mechanistic understanding of the kinetics, (dis)association pathways, key protein residues facilitating the entry-exit of the drugs with targets are fundamental in selecting these repurposed drugs. Keeping this target as the goal of the paper, the potential repurposing drugs, Nafamostat, Camostat, Silmitasertib, Valproic acid, and Zotatifin with host-proteins HDAC2, CSK22, eIF4E2 are studied to elucidate energetics, kinetics, and dissociation pathways. From an ensemble of independent simulations, we observed the presence of single or multiple dissociation pathways with varying host-proteins-drug systems and quantitatively estimated the probability of unbinding through these specific pathways. We also explored the crucial gateway residues facilitating these dissociation mechanisms. Interestingly, the residues we obtained for HDAC2 and CSK22 are also involved in the catalytic activity. Our results demonstrate how these potential drugs interact with the host machinery and the specific target residues, showing involvement in the mechanism.

In response, schools have been searching for methods to negate these results through wellness programs focused on student life. METHODS: A survey comprised of three multiple choice questions was disseminated amongst first year basic science medical students to determine their current state of well-being and potential interest in an educational course focused on wellness. Questions inquired about students current coping strategies and their interest in engaging in wellness focused activities. Participants responses were then used to create a Well-being selective. The course design was centered around a small points reward system in order to promote autonomous decision making and encourage balance of body, mind, and spirit. RESULTS/DISCUSSION: Initial survey data suggests student interest in the creation of a wellness centered selective. Students engaged in a diverse array of activities to support the whole of their being. By tracking student choices of activities to engage in and feedback sent to the selective director, the selective design is being adapted to fit the needs of the student body. CONCLUSION: Through promotion of on and off-campus extracurricular activities, the Well-being selective offers a non-threatening and self-paced approach to a balanced mind, body, and spirit. In this selective, students participate in diverse activities that support health and life balance, ranging from sunset group yoga to local botany.

DESIGN: Arksey and OMalleys five-stage scoping review framework was used to identify the types of evidence available in the field of well-being interventions for healthcare workers during a pandemic. PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL and ERIC databases were searched to find interventions for the well-being of doctors during pandemics. Owing to a lack of results, this search was expanded to all healthcare workers and to include any crisis. Databases were searched in June 2020 and again in October 2020. INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Articles were included that studied healthcare workers, reported an intervention design and were specifically designed for use during a pandemic or other crisis. Well-being was defined broadly and could include psychological, physical, social or educational interventions. RESULTS: Searching produced 10 529 total academic references of which 2062 were duplicates. This left 8467 references. Of these, 16 met our inclusion criteria and were included in data extraction. During data extraction, three more papers were excluded. This left 13 papers to summarise and report. Of these 13 papers, 6 were prospective studies and 7 were purely descriptive. None of the interventions were theoretically informed in their development and the quality of the evidence was generally deemed poor. CONCLUSIONS: There are no high-quality, theory-based interventions for the well-being of healthcare workers during a pandemic or other crisis.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the effect of ECMO on 90-Day mortality vs IMV only Methods: Among 4,244 critically ill adult patients with COVID-19 included in a multicenter cohort study, we emulated a target trial comparing the treatment strategies of initiating ECMO vs. no ECMO within 7 days of IMV in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (PaO2/FiO2 <80 or PaCO2 60 mmHg). We controlled for confounding using a multivariable Cox model based on predefined variables. MAIN RESULTS: 1,235 patients met the full eligibility criteria for the emulated trial, among whom 164 patients initiated ECMO. The ECMO strategy had a higher survival probability at Day-7 from the onset of eligibility criteria (87% vs 83%, risk difference: 4%, 95% CI 0;9%) which decreased during follow-up (survival at Day-90: 63% vs 65%, risk difference: -2%, 95% CI -10;5%). However, ECMO was associated with higher survival when performed in high-volume ECMO centers or in regions where a specific ECMO network organization was set up to handle high demand, and when initiated within the first 4 days of MV and in profoundly hypoxemic patients. CONCLUSIONS: In an emulated trial based on a nationwide COVID-19 cohort, we found differential survival over time of an ECMO compared with a no-ECMO strategy. However, ECMO was consistently associated with better outcomes when performed in high-volume centers and in regions with ECMO capacities specifically organized to handle high demand.

AIM: Here we present a resource-efficient in-house protocol for the PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in patient specimens (RKI/ZBS1 SARS-CoV-2 protocol). METHODS: Two duplex one-step real-time RT-PCR assays are run simultaneously and provide information on two different SARS-CoV-2 genomic regions. Each one is duplexed with a control that either indicates potential PCR inhibition or proves the successful extraction of nucleic acid from the clinical specimen. RESULTS: Limit of RNA detection for both SARS-CoV-2 assays is below 10 genomes per reaction. The protocol enables testing specimens in duplicate across the two different SARS-CoV-2 PCR assays, saving reagents by increasing testing capacity. The protocol can be run on various PCR cyclers with several PCR master mix kits.

In times of crisis, the emotional behavior of the project manager and his infection with the project team is exacerbated by external uncertainty. The stakeholder infection model is based on an understanding of the life cycle of the project manager, which is presented as a curve for personal changes of the manager of innovative projects and programs. Emotions are considered in content, reflecting the various aspects and meanings that caused them. To apply the psychophysiological formula for assessing the impact of the emotional state of the stakeholders of innovative projects, these influences have been transformed into a competent model Infodemic vs. Panicdemic vs. Pandemic COVID-19 for managing health projects. Examples of changes in the competence of the manager and the project team in the case of a wall and asthenic emotions are given. ? 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.","output":"Emotional behavior in the Infodemic vs. Panicdemic vs. Pandemic modeling COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Much of the research and clinical commentary on COVID-19 have been focused on respiratory function. Pelvic floor therapists understand that both respiratory dysfunction and hospitalization can have an impact on pelvic floor function. This clinical commentary provides context as to how the long-term effects of COVID-19 could affect the pelvic floor as well as some generalized treatment considerations. DISCUSSION: The respiratory diaphragm has an impact on the ability of the pelvic floor to contract and relax in a manner that will allow for both continence and elimination. COVID-19 survivors often have disability in this muscle of respiration that can lead to implications for both overactive and underactive pelvic floor. Commonly, this population is hospitalized for long periods of time, which can have long-term consequences on both bladder and bowel functioning including, but not limited to, incontinence, urinary retention, and constipation. Pelvic floor therapists must be prepared to adjust both their evaluation and treatment methods in consideration of this novel treatment population. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the pervasive nature of this virus, pelvic floor physical therapists should be a part of the rehabilitation team treating these patients once they have become medically stable.

Its mechanical behaviour is governed by the inherent viscoelasticity of the fibrils, and their interaction with the fluid. This study investigated the underlying mechanisms of plastic compression (PC), a recently introduced technique for the production of dense collagen matrices for tissue engineering. Unconfined compressive loading results in the rapid expulsion of the fluid phase to produce scaffolds with improved mechanical properties potentially suitable for direct implantation and suturing. The controllability of the PC, as a single or multi-stage process was investigated in terms of fluid loss, remaining protein concentration, and morphological characteristics. Time dependent analysis, and quasi-static mechanical (compressive and tensile) properties of hyper-hydrated and PC collagen, produced by single (SC) and double (DC) compression, were also investigated on the non-covalently cross-linked gels. Under unconfined compressive creep, the behaviour of hyper hydrated gel was dictated by the fluid movement relative to the solid ( poroelasticity) with negligible recovery upon load removal. Similar behaviour was achieved in multiple compressed gels; however, these progressively dense matrices displayed an instantaneous recovery that was in line with the increase in fibrillar collagen concentration. Under tension, where the mechanical response of the gels is dominated by the fibrils, there was significant increase in both break strength and modulus with increasing fibril concentration due to multiple compression as DC provided greater opportunity for physical interaction between the nano-sized fibrils.","output":"Use of multiple unconfined compression for control of collagen gel scaffold density and mechanical properties"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inequities in pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) experiences will impede HIV epidemic elimination among gay and bisexual men (GBM).

One such change was to convert in-person advanced gastrointestinal endoscopy pre-procedure consultations to telemedicine visits. The use of telemedicine has been successfully used in the field of gastroenterology in managing symptoms and chronic conditions among established patients. However, to our knowledge, there is little literature on the utility of this modality for pre-procedure consultation visits, where patients often meet their proceduralists for the first time. The aim of this study was to compare overall patient satisfaction among those who had pre-procedure consultation visits by telemedicine, in Cperson, or a direct access procedure (instructions and procedure explained by a nurse practitioner or physicians assistant). Methods: Patients who had undergone an advanced endoscopic procedure at Long Island Jewish Hospital from the months of May 2020 to August 2020 were called by telephone and asked to complete a modified version of the validated patient satisfaction survey mGHAA-9. The survey was designed to assess patient satisfaction in their pre-procedure, intra-procedure, and post procedure experiences. Patients were grouped based on whether they had received an in-clinic consultation visit by the endoscopist, telemedicine consultation visit by the endoscopist, or direct access. Geographic location to the office, prior endoscopic experience, type of endoscopic procedure (diagnostic vs. therapeutic), and new gastrointestinal cancer diagnosis data were recorded. Results: Of the total 322 patients that were called, 123 agreed to participate (38%) and provided responses to the survey. There were 26 who had in person consultation visits, 32 who had telemedicine consultation visits, and 65 direct access visits. Overall mean satisfaction among the three groups did not reveal a statistically significant difference (p value= 0.983). Furthermore, sub-analysis of the preprocedure, intra procedure, and post procedure satisfaction scores did not reveal statistically significant differences (p=0.996, p=0.244, and p=0.998, respectively). However, patients with a new gastrointestinal cancer diagnosis had a statistically significant higher mean satisfaction score in those who had telemedicine visits with proceduralists compared to those who had direct access procedures (P=0.0116). Conclusion: Our study suggests that pre-procedure consultation visits by telemedicine, in-person, or direct access all have similar satisfaction scores among patients. However, telemedicine consultation visits with the endoscopist may be preferred over direct access in patients who have a clinically high suspicion for a new gastrointestinal cancer diagnosis.

The immediate cost of abiding by these restrictions (e.g., by staying home) to the individual is relatively clear, yet other outcomes are delayed and noisy. It is difficult to infer whether others have fallen ill because of ones own actions, or whether one has played a part in causing a lockdown. This uncertainty leads people to take cues from their dynamic environment and social norms on the right course of action. This preregistered study investigates how people cooperate, and how the social context influences their decisions using an iterated multiplayer game (akin to a public goods game), wherein they encounter various levels of compliance of others, variations in disease prevalence, and differences in the costliness of a lockdown. Participants indicate how much they would hypothetically isolate themselves for each level of average self-isolation by others in the group, they predict how much others will self-isolate, and make a decision about their own self-isolation. We show that participants tend to self-isolate more when they predict others will self-isolate more, and when there are more infected players in the group;we show that participants suffer from illusory superiority, underestimating others self-isolation compared to their own, and we show that higher perceived cost of lockdown leads to more compliance, but that this effect is stronger when players predict that others will be compliant too.","output":"Staying home so you can keep going out: A multiplayer self-isolation game modelling pandemic behaviour"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We live in a unique moment in the history of our lives The virus that caused this pandemic is certainly not the worst that humanity has faced, despite the complexity of the crisis it has generated and the unprecedented socioeconomi disruption it is causing, at all scales on the planet The damage to local economies and global supply chains is incalculable, affecting safety and quality of life, among many other aspects of our existence For thousands of people, life will never be the same (Couclelis, 2020) ? 2020,Finisterra All Rights Reserved","output":"Geographical Readings of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To examine the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 positive players and other players during rugby league matches and determine within-match SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk. METHODS: Four Super League matches in which SARS-CoV-2 positive players were subsequently found to have participated were analysed. Players were identified as increased-risk contacts, and player interactions and proximities were analysed by video footage and global positioning system (GPS) data. The primary outcome was new positive cases of SARS-CoV-2 within 14 days of the match in increased-risk contacts and other players participating in the matches. RESULTS: Out of 136 total players, there were 8 SARS-CoV-2 positive players, 28 players identified as increased-risk contacts and 100 other players in the matches. Increased-risk contacts and other players were involved in 11.49.0 (maximum 32) and 4.05.2 (maximum 23) tackles, respectively. From GPS data, increased-risk contacts and other players were within 2 m of SARS-CoV-2 positive players on 10.418.0 (maximum 88) and 12.520.7 (maximum 121) occasions, totalling 65.7137.7 (maximum 689) and 89.5169.4 (maximum 1003) s, respectively. Within 14 days of the match, one increased-risk contact and five players returned positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) tests, and 27 increased-risk contacts and 95 other participants returned negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests. Positive cases were most likely traced to social interactions, car sharing and wider community transmission and not linked to in-match transmission.

We, therefore, conducted a rapid systematic review of current scientific literature to identify and consolidate evidence of AT in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A systematic search of literature was conducted between November 1, 2019, and June 9, 2020, on PubMed and China National Knowledge Infrastructure to identify potentially eligible studies. RESULTS: A total of 27 studies (5 cohort, 5 case series, and 17 case reports) describing arterial thrombotic events in 90 COVID-19 patients were included. The pooled incidence of AT in severe/critically ill intensive care unit-admitted COVID-19 patients across the 5 cohort studies was 4.4% (95% confidence interval 2.8-6.4). Most of the patients were male, elderly, and had comorbidities. AT was symptomatic in >95% of these patients and involved multiple arteries in approximately 18% of patients. The anatomical distribution of arterial thrombotic events was wide, occurring in limb arteries (39%), cerebral arteries (24%), great vessels (aorta, common iliac, common carotid, and brachiocephalic trunk; 19%), coronary arteries (9%), and superior mesenteric artery (8%).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a prospective observational study performed in the Gynaecologic Oncology Unit, on the outcomes of the reallocation of surgical activities outside the University Hospital of Bologna, Italy, during the Italian lockdown period. Here, we described our COVID-19 free surgical oncologic pathway, in terms of lifestyle restrictions, COVID-19 screening measures, and patient clinical, surgical and follow up outcomes. RESULTS: During the lockdown period (March 9th C May 4th, 2020), 83 patients were scheduled for oncological surgery, 51 patients underwent surgery. Compared to pre-COVID period, we performed the same activities: number of cases scheduled for surgery, type of surgery and surgical and oncological results. No cases of COVID-19 infection were recorded in operated patients and in medical staff. Patients were compliant and well accepted the lifestyle restrictions and reorganization of the care.

Popular with consumers, TCs have not been shown to protect against infectious diseases. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether use of TC-containing wash products reduces incidence of infection in children less than one year of age. METHODS: Starting in 2011, we nested a randomized intervention of wash products with and without TCs within a multiethnic birth cohort. Maternal reports of infectious disease symptoms and antibiotic use were collected weekly by automated survey; household visits occurred every four months. Antibiotic prescriptions were identified by medical chart review. Urinary triclosan levels were measured in a participant subset. Differences by intervention group in reported infectious disease (primary outcome) and antibiotic use (secondary outcome) were assessed using mixed effects logistic regression and Fishers Exact tests, respectively. RESULTS: Infectious illness occurred in 6% of weeks, with upper respiratory illness the predominant syndrome. Among 60 (45%) TC-exposed and 73 (55%) non-TC-exposed babies, infectious disease reports did not differ in frequency between groups (likelihood ratio test: p = 0.88). Medical visits with antibiotic prescriptions were less common in the TC group than in the non-TC group (7.8% vs. 16.6%, respectively; p = 0.02).

Methods We performed a retrospective review of BAL results from January 2014 to July 2016 for 54 AHSCT recipients. A positive BAL was determined by culture, multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Aspergillus galactomannan antigen (AGA), and cytology. Findings BAL was positive for infectious etiologies in 63%, and antimicrobials were adjusted in 48/54 (89%) of patients. Antibacterial escalation was predicted by a positive BAL bacterial culture (OR 7.61, P=0.017). Antibiotic de-escalation was more likely with an elevated AGA (OR 3.86, P=0.035). Antiviral initiation was more likely with positive BAL multiplex PCR (OR 17.33, P=0.010). Antifungals were more likely to be escalated or changed with an elevated AGA (OR 4.33, P=0.020).

The Swiss-German easy language version of the IPOS-Dem was developed and culturally adapted in a six-phase process from the German IPOS-Dem using recommended guidelines. With nursing home staff and laypeople, the conceptual definition and relevance of IPOS-Dem items were established during phase I. Phase II encompassed the completion of forward translations. Independent native speakers blind to the original scale translated and back-translated the Swiss-German easy language version. The resulting IPOS-Dem version was then blindly back-translated in phase III. Experts reviewed all resulting translations in phase IV to produce a pre-final IPOS-Dem version. Finally, the phase V cognitive debriefing involved two focus groups assessing the pre-final IPOS-Dem version. Phase V included cognitive interviews with laypeople (n = 2), family members of those with dementia (n = 4) and staff from different care contexts (n = 12). RESULTS: Using easy language specialists yielded a clinically relevant, comprehensive and understandable translation. In addition, face and content validity for the easy language version were established in the cognitive interviews.

We find that particles exhaled into indoor air become mildly acidic (pH $approx$ 4), rapidly inactivating influenza A virus within minutes, whereas SARS-CoV-2 requires days. If indoor air is enriched with non-hazardous levels of nitric acid, aerosol pH drops by up to 2 units, decreasing 99%-inactivation times for both viruses in small aerosol particles to below 30 seconds. Conversely, unintentional removal of volatile acids from indoor air by filtration may elevate pH and prolong airborne virus persistence.

We observed a significantly higher rate of clotting in the tubing system of the digital CDUs (P = 0.042). Concerning the user experience, the digital CDUs were associated with a more favourable ease of use on the regular wards (P < 0.001). With regard to the overall user experience, the digital CDUs outperformed the analogue systems (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Digital CDUs can be safely and effectively applied in patients after cardiac surgery. Due to the improved patient mobility and simplified chest tube management, the use of digital CDUs may be advantageous for patients after cardiac surgery. However, the issue of clotting of the tubing systems should be addressed by further technical improvements.","output":"Safety and efficacy of digital chest drainage units compared to conventional chest drainage units in cardiac surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The overload of healthcare systems around the world and the danger of infection have limited the ability of researchers to obtain sufficient and reliable data on psychopathology in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The relationship between severe acute respiratory syndrome with the coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and specific mental disturbances remains poorly understood. AIM: To reveal the possibility of identifying the typology and frequency of psychiatric syndromes associated with acute COVID-19 using cluster analysis of discrete psychopathological phenomena. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Descriptive data on the mental state of 55 inpatients with COVID-19 were obtained by young-career physicians. Classification of observed clinical phenomena was performed with k-means cluster analysis of variables coded from the main psychopathological symptoms. Dispersion analysis with p level 0.05 was used to reveal the clusters differences in demography, parameters of inflammation, and respiration function collected on the basis of the original medical records. RESULTS: Three resulting clusters of patients were identified: (1) persons with anxiety; disorders of fluency and tempo of thinking, mood, attention, and motor-volitional sphere; reduced insight; and pessimistic plans for the future (n = 11); (2) persons without psychopathology (n = 37); and (3) persons with disorientation; disorders of memory, attention, fluency, and tempo of thinking; and reduced insight (n = 7). The development of a certain type of impaired mental state was specifically associated with the following: age, lung lesions according to computed tomography, saturation, respiratory rate, C-reactive protein level, and platelet count. CONCLUSION: Anxiety and/or mood disturbances with psychomotor retardation as well as symptoms of impaired consciousness, memory, and insight may be considered as neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19 and should be used for clinical risk assessment.","output":"Mental State of Inpatients With COVID-19: A Computational Psychiatry Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is frequently associated with abnormalities on coagulation testing and a coagulopathy driven by inflammation, intravascular coagulation activation, and microvascular thrombosis. Elevated D-dimer is the most common finding and is a predictor of adverse outcomes including thrombosis, critical illness, and death. Although COVID-19-associated coagulopathy has some similarities to disseminated intravascular coagulation, the platelet count is usually preserved, coagulation times are usually normal or minimally prolonged, and thrombosis is more common than bleeding, at least in noncritically ill patients. Bleeding is uncommon but may be a significant problem in critically ill patients, including those who may develop a consumptive coagulopathy with frank disseminated intravascular coagulation and those on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Blood product support to correct coagulopathy is reserved for bleeding patients or those requiring invasive procedures. Current recommendations suggest that all hospitalized patients should receive at least a prophylactic dose of anticoagulation. Results from a multiplatform randomized clinical trial suggest that therapeutically dosed anticoagulation may improve outcomes, including the need for organ support and mortality in moderately ill patients but not in those requiring critical care. The results of ongoing trials evaluating the impact of different antithrombotic strategies (therapeutic agents and intensity) on COVID-19 outcomes are eagerly awaited and are expected to have important implications for patient management. We also discuss COVID-19 vaccine-associated cytopenias and bleeding as well as vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia, in which thrombosis is associated with thrombocytopenia, elevated D-dimer, and, frequently, hypofibrinogenemia.","output":"How to recognize and manage COVID-19-associated coagulopathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The biggest challenge for the World Health Organization today is the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.

It is unknown whether this occurs in patients with coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and its impact on thrombotic complications. METHODS: We measured serum levels of zonulin, a marker of gut permeability, LPS, and D-dimer in 81 patients with COVID-19 and 81 healthy subjects; the occurrence of thrombotic events in COVID-19 during the intrahospital stay was registered. RESULTS: Serum LPS and zonulin were higher in patients with COVID-19 than in control subjects and, in COVID-19, significantly correlated (R = 0.513; P < 0.001). Among the 81 patients with COVID-19, 11 (14%) experienced thrombotic events in the arterial (n = 5) and venous circulation (n = 6) during a median follow-up of 18 days (interquartile range 11-27 days). A logistic regression analysis showed that LPS (P = 0.024) and D-dimer (P = 0.041) independently predicted thrombotic events. DISCUSSION: The study reports that low-grade endotoxemia is detectable in patients with COVID-19 and is associated with thrombotic events. The coexistence of low-grade endotoxemia with enhanced levels of zonulin may suggest enhanced gut permeability as an underlying mechanism.","output":"Low-Grade Endotoxemia and Thrombosis in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Closed-circuit video (CCTV) inspection has been the most popular technique for visually evaluating the interior status of pipelines in recent decades.

To address this evidence gap, we present data on a cohort of U.S. women with SARS-CoV-2 infection in early pregnancy to help inform clinical practice. STUDY DESIGN: PRIORITY is an ongoing nationwide prospective cohort study of COVID-19 during pregnancy in the U.S. Participants are &#8805;13 years, under investigation for or had confirmed COVID-19 defined as positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2, enrolled from March-October 2020. For this analysis, we selected participants who enrolled at <14 weeks gestation and had SARS-CoV-2 testing; 7 were excluded that did not have longitudinal follow-up. The study was approved by the UCSF Institutional Review Board (IRB #20-30410). Participants completed questionnaires at enrollment, weekly for 4 weeks, and then multiple times throughout pregnancy. Medical record review was used to adjudicate adverse outcomes in a subsample of the population. We calculated the incidence and 95% confidence intervals for early pregnancy loss (EPL) defined as pregnancy loss <20 weeks gestation. RESULTS: Among the 1,338 PRIORITY participants, 109 comprise the analysis set who enrolled at <14 weeks gestation; 94 were COVID-19 positive, 15 were COVID-19 negative. All 109 were outpatients and all were symptomatic. Average age of the population was 31 years; 30% of participants were Latinx (Table). The mean gestational age at enrollment was approximately 9 weeks; 83% of participants had at least 1 month of longitudinal follow-up prior to ending pregnancy. In the COVID-19 positive group, 6/94 (6.4%, 95% CI 2.4%-13.4%) had EPL compared with 1/15 in the COVID-19 negative group (6.7%, 95% CI 0.1%-31.9%). In the COVID-19 positive group, 5 EPLs occurred at 7-12 weeks and one at 15 weeks. In a subgroup analysis of 34 COVID-19 positive participants enrolled at <8 weeks gestation, 2/34 had EPL (5.9%). In the COVID-19 positive group, 82/90 (91.1%, 95% CI 83.2%-96.1%) had live births; 84.4% (95% CI 75.3%-91.2%) at term and 15.6% (95% CI 8.8%-24.7%) at <37 weeks; 6/94 pregnancies are ongoing but all are >24 weeks. CONCLUSION: In this nationwide study of pregnant people in the U.S., the risk of pregnancy loss at <20 weeks gestation was about 6%, both for participants with COVID-19 (N=94) and COVID-19 negative controls (N=15). This data compares favorably to the 10% rate of miscarriage among clinically recognized first trimester pregnancies prior to the pandemic.6 To our knowledge, this is the largest analyses of COVID-19 in the first trimester in a U.S. longitudinal cohort. With this sample size, the upper bound of the confidence interval for pregnancy loss of 13.4% is reassuring because it is not significantly higher than the expected miscarriage rate without viral infection. These results can guide counseling for people infected with SARS-CoV-2 early in pregnancy.","output":"Risk of Pregnancy Loss Prior to 20 weeks Gestation with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Burn injuries trigger a greater and more persistent inflammatory response than other trauma cases. Exercise has been shown to positively influence inflammation in healthy and diseased populations, however little is known about the latent effect of exercise on chronic inflammation in burn injured patients. The aims of the pilot study were to assess the feasibility of implementing a long duration exercise training program, in burn injured individuals including learnings associated with conducting a clinical trial in COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Fifteen participants with a burn injury between 5C20% total body surface area acquired greater than a year ago were randomised in a within-subject designed study, into one of two conditions, exerciseCcontrol or controlCexercise. The exercise condition consisted of six weeks of resistance and cardiovascular exercises, completed remotely or supervised in a hospital gym. A comprehensive outcome measurement was completed at the initial, mid and end point of each exercise and control condition. To determine the success of implementation, the feasibility indicator for the data completeness across the comprehensive outcome battery was set at 80%. RESULTS: Half (49%) of eligible participants in the timeframe, were recruited and commenced the study. Six participants withdrew prior to completion and a total of 15 participants completed the study. Eight participants were randomised to the exercise-control and seven to the control exercise group. Five participants trained remotely and seven did supervised training. Three participants completed a mix of both supervised and remote training initiated due to COVID restrictions. Outcome measures were completed on 97% of protocolised occasions and 100% of participants completed the exercise training.

The aim of this study was to identify community interactions related to vaccines and to identify key influences/influencers before and after the pandemic using social network data from Twitter. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two datasets, including tweets about vaccinations before and after COVID-19 in Turkey, were collected. Social networks were created based on interactions (mentions) between Twitter users. Users and their influence were scored based on social network analysis and parameters that included in-degree and betweenness centrality. RESULTS: In the pre-COVID-19 network, media figures and authors who had anti-vaccine views were the most influential users. In the post-COVID-19 network, the Turkish minister of health, the was the most influential figure. The vaccine network was observed to be growing rapidly after COVID-19, and the physicians and authors who had opinions about mandatory vaccinations received a great deal of reaction.

We find substantial but temporary effects on spending and revenues, with more moderate but permanent effects on the long-term projections. We project that the debt-to-GDP ratio, currently 98%, will rise to 190% in 2050 under current law, compared to a CBO pre-COVID projection of 180%. Sharply lower interest rates projected for the next dozen years help moderate future debt accumulation. Under a current policy projection that allows temporary tax provisionssuch as those in the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017to be made permanent, the debt-to-GDP ratio would rise to 222% by 2050 and would continuing rising thereafter. The long-term projections are sensitive to interest rates. We discuss several aspects of these results, including how the current episode compares to past debt changes, the role of historically low interest rates, and the role of recent Federal Reserve Board policies and actions. Because of the macro-stabilization effects of fiscal tightening, and because low interest rates create breathing room for fiscal policy, we do not see the large, short-run debt accumulation resulting from the current pandemic as necessitating any immediate offsetting response. But the long-term projections show that significant fiscal imbalances remain and will eventually require attention.","output":"The effects of the COVID pandemic on the federal budget outlook"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Leisure time is considered an important context for adolescent development. The purpose of this article is to investigate what contributes to the frequency of adolescents participation in structured leisure activities (SLA). Participants were aged 14C21 years (M = 18.87, SD = 1.23) and 44.8% of participants were female. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted. Results indicate that boys and adolescents who perceive the context of participation in SLA as safe, are externally or intrinsically motivated, and perceive that participation has contributed to their identity development and experiences of initiative, as well as their experiences of stress, are more likely to participate frequently in SLA. On the other hand, these findings indicate that girls and adolescents who are unmotivated to participate in SLA and who experience negative peer influences while participating in SLA are less likely to frequently participate in SLA. It can be concluded that it is important to think much more broadly than just the setting of the activities themselves when promoting young peoples participation in SLA.

This study looked into the usefulness of Thromboelastography (TEG) and the velocity curve (V-curve) derivative from TEG in diagnosing and differentiating different stages of CAC. MATERIALS AND METHODS A prospective single cohort study of RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients was carried out for 2 weeks. Severe COVID-19 patients in the adult critical care units with a TEG report were recruited for the study. Citrated kaolin TEG was performed on the day of admission before anticoagulation. TEG parameters included were R and K time, alpha angle, maximum amplitude, clotting index, lysis at 30 min. The first-degree velocity curve of TEG is plotted as V-curve which extrapolates thrombus generation potential. Parameters analyzed were the maximum rate of thrombus generation as well as thrombus generated (TG). RESULTS The study included 43 patients with an average age of 58.34 (15.35). TEG as well as V-curve of all the patients were hypercoagulable compared with age-matched reference range. We had 79.06% of patients in hypercoagulable stage. The mortality rate was 32.56% and 30.23% developed thrombotic incidents. Patients who succumbed to death had prolonged PT, aPTT, MA, Ly30, with a reduced TG (p < .05). The presence of fibrinolysis was associated with thromboembolism (OR = 6.76, CI = 1.48-25.82). Repeat TEG was done randomly in 11 patients and revealed a persistent hypercoagulable stage with increasing fibrinolysis activity.

Naloxone is an effective overdose response that saves lives, but the drug does not address problematic drug use, addiction, or the underlying conditions that lead to overdoses. The opioid crisis is at its core a multidisciplinary, multisystem problem, and an effective response to the crisis requires collaboration across those various systems. This paper describes such a collaborative effort. The Tempe First-Responder Opioid Recovery Project is a multidisciplinary partnership that includes police officers, social workers, substance use peer counselors, public health professionals, police researchers, and drug policy/harm reduction researchers. The project, 10 months underway, trained and equipped Tempe (AZ) police officers to administer Narcan. In addition, a 24/7 in-person Crisis Outreach Response Team rapidly responds to any suspected overdose and offers follow-up support, referrals, and services to the individual (and loved ones) for up to 45 days after the overdose. We present preliminary project data including interviews with project managers, counselors, and police officers, descriptions of Narcan administrations in the field, and aggregate data on client service engagement.

As social distancing measures continue during the COVID-19 pandemic, experts encourage individuals with underlying conditions to engage in telehealth appointments to maintain continuity of care while minimizing risk exposure. To date, however, little information has been provided regarding telehealth uptake among this high-risk population. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to describe the telehealth use, resource needs, and information sources of individuals with chronic conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondary objectives include exploring differences in telehealth use by sociodemographic characteristics. METHODS: Data for this study were collected through an electronic survey distributed between May 12-14, 2020, to members of 26 online health communities for individuals with chronic disease. Descriptive statistics were run to explore telehealth use, support needs, and information sources, and z tests were run to assess differences in sociodemographic factors and information and support needs among those who did and did not use telehealth services. RESULTS: Among the 2210 respondents, 1073 (49%) reported engaging in telehealth in the past 4 months. Higher proportions of women engaged in telehealth than men (890/1781, 50% vs 181/424, 43%; P=.007), and a higher proportion of those earning household incomes of more than US $100,000 engaged in telehealth than those earning less than US $30,000 (195/370, 53% vs 241/530 45%; P=.003). Although 59% (133/244) of those younger than 40 years and 54% (263/486) of those aged 40-55 years used telehealth, aging populations were less likely to do so, with only 45% (677/1500) of individuals 56 years or older reporting telehealth use (P<.001 and P=.001, respectively). Patients with cystic fibrosis, lupus, and ankylosing spondylitis recorded the highest proportions of individuals using telehealth when compared to those with other diagnoses. Of the 2210 participants, 1333 (60%) participants either looked up information about the virus online or planned to in the future, and when asked what information or support would be most helpful right now, over half (1151/2210, 52%) responded understanding how COVID-19 affects people with my health condition. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly half of the study sample reported participating in telehealth in the past 4 months. Future efforts to engage individuals with underlying medical conditions in telehealth should focus on outreach to men, members of lower-income households, and aging populations. These results may help inform and refine future health communications to further engage this at-risk population in telehealth as the pandemic continues.","output":"Telemedicine Use and Health-Related Concerns of Patients With Chronic Conditions During COVID-19: Survey of Members of Online Health Communities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The mechanisms that lead to disease onset and propagation in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) are not fully elucidated. Maresins (MaR) are a family of essential fatty acid-derived lipid mediators that play a central role in the regulation of inflammation with several studies demonstrating that these mediators display protective activities in airway inflammation. Therefore, in the present studies we evaluated whether concentrations of these mediators were altered in both peripheral blood and nasal secretions from CRS patients. Herein, we focused on patients with CRS that also develop nasal polyps (CRSwNP), given that therapeutic options for the treatment of these patients are limited. Thereby, insights into disease mechanisms in these patients may help design more effective treatments. For this purpose, we compared maresin concentrations from CRSwNP patients with those found in healthy volunteers or patients with an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), as a self-resolving inflammatory condition. Using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, we found that MaR concentrations were significantly decreased in plasma from patients with CRSwNP when compared to healthy volunteers. MaR concentrations were observed to be significantly upregulated in nasal secretions from patients with CRSwNP when compared with both healthy volunteers and URTI subjects. Concentration of these mediators in both plasma and nasal secretions from CRSwNP patients were positively correlated with quality-of-life scores in these patients. Assessment of the concentrations of other pro-resolving and pro-inflammatory lipid mediators (LM) demonstrated that there was a general shift in LM levels in both plasma and nasal secretions from CRSwNP when compared with healthy volunteers and URTI subjects. Of note, incubation of peripheral blood cells from CRSwNP patients with MaR1 downregulated the expression of activation markers on peripheral blood phagocytes, including CD41 and CD62P, markers of platelet-leukocyte heterotypic aggregates. Together these findings demonstrate that both local and systemic LM concentrations, in particularly those of the MaR family, become altered in patients with CRSwNP. They also suggest that therapeutics designed around MaR1 may be useful in regulating the activation of phagocytes in patients with CRSwNP thereby potentially also limiting the local inflammatory response in these patients.","output":"Dysregulated Maresin Concentrations in Plasma and Nasal Secretions From Patients With Chronic Rhinosinusitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is today a strong and emerging commitment toward designing complex and hierarchical architectures.

While the field of infodemiology has studied information patterns on the Web and in social media for at least 18 years, the COVID-19 pandemic has been referred to as the first social media infodemic. However, there is limited evidence about whether and how the social media infodemic has spread panic and affected the mental health of social media users. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine how social media affects self-reported mental health and the spread of panic about COVID-19 in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. METHODS: To carry out this study, an online questionnaire was prepared and conducted in Iraqi Kurdistan, and a total of 516 social media users were sampled. This study deployed a content analysis method for data analysis. Correspondingly, data were analyzed using SPSS software. RESULTS: Participants reported that social media has a significant impact on spreading fear and panic related to the COVID-19 outbreak in Iraqi Kurdistan, with a potential negative influence on peoples mental health and psychological well-being.

It used data from 3916 notified cases of COVID-19, from April 14th to June 02nd, 2020, in Florianopolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil. We used machine-learning algorithm to classify cases which had no diagnosis yet, producing the nowcast. To analyze the underdiagnosis, we compared the difference between the data without nowcasting and the median of the nowcasted projections for the entire period and for the six days from the date of onset of symptoms to diagnosis at the moment of data extraction. Results: The number of new cases throughout the entire period, without nowcasting, was 389. With nowcasting, it was 694 (UI95 496-897,025).

Perceptions of risk have an impact on behavior as individuals who are less likely to view cannabis as risky are more likely to use it problematically. Purpose: This study examined how mental health professionals who use cannabis perceive the risks related to use. Methods: Interpretative phenomenological analysis was utilized to understand how participants made sense of the harm related to personal and client use. Interviews were conducted with a sample of social workers, nurses, and psychotherapists who work with cannabis-consuming clients. Results: Participants reported cannabis use is related to anxiety, relational challenges, impaired driving, psychosis, cognitive impairment, educational/employment dysfunction, and addiction in some users. Conclusion: Assessing risk perceptions among cannabis users can reveal subtle psychosocial problems the user may be experiencing. Mental health workers may benefit from further education regarding cannabis-related physical health harm.","output":"Cannabis Use Among Mental Health Professionals: A Qualitative Study of Cannabis-Related Risk Perceptions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundVaccines for COVID-19 represent a breakthrough in the fight against the pandemic. However, worries about adverse effects have led to vaccine hesitancy in some people. On the other hand, as COVID-19 may be associated with a range of sequelae, it is possible that vaccines may protect against hospitalization and mortality of various diseases. MethodsWe leveraged a large prospective cohort, the UK-Biobank (UKBB), and studied associations of at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccination (BioNTech BNT162b2 or Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) with hospitalization and mortalities from cardiovascular and other diseases (N=180,727). Multivariable Cox and Poisson regression was conducted controlling for main confounders. For hospitalizations, we also conducted separate analysis for new-onset and recurrent cases. All-cause and cardiovascular mortality were also included as outcome. ResultsWe observed that COVID-19 vaccination (at least one dose) was associated with lower risks of hospitalizations from stroke (hazard ratio [HR]=0.371, 95% CI: 0.254-0.543, p=3.36e-7), venous thromboembolism (VTE) (HR=0.485, 95% CI: 0.292-0.804, p=4.99e-3), dementia (HR=0.207, 95% CI 0.091-0.470; p=1.66e-4) and non-COVID-19 pneumonia (HR=0.482, 95% CI 0.313-0.742; p=9.18e-4). Regarding mortality, an association with lower all-cause and cardiovascular mortality was observed, as well as lower mortality from several diseases including stroke, coronary artery disease(CAD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and dementia. There is no evidence that vaccination was associated with increased hospitalization/fatality from any specific disorders. ConclusionsTaken together, this study provides further support to the safety and benefits of COVID-19 vaccination, and such benefits may extend beyond reduction of infection risk or severity per se. As an observational study, causal relationship cannot be concluded and further studies are required to verify the findings.","output":"Association of COVID-19 vaccination with risks of hospitalization and mortality due to cardiovascular and other diseases: A study of the UK Biobank"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The aim was to determine the antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and nucleoprotein using four automated immunoassays and three ELISAs for the detection of total Ig antibodies (Roche) or IgG (Abbott, Diasorin, Snibe, Euroimmun, Mikrogen) in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Sensitivity and dynamic trend to seropositivity were evaluated in 233 samples from 114 patients with moderate, severe or critical COVID-19 confirmed with PCR on nasopharyngeal swab. Specificity was evaluated in 113 samples collected before January 2020, including 24 samples from patients with non-SARS coronavirus infection. RESULTS: Sensitivity for all assays was 100% (95% confidence interval 83.7-100) 3 weeks after onset of symptoms. Specificity varied between 94.7% (88.7-97.8) and 100% (96.1-100). Calculated at the cut-offs that corresponded to a specificity of 95% and 97.5%, Roche had the highest sensitivity (85.0% (79.8-89.0) and 81.1% (76.6-85.7), p < 0.05 except vs. Abbott). Seroconversion occurred on average 2 days earlier for Roche total Ig anti-N and the three IgG anti-N assays (Abbott, Mikrogen, Euroimmun) than for the two IgG anti-S assays (Diasorin, Euroimmun) (&#8805;50% seroconversion day 9-10 vs. day 11-12 and p < 0.05 for percent seropositive patients day 9-10 to 17-18). There was no significant difference in the IgG antibody time to seroconversion between critical and non-critical patients. DISCUSSION: Seroconversion occurred within 3 weeks after onset of symptoms with all assays and on average 2 days earlier for assays detecting IgG or total Ig anti-N than for IgG anti-S. The specificity of assays detecting anti-N was comparable to anti-S and excellent in a challenging control population.","output":"Antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and nucleoprotein evaluated by four automated immunoassays and three ELISAs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We construct a pandemic-induced fear (PIF) index to measure fear of the COVID-19 pandemic using Internet search volumes of the Chinese local search engine and empirically investigate the impact of fear of the pandemic on Chinese stock market returns A reduced-bias estimation approach for multivariate regression is employed to address the issue of small-sample bias We find that the PIF index has a negative and significant impact on cumulative stock market returns The impact of PIF is persistent, which can be explained by mispricing from investors' excessive pessimism We further reveal that the PIF index directly predicts stock market returns through noise trading Investors' Internet search behaviors enhance the fear of the pandemic, and pandemic-induced fear determines future stock market returns, rather than the number of cases and deaths caused by the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"Pandemic-induced fear and stock market returns: Evidence from China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current new coronavirus pandemic has highlighted the importance of taking into consideration population groups particularly at risk of contracting Covid-19 disease or developing severe forms of the disease.

However, the evidence to support such transport infrastructure modifications is unclear. Previous studies on public transport use and elderly health were mostly observational studies using cross-sectional data. Few studies have examined the before-and-after effects of a new metro, for example, to see if it leads to improved elderly health. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We use a new metro line in Hong Kong as a natural experiment to examine the impact of the metro-led public transport intervention on elderly health. In Hong Kong, more than 90% of daily travels are made by public transport. The public transport modifications consist of the new metro line with eight stations and changes in the walking environment and bus services around the stations. We will look at the before-and-after differences in public transport use and health outcomes between elderly participants living in treatment neighbourhoods (400 m walking buffered areas of the new metro stations) and in control groups (living in comparable areas but unaffected by the new metro). Questionnaire-based baseline data were collected in 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic, while some qualitative interviews are ongoing. Amid the pandemic, we conducted a quick telephone-based survey of COVID-19's potential impact on public transport use behaviours of our elderly cohort in September 2020. Note there is no lockdown in Hong Kong until the writing of the paper (January 2021). After the new metro opens, we will conduct a follow-up survey, tentatively in late 2022. We aim to investigate if the new metro and the associated changes in the built environment have any effects on public transport use behaviours, physical activity and wider health outcomes among the elderly (eg, social inclusion, quality of life, subjective well-being). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of Hong Kong reviewed and approved the study procedures and materials (reference number: EA1710040).

Limitations of oro-nasopharyngeal real-time PCR sensitivity have been described based on comparisons of single tests with repeated sampling. We assessed SARS-CoV-2 PCR clinical sensitivity using a clinical and radiological reference standard. METHODS: Between March-May 2020, 2060 patients underwent thoracic imaging and SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. Imaging was independently double- or triple-reported (if discordance) by blinded radiologists according to radiological criteria for COVID-19. We excluded asymptomatic patients and those with alternative diagnoses that could explain imaging findings. Associations with PCR-positivity were assessed with binomial logistic regression. RESULTS: 901 patients had possible/probable imaging features and clinical symptoms of COVID-19 and 429 patients met the clinical and radiological reference case definition. SARS-CoV-2 PCR sensitivity was 68% (95% confidence interval 64-73), was highest 7-8 days after symptom onset (78% (68-88)) and was lower among current smokers (adjusted odds ratio 0.23 (0.12-0.42) p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with clinical and imaging features of COVID-19, PCR test sensitivity was 68%, and was lower among smokers; a finding that could explain observations of lower disease incidence and that warrants further validation.

METHODS: Nested case-control study in a COVID recovery clinic. Individuals with (cases) and without (controls) significant fatigue were included. We performed a multidimensional assessment evaluating various parameters, including pulmonary function tests and cardiopulmonary exercise testing, and implemented multivariable logistic regression to assess risk factors for significant long COVID fatigue. RESULTS: Total of 141 individuals were included. Mean age was 47 (SD 13) years; 115 (82%) were recovering from mild COVID-19. Mean time for evaluation was 8 months following COVID-19. Sixty-six (47%) individuals were classified with significant long COVID fatigue. They had significantly higher number of children, lower proportion of hypothyroidism, higher proportion of sore throat during acute illness and long COVID symptoms, and of physical limitation in daily activities.Individuals with fatigue had poorer sleep quality and higher degree of depression. They had significantly lower heart rate [153.52 (22.64) vs 163.52 (18.53), p=0.038] and oxygen consumption per Kg [27.69 (7.52) vs 30.71 (7.52), p=0.036] at peak exercise.The two independent risk factors for fatigue identified in multivariable analysis were peak exercise heart rate (odds ratio [OR] 0.79 per 10 beats/minute, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65-0.96, p=0.019); and long COVID memory impairment (OR 3.76, 95% CI 1.57-9.01, p=0.003).

In situ hybridization of glial cell cultures infected with MHV-A59 again showed enhanced MHC mRNA expression, both in infected and uninfected cells. These results extend our earlier finding that MHC surface antigens are enhanced on astrocytes and oligodendrocytes after MHV-A59 infection and suggest that this enhancement is a result of an increase in the steady-state level of MHC mRNA. We further demonstrate that increases in MHC mRNA occur in the murine central nervous system (CNS) following infection in vivo. Northern blot analysis of RNA from the brains of infected animals showed transient expression of both MHC class I and class II mRNA over the first 14 days of infection. Expression coincided with viral replication and clearance. In situ hybridization of brain sections from infected animals showed that class I and class II expression was widespread throughout all portions of the brain and in uninfected as well as infected cells. Viral RNA, in contrast, was observed in small foci of cells and mostly within the limbic system. Thus enhancement of MHC mRNA was not restricted either to areas of infection or inflammation. The spatial relationship between viral and MHC expression supports our hypothesis that a soluble mediator is involved in the mechanism of the increase in MHC levels. The fact that MHC induction occurs in vivo as well as in vitro suggests MHC may be important in the mechanism of MHV-induced disease.","output":"Mouse hepatitis virus A59 increases steady-state levels of MHC mRNAs in primary glial cell cultures and in the murine central nervous system()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic has brought to the fore many concerns related to use of immunosuppressive agents (ISAs) in dermatology.

represented a humanitarian crisis, since both the disease and the measures to contain it lead to persistent socioeconomic effects In this context, the labor category has an important role, either because of the feasibility of maintaining the social distancing and living conditions allowed by the employment relationship, or because of the impossibility of adopting protection strategies due to job insecurity The essay was initially built on the basis of a literature review on the interface between COVID-19 and workers' health, carried out from December 2019 to April 2020, on the PubMed, BIREME, Cochrane Library, medRxiv and LitCovid bases, as well as using gray literature Health professionals are more affected, but they also have greater access to diagnosis;however, data are still scarce on other professional categories, as well as on the social determinants that lead to greater labor-related vulnerability In Brazil, the pandemic coincides with a situation in which workers accumulate significant losses of labor and social security rights, in addition to pre-existing social inequalities, such as precarious housing, with greater exposure and risk Although the pandemic is still evolving, social inequalities are expected to intensify, with the deep retraction of the economy, and workers must be a priority target of attention in the control and spread of the disease, in addition to being the axis for planning public social and health protection policies","output":"Labor, health and vulnerability in the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given

The epidemiological relationship between carceral facilities and community health during the COVID-19 pandemic, however, remains largely unexamined. Using data from Cook County Jail, we examine temporal patterns in the relationship between jail cycling (i.e., arrest and processing of individuals through jails before release) and community cases of COVID-19 in Chicago ZIP codes. We use multivariate regression analyses and a machine-learning tool, elastic regression, with 1,706 demographic control variables. We find that for each arrested individual cycled through Cook County Jail in March 2020, five additional cases of COVID-19 in their ZIP code of residence are independently attributable to the jail as of August. A total 86% of this additional disease burden is borne by majority-Black and/or -Hispanic ZIPs, accounting for 17% of cumulative COVID-19 cases in these ZIPs, 6% in majority-White ZIPs, and 13% across all ZIPs. Jail cycling in March alone can independently account for 21% of racial COVID-19 disparities in Chicago as of August 2020. Relative to all demographic variables in our analysis, jail cycling is the strongest predictor of COVID-19 rates, considerably exceeding poverty, race, and population density, for example. Arrest and incarceration policies appear to be increasing COVID-19 incidence in communities. Our data suggest that jails function as infectious disease multipliers and epidemiological pumps that are especially affecting marginalized communities. Given disproportionate policing and incarceration of racialized residents nationally, the criminal punishment system may explain a large proportion of racial COVID-19 disparities noted across the United States.","output":"Carceral-community epidemiology, structural racism, and COVID-19 disparities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant has become the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant around the world and exhibits immune escape to current COVID-19 vaccines to some extent due to its numerous spike mutations.

We found that the Ad5-nCoV booster induced potent neutralizing activity against the wild-type virus and Omicron variant, while aerosolized Ad5-nCoV generated the greatest neutralizing antibody responses against the Omicron variant at day 28 after booster vaccination, at 14.1-fold that of CoronaVac, 5.6-fold that of ZF2001 and 2.0-fold that of intramuscular Ad5-nCoV. Similarly, the aerosolized Ad5-nCoV booster produced the greatest IFN{gamma} T-cell response at day 14 after booster vaccination. The IFN{gamma} T-cell response to aerosolized Ad5-nCoV was 12.8-fold for CoronaVac, 16.5-fold for ZF2001, and 5.0-fold for intramuscular Ad5-nCoV. Aerosolized Ad5-nCoV booster also produced the greatest spike-specific B cell response.

The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated changes in surgical care, including expanded telehealth access. This study aims to evaluate telehealths use for routine postoperative care at an urban safety-net hospital. We hypothesized that completion rates for telehealth would be higher than in-person follow-up, with no difference in the rate of complications. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of 410 patients undergoing inguinal hernia repair, appendectomy, cholecystectomy, and lipoma excision, from September 2019 to September 2020. We compared demographics, social determinants of health, co-existing conditions, and appointment completion between in-person and telehealth follow-ups, using univariate methods. Outcomes of interest were 90-day complications, 30-day surgery-related Emergency Department visits, and readmissions and reoperations. Results: Review identified 115 appendectomies, 168 cholecystectomies, 119 inguinal hernia repairs, and 10 lipoma excisions, with 54.4% urgent/emergent. Overall, 84.9% of surgical follow-ups were completed. Preliminary results from patients who underwent appendectomy showed that 15.6% of patients had telehealth and 55.1%in-person postoperative visits. Interpreters were required for 48.7% of patients, 31.3% had a primary care provider at the time of surgery, and 23.5% had unstable housing. The no-show rate for telehealth was 17.6%, compared to 11.7% for in-person visits (p=0.5). The NSQIP-predicted risk of complication was 4.0% in the telehealth and 4.1% in the in-person group;observed complication rates were11.8% for telehealth and 5.0% for in-person follow-up (n=8, p=0.3).

Based on the self-efficacy approach and social cognitive career and motivation theory, this study was guided by two research questions, as follows: (1) What are the stress factors for senior taxi drivers? How do senior taxi drivers describe the relationship between stress and job satisfaction, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea? Does age play a role? (2) Did senior taxi drivers leave or retire from the taxi driving profession due to stress and job satisfaction during or after the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea? Why? Does age play a role? Materials and methods: The purposive and snowball sampling strategies were employed to recruit 62 male senior taxi drivers all across South Korea. The in-depth, semi-structured, and private interview session was employed. Results: The results indicated that the surrounding environment and individuals, personal considerations with health and body condition, and financial consideration with insufficient pension from the government policy were three key elements for motivations and career decisions. Contributions and conclusion: Government leaders and policymakers should take the results from this study as a blueprint to reform and polish human resources planning and working rights for senior citizens who continue to work in the professions. Although the government has encouraged senior citizens to be part of the workforce until the age of 65, many senior citizens in late adulthood still suffer from negative workplace conditions and stress.

The literature was reviewed for articles relevant to \\"gynecologic oncology\\" and \\"robotics\\" with \\"vaginal cuff dehiscence\\" in the English and French languages. Respective authors were contacted to complete relevant information. RESULTS Seven dehiscences were identified of 441 cases with established gynecologic cancers. The closures in these 7 were performed using interrupted 1-Vicryl (Ethicon Inc) (3/167; 1.8%), combination of interrupted 1-Vicryl and 1-Biosyn (Covidien Inc) (3/156, 1.9%), and V-Loc (Covidien Inc) (1/118, 0.8%) sutures. Associated risk factors included adjuvant chemotherapy and/or brachytherapy, early resumption of sexual activity, and low body mass index (mean, 23  3.23 kg/m2). Dehiscences occurred regardless of suturing by staff or trainees. Review of operative videos did not reveal a detectable etiologic factor, such as excessive cautery damage to the vaginal cuff or shallow tissue sutured. All 7 colporrhexis repairs were performed through a vaginal approach without the need of laparoscopy or laparotomy.

For this reason lifestyle has changed, bringing inevitable repercussions to the Quality of Life (QoL). The present study aims to identify which psychosocial variables predict behaviors capable of affecting the QoL during the lockdown period, potentially highlighting factors that might promote well-being and health in the Italian population during the epidemic. METHODS: Between 27 April 2020 and 11 May 2020, we administered a web-survey to a sample of young Italian people (age M = 21.2; SD = 3.5; female = 57.7% of the sample). Employing variance-based structural equation modeling, we attempted to identify whether social connectedness, social support, and loneliness were variables predictive of the QoL of young Italians. We also sought to identify specific psychological factors, such as symbolic threat, realistic threat, and the threat from potentially contaminated objects, was correlated to COVID-19 fear and whether engaging in particular behaviors was likely to improve the QoL. RESULTS: Our results suggest that social connectedness and loneliness are significant predictors of QoL, while social support did not have a significant effect on QoL. Furthermore, we observed that symbolic and realistic threats and the threat from potentially contaminated objects are significant and positive predictors of COVID-19 fear. Moreover, COVID-19 fear had significant and positive relationships with the carrying out of specific behaviors, such as creative activities during the isolation period and that this related to affirming individuals country-specific identity. Finally, COVID-19 fear is a significant predictor of behavioral factors related to the adherence to public health advice in line with national guidance regarding the containment of COVID-19; this factor, however, did not correlate with QoL. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest the importance of social context and psychological factors to help devise intervention strategies to improve the QoL during lockdown from epidemic events and, in particular, support the importance of promoting social communication and accurate information about the transmission of the virus.","output":"Psychosocial variables and quality of life during the COVID-19 lockdown: a correlational study on a convenience sample of young Italians"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background In many developing countries, acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are the main cause of morbidity and mortality among young children. This study aims to evaluate the molecular epidemiology of respiratory viruses among Malaysian children with confirmed respiratory infections between July 2014 and July 2015. Methods A total of 394 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected prospectively from children age 0-5 years old with ARTIs from hospitals in Kuala Lumpur. Respiratory viral panel (RVP) assay was used to identify the viral aetiology of respiratory infections. Results From a total of 394 samples, the positive detection rate was 79.9% (n=315). A total of 15 types of RNA viruses and a single type of DNA virus were detected. Enterovirus/rhinovirus (n=112, 28.4%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (n=85, 21.6%), adenovirus (n=64, 16.2%), human bocavirus (n=34, 8.6%), and human metapneumovirus (n=29, 7.4%) were the five predominant viruses. Enterovirus/rhinovirus and RSV constituted most of the viral respiratory infections among young children, especially among children less than 1 year old. No coronavirus was detected among children between 3 and 5 years old. Co-infection caused by 2 or 3 respiratory viruses were detected in 52 patients (13.2%). Enterovirus/rhinovirus, adenovirus, and human bocavirus demonstrated pronounced seasonality. The infection rate peaked during mid-year, while the lowest activity occurred during early of the year.

This scoping review aimed to provide insight into the incidence, patterns, risk factors, histopathological findings, and relationship with disease severity of COVID-19-associated liver injury. Furthermore, we identified existing gaps in the research on the hepatic manifestations of COVID-19 and highlighted areas for future investigations. METHODS A scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework suggested by Arksey and O'Mallay. Five online databases, along with grey literature, were searched for articles published until 22 May 2020, and we included 62 articles in the review. The research domains, methodological characteristics, and key conclusions were included in the analysis. RESULTS Retrospective observational studies comprised more than one third (41.9%) of the included publications, and 77.8% were conducted on living patients. The incidence of liver injury varied widely across the studies (4.8%-78%), and liver injury was frequently associated with severe COVID-19. We identified the following risk factors for liver injury: male sex, lymphopoenia, gastrointestinal involvement, old age, increased neutrophil count, and the use of hepatotoxic drugs. Histopathological findings indicate that COVID-19 has direct cytopathic effects and causes liver function test derangements secondary to inflammation, hypoxia, and vascular insult. CONCLUSIONS Liver injury following COVID-19 infection is common and primarily hepatocellular, with a greater elevation of aspartate aminotransferase than of alanine aminotransferase. However, the evidence regarding hepatic failure secondary to COVID-19 is insufficient. Standardised criteria to diagnose liver injury need to be devised.

Effective concentrations of active substances of disinfectants (potassium peroxymonosulfate, sodium dichloroisocyanurate, malic acid, citric acid, glutaraldehyde, and benzalkonium chloride) against ASFV and MVA were compared; similarly, efficacies of APQA-listed commercial disinfectants were examined. Tests were performed according to APQA guidelines, and infectivities of ASFV and MVA were confirmed by hemadsorption and cytopathic effect, respectively.

Here, we present regression analyses using daily national numbers from Austria and from Portugal with daily ultraviolet indexes of two selected locations in these territories, obtained from a Satellite source. These countries, have similar surfaces areas and population size but Austria's mean latitude is 9 up-north.

Similar equations were derived for deaths that follow infections within a few weeks delay. Strong correlations depend on the size of the region/country from which infections are collected, the robustness of screening practices, ideally kept through weekends and holidays. Besides the forecasting usefulness of such correlations, these findings also suggest that covid-19 transmission co-exists with a Sars-Cov-2 specific UV-induced immunosuppression response.

Although many studies have confirmed that helminth-derived proteins had strong immunomodulatory functions and could be used to treat inflammatory diseases, there is no report on the therapeutic effect of excretory-secretory products of Trichinella spiralis adult worms (Ts-AES) on sepsis-induced ALI. In this study, the therapeutic efficacy of Ts-AES on sepsis-induced ALI and the underlying immunological mechanism and the signaling pathway were investigated. The results indicated that after being treated with Ts-AES, the survival rate of mice with CLP-induced sepsis was significantly increased to 50% for 72 hours after CLP surgery compared to PBS control group with all mice died. The sepsis-induced ALI was largely mitigated characterized by reduced inflammation cell infiltration and pathological changes in lung tissue, with decreased lung injury scores and lung wet/dry weight ratio. The therapeutic efficacy of Ts-AES is associated with stimulated Tregs response with increased regulatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF- and downregulated pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-, IL-6, IL-1). The expression of HMGB1, TLR2 and MyD88 in lung tissue was inhibited after treatment of Ts-AES. Our results demonstrated that Ts-AES play an important role in immunomodulation and confer a therapeutic effect on sepsis-induced ALI through inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines. The activation of Tregs and increased level of regulatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF- are possibly involved in the immunomodulatory functions of Ts-AES through HMGB1/TLR2/MyD88 signal pathway.

The median time to clearance of SARS-CoV-2 was 13 days in the nasopharyngeal swabs of the 13 children. Three children presented false negatives for RT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 RNA remained detectable in stools for 12 days after the nasopharyngeal swab test yielded a negative result. Abnormal CT findings were observed in 6 children. All 13 children were cured and discharged and they were normal at 2 weeks after discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Intra-family contact is the main transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children, and there is also a possibility of fecal-oral transmission. Mild and common types are the major clinical types in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and cytokine storm is not observed. Children with SARS-CoV-2 infection tend to have a good short-term prognosis, and follow-up is needed to observe their long-term prognosis. Multiple nucleic acid tests should be performed for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and their close contacts by multiple site sampling.","output":"[Clinical features of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection: an analysis of 13 cases from Changsha, China]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant contains 15 mutations of the receptor-binding domain (RBD). How Omicron evades RBD-targeted neutralizing antibodies requires immediate investigation. Here we use high-throughput yeast display screening(1,2) to determine the profiles of RBD escaping mutations for 247 human anti-RBD neutralizing antibodies and show that the neutralizing antibodies can be classified by unsupervised clustering into six epitope groups (ACF)a grouping that is highly concordant with knowledge-based structural classifications(3C5). Various single mutations of Omicron can impair neutralizing antibodies of different epitope groups. Specifically, neutralizing antibodies in groups ACD, the epitopes of which overlap with the ACE2-binding motif, are largely escaped by K417N, G446S, E484A and Q493R. Antibodies in group E (for example, S309)(6) and group F (for example, CR3022)(7), which often exhibit broad sarbecovirus neutralizing activity, are less affected by Omicron, but a subset of neutralizing antibodies are still escaped by G339D, N440K and S371L. Furthermore, Omicron pseudovirus neutralization showed that neutralizing antibodies that sustained single mutations could also be escaped, owing to multiple synergetic mutations on their epitopes. In total, over 85% of the tested neutralizing antibodies were escaped by Omicron. With regard to neutralizing-antibody-based drugs, the neutralization potency of LY-CoV016, LY-CoV555, REGN10933, REGN10987, AZD1061, AZD8895 and BRII-196 was greatly undermined by Omicron, whereas VIR-7831 and DXP-604 still functioned at a reduced efficacy. Together, our data suggest that infection with Omicron would result in considerable humoral immune evasion, and that neutralizing antibodies targeting the sarbecovirus conserved region will remain most effective. Our results inform the development of antibody-based drugs and vaccines against Omicron and future variants.","output":"Omicron escapes the majority of existing SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objectives: Although the pathogenesis and treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been gradually revealed, the risk for re-emergence of coronavirus nucleic acids in recovered patients remains poorly understood. Hence, this study evaluated the risk predictors associated with re-positivity for virus nucleic acid. Methods: Between February 1 and March 20, 2020, we retrospectively reviewed the clinical epidemiological data of 129 COVID-19 patients who were treated at Zhongxiang People's Hospital of Hubei Province in China. Subsequently, a risk prediction model for the re-positivity of virus nucleic acid was developed, and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn for further validation. Results: In this study, the rate of re-positivity for virus nucleic acid was 17.8% (23/129) where all re-positivity cases were asymptomatic. The median time interval from discharge to nucleic acid re-positivity to discharge after being cured again was 11.5 days (range: 7C23 days). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that leukocytopenia [odds ratio (OR) 7.316, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.319C23.080, p = 0.001], prealbumin < 150 mg/L (OR 4.199, 95% CI 1.461C12.071, p = 0.008), and hyperpyrexia (body temperature >39C, OR 4.643, 95% CI 1.426C15.117, p = 0.011) were independent risk factors associated with re-positivity. The area under the ROC curve was 0.815 (95% CI, 0.729C0.902). Conclusion: COVID-19 patients with leukocytopenia, low prealbumin level, and hyperpyrexia are more likely to test positive for virus nucleic acid after discharge. Timely and effective treatment and appropriate extension of hospital stays and quarantine periods may be feasible strategies for managing such patients.","output":"Prediction of Re-positivity for Coronavirus Nucleic Acid Among COVID-19 Patients in the Recovery Phase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Residents and staff members of long-term care facilities (LTCFs), because they live and work in congregate settings, are at increased risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1,2). In particular, skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), LTCFs that provide skilled nursing care and rehabilitation services for persons with complex medical needs, have been documented settings of COVID-19 outbreaks (3). In addition, residents of LTCFs might be at increased risk for severe outcomes because of their advanced age or the presence of underlying chronic medical conditions (4). As a result, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has recommended that residents and staff members of LTCFs be offered vaccination in the initial COVID-19 vaccine allocation phase (Phase 1a) in the United States (5). In December 2020, CDC launched the Pharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care Program* to facilitate on-site vaccination of residents and staff members at enrolled LTCFs. To evaluate early receipt of vaccine during the first month of the program, the number of eligible residents and staff members in enrolled SNFs was estimated using resident census data from the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN?) and staffing data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Payroll-Based Journal. Among 11,460 SNFs with at least one vaccination clinic during the first month of the program (December 18, 2020-January 17, 2021), an estimated median of 77.8% of residents (interquartile range [IQR] = 61.3%- 93.1%) and a median of 37.5% (IQR = 23.2%- 56.8%) of staff members per facility received 1 dose of COVID-19 vaccine through the Pharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care Program.

This volume surveys the literature on the many misuses of money as punishment and the range of efforts underway to undo the webs of fines, fees, assessments, charges, and surcharges that have been used as sources of funds for governments at all levels. Whether in domains that are denominated civil, criminal, or administrative, and whether the needs are about law, health care, employment, housing, education, or safety services, racism intersects with the criminalization of poverty in all of lifes sectors to impose harms felt disproportionately by people of color.These materials are lengthy because of the proliferation of research on this subject, as well as the need to bridge legal and public finance analyses. The first segment, using Ferguson as a Frame, reflects the impact of the killings of Michael Brown in Ferguson in 2014 and of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020, as well as the mass protest movement underway related to those events. Documentation from policing, prosecution, detention, and probation to prisons is plentifulthat these systems exemplify the over-control of individuals and communities of color and the under-control of state violence. Local groups in Missouri have released analyses of the events and, in 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice issued a report detailing how the police, courts, and elected officials in the City of Ferguson, Missouri, chose to exploit low-income people of color by discriminatorily imposing fines and fees to fund the citys budget. Commentators analyze what Ferguson does, should, or could mean. The excerpts address what has, and has not, changed since 2015 at local, state, and national levels. The need for money (sought by governments and spent by governments and private actors)is the justification for a wide array of fees and assessments. As these authors explain, the desire to punish through money has produced a welter of fines and economic penalties.The second segment, Funding Government: Fiscal Incentives, Inequalities, Reform, and Abolition, reflects the importance of understanding public finance systems and tax mechanisms to learn how to alter structures of government funding to reduce or eliminate monetary sanctions. The questions are why and how government funds are collected and allocated, and the impact of various modes of financing. Researchers have documented how certain funding mechanisms produce and reinforce inequality, and have honed in on the effects of funding government services through fines and fees in state and local public finance systems. The readings consider the decision-making and the politics that drive assessments. Knowing these incentives is requisite to changing them, and throughout this volume, commentators examine means to stop pernicious fiscal policymaking.The third segment, The Practices, Law, and Harms of Tying Monetary Assessments to Law Enforcement Systems, includes readings about the history of criminal legal obligations, their impacts on individuals and families, how the harms track race and class, and what changes could make dents in the systems of unfairness. Excerpted essays explore government funding mechanisms and examine the formal distinctions among categories labeled tax, fine, and fee, their functional overlaps, and their effects. Other materials address aspects of constitutional and state and municipal law that frame some of the discussion and litigation. As recounted, concerns about excessive economic burdens imposed by governments have a long history. In the English-United States legal system, governments are forbidden from levying excessive fines and from imposing cruel and unusual punishments, as well as required to respect life, liberty, and property. Since the 1980s, governments cannot turn monetary obligations into incarceration. While some commentators and juris s call for these constitutional rights to stop systems of punishment that ruin individuals, these provisions have not yet been read to end the racial and economic oppression of legal assessments. Indeed, through the post-Civil War Black Codes, convict leasing, and peonage systems, and with expansion of criminal systems in recent decades and charges of pay to stay in jails and prisons, inequalities abound and ruin has resulted. In addition, several commentators address jurisdiction-specific harms and make proposals for change. Excerpted are a series of case studies, analyses of race as a key variable, and arguments for how and why to revise, reform, and transform the use of money in conjunction with courts.The final set of edited readings, In the Courts and Legislatures, Circa 2020, and Shadowed by COVID-19, provide a partial account of the many lawsuits and legislative initiatives between 2018 and 2020, including recent months when COVID-19 came to dominate the world. As the judicial opinions reflect, some federal appellate courts are proffering limited readings of the 1980s precedents and narrowing the scope of constitutional protection for the intersection of poverty and of the use (voluntary or not) of courts.This volume is the fourth in a series of co-edited, interrelated monographs focused on money as sanctions. In 2018, the volume Who Pays? Fines, Fees, Bail, and the Cost of Courts mapped the many modes by which localities tie their work to funds obtained from individuals, disproportionately poor and of color, who make payments as part of the law enforcement system. In 2019, we published Ability to Pay, which both updated research and the case law on monetary sanctions and detailed some of the many efforts based at law schools to interrupt the pernicious systems and to bring into the curriculum knowledge about and work on revising corrosive practices. A third volume, Fees, Fines, and the Funding of Public Services: A Curriculum for Reform, published in 2020, provides a primer on these issues to bridge the work in the fields of public finance, state and local governance, and tax policy with legal materials focused on monetary sanctions.This volume was co-edited by Anna VanCleave, Brian Highsmith, Judith Resnik, Lisa Foster, Jeff Selbin, Molly Petchenik, Hannah Duncan, and Stephanie Garlock.","output":"Money and Punishment, Circa 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have been associated with increased risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the mechanisms and putative immune pathways are unclear. Besides, increased levels of several immune mediators in patients with severe coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) have been reported. Objective: To perform an immunoproteomic profiling of dysregulated plasma proteins in patients with asthma and COPD and to evaluate their relationship with biomarkers of severe COVID-19. Methods: 92 protein biomarkers were quantified in 315 plasma samples from adult subjects (age 40-90 years) including 118 asthmatics, 99 COPD patients and 98 healthy controls, that have been recruited in two reference pneumology clinics in Colombia before the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Forty-one plasma proteins showed differences between patients and controls. Asthmatic patients have increased levels in IL-6 and CCL3 while COPD patients have a broader systemic inflammatory dysregulation driven by HGF, OPG, and several chemokines (CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, CX3CL1, CXCL1, MCP-3, MCP-4, CCL3, CCL4 and CCL11). Functional annotation revealed their enrichment in chemokine signaling pathways related with response to viral infections. Some of these proteins were found up-regulated upon SARS-Cov-2 infection of Calu-3 cells. Also, HPG, CXCL9, CXCL10, IL-6, MCP-3, TNF and EN-RAGE have been found increased in patients with severe COVID-19. HGF, the most significant protein in this study as well as its correlated proteins could be associated with the increased risk of severe COVID-19 in COPD patients. Conclusions: Asthma and COPD patients have altered plasma levels of proteins that have been found associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19. The reasons for sharing these profiles with this infection are unknown, but our study suggest that adult patients with asthma and COPD have a systemic dysregulation in chemokine networks that could make them more susceptible to severe COVID-19.","output":"Patients with Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) have increased levels of plasma inflammatory mediators upregulated in severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a malignant infectious disease with high mortality caused by HIV (human immunodeficiency virus, and up to now there are no curable drugs or effective vaccines. In order to understand AIDSs development trend, we establish hybrid EMD-BPNN (empirical modal decomposition and Back-propagation artificial neural network model) model to forecast new HIV infection in Dalian and to evaluate models performance. METHODS: The monthly HIV data series are decomposed by EMD method, and then all decomposition results are used as training and testing data to establish BPNN model, namely BPNN was fitted to each IMF (intrinsic mode function) and residue separately, and the predicted value is the sum of the predicted values from the models. Meanwhile, using yearly HIV data to established ARIMA and using monthly HIV data to established BPNN, and SARIMA (seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average) model to compare the predictive ability with EMD-BPNN model. RESULTS: From 2004 to 2017, 3310 cases of HIV were reported in Dalian, including 101 fatal cases. The monthly HIV data series are decomposed into four relatively stable IMFs and one residue item by EMD, and the residue item showed that the incidence of HIV increases firstly after declining. The mean absolute percentage error value for the EMD-BPNN, BPNN, SARIMA (1,1,2) (0,1,1)(12) in 2018 is 7.80%, 10.79%, 9.48% respectively, and the mean absolute percentage error value for the ARIMA (3,1,0) model in 2017 and 2018 is 8.91%.

Although baculovirus is an enveloped virus that infects insects in nature, it has emerged as a vaccine vector, and we used it to develop a novel candidate vaccine for a preventive or therapeutic strategy to control PCV2 infections. METHODS: Immunoblotting analysis of recombinant baculovirus and immunofluorescent staining of baculovirus-infected cells were followed using anti-ORF2 monoclonal antibodies. The BALB/c mice were immunized intramuscularly with this baculovirus. The titers of antibodies were mensurated with a Cap-protein-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a serum neutralization assay.

A History of previous treatment or active surveillance (AS) were considered as exclusion criteria from the study. Patients were divided into two groups according the time period between the diagnosis and surgery;less than or equal to 90 days (group 1) or longer than 90 days (group 2). Surgical pathology results and oncological outcomes were compared between the two groups. RESULTS A total of 2454 out of 3646 patients were assessed. Pathological findings of the radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens were similar between two groups. However, there was slightly more seminal vesicle invasion in final surgical pathology in group 1 (12.9% vs. 9.3%, respectively p=0.042). 5-year biochemical recurrence free survival times were similar across all DAmico risk categories between two groups.

Hepatitis C virus displays a narrow host species tropism, naturally infecting only humans, although chimpanzees are also susceptible to experimental infection. To date, there is no evidence for an animal reservoir of viruses closely related to hepatitis C virus which may have crossed the species barrier to cause disease in humans and resulted in the current pandemic. In fact, due to this restricted host range, a robust immunocompetent small animal model is still lacking, hampering mechanistic analysis of virus pathogenesis, immune control and prophylactic vaccine development.

The impact of viral load in asymptomatic infected children is important to understand transmission potential. We sought to determine whether children deemed to be asymptomatic had a difference in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cycle threshold (Ct) value of respiratory samples from symptomatic children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study to compare PCR Ct values of children who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by respiratory samples collected over a 4-month period at a large tertiary care childrens hospital. RESULTS: We analyzed 728 children who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) from a respiratory sample over a 4-month period and for whom data were available in the electronic medical record. Overall, 71.2% of infected children were symptomatic.

The mean PCR Ct value was lowest in children <5 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective review of children who tested positive by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, the mean Ct was significantly lower in symptomatic children and was lowest in children <5 years of age, indicating that symptomatic children and younger children infected with SARS-CoV-2 may have a higher viral load in the nasopharynx compared to asymptomatic children.

Nearly all subjects who tested positive for HCoV had nasal congestion or secretions (47/49; 96%). The most frequent syndromic diagnosis was common cold (41%), followed by bronchiolitis (27%). We found no association between the infecting HCoV type and subject's syndromic diagnosis (P > 0.05) or anatomic location of infection (upper vs. lower respiratory tract; P > 0.05). The 2018-2019 peak HCoV activity occurred from October to November; the 2019-2020 peak occurred from January to February. CONCLUSIONS: HCoVs were detected in ~7% of outpatient Ecuadorean children <5 years of age with symptoms of acute respiratory tract infection. The most frequently detected HCoV types, and the period of peak HCoV activity differed for the 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 seasons.","output":"Medically Attended Outpatient Coronavirus Infections in Ecuadorean Children During the 20 Months Preceding Countrywide Lockdown Related to the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic of 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Large traditional clinical trials suggest that sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors improve symptoms in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

This study describes our experience in the first 7 cases. Methods This study included all patients received double LTx (DLTx) for COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) between November 2020 and October 2021. Patient pre-LTx and perioperative characteristics as well as post-LTx outcomes are presented. Results Seven patients underwent DLTx for COVID-19 ARDS. All required mechanical ventilation (MV) pre-LTx. Six patients were male (85%), 5 Hispanic (71%), with a median age of 48 (IQR 40-53) and median body mass index of 23.6 (IQR 21.7-25.6). Six patients (85%) were on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) pre-LTx (one conversion from VV to veno-arterial (VA)). Median duration of MV and ECMO pre-LTx was 140 days (IQR 82-165) and 71.5 days (IQR 58-149), respectively. Two patients developed acute kidney injury pre-LTx requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Median time from listing to transplant was 17 days (IQR 10-24). ECMO was discontinued in all but 1 patient post-LTx. Median length of stay in the hospital post-LTx was 30 days (IQR 15-57). All were discharged from the hospital (43% to rehabilitation facility). Two patients on pre-LTx CRRT remained hemodialysis dependent and had multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacterial infections post-LTx. One readmission occurred for presumed rejection, aspiration and infection with MDR Klebsiella now requiring oxygen. All surgical pathology showed diffuse interstitial fibrosis consistent with the fibrotic sequelae of alveolar damage due to COVID-19. At 3-month follow-up, 6 patients (85%) did not need supplemental oxygen and had good pulmonary function. Conclusion Lung transplantation for COVID-ARDS is feasible. However, pre-transplant multi-system involvement may be associated with a protracted post-LTx stay and MDR infection.

Mathematical modelling and forecasting efforts have been widely used to inform policy-making and to create situational awareness. Methods and Findings: From 8th March to 29th November 2020, we produced weekly estimates of SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and forecasts of deaths due to COVID-19 for countries with evidence of sustained transmission. The estimates and forecasts were based on an ensemble model comprising of three models that were calibrated using only the reported number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in each country. We also developed a novel heuristic to combine weekly estimates of transmissibility and potential changes in population immunity due to infection to produce forecasts over a 4-week horizon. We evaluated the robustness of the forecasts using relative error, coverage probability, and comparisons with null models. Conclusions: During the 39-week period covered by this study, we produced short- and medium-term forecasts for 81 countries. Both the short- and medium-term forecasts captured well the epidemic trajectory across different waves of COVID-19 infections with small relative errors over the forecast horizon. The model was well calibrated with 56.3% and 45.6% of the observations lying in the 50% Credible Interval in 1-week and 4-week ahead forecasts respectively. We could accurately characterise the overall phase of the epidemic up to 4-weeks ahead in 84.9% of country-days.

Modular electrochemical synthesis (ModES) using a redox reservoir (RR) offers a promising membrane-free approach to improve energy efficiency and reduce waste through the pairing of multiple independent oxidative and reductive half-reactions; however, undesired ion-imbalance and induced pH changes in the existing ModES process limit sustained production. Here we present Ni(OH)(2) as a heterogeneous RR that can selectively store and transport the hydroxide ions involved in the target half-reactions by reversible conversion with NiOOH to enable an ion-balanced ModES of two common disinfectants, hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and sodium hypochlorite (NaClO). This hydroxide-balanced ModES realizes stable operation without appreciable pH swing to accumulate practically useful concentrations of H(2)O(2) and NaClO up to 251 and 481 ppm, respectively.

While abundant in soil, Fe bioavailability in oxic soil is very low. In environmental conditions, bacteria need to acquire sufficient Fe to sustain growth while limiting the energy cost of siderophore synthesis. Biofilm formation might mitigate this Fe stress, since it was shown to accumulate Fe in certain Gram-negative bacteria and that this Fe could be mobilized for uptake. However, it is still unclear if and to what extent the amount of Fe accumulated in the biofilm can sustain growth, and if the mobilization of this local Fe pool is modulated by the availability of environmental Fe (i.e., Fe outside the biofilm matrix). Here we use a non-domesticated strain of the ubiquitous biofilm-forming soil bacterium, Bacillus subtilis, and stable Fe isotopes to precisely evaluate the origin of Fe during growth in the presence of tannic acid and hydroxides, used as proxies for different environmental conditions. We report that this B. subtilis strain can accumulate a large quantity of Fe in the biofilm, largely exceeding Fe associated with cells. We also report that only a fraction of biofilm-bound Fe is available for uptake in the absence of other sources of Fe in the vicinity of the biofilm. We observed that availability of environmental Fe modulates the usage of this pool of biofilm-bound Fe. Finally, our data suggest that consumption of biofilm-bound Fe relates to the efficacy of B. subtilis to transport Fe from the environment to the biofilm, possibly through siderophores.Importance Recent evidences suggest that Fe bound to the biofilm could assume at least two important functions; a local source of Fe for uptake and a support to extracellular metabolism such as extracellular electron transfer. Our results show that B. subtilis can use biofilm-bound Fe for uptake only if it does not compromise Fe homeostasis of the biofilm, i.e., maintaining a minimum Fe concentration in the biofilm for extracellular purposes. We propose a theoretical framework based on our results and recent literature to explain how B. subtilis manages biofilm-bound Fe and Fe uptake in response to environmental Fe availability. These results provide important insights into the management of biofilm-bound and environmental Fe by B. subtilis in response to Fe stress.","output":"Bacillus subtilis modulates its usage of biofilm-bound iron in response to environmental iron availability."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In an international comparison, Germany is in the top group for health care.

Being affected by the disease exposes the individual to an uncertain prognosis and a state of quarantine. These factors can predispose individuals to the development of mental symptoms during or after the acute phase of the disease. There is a need for prospective studies assessing psychiatric symptoms in COVID-19 patients in the post-infection period. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, nasopharyngeal swabs for COVID-19 tests were collected at patients' homes under the supervision of trained healthcare personnel. Patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and were classified as mild cases (N = 895) at treatment intake were further assessed for the presence of psychiatric symptoms (on average, 56.6 days after the intake). We investigated the association between the number of COVID-19 symptoms at intake and depressive, anxiety and post-traumatic symptoms approximately two months later, adjusting for previous mental health status, time between baseline and outcome, and other confounders. Multivariate logistic regression and generalized linear models were employed for categorical and continuous outcomes, respectively.

Reporting an increased number of COVID-related symptoms was associated with the presence of clinically significant levels of depressive (aOR = 1.059;95%CI = 1.002-1.119), anxiety (aOR = 1.072;95%CI = 1.012-1.134), and post-traumatic stress (aOR = 1.092;95%CI = 1.024-1.166) symptoms. Sensitivity analyses supported findings for both continuous and categorical measures. CONCLUSION: Exposure to an increased number of COVID-19 symptoms may be associated with depressive, anxiety and post-traumatic symptoms after the acute phase of the disease. These patients should be monitored for the development of psychiatric symptoms after COVID-19 treatment discharge. Early interventions, such as brief interventions of psychoeducation on coping strategies, could benefit these individuals.","output":"Post-infection depressive, anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms: A prospective cohort study in patients with mild COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A major bottleneck in scaling-up COVID-19 testing is the need for sophisticated instruments and well-trained healthcare professionals, which are already overwhelmed due to the pandemic. Moreover, the high-sensitive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics are contingent on an RNA extraction step, which, in turn, is restricted by constraints in the supply chain. Here, we present CASSPIT (Cas13 Assisted Saliva-based & Smartphone Integrated Testing), which will allow direct use of saliva samples without the need for RNA extraction for SARS-CoV-2 detection. CASSPIT utilizes CRISPR-Cas13a based SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection, and lateral-flow assay (LFA) readout of the test results. The sample preparation workflow includes an optimized chemical treatment and heat inactivation method, which, when applied to 94 COVID-19 clinical samples, showed a 97% positive agreement with the RNA extraction method. With CASSPIT, LFA based visual limit of detection (LoD) for a given SARS-CoV-2 RNA spiked into the saliva samples was ~200 copies; image analysis-based quantification further improved the analytical sensitivity to ~100 copies. Upon validation of clinical sensitivity on RNA extraction-free saliva samples (n=76), a 98% agreement between the lateral-flow readout and RT-qPCR data was found. To enable user-friendly test results with provision for data storage and online consultation, we subsequently integrated lateral-flow strips with a smartphone application. We believe CASSPIT will eliminate our reliance on RT-qPCR by providing comparable sensitivity and will be a step toward establishing nucleic acid-based point-of-care (POC) testing for COVID-19.","output":"A saliva-based RNA extraction-free workflow integrated with Cas13a for SARS-CoV-2 detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-based aptasensors display high sensitivity for influenza A/H1N1 virus detection but improved signal reproducibility is required. Therefore, in this study, we fabricated a three-dimensional (3D) nano-popcorn plasmonic substrate using the surface energy difference between a perfluorodecanethiol (PFDT) spacer and the Au layer. This energy difference led to Au nanoparticle self-assembly; neighboring nanoparticles then created multiple hotspots on the substrate. The localized surface plasmon effects at the hot spots dramatically enhanced the incident field. Quantitative evaluation of A/H1N1 virus was achieved using the decrease of Raman peak intensity resulting from the release of Cy3-labeled aptamer DNAs from nano-popcorn substrate surfaces via the interaction between the aptamer DNA and A/H1N1 virus. The use of a Raman imaging technique involving the fast mapping of all pixel points enabled the reproducible quantification of A/H1N1 virus on nano-popcorn substrates. Average ensemble effects obtained by averaging all randomly distributed hot spots mapped on the substrate made it possible to reliably quantify target viruses. The SERS-based imaging aptasensor platform proposed in this work overcomes the issues inherent in conventional approaches (the time-consuming and labor-intensiveness of RT-PCR and low sensitivity and quantitative analysis limits of lateral flow assay kits). Our SERS-based assay for detecting A/H1N1 virus had an estimated limit of detection of 97 PFU mL-1 (approximately three orders of magnitude more sensitive than that determined by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and the approximate assay time was estimated to be 20 min.

Tracheostomy has been shown to decrease the amount of sedative, anxiolytic and analgesic medications given to patients. The goal of this study was to assess whether tracheostomy decreased sedation and analgesic medication usage, improved markers of activity level and cognitive function, and clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 ARDS. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS A retrospective registry of patients with COVID-19 ARDS who underwent tracheostomy creation at the University of Pennsylvania Health System or the Johns Hopkins Hospital from 3/2020 to 12/2020. Patients were grouped into the early (14 days, n = 31) or late (15 + days, n = 97) tracheostomy groups and outcome data collected. RESULTS 128 patients had tracheostomies performed at a mean of 19.4 days, with 66% performed percutaneously at bedside. Mean hourly dose of fentanyl, midazolam, and propofol were all significantly reduced 48-h after tracheostomy: fentanyl (48-h pre-tracheostomy: 94.0 mcg/h, 48-h post-tracheostomy: 64.9 mcg/h, P = .000), midazolam (1.9 mg/h pre vs. 1.2 mg/h post, P = .0012), and propofol (23.3 mcg/kg/h pre vs. 8.4 mcg/kg/h post, P = .0121). There was a significant improvement in mobility score and Glasgow Coma Scale in the 48-h pre- and post-tracheostomy. Comparing the early and late groups, the mean fentanyl dose in the 48-h pre-tracheostomy was significantly higher in the late group than the early group (116.1 mcg/h vs. 35.6 mcg/h, P = .03). ICU length of stay was also shorter in the early group (37.0 vs. 46.2 days, P = .012). INTERPRETATION This data supports a reduction in sedative and analgesic medications administered and improvement in cognitive and physical activity in the 48-h period post-tracheostomy in COVID-19 ARDS. Further, early tracheostomy may lead to significant reductions in intravenous opiate medication administration, and ICU LOS.","output":"Sedation and Analgesia in Patients Undergoing Tracheostomy in COVID-19, a Multi-Center Registry."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Shared sanitation facilities have been hailed as an innovative approach to solve the challenge with sanitation access. However, these facilities may act as hotspots for disease transmission due to unhygienic conditions. In this study we used quantitative (based on Escherichia coli contamination) techniques to assess the health risks associated with the use of community ablution blocks (CABs). The most contaminated surfaces were the cistern handle (5.7 Log(10) cfu/cm(2)) and internal pull latch (5.8 Log(10) cfu/cm(2)). Based on the E. coli contamination, at least two people out of 100 CAB users might be potentially infected when they touch hot surfaces. These risks were modelled assuming transfer of potentially pathogenic E. coli from these surfaces to the mouth. The incorporation of risk-reduction measures, such as wiping of these surfaces or washing of hands, could potentially result in significant reduction of infection risks. The most significant risk-reduction intervention was determined to be wiping of the contact surfaces, especially twice prior to contact. A combination of risk-reduction interventions could further reduce the risks. This study shows that contamination of contact surfaces within shared CABs could lead to increased risks of infections, requiring measures aimed at reducing the associated risks. The risk assessment framework used in this study could therefore be applied in similar settings to estimate associated health risks with the use of such facilities.

Certain guidelines issued by National Health Commission of the People's Repubilic of China recommend intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for adjuvant treatment of COVID-19. However, there is a lack of clinical evidence to support the use of IVIG. METHODS: This single-center retrospective cohort study included all adult patients with laboratory-confirmed severe COVID-19 in the Respiratory and Critical Care Unit of Dabie Mountain Regional Medical Center, China. Patient information, including demographic data, laboratory indicators, the use of glucocorticoids and IVIG, hospital mortality, the application of mechanical ventilation, and the length of hospital stay was collected. The primary outcome was the composite end point, including death and the use of mechanical ventilation. The secondary outcome was the length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Of the 285 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 113 severely ill patients were included in this study. Compared to the non-IVIG group, more patients in the IVIG group reached the composite end point [12 (25.5%) vs 5 (7.6%), P = 0.008] and had longer hospital stay periods [23.0 (19.0C31.0) vs 16.0 (13.8C22.0), P < 0.001].

There are no effective antiviral drugs for SARS although the epidemic of SARS was controlled. The aim of this study was to develop an RNAi (RNA interference) approach that specifically targeted the N gene sequence of severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) by synthesizing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in vivo, and to assess the inhibitory effect of this shRNA on SARS-CoV N antigen expression. METHODS The eukaryotic expression plasmid pEGFP-C1-N, containing SARS-CoV N gene, was co-transfected into 293 cells with either the RNAi plasmid pshRNA-N or unrelated control plasmid pshRNA-HBV-C4. At 24, 48 and 72 hours post transfection, the green fluorescence was observed through a fluorescence microscope. The RNA levels of SARS-CoV N were determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The expression of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) and protein N were detected using Western blot. RESULTS The vector, pshRNA-N expressing shRNA which targeted the N gene of SARS-CoV, was successfully constructed. The introduction of RNAi plasmid efficiently and specifically inhibited the synthesis of protein N. RT-PCR showed that RNAs of N gene were clearly reduced when the pEGFP-C1-N was cotransfected with pshRNA-N, whereas the control vector did not exhibit inhibitory effect on N gene transcription.

This disease is a communicable disease which is spreading fastly due to Community Transmission, where the affetced people in the community aftects the heathy people in the community. Government is taking precautions by imposing Social Distancing in the countries or state to control the impact of COVID-19. Social Distancing can reduce the community transmission of COVID-19 by reducing the number of infected persons in an area. This is performed by staying at home and maintaining social distance with people. It reduces the density of people in an area by which it is difficult for the virus to spread from one person to other. In this work, the community transmission is presented using simulations. It shows how an infected person affects the healthy persons in an area. Simulations also show how social distancing can control the spread of COVID-19. The simulation is performed in GNU Octave programming platform by considering number of infected persons and number of healthy persons as parameters.

Tumor cells are injected at 48 h post fertilization, with oncolytic virus treatment then being administered 24 h later to allow for an initial period of tumor development and angiogenesis. Confocal fluorescent imaging is used to quantify dynamics within the tumor environment. The natural translucency of zebrafish at the embryo stage, coupled with the availability of strains with fluorescent immune and endothelial cell reporter lines, gives the model broad potential to allow for real time, in vivo investigation of important events within tumors throughout the course of virotherapy.

Compared with other models, our protocol offers a powerful, inexpensive approach to evaluating novel oncolytic viruses and oncolytic virus-based combination therapies, with potential application to investigating the impacts of virotherapy on immune response, tumor vasculature, and metastatic disease.","output":"Modeling oncolytic virus dynamics in the tumor microenvironment using zebrafish"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main protease (M(pro)) in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) catalyzes the cleavage of polyproteins for viral replication.

To increase the chances of obtaining positive results in this context, this article proposes a gamification analytics model for teachers. In this model, teachers are allowed to define interaction goals, monitor students interaction with the system learning resources and the gamification elements, and adapt the gamification design through missions to motivate disengaged students to achieve the interaction goals defined. However, the gamification analytics model-based design concepts that will be implemented to support the learning process should be well-planned to teachers needs. Hence, one of the contributions of this paper is the validation of twenty design concepts based on the gamification analytics model for teachers by using the speed dating method. Our results suggest that teachers judged useful/relevant visualize students interaction with gamification elements such as missions, levels to help them understand the students status, but did not evaluate the visualization of the interaction of students with trophies relevant. Teachers also highly evaluated the creation of personalized missions for a student or a specific group as relevant to help demotivated students to engage and achieve the desired goals. Therefore, this study provides some relevant insights to guide the design and re-design of gamified adaptive learning systems.","output":"Raising Teachers Empowerment in Gamification Design of Adaptive Learning Systems: A Qualitative Research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Microlearning, the acquisition of knowledge or skills in the form of small units, is endorsed by health professions educators as a means of facilitating student learning, training, and continuing education, but it is difficult to define in terms of its features and outcomes. OBJECTIVE This review aimed to conduct a systematic search of the literature on microlearning in health professions education to identify key concepts, characterize microlearning as an educational strategy, and evaluate pedagogical outcomes experienced by health professions students. METHODS A scoping review was performed using the bibliographic databases PubMed (MEDLINE), CINAHL, Education Resources Information Center, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Education Full Text (HW Wilson), and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global. A combination of keywords and subject headings related to microlearning, electronic learning, or just-in-time learning combined with health professions education was used. No date limits were placed on the search, but inclusion was limited to materials published in English. Pedagogical outcomes were evaluated according to the 4-level Kirkpatrick model. RESULTS A total of 3096 references were retrieved, of which 17 articles were selected after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Articles that met the criteria were published between 2011 and 2018, and their authors were from a range of countries, including the United States, China, India, Australia, Canada, Iran, Netherlands, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom. The 17 studies reviewed included various health-related disciplines, such as medicine, nursing, pharmacy, dentistry, and allied health. Although microlearning appeared in a variety of subject areas, different technologies, such as podcast, short messaging service, microblogging, and social networking service, were also used. On the basis of Buchem and Hamelmann's 10 microlearning concepts, each study satisfied at least 40% of the characteristics, whereas all studies featured concepts of maximum time spent less than 15 min as well as content aggregation. According to our assessment of each article using the Kirkpatrick model, 94% (16/17) assessed student reactions to the microlearning (level 1), 82% (14/17) evaluated knowledge or skill acquisition (level 2), 29% (5/17) measured the effect of the microlearning on student behavior (level 3), and no studies were found at the highest level. CONCLUSIONS Microlearning as an educational strategy has demonstrated a positive effect on the knowledge and confidence of health professions students in performing procedures, retaining knowledge, studying, and engaging in collaborative learning. However, downsides to microlearning include pedagogical discomfort, technology inequalities, and privacy concerns. Future research should look at higher-level outcomes, including benefits to patients or practice changes. The findings of this scoping review will inform education researchers, faculty, and academic administrators on the application of microlearning, pinpoint gaps in the literature, and help identify opportunities for instructional designers and subject matter experts to improve course content in didactic and clinical settings.","output":"Microlearning in Health Professions Education: Scoping Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Swedish COVID-19 response has received excessive attention, despite not having distinctively different goals or features than other countries.

We evaluated a distance learning program's effectiveness for reducing outpatient antibiotic prescribing for ARTI visits. METHODS In this stepped-wedge clinical trial run from November 2015 to June 2018, we randomly assigned 19 pediatric practices belonging to the Pediatric Research in Office Settings Network or the NorthShore University HealthSystem to 4 wedges. Visits for acute otitis media, bronchitis, pharyngitis, sinusitis, and upper respiratory infection for children 6 months to <11 years old without recent antibiotic use were included. Clinicians received the intervention as 3 program modules containing online tutorials and webinars on evidence-based communication strategies and antibiotic prescribing, booster video vignettes, and individualized antibiotic prescribing feedback reports over 11 months. The primary outcome was overall antibiotic prescribing rates for all ARTI visits. Mixed-effects logistic regression compared prescribing rates during each program module and a postintervention period to a baseline control period. Odds ratios were converted to adjusted rate ratios (aRRs) for interpretability. RESULTS Among 72 723 ARTI visits by 29 762 patients, intention-to-treat analyses revealed a 7% decrease in the probability of antibiotic prescribing for ARTI overall between the baseline and postintervention periods (aRR 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90-0.96). Second-line antibiotic prescribing decreased for streptococcal pharyngitis (aRR 0.66; 95% CI, 0.50-0.87) and sinusitis (aRR 0.59; 95% CI, 0.44-0.77) but not for acute otitis media (aRR 0.93; 95% CI, 0.83-1.03).

OBJECTIVE To investigate possible associations between aneurysm hemodynamic and geometric characteristics and the development of blebs in intracranial aneurysms. METHODS A total of 270 IAs in 199 patients selected for surgical clipping were studied. Blebs were visually identified and interactively marked on patient-specific vascular models constructed from presurgical images. Blebs were then deleted from the vascular reconstruction to approximate the aneurysm before bleb formation. Computational fluid dynamics studies were performed in these models and in cases without blebs. Hemodynamic and geometric characteristics of aneurysms with and without blebs were compared. RESULTS A total of 173 aneurysms had no blebs, while 97 aneurysms had a total of 122 blebs. Aneurysms favoring bleb formation had stronger (p<0.0001) and more concentrated inflow jets (p<0.0001), higher flow velocity (p=0.0061), more complex (p<0.0001) and unstable (p=0.0157) flow patterns, larger maximum wall shear stress (WSS; p<0.0001), more concentrated (p=0.0005) and oscillatory (p=0.0004) WSS distribution, and a more heterogeneous WSS field (p<0.0001), than aneurysms without blebs. They were also larger (p<0.0001), more elongated (p<0.0001), had wider necks (p=0.0002), and more distorted and irregular shapes (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Strong and concentrated inflow jets, high-speed, complex, and unstable flow patterns, and concentrated, oscillatory, and heterogeneous WSS patterns favor the formation of blebs in IAs. Blebs are more likely to form in large, elongated, and irregularly shaped aneurysms. These adverse characteristics could be considered signs of aneurysm instability when evaluating aneurysms for conservative observation or treatment.","output":"Hemodynamic conditions that favor bleb formation in cerebral aneurysms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Separation of the vertebrobasilar artery (VBA) from the trigeminal nerve root in microvascular decompression (MVD) is technically challenging. This study aimed to review the clinical features of VBA involvement in trigeminal neuralgia and evaluate surgical decompression techniques in the long term. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the surgical outcomes of 26 patients (4.4%) with VBA involvement in 585 consecutive MVDs for TGN using a Teflon roll for repositioning the VBA. The final operative status of the nerve decompression was categorized into two groups: the separation group and the contact group. Separation of the VBA from the nerve root was completed in 13 patients in the separation group, and slight vascular contact remained in the remaining 13 patients of the contact group. The clinical features of VBA-related TGN were investigated and the operative results were analyzed. RESULTS Multiple arteries are involved in neurovascular compression (NVC) in most cases. The anterior inferior cerebellar artery was the most common concomitant artery (69%). The site of the NVC varies from the root entry zone to the distal portion of the root. All patients were pain-free immediately after surgery and maintained medication-free status during the follow-up period, except for one patient (3.8%) who had recurrent facial pain 8 years after surgery. Postoperative facial numbness was observed in six patients (23%). Of these, one patient showed improvement within 3 months and the other five patients had persistent facial numbness (19.2%). Other neurological deficits include one dry eye, one diplopia due to trochlear nerve palsy, two decreased hearing (< 50 db), two facial weaknesses, and two cerebellar ataxia. Although most of them were transient, one dry eye, two hearing impairments, and one cerebellar ataxia became persistent deficits. Statistical analyses revealed no difference in surgical efficacy or complications in the long term between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Slightly remaining vascular contact does not affect pain relief in the long term. Our study indicated that once the tense trigeminal nerve is loosened, further attempts to mobilize the VBA are not necessary.","output":"Microvascular decompression for trigeminal neuralgia attributable to the vertebrobasilar artery: decompression technique and significance of separation from the nerve root."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Neck pain is a common condition that leads to serious pain, disability, and increased healthcare costs worldwide. Pharmacotherapy is one of the most common strategies to reduce neck pain in patients. The aim of this study was to analyze the real-world pattern of drugs prescribed for patients with neck pain in the USA. METHODS Data on individuals who reported current neck pain in the 2009-2010 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and with a history of persistent pain for at least 6 weeks or 3 months were extracted from the NHANES database. Those included in the study were divided into three groups based on the duration of pain: the without neck pain group (Group A); subacute group (Group B) with a history of 6 weeks of neck pain; and the chronic neck pain group (Group C) with a history of 3 months of neck pain. The use and duration of medication prescribed for Group A, B, and C patients were compared. RESULTS The analysis revealed that opioid use was significantly more prevalent in the subacute and chronic neck pain group than in the without neck pain group (Group A) (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 4.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.07-8.52 and aOR 7.00, 95% CI 4.32-11.33, respectively). The factors strongly associated with higher opioid use included older age, low education level, and low family income. In the chronic neck group, opioids, followed in decreasing order of frequency by acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-infammatory drugs, were the most common analgesics used in combination with other analgesics. CONCLUSION Our analysis of the data shows that the long-term excessive use of opioids and the underutilization of other analgesics are two major issues in the treatment of neck pain in the USA. Possible improvements include improved education of patients by healthcare professionals on the use of opioids and more consideration given to non-pharmacotherapy options. Our results reveal the potential problem in pharmacotherapy choices for neck pain treatment and may help improve the current clinical practice in the USA and other countries.","output":"Real-World Evidence in Prescription Medication Use Among U.S. Adults with Neck Pain."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been rapidly spreading on a global scale and poses a great threat to human health. Acute respiratory distress syndrome, characterized by a rapid onset of generalized inflammation, is the leading cause of mortality in patients with COVID-19. We thus aimed to explore the effect of risk factors on the severity of the disease, focusing on immune-inflammatory parameters, which represent the immune status of patients. Methods: A comprehensive systematic search for relevant studies published up to April 2020 was performed by using the PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and China National Knowledge Internet (CNKI) databases. After extracting all available data of immune-inflammatory indicators, we statistically analyzed the risk factors of severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients with a meta-analysis. Results: A total of 4,911 patients from 29 studies were included in the final meta-analysis. The results demonstrated that severe patients tend to present with increased white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), procalcitonin (PCT), C-reaction protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and a decreased number of total lymphocyte and lymphocyte subtypes, such as CD4+ T lymphocyte and CD8+ T lymphocyte, compared to the non-severe patients. In addition, the WBC count>10  10(9)/L, lymphocyte count<1  10(9)/L, PCT>0.5 ng/mL, and CRP>10 mg/L were risk factors for disease progression in patients with COVID-19 (WBC count>10  10(9)/L: OR = 2.92, 95% CI: 1.96C4.35; lymphocyte count<1  10(9)/L: OR = 4.97, 95% CI: 3.53C6.99; PCT>0.5 ng/mL: OR = 6.33, 95% CI: 3.97C10.10; CRP>10 mg/L: OR = 3.51, 95% CI: 2.38C5.16). Furthermore, we found that NLR, as a novel marker of systemic inflammatory response, can also help predict clinical severity in patients with COVID-19 (OR = 2.50, 95% CI: 2.04C3.06). Conclusions: Immune-inflammatory parameters, such as WBC, lymphocyte, PCT, CRP, and NLR, could imply the progression of COVID-19. NLR has taken both the levels of neutrophil and lymphocyte into account, indicating a more complete, accurate, and reliable inspection efficiency; surveillance of NLR may help clinicians identify high-risk COVID-19 patients at an early stage.","output":"Immune-Inflammatory Parameters in COVID-19 Cases: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Several vaccines have been approved for use against coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and distributed globally in different regions. However, general community knowledge, attitudes and perceptions towards COVID-19 vaccinations are poorly understood. Thus, the study aimed to investigate community knowledge, attitudes and perceptions towards COVID-19 vaccinations in Bangladesh. METHODS: An exploratory and anonymous population-based e-survey was conducted among 1658 general individuals (55.6% male; mean age = 23.17  6.05 years; age range = 18C65 years). The survey was conducted using a semi-structured and self-reported questionnaire containing informed consent along with four sections (i.e., socio-demographics, knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions). Multiple linear regression was performed to determine the variables predicting knowledge, and attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccinations. RESULTS: The mean scores of knowledge and attitudes were 2.83  1.48 (out of 5) and 9.34  2.39 (out of 12) respectively. About a quarter of participants thought that the COVID-19 vaccination available in Bangladesh is safe, only 60% will have the vaccination and about two-thirds will recommend it to family and friends. In the multiple regression model, higher SES, having university/ higher levels of education, having nuclear families and having previous history of essential vaccines uptake were associated with knowledge; whilst attitudes were significantly associated with being female and having previous history of essential vaccines uptake. Just over half of the participants thought that everyone should be vaccinated and 61% responded that health workers should be vaccinated first on priority basis. 95% of respondents believed the vaccine should be administered free of charge in Bangladesh and almost 90% believed that the COVID-19 vaccine used in Bangladesh may have side effects. CONCLUSIONS: The findings reflect inadequate knowledge but more positive attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccine among the general population in Bangladesh.

Although many cases of dehiscence can be managed non-operatively, major leakage requires a second surgery and can potentially lead to death. Therefore, accurate and immediate diagnosis and treatment are essential. CASE PRESENTATION In this report, we describe a 66-year-old Japanese man who was diagnosed with a complete separation of an esophagojejunal anastomosis after laparoscopic total gastrectomy with oral contrast radiography using Gastrografin?. The severe complication was successfully treated by re-anastomosis after two emergency drainage surgeries. After the second surgery, the esophageal end formed a fistula with the jejunum, but balloon dilation failed to open the fistula. Therefore, oral ingestion and conservative treatment were considered unsuitable, and we performed esophagojejunal re-anastomosis 7 months after the first surgery. At a follow-up examination 2 years after re-anastomosis, the patient weighed 47 kg, and his ingestion had recovered to 80% of that before surgery. CONCLUSIONS Complete separation of an esophagojejunal anastomosis is a rare but severe complication of total gastrectomy. Therefore, we consider that once separation is diagnosed, aggressive and urgent re-operation and effective drainage are useful. Moreover, it is necessary to take great care to minimize the operative morbidity associated with esophagojejunal anastomosis.","output":"Successful treatment of refractory complete separation of an esophagojejunal anastomosis after laparoscopic total gastrectomy: a case report."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES The aim of this longitudinal study was to examine whether the onset and the end of obesity was associated with loneliness. METHOD Nationally representative longitudinal data from Germany were taken from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (wave 5 to wave 7; n = 10,446 observations in the analytical sample). Using the three item loneliness scale (UCLA), loneliness was measured. According to the WHO thresholds, obesity was defined as BMI  30 kg/m2. Asymmetric fixed effects (FE) regressions were used. RESULTS Conventional FE regression analysis revealed that changes in obesity status were associated with changes in loneliness (men:  = -.19, p < .05; women:  = .19, p < .05). Asymmetric FE regressions showed that in men the onset of obesity was associated with a decrease in loneliness ( = -.31, p < .05), whereas the end of obesity was not associated with loneliness. Asymmetric FE regressions showed that in women, the onset of obesity was associated with an increase in loneliness ( = .33, p < .01), whereas the end of obesity was not associated with loneliness. CONCLUSION Findings showed that the onset of obesity has different consequences in terms of loneliness for older women and men in Germany, whereas the end of obesity was not associated with changes in loneliness scores. We recommend that future studies should distinguish between the onset and the end of obesity - which comes along with important practical implications. When older women report transitions to obesity, efforts to prevent loneliness may be of importance.","output":"Asymmetric effects of obesity on loneliness among older Germans.

This paper presents a pilot investigation on the geochemical transformation of DNTs affected by historical wastewater spillage from a typical TNT production company in Northwest China. In the horizontal direction, DNTs diffused from the evaporation pond to the surrounding area of the site, and the concentration of DNTs in the evaporation pond surface soil exceeded 1000 mg/kg. The horizontal distribution of DNTs in the site showed a migration trend to the east and south of evaporation, which was consistent with the terrain of high northwest and low southeast of the site. Due to the high water solubility of pollutants, water flow is the main driving force for the horizontal distribution of DNTs. In the vertical direction, the concentration of pollutants gradually increased with the depth of the soil. DNTs are mainly adsorbed in the third layer (6.0-8.0 m). It can be seen that the accumulation of the 2,4-DNTs-3-SO3- is obviously larger than that of the 2,4-DNTs-5-SO3-, which may be related to the steric hindrance effect of sulfonic acid groups in the two isomers. Results showed DNTs distribution strongly linked to soil physicochemical properties and the migration of DNTs in soil exhibited obvious heterogeneity in time and space. The carcinogenic risks in surface soil (0-1.5 m) and lower soil (1.5-6.0 m, 6.0-8.0 m) are all higher than 1?10-6; non-carcinogenic risk surface soil (0-1.5 m) is 4.011?10, which is greater than 1, indicating that they may cause certain harm to the human body.

Some of the first actions taken by governments are the closing of schools. The evidence that mandatory school closures reduce the number of cases and, ultimately, mortality comes from experience with influenza or from models that do not include the effect of school closure on the health-care labour force. The potential benefits from school closures need to be weighed against costs of health-care worker absenteeism associated with additional child-care obligations. In this study, we aimed to measure child-care obligations for US health-care workers arising from school closures when these are used as a social distancing measure. We then assessed how important the contribution of health-care workers would have to be in reducing mortality for their absenteeism due to child-care obligations to undo the benefits of school closures in reducing the number of cases. METHODS: For this modelling analysis, we used data from the monthly releases of the US Current Population Survey to characterise the family structure and probable within-household child-care options of US health-care workers. We accounted for the occupation within the health-care sector, state, and household structure to identify the segments of the health-care workforce that are most exposed to child-care obligations from school closures. We used these estimates to identify the critical level at which the importance of health-care labour supply in increasing the survival probability of a patient with COVID-19 would undo the benefits of school closures and ultimately increase cumulative mortality. FINDINGS: Between January, 2018, and January, 2020, the US Current Population Survey included information on more than 31 million individuals across 13 million households. We found that the US health-care sector has some of the highest child-care obligations in the USA, with 288% (95% CI 285C291) of the health-care workforce needing to provide care for children aged 3C12 years. Assuming non-working adults or a sibling aged 13 years or older can provide child care, 150% (148C152) of the health-care workforce would still be in need of child care during a school closure. We observed substantial variation within the health-care system. We estimated that, combined with reasonable parameters for COVID-19 such as a 150% case reduction from school closings and 20% baseline mortality rate, a 150% decrease in the health-care labour force would need to decrease the survival probability per percent health-care worker lost by 176% for a school closure to increase cumulative mortality. Our model estimates that if the infection mortality rate of COVID-19 increases from 200% to 235% when the health-care workforce declines by 150%, school closures could lead to a greater number of deaths than they prevent. INTERPRETATION: School closures come with many trade-offs, and can create unintended child-care obligations. Our results suggest that the potential contagion prevention from school closures needs to be carefully weighted with the potential loss of health-care workers from the standpoint of reducing cumulative mortality due to COVID-19, in the absence of mitigating measures. FUNDING: None.","output":"Impact of school closures for COVID-19 on the US health-care workforce and net mortality: a modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemics like influenza and plague have posed a great threat to humanity in the past Recent outbreak of COVID-19, a viral pandemic, has motivated the global community for social distancing and enforcement of lockdown Teledermatology practice (TP) is an effective, safe, and fast medium to reach one who is difficult to reach It is a medium for a dermatologist to cater the needy patients Store-and-forward (SAF) teledermatology mobile apps (e g , WhatsApp) perform to capture, transfer, and store the clinical images This overview provides an insight to TP In an Indian scenario, SAF TP meets the technical requirement, economical, and easy to practice Spotters, pediatric, geriatric, and chronic cases are managed with TP The Indian Association of Dermatologists, Venereologists, and Leprologists in view of COVID-19 situation encourages its members to perform TP and provide care The members may practice TP after observing all conditions as in telemedicine guidelines prepared by the National Medical Council with due caution","output":"Teledermatology practice in the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Isotype-specific antibody responses to bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV1) were measured in sera, nasal, ocular and genital secretions of calves that were reinfected with BHV1 and 6 weeks later treated with corticosteroids to reactivate putative latent virus. After reinfection and after reactivation, no BHV1-specific IgM antibody response was detected. The serum IgA response was only transiently detectable after reinfection and again appeared rapidly after reactivation in most calves. Most calves showed an increase in nasal and ocular IgA titres after reinfection and reactivation; some calves also had IgA antibodies in genital secretions. A salient finding was that after reinfection and reactivation more calves showed a serum IgA response than virus shedding or an increase in serum IgG1 or IgG2 titres. This suggests that the serum IgA response would be the most sensitive indicator to detect BHV1 reinfection and reactivation. No correlation was found between nasal IgA titre at the time of reinfection or corticosteroid treatment and the period of virus shedding, suggesting that nasal IgA does not play a major role in protection against reinfection with BHV1.","output":"Isotype-specific antibody responses to bovine herpesvirus 1 in sera and mucosal secretions of calves after experimental reinfection and after reactivation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 epidemic a public health emergency of international concern on March 11th, 2020, and the pandemic is rapidly spreading worldwide. COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which enters human target cells via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We used a number of bioinformatics tools to computationally characterize ACE2 by determining its cell-specific expression in trachea, lung, and small intestine, derive its putative functions, and predict transcriptional regulation. The small intestine expressed higher levels of ACE2 mRNA than any other organ. By immunohistochemistry, duodenum, kidney and testis showed strong signals, whereas the signal was weak in the respiratory tract. Single cell RNA-Seq data from trachea indicated positive signals along the respiratory tract in key protective cell types including club, goblet, proliferating, and ciliary epithelial cells; while in lung the ratio of ACE2-expressing cells was low in all cell types (<2.6%), but was highest in vascular endothelial and goblet cells. Gene ontology analysis suggested that, besides its classical role in the renin-angiotensin system, ACE2 may be functionally associated with angiogenesis/blood vessel morphogenesis. Using a novel tool for the prediction of transcription factor binding sites we identified several putative binding sites within two tissue-specific promoters of the ACE2 gene as well as a new putative short form of ACE2. These include several interferon-stimulated response elements sites for STAT1, IRF8, and IRF9. Our results also confirmed that age and gender play no significant role in the regulation of ACE2 mRNA expression in the lung.","output":"Bioinformatic characterization of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and restricted occupancy in work and school settings, there is a heightened risk for Legionella infection.

Social workers in particular experience this crisis by providing direct practice and macro-level interventions across a myriad of occupations and ecological systems. Consequently, the prevalence of occupational stress issues, especially shared trauma and burnout, has intensified. Although these are not new issues for healthcare workers, including social workers, COVID-19 has underscored the importance of protecting them with the most effective and practical approaches to alleviate shared stress and burnout. COVID-19 also demonstrates the limitations of self-care, one of the most touted frameworks to reduce shared stress and burnout. This chapter critically examines why self-care has assumed prominence in social work discourse and education, emphasizing its synergy with neoliberal values. It then explores how the intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the deficiencies of self-care. Finally, suggestions are offered that center on structurally mitigating the effects of burnout and shared trauma in social work caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although self-care can be useful in specific roles, the primary onus for reduction of both burnout and shared trauma should be shifted from the individual worker to the organization.","output":"How COVID-19 Exposed an Inadequate Approach to Burnout: Moving Beyond Self-Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Managing education and research during pandemics has increased in importance since the onset of epidemics such as avian flu, SARS and now CoViD-19.

To date, however, no general pandemic preparedness frameworks exist for IHEs. The aim of this paper is to report on the development of a Haddon matrix framework for IHE pandemic preparedness based on a scoping literature review of past IHE responses including pre-, during and post-pandemic phases. First, a review of previous global responses by IHEs during past pandemics was carried out. The review findings were then collated into a new IHE-centric Haddon matrix for pandemic preparedness. The content of the matrix is then illustrated through the documented responses of Malaysian universities during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The resulting IHE Haddon matrix can be used by universities as a general guide to identify preparedness gaps and intervention opportunities for business continuity during pandemics.","output":"Development of a Haddon Matrix Framework for Higher Education Pandemic Preparedness: Scoping Review and Experiences of Malaysian Universities During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cross-border services and support are becoming an increasingly important part of Hong Kong's social policy because an increasing number of its older citizens are choosing to live in mainland China.

Few studies, however, on LCHF diets have been completed in a real-world primary care setting over an extended period of time. OBJECTIVES: To examine the efficacy of a low-carbohydrate, high-fat dietary educational intervention delivered in a family practice setting on weight, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting insulin, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR). A secondary objective was to determine whether compliance to the program had an effect on outcomes. METHODS: In this retrospective chart review, we collected laboratory and anthropometric data from an electronic medical record system for patients (n = 122) at least 19 years of age, who attended at least 2 LCHF educational sessions between January 2018 and May 2020. Pre-post mean differences of outcome were analysed using paired sample t-tests. Independent sample t-tests examined the effect of compliance on the outcomes. RESULTS: Statistically significant reductions in weight (3.96 kg [P < 0.001]) and BMI (1.46 kg/m2 [P = 0.001]) were observed. Compared with patients who participated in 5 educational visits, patients who participated in >5 visits showed trends towards more clinically significant changes in weight, BMI, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, HbA1c, eGFR, and ACR. CONCLUSION: Improvements in weight and BMI indicate the utility of providing LCHF health promotion interventions in primary care settings.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study using a 20-question survey that used SeziureTracker.com, sent to eligible PWE and their caregivers on May 6th, 2020. Questions about demographics and medical history were used to calculate COVID mortality risk odds ratios (OR) compared to a low baseline risk group. RESULTS: In total, 505 responses were collected. Of these, 71% reported no change in seizure rates and 25% reported an increase in seizures, which they attributed primarily to disrupted sleep (63%) and decreased exercise (42%). Mortality risks from COVID-19 had median OR of 1.67, ranging 1.00-906.98. Fear about hospitalization (53%) and concern for loved ones (52%) were prominent concerns. Of the respondents, 5% reported stopping or reducing anti-seizure medications due to problems communicating with doctors, access or cost. Lower-risk COVID patients reported more fear of hospitalization (55% versus 38%, p<0.001) and anxiety about medication access (43% versus 28%, p=0.03) compared with higher-risk COVID patients. Increased anxiety was reported in 47%, and increased depression in 28%. Ten percent without generalized convulsions and 8% with did not know anything about epilepsy devices (VNS, RNS, DBS).

METHODS: We analyzed 2817 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients enrolled in the Lean European Open Survey on SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and identified 426 patients with pre-existing CKD. Group comparisons were performed via Chi-squared test. Using univariate and multivariable logistic regression, predictive factors for mortality were identified. RESULTS: Comparative analyses to patients without CKD revealed a higher mortality (140/426, 32.9% versus 354/2391, 14.8%). Higher age could be confirmed as a demographic predictor for mortality in CKD patients (> 85 years compared to 15-65 years, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 6.49, 95% CI 1.27-33.20, p = 0.025).

MCO enforcement has made Malaysians spend most of their time staying at home, and even some have lost their income source. Another sector that has been greatly affected is the educational sector. Todays landscape of education has changed dramatically with the phenomenal rise of virtual classes from home. Learning and teaching processes are undertaken remotely and on digital platforms to curb the spreading of the virus. This situation has affected the lesson and learning process from home to many of the several students in Malaysia. Therefore, this study investigates the challenges of home learning during MCO among students in the Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Pahang Branch. A simple random sampling technique was used to distribute the online survey questionnaires, involving a sample of 213 students. Besides, a descriptive statistic was used to study the students demographic characteristics according to the challenges. In contrast, logistic regression analysis was used to determine the factors associated with home learning challenges during MCO. Based on the findings, most male and female students were not well prepared for home learning during MCO, with a percentage of 71.60% and 69.70%, respectively. As a result, 79.81% agreed that home learning is more stressful than the physical classes on the campus. In comparison, 79.63% of Social Science and 83.02% of Science and Technology students claimed that the workload given is way more significant during online classes. Furthermore, this study concludes that the most associated challenges of home learning faced by the students during MCO are the abundance of workload and loss of interest in the subject.","output":"Challenges of home learning during movement control order among UiTM Pahang students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Rhinoviruses (RV) are a well-established cause of respiratory illness. RV-C has been associated with more severe illness. We aimed to characterize and compare the clinical presentations and disease severity of different RV type circulating in South Africa. METHOD: We performed two analyses of RV-positive specimens identified through surveillance in South Africa across all age groups. First, RV-positive specimens identified through severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) surveillance in four provinces was randomly selected from 2009 to 2010 for molecular characterization. Second, RV-positive specimens identified through SARI, influenza-like illness (ILI) and control surveillance at hospitals and outpatient clinics in during 2012C2013 were used to determine the association of RV type with severe disease. Selected specimens were sequenced, and phylogenetic analysis was performed. RESULTS: Among the 599 sequenced specimens from 2009 to 2010 and 2012 to 2013, RV-A (285, 48%) and RV-C (247, 41%) were more commonly identified than RV-B (67, 11%), with no seasonality and a high genetic diversity. A higher prevalence of RV infection was identified in cases with SARI [515/962 (26%); aRRR = 16; 95% CI 121; 22] and ILI [356/962 (28%); aRRR = 19; 95% CI 137; 26] compared with asymptomatic controls (91/962, 22%). There was no difference in disease severity between the different type when comparing SARI, ILI and controls. CONCLUSION: All three type of RV were identified in South Africa, although RV-A and RV-C were more common than RV-B. RV was associated with symptomatic respiratory illness; however, there was no association between RV type and disease severity.","output":"Genetic diversity and molecular epidemiology of human rhinoviruses in South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gross anatomy knowledge is an essential element for medical students in their education, and nowadays, cadaver-based instruction represents the main instructional tool able to provide three-dimensional (3D) and topographical comprehensions. The aim of the study was to develop and test a prototype of an innovative tool for medical education in human anatomy based on the combination of augmented reality (AR) technology and a tangible 3D printed model that can be explored and manipulated by trainees, thus favoring a three-dimensional and topographical learning approach. After development of the tool, called AEducaAR (Anatomical Education with Augmented Reality), it was tested and evaluated by 62 second-year degree medical students attending the human anatomy course at the International School of Medicine and Surgery of the University of Bologna. Students were divided into two groups: AEducaAR-based learning (AEducaAR group) was compared to standard learning using human anatomy atlas (Control group). Both groups performed an objective test and an anonymous questionnaire. In the objective test, the results showed no significant difference between the two learning methods; instead, in the questionnaire, students showed enthusiasm and interest for the new tool and highlighted its training potentiality in open-ended comments. Therefore, the presented AEducaAR tool, once implemented, may contribute to enhancing students motivation for learning, increasing long-term memory retention and 3D comprehension of anatomical structures. Moreover, this new tool might help medical students to approach to innovative medical devices and technologies useful in their future careers.","output":"AEducaAR, Anatomical Education in Augmented Reality: A Pilot Experience of an Innovative Educational Tool Combining AR Technology and 3D Printing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: mRNA vaccines for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) illicit strong humoral and cellular responses and have high efficacy for preventing and reducing the risk of severe illness from COVID-19. Since solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients were excluded from the phase 3 trials, the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine remains unknown. Understanding the serological responses to COVID vaccines among SOT recipients is essential to better understand vaccine protection for this vulnerable population. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, a subset of SOT recipients who were part of our centers larger antibody study were enrolled prior to receipt of two doses of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer, Inc) vaccine for high resolution immunophenotyping. To date, plasma has been collected for 10 participants on the day of their first dose (baseline), day of their second dose, and 28 days post second dose. 23 healthy participants planning to receive either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 (ModernaTX, Inc) were also enrolled, providing plasma at the same timepoints. Ultrasensitive single-molecule array (Simoa) assays were used to detect SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S), S1, receptor-binding domain (RBD) and Nucleocapsid (N) IgG antibodies. RESULTS: Participant demographics and SOT recipient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Low titers of anti-N IgG at all timepoints indicate no natural infection with COVID-19 during the study (Fig 1A). There were significantly lower magnitudes for anti-S (p< 0.0001), anti-S1 (p< 0.0001), and anti-RBD (p< 0.0001) IgG titers on the day of dose 2 and day 28 post second dose for SOT recipients compared to healthy controls (Fig 1B,C,D). Using the internally validated threshold of anti-S IgG >1.07 based on pre-pandemic controls, only 50% of the SOT sub-cohort responded to vaccine after series completion (Fig 2). There was a positive trend between months from transplant and anti-S IgG titer (Fig 3). Table 1: Demographics [Image: see text] Figure 1: Anti-N, Anti-S, Anti-S1, Anti-RBD and Anti-N Ig G for healthy v. SOT cohort [Image: see text] Black error bars denote median and 95% CI. The dotted line on panel B denotes an internally validated cutoff of 1.07; anti-S IgG titers greater than 1.07 denote a positive response. Figure 3: Time from Transplant v. anti-S IgG Titer [Image: see text] SOT recipients further out from transplant tend to have a higher anti-S IgG response. The dotted line denotes an internally validated cutoff, with anti-S IgG titers greater than 1.07 indicating a positive response. CONCLUSION: SOT recipients had a significantly decreased humoral response to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines compared to the healthy cohort, with those further out from transplant more likely to respond. Further research is needed to evaluate T-cell responses and clinical efficacy to maximize the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine response among SOT recipients. [Image: see text] DISCLOSURES: Ann E.

We report three patients with critical respiratory failure due to Covid-19, in which all presented with severe hypoxemia refractory to supplemental oxygen therapy. We discuss possible strategies for ventilatory support in the emergency pre-hospital setting, and point out some pitfalls regarding the management of these patients. Guidelines for pre-hospital care of critically ill Covid-19 patients cannot be established based on the current evidence base, and we have to apply our understanding of respiratory physiology and mechanics in order to optimize respiratory support. METHODS: Three cases with similar clinical presentation were identified within the Norwegian national helicopter emergency medical service (HEMS) system. The HEMS units are manned by a consultant anaesthesiologist. Patient's next of kin and the Regional committee for medical and health research ethics approved the publication of this report. CONCLUSION: Patients with Covid-19 and severe hypoxemia may pose a considerable challenge for the pre-hospital emergency medical services. Intubation may be associated with a high risk of complications in these patients and should be carried out with diligence when considered necessary. The following interventions are worth considering in Covid-19 patients with refractory hypoxemia before proceeding to intubation. First, administering oxygen via a tight fitting BVM with an oxygen flow rate that exceeds the patient's ventilatory minute volume. Second, applying continuous positive airway pressure, while simultaneously maintaining a high FiO2. Finally, assuming the patient is cooperative, repositioning to prone position.","output":"Pre-hospital critical care management of severe hypoxemia in victims of Covid-19: a case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Approximately 800 people are diagnosed with osteosarcoma (OSA) per year in the USA. Although 70% of patients with localized OSA are cured with multiagent chemotherapy and surgical resection, the prognosis for patients with metastatic or relapsed disease is guarded. The small number of patients diagnosed annually contributes to an incomplete understanding of disease pathogenesis, and challenges in performing appropriately powered clinical trials and detecting correlative biomarkers of response. While mouse models of OSA are becoming increasingly sophisticated, they generally fail to accurately recapitulate tumor heterogeneity, tumor microenvironment (TME), systemic immune dysfunction, and the clinical features of tumor recurrence, metastases, and chemoresistance, which influence outcome. Pet dogs spontaneously develop OSA with an incidence that is 30-50 times higher than humans. Canine OSA parallels the human disease in its clinical presentation, biological behavior, genetic complexity, and therapeutic management. However, despite therapy, most dogs die from metastatic disease within 1 year of diagnosis. Since OSA occurs in immune-competent dogs, immune factors that sculpt tumor immunogenicity and influence responses to immune modulation are in effect. In both species, immune modulation has shown beneficial effects on patient outcome and work is now underway to identify the most effective immunotherapies, combination of immunotherapies, and correlative biomarkers that will further improve clinical response. In this chapter, the immune landscape of canine OSA and the immunotherapeutic strategies used to modulate antitumor immunity in dogs with the disease will be reviewed. From this immunological viewpoint, the value of employing dogs with spontaneous OSA to accelerate and inform the translation of immunotherapies into the human clinic will be underscored.","output":"Comparative Immunology and Immunotherapy of Canine Osteosarcoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Healthcare workers facing the threatening COVID-19 can experience severe difficulties Despite the need to evaluate both the psychological distress and positive protective resources, brief and reliable assessment tools are lacking Aim: Study 1 aimed at developing a new assessment tool to measure psychological distress and esteem in healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic Study 2 aimed to explore and compare the psychological reactions of healthcare workers of the COVID-19 and the non-COVID-19 wards","output":"Psychological Differences Among Healthcare Workers of a Rehabilitation Institute During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Two-Step Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To replicate and analyse the information available to UK policymakers when the lockdown decision was taken in March 2020 in the United Kingdom. DESIGN: Independent calculations using the CovidSim code, which implements Imperial College Londons individual based model, with data available in March 2020 applied to the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) epidemic. SETTING: Simulations considering the spread of covid-19 in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. POPULATION: About 70 million simulated people matched as closely as possible to actual UK demographics, geography, and social behaviours. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Replication of summary data on the covid-19 epidemic reported to the UK government Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), and a detailed study of unpublished results, especially the effect of school closures. RESULTS: The CovidSim model would have produced a good forecast of the subsequent data if initialised with a reproduction number of about 3.5 for covid-19. The model predicted that school closures and isolation of younger people would increase the total number of deaths, albeit postponed to a second and subsequent waves. The findings of this study suggest that prompt interventions were shown to be highly effective at reducing peak demand for intensive care unit (ICU) beds but also prolong the epidemic, in some cases resulting in more deaths long term. This happens because covid-19 related mortality is highly skewed towards older age groups. In the absence of an effective vaccination programme, none of the proposed mitigation strategies in the UK would reduce the predicted total number of deaths below 200 000. CONCLUSIONS: It was predicted in March 2020 that in response to covid-19 a broad lockdown, as opposed to a focus on shielding the most vulnerable members of society, would reduce immediate demand for ICU beds at the cost of more deaths long term. The optimal strategy for saving lives in a covid-19 epidemic is different from that anticipated for an influenza epidemic with a different mortality age profile.","output":"Effect of school closures on mortality from coronavirus disease 2019: old and new predictions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The learning process during a pandemic requires teachers to be more interactive in making online learning media.

For curriculum simplification, only the main material in learning activities needs to be conveyed, while for practice it can be independently or through an application media. This study aims to create an augmented reality-based learning media on geometry in mathematics subjects for grade 5 elementary school. This media can make it easier for students to understand the shapes with augmented reality and there is a learning video feature that also explains the material presented by the teacher. With the black box white box method, the application is developed by adjusting the curriculum simplification planned by the government.

In some cases, it occurs in isolation, and in others, it occurs as part of a multisystem disorder, severe visual impairment or neurological disorder. Similarly, in some cases, visual acuity can be normal and in others can be severely degraded. Furthermore, the impact on vision goes well beyond static acuity alone, is rarely measured and may vary on a minute-to-minute, day-to-day or month-to-month basis. For these reasons, management of children with nystagmus in the UK is varied, and patients report hugely different experiences and investigations. In this review, we hope to shine a light on the current management of children with nystagmus across five specialist centres in the UK in order to present, for the first time, a consensus on investigation and clinical management.","output":"Management of nystagmus in children: a review of the literature and current practice in UK specialist services"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Object detection is one of the most fundamental and challenging tasks to locate objects in images and videos.

They shed virus in their stool. Municipal sewage systems carry the virus and its genetic remnants. These viral traces can be detected in the sewage entering a wastewater treatment plant (WTP). Such virus signals indicate community infections but not locations of the infection within the community. In this paper, we frame and formulate the problem in a way that leads to algorithmic procedures homing in on locations and/or neighborhoods within the community that are most likely to have infections. Our data source is wastewater sampled and real-time tested from selected manholes. Our algorithms dynamically and adaptively develop a sequence of manholes to sample and test. The algorithms are often finished after 5 to 10 manhole samples, meaning thatin the fieldthe procedure can be carried out within one day. The goal is to provide timely information that will support faster more productive human testing for viral infection and thus reduce community disease spread. Leveraging the tree graph structure of the sewage system, we develop two algorithms, the first designed for a community that is certified at a given time to have zero infections and the second for a community known to have many infections. For the first, we assume that wastewater at the WTP has just revealed traces of SARS-CoV-2, indicating existence of a Patient Zero in the community. This first algorithm identifies the city block in which the infected person resides. For the second, we home in on a most infected neighborhood of the community, where a neighborhood is usually several city blocks.

Many physicians across the globe are changing practice patterns in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We sought to examine the practice changes among rheumatologists and what they perceive the impact to be on their most vulnerable patients. METHODS: We administered an online survey to a convenience sample of rheumatologists worldwide during the initial height of the pandemic (between 8 April and 4 May 2020) via social media and group emails. We surveyed rheumatologists about their opinions regarding patients from low SES and racial/ethnic minority groups in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mainly, what their specific concerns were, including the challenges of medication access; and about specific social factors (health literacy, poverty, food insecurity, access to telehealth video) that may be complicating the management of rheumatologic conditions during this time. RESULTS: 548 rheumatologists responded from 64 countries and shared concerns of food insecurity, low health literacy, poverty and factors that preclude social distancing such as working and dense housing conditions among their patients. Although 82% of rheumatologists had switched to telehealth video, 17% of respondents estimated that about a quarter of their patients did not have access to telehealth video, especially those from below the poverty line. The majority of respondents believed these vulnerable patients, from racial/ethnic minorities and from low SES groups, would do worse, in terms of morbidity and mortality, during the pandemic.

Therefore, we evaluated neutralizing antibody responses in paired plasma and endotracheal aspirates of pediatric severe, acute COVID-19 or MIS-C patients against SARS-CoV-2 WA1/2020, as well as against variants of concern (VOCs). Neutralizing antibody responses against the SARS-CoV-2 WA1/2020 strain in pediatric plasma were 2-fold or 35-fold higher compared with the matched endotracheal aspirate in COVID-19 or MIS-C patients, respectively. In contrast to plasma, neutralizing antibody responses against the VOCs and variants of interest (VOIs) in endotracheal aspirates were lower, with only one endotracheal aspirate demonstrating neutralizing titers against the Iota, Kappa, Beta, Gamma, and Omicron variants.

METHODS: This cross-sectional online survey was conducted (in community pharmacies in the United Arab Emirates) over 3 weeks (24 May 2020 to 14 June 2020). A proportionate random sample of 491 participants was invited to take part. The SPSS version 26 was used for data management and analysis. KEY FINDINGS: The majority of participants (n = 400) had good knowledge about COVID-19 and high level of preparedness for the pandemic control. Most pharmacists agreed (212, 53.0%) or strongly agreed (91, 22.8%) that they have a major role in the management of the ongoing crisis. Most participants had good awareness about the most common methods of COVID-19 transmission (359, 89.7%) and symptoms encountered (368, 92.0%). However, approximately a quarter of participants (103, 25.7%) incorrectly thought COVID-19 was caused by a DNA virus. Participants who had 5-10 and >10 years of experience were 3.95 (P = 0.03) and 1.59 (P = 0.01) times, respectively, were more likely to have good knowledge compared to participants with less than 2 years of experience. Those with good knowledge were more likely to have a specific area for customers with suspected COVID-19 symptoms compared to those with poor knowledge (P = 0.031).

However, questions remain regarding its performance in high-risk healthcare occupations and work locations. We describe the effect of a COVID-19 HCP vaccination campaign on SARS-CoV-2 infection by timing of vaccination, job type, and work location. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of COVID-19 vaccination acceptance, incidence of postvaccination COVID-19, hospitalization, and mortality among 16,156 faculty, students, and staff at a large academic medical center. Data were collected 8 weeks prior to the start of phase 1a vaccination of frontline employees and ended 11 weeks after campaign onset. RESULTS: The COVID-19 incidence rate among HCP at our institution decreased from 3.2% during the 8 weeks prior to the start of vaccinations to 0.38% by 4 weeks after campaign initiation. COVID-19 risk was reduced among individuals who received a single vaccination (hazard ratio [HR], 0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40C0.68; P < .0001) and was further reduced with 2 doses of vaccine (HR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.09C0.32; P < .0001). By 2 weeks after the second dose, the observed case positivity rate was 0.04%. Among phase 1a HCP, we observed a lower risk of COVID-19 among physicians and a trend toward higher risk for respiratory therapists independent of vaccination status. Rates of infection were similar in a subgroup of nurses when examined by work location. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show the real-world effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in HCP. Despite these encouraging results, unvaccinated HCP remain at an elevated risk of infection, highlighting the need for targeted outreach to combat vaccine hesitancy.","output":"Real-world impact of vaccination on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) incidence in healthcare personnel at an academic medical center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Utilizing a measure of the Bitcoin networks daily electricity load, we document a significant volatility effect of Bitcoin mining activity in three prominent electricity markets in the U.S. The volatility effect is found to be increasing over time, particularly with the widespread lockdowns enforced due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

These asymptomatic carriers contribute to the spread of disease but go largely undetected and can therefore undermine efforts to control transmission. Understanding the natural history of carriage and its relationship to disease is important for the design of effective interventions to control transmission. Mathematical models of infectious diseases are frequently used to inform decisions about control and should therefore accurately capture the role played by asymptomatic carriers. In practice, incorporating asymptomatic carriers into models is challenging due to the sparsity of direct evidence. This absence of data leads to uncertainty in estimates of model parameters and, more fundamentally, in the selection of an appropriate model structure. To assess the implications of this uncertainty, we systematically reviewed published models of carriage and propose a new model of disease transmission with asymptomatic carriage. Analysis of our model shows how different assumptions about the role of asymptomatic carriers can lead to different conclusions about the transmission and control of disease. Critically, selecting an inappropriate model structure, even when parameters are correctly estimated, may lead to over- or under-estimates of intervention effectiveness. Our results provide a more complete understanding of the role of asymptomatic carriers in transmission and highlight the importance of accurately incorporating carriers into models used to make decisions about disease control.","output":"Implications of asymptomatic carriers for infectious disease transmission and control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To describe how a fixed regimen of intravitreal injections (IVI) was helpful to continue activity during the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown and to address basic conditions to resume activity METHODS: A fixed regimen of IVI was conceived to significantly reduce the number of visits while keeping a number of injections related to the best outcomes We retrospectively collected data of surgeries performed in 2019 and in the first seven months of 2020 and from OCTs in the first semester of 2020 RESULTS: IVI per month, from January to July 2020, were 304, 291, 256, 204, 276, 297 and 322, respectively Phacoemulsification surgeries in the same period were 397, 408, 171, 0, 304, 391 and 389 Posterior vitrectomies were 23, 21, 17, 10, 21, 28 and 25 Laser sessions were 44, 26, 33, 17, 23 and 33, respectively OCTs dropped from a mean of 25 7 per day in the first half of March 2020 to 5 8 per day in the second half of March A mean of 6 5 OCTs per day was made in April, rising to 19 1 in May and 39 5 in June CONCLUSION: It was possible to keep the ophthalmological activity during the pandemic outbreak due to the existence of a pre-scheduled fixed regimen for IVI and to the availability of personal protective equipment The air-borne nature of the peril we are facing addresses the need to evaluate the physical conditions of health facilities, including ventilation, size of waiting and consult rooms and the need to avoid elevators","output":"The Paradigm Shift of Ophthalmology in the COVID-19 Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has dramatically changed societies in 2020. Since the end of February, Europe has been hit particularly hard by COVID-19, but there are major country differences in both the spread of the virus and measures taken to stop the virus. Social psychological factors such as institutional trust could be important in understanding the development of the epidemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine country variations of COVID-19 mortality in Europe by analyzing social risk factors explaining the spread of the disease, restrictions and control measures, and institutional trust. METHODS: The present study was based on a background analysis of European Social Survey data on 25 European countries (N=47,802). Multilevel mixed effects linear regression models focused on 84 days of the COVID-19 epidemic (January 22 to April 14, 2020) and modelled the daily COVID-19 mortality. Analysis focused on the impact of social relations, restrictions, and institutional trust within each country. RESULTS: The spread of the COVID-19 epidemic has been fast everywhere, but the findings revealed significant differences between countries in COVID-19 mortality. Perceived sociability predicted higher COVID-19 mortality. Major differences between the 25 countries were found in reaction times to the crisis. Late reaction to the crisis predicted later mortality figures. Institutional trust was associated with lower COVID-19 mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The analyses demonstrated the importance of societal and social psychological factors in the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. By considering multiple perspectives, this study showed that country differences in Europe are major, and this will have an impact on how countries will cope with the ongoing crisis in the following months.

The development of effective interventions to prevent such outcomes is a key priority for research and service provision. This paper reports a protocol designed to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a three arm randomised controlled trial (RCT) within the ED setting and in the patients home. The interventions are comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA), ED PLUS and usual care. METHODS: The ED PLUS pilot trial is designed as a feasibility RCT conducted in the ED and Acute Medical Assessment Unit of a university teaching hospital in the mid-west region of Ireland. We aim to recruit 30 patients, aged 65 years and over presenting to the ED with undifferentiated medical complaints and discharged within 72 h of index visit. Patients will be randomised by a computer in a ratio of 1:1:1 to deliver usual care, CGA or ED PLUS during a 6-month study period. A randomised algorithm is used to perform randomization. CGA will include a medical assessment, medication review, nursing assessment, falls assessment, assessment of mobility and stairs, transfers, personal care, activities of daily living (ADLs), social supports and baseline cognition. ED PLUS, a physiotherapist led, multidisciplinary intervention, aims to bridge the transition of care between the index visit to the ED and the community by initiating a CGA intervention in the ED and implementing a 6-week follow-up self-management programme in the patients own home following discharge from the ED. The outcomes will be parameters of the feasibility of the intervention and trial methods and will be assessed quantitatively and qualitatively. DISCUSSION: Rising ED visits and an ageing population with chronic health issues render ED interventions to reduce adverse outcomes in older adults a research priority. This feasibility RCT will generate data and experience to inform the conduct and delivery of a definite RCT.

Based on Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, high expression of CXCR4 was found to be associated with worse overall survival (HR = 4.646, p < 0.001) and cancer-specific survival (HR = 4.480, p < 0.001) in tamoxifen-treated breast cancer. CXCR4 was also positively correlated with the level of AKT phosphorylation and the resistance to tamoxifen in breast cancer. AMD3100 is a CXCR4 antagonist and was found to decrease p-AKT levels of tamoxifen-resistant cells. The reversal effect of AMD3100 on tamoxifen resistance was also confirmed in vitro and in vivo.

However, disagreements between the prescribers and ASP personnel can occur. The aim of the present study was to identify the factors associated with nonadherence to PPRF intervention. Methods The present retrospective nested case-control study was performed at a tertiary care center, which has been conducting a once-weekly PPRF for carbapenems and piperacillin/tazobactam since 2014. Nonadherence to ASP recommendations was defined as the failure of the primary care team to modify or stop antimicrobial therapy 72 hours after the issuance of PPRF recommendations. Factors associated with nonadherence to PPRF intervention were identified using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results In total, 2466 instances of PPRF in 1714 cases between April 2014 and September 2019 were found. The nonadherence rate was 5.9%, and 44 cases were found in which carbapenems or piperacillin/tazobactam continued to be used against PPRF recommendations. Factors associated with nonadherence to PPRF recommendations were a previous history of hospitalization within 90 days (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18-5.81) and a rapidly fatal McCabe score at the time of PPRF intervention (aOR, 2.87; 95% CI, 1.18-6.98). A review of the narrative comments in the electronic medical records indicated that common reasons for nonadherence were \\"the patient was sick\\" (n = 12; 27.3%) and \\"the antimicrobial seemed to be clinically effective\\" (n = 9; 20.5%). Conclusions Nonadherence to PPRF recommendations was relatively uncommon at the study institution. However, patients with a severe disease condition frequently continued to receive broad-spectrum antimicrobials against PPRF recommendations.

Thanks to the rapid work of Chinese scientists, the pathogen now called SARS-CoV-2 has been identified and its whole genome was deposited in public databases by early January 2020. The availability of the genome has allowed researchers to develop Reverse TranscriptionPolymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assays, which are now the gold-standard for molecular diagnosis of the respiratory syndrome COVID19. Because of the rising number of cases and rapid spreading, the world has been facing a shortage of RT-PCR supplies, especially the ones involved in RNA extraction. This has been a major bottleneck to increase testing capacity in many countries that do not significantly manufacture these supplies, such as Brazil. Additionally, RT-qPCR scalability is highly dependent on equipment that usually performs testing of 96 samples at a time. In this work, we describe a cost-effective molecular NGS-based test for diagnosis of COVID19, which uses a single-step RNA extraction and presents high scalability and accuracy when compared to the gold-standard RT-qPCR. A single run of the NGS-based test using the Illumina NextSeq 550 mid-end sequencing equipment is able to multiplex 1,536 patients samples, providing individual semi-qualitative results (detected, not detected). Detected results are provided with fragments per million (FPM) values, which was demonstrated to correlate with RT-qPCR Cycle Threshold (CT) values. Besides, usage of the high-end Illumina Novaseq platform may yield diagnostic for up to 6144 samples in a single run. Performance results when compared with RT-qPCR show general accuracy of 96%, and 98% when only samples with CT values (gene N) lower than 30 are considered. We have also developed an online platform, termed VarsVID, to help test executors to easily scale testing numbers. Sample registering, wet-lab worksheets generation, sample sheet for sequencing and results display are all features provided by VarsVID.

The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is a key player in the viral entry into cells through its interaction with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor protein, and the RBD has therefore been crucial as a drug target. In this study, we used phage display to develop human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that neutralize SARS-CoV-2. A human synthetic Fab phage display library was panned against the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SARS-2 RBD), yielding ten unique Fabs with moderate apparent affinities (EC50 = 19-663 nM) for the SARS-2 RBD. All of the Fabs showed no cross-reactivity to the MERS-CoV spike protein, while three Fabs cross-reacted with the SARS-CoV spike protein. Five Fabs showed neutralizing activities in in vitro assays based on the Fabs' activities antagonizing the interaction between the SARS-2 RBD and ACE2. Reformatting the five Fabs into immunoglobulin Gs (IgGs) greatly increased their apparent affinities (KD = 0.08-1.0 nM), presumably due to the effects of avidity, without compromising their non-aggregating properties and thermal stability. Furthermore, two of the mAbs (D12 and C2) significantly showed neutralizing activities on pseudo-typed and authentic SARS-CoV-2. Given their desirable properties and neutralizing activities, we anticipate that these human anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs would be suitable reagents to be further developed as antibody therapeutics to treat COVID-19, as well as for diagnostics and research tools.","output":"Neutralizing Human Antibodies against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Isolated from a Human Synthetic Fab Phage Display Library"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: Various individual, relational, and sociocultural variables have been identified as determinants of sexual responding, but these have rarely been investigated in non-Western cultures that are characterized by sexual conservatism. We aimed to explore the role of socioeconomic status and religion, sexual double standards, erotophobia-erotophilia, sexual dysfunctional beliefs, and relationship satisfaction to explain sexual function and satisfaction in Ecuador. METHOD: 599 participants (431 women and 159 men) completed an online survey. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: The Female sexual function was predicted by sexual satisfaction, relationship satisfaction, sexual dysfunctional beliefs, and sexual double standards, while the male sexual function was predicted solely by sexual satisfaction. Additionally, female sexual satisfaction was predicted by sexual function, relationship satisfaction, and sexual dysfunctional beliefs, while male sexual satisfaction was predicted by sexual function and relationship satisfaction. RESULTS: Female Sexual Function Index, International Index of Erectile Function, Brief Sexual Opinion Survey, Sexual Double Standards Scale, Sexual Dysfunctional Beliefs Questionnaire, New Sexual Satisfaction Scale, and Couple Satisfaction Index. CONCLUSION: This study provided novel information on the determinants of sexual function and satisfaction within a culture in which conservative religious beliefs still prevail. Results should be interpreted with caution given the unequal distribution of men and women, social desirability and volunteer biases, and the specific COVID-19 pandemic context during which the survey took place. Markers of sexual conservatism were inversely related to sexual function and satisfaction, mainly in women, and may, therefore, be important targets of treatment.

Such models have the potential to be deployed on smartphones for fast, widespread, and low-resource testing. However, while previous studies have trained models on cleaned audio samples collected mainly from clinical settings, audio samples collected from average smartphones may yield suboptimal quality data that is different from the clean data that models were trained on. This discrepancy may add a bias that affects COVID-19 status predictions.

During neutrophil dysfunction, excessive activation and uncontrolled infiltration are the core processes in the progression of inflammation-related diseases, including severe coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), sepsis, etc. Herein, we used sialic acid-modified liposomal doxorubicin (DOX-SAL) to selectively target inflammatory neutrophils in the peripheral blood and deliver DOX intracellularly, inducing neutrophil apoptosis, blocking neutrophil migration, and inhibiting the inflammatory response. Strong selectivity resulted from the specific affinity between SA and L-selectin, which is highly expressed on inflammatory neutrophil membranes. In inflammation models of acute lung inflammation/injury (ALI), sepsis, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), DOX-SAL suppressed the inflammatory response, increased the survival of mice, and delayed disease progression, respectively.

Because of differences in their role within the health system, each group's calculation of telehealth's value may align or not with one another, depending on how it is being used. Therefore, a common mental model for determining value is critical in order to use telehealth in ways that produce win-win situations for most if not all four stakeholder groups. In this chapter, we present important principles and concepts from previously published frameworks to propose an approach to telehealth evaluation that can be used for perinatal health.

Research has proven that vitamin D supplementation can prevent inflammation based on its role in innate immune response; however, there have been limited studies regarding vitamin D supplementation in COVID-19. We aimed to determine whether vitamin D supplementation in vitamin D insufficient patients was associated with fewer severe COVID-19 outcomes, defined as mechanical ventilation or death. Methods: Retrospective study that analyzed data from all adult patients admitted to our tertiary care center between March 2020 and July 2020 with a positive RT-PCR for SARS CoV-2 and a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) level measured within 90 days prior to the index admission. Patients with 25(OH)D <30 ng/mL were considered vitamin D insufficient and patients ordered for least one weekly dose of 1,000 units of ergocalciferol or cholecalciferol were considered supplemented. Supplemented vitamin D insufficient patients were compared to non-supplemented vitamin D insufficient patients in terms of severe COVID-19 disease as defined by mechanical ventilation or death. Results: 129 COVID-19 patients with a vitamin D level <30 ng/mL were identified, with a median vitamin D level of 21.4 ng/mL. A total of 43 patients (33.3%) had severe COVID-19 outcomes. 65 (50.4%) patients with vitamin D insufficiency were supplemented and 64 (49.6%) were not supplemented. Vitamin D supplementation with 1,000 units (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.28 - 1.40; p=0.25), 5,000 units (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.26 - 1.23; p=0.15), or 50,000 units (OR 1.0, 95% CI 0.42C2.20, p=0.92) weekly had no statistically significant effect on severe COVID-19 outcomes. The odds of severe COVID-19 outcomes in supplemented patients were non-significantly reduced at lower cutoff values for vitamin D insufficiency (<20 ng/mL and <12 ng/mL) for all supplementation amounts. Conclusion: Vitamin D supplementation in patients with vitamin D insufficiency did not significantly reduce severe COVID-19 outcomes; however, vitamin D supplementation was associated with non-statistically significant reduced odds of severe COVID-19 outcomes at lower cutoff values of vitamin D level. These results demonstrate that Vitamin D supplementation may have a protective effect against severe COVID-19 outcomes in patients with lower baseline levels of vitamin D.","output":"The Effect of Vitamin D Supplementation on Severe COVID-19 Outcomes in Patients With Vitamin D Insufficiency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Evaluate the associations of obesity and diabetes with the risk of mortality in critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cohort study included 115 adult patients admitted to the ICU with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.

Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to investigate the associations. RESULTS: Mean age was 50.611.2 years, 68.7% were male. Median BMI was 30.9kg/m2. All patients had invasive mechanical ventilation. Patients with diabetes had increased risk of mortality with OR of 2.86 (CI 95% 1.1-7.4, p=0.026); among those patients who, in addition to diabetes had obesity, the risk was de 3.17 (CI 95% 1.9-10.2, p=0.038).

This note extends the arguments in that paper, focusing on some of the logistic issues involved in providing assistance to informal settlements. It argues that such assistance is essential not only for the help it would provide to people in these settlements but also because the residents of these communities should be key targets of assistance.

Most patients with COVID-19 have a mild course of the disease. However, approximately 20% develop severe illness with a high mortality rate which is associated with age, comorbidities, and immunosuppression. Epidemiological studies are used to reveal the extent of viral spread in homes, communities, and hospitals. Thus, preventive and control measures can be established by the authorities. Objective In this study, patients with suspect COVID-19 symptoms who search for hospital care at the city of Sao Jos do Rio Preto (Sao Paulo, Brazil) were monitored, in order to identify the first case of this new disease in the region. In the first two months (March and April), more than 3000 individuals looked for the public and private health system with suspected respiratory symptoms, but only 164 (8.4%) were COVID-19 confirmed. Results From those, males (56.1%) and patients of the age distribution of 16-59 (91.2%), with diarrhea (22.2%), runny nose (25%), altered taste (15.9%), and anosmia (11.6%) presented statistical significance, although none comorbidities were related with COVID-19 occurrence.

In this study we investigated whether or how FSH affected menopausal depression in postmenopausal (ovariectomized) FSHR knockout mice (Fshr(?/?)). We found that Fshr(?/?) mice displayed aggravated depression-like behaviors, accompanied by severe oxidative stress in the whole brain, resulted from significantly reduced glutamate cysteine ligase modifier subunit (GCLm) in glutathione synthesis and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) in NADP/NADPH transition. Importantly, administration of ROS scavenger N-acetyl cysteine (NAC, 150 mg  kg(?1)  d(?1), i.p. for 12 weeks) attenuated the depression-like behaviors of Fshr(?/?) mice. Consistent with these in vivo experiment results, we found that pretreatment with FSH (50, 100 ng/mL) dose-dependently increased protein levels of GCLm and G6PD, and decreased the ROS production in N2a mouse neuroblastoma cells.

However, clinical trials designed to study the efficacy of CPT based on antibody concentrations were inconclusive. Lymphatic transport is at the interplay between the immune response and the resolution of inflammation from peripheral tissues, including the artery wall. As vascular complications are a key pathogenic mechanism in COVID-19, leading to inflammation and multiple organ failure, we believe that sustaining lymphatic vessel function should be considered to define optimal CPT. We herein sought to determine what specific COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) characteristics should be considered to limit inflammation-driven lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) dysfunction. CCP donated 16 to 100 days after the last day of symptoms was characterized and incubated on inflammation-elicited adult human dermal LEC (aHDLEC). Plasma analysis revealed that late donation correlates with higher concentration of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. Conversely, extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from LEC are more abundant in early donated plasma (r = ?0.413, p = 0.004). Thus, secretion of LEC-EVs by an impaired endothelium could be an alarm signal that instigate the self-defense of peripheral lymphatic vessels against an excessive inflammation. Indeed, in vitro experiments suggest that CCP obtained rapidly following the onset of symptoms does not damage the aHDLEC junctions as much as late-donated plasma. We identified a particular signature of CCP that would counteract the effects of an excessive inflammation on the lymphatic endothelium. Accordingly, an easy and efficient selection of convalescent plasma based on time of donation would be essential to promote the preservation of the lymphatic and immune system of infected patients.","output":"Use of Early Donated COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Is Optimal to Preserve the Integrity of Lymphatic Endothelial Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Occurrence of abdominal wall hernias during and before peritoneal dialysis constitutes a pivotal role in treatment discontinuation, failure, and exclusion from this dialysis method.

Data collection included recurrent and new-onset hernias, surgical site infection, 1-year and 2-year catheter survival. RESULTS In 23 patients, 27 hernia repairs combined with peritoneal dialysis catheter implantation were performed. Median age was 52 years (range, 30-85 years) and 18/23 (78%) patients were male. There were no recurrent hernias and no early surgical site infections. Daily flushing was regularly started on the 1st to 3rd postoperative day. Five patients (22%) developed hernias on other anatomical sites, which required hernia repair and perioperative discontinuation of peritoneal dialysis. After a median follow-up of 37 months (range, 28-87 months), 96% of all implanted catheters were still working.

Thus, new platform technologies that can be readily modified as soon as new pathogens are detected, sequenced, and characterized are needed to enable rapid deployment and mass distribution of biosensors. This need can be addressed by the development of adaptive, multiplexed, and affordable sensing technologies that can avoid the conventional biological amplification step, make use of the optical and/or electrical signal amplification, and shorten both the preliminary development and the point-of-care testing time frames. We provide a comparative review of the existing and emergent photonic biosensing techniques by matching them to the above criteria and capabilities of preventing the spread of the next global pandemic.","output":"Roadmap on Universal Photonic Biosensors for Real-Time Detection of Emerging Pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study intends to reveal the underlying structural inequity in vulnerability to infection of the novel coronavirus disease pandemic among children and youth.

It is a key component in AI applications which rely on building a model of the environment using observations and performing lookups on the model for newer observations. In this work, we develop FASTHash, a truly high throughput parallel hash table implementation using FPGA on-chip SRAM. Contrary to state-of-the-art hash table implementations on CPU, GPU, and FPGA, the parallelism in our design is data independent, allowing us to support p parallel queries ([Formula: see text]) per clock cycle via p processing engines (PEs) in the worst case. Our novel data organization and query flow techniques allow full utilization of abundant low latency on-chip SRAM and enable conflict free concurrent insertions. Our hash table ensures relaxed eventual consistency - inserts from a PE are visible to all PEs with some latency. We provide theoretical worst case bound on the number of erroneous queries (true negative search, duplicate inserts) due to relaxed eventual consistency. We customize our design to implement both static and dynamic hash tables on state-of-the-art FPGA devices. Our implementations are scalable to 16 PEs and support throughput as high as 5360 million operations per second with PEs running at 335 MHz for static hashing and 4480 million operations per second with PEs running at 280 MHz for dynamic hashing.

The unexpected apparent positive results led to ethical questions on the employment of further full placebo-control studies in early stage COVID-19. The objective of the present study was to elucidate whether the conduction of a full placebo-control RCT was still ethically viable, through a comparative analysis with two control-groups. Materials and methods: Active group (AG) consisted of mild-to-moderate early stage COVID-19 patients enrolled in the Pre AndroCoV-Trial, treated with nitazoxanide ivermectin, or hydroxychloroquine in selected cases, in association with azithromycin. Vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc, glucocorticoids and anticoagulants, when clinically recommended. Control Group 1 (CG1) consisted of a retrospectively obtained group of untreated patients from the same population as those from the Pre-AndroCoV Trial, and Control Group 2 (CG2) resulted from a precise prediction of clinical outcomes, based on a thorough and structured review of articles indexed in PubMed and MEDLINE and statements by official government agencies and specific medical societies. For both CGs, patients were matched for proportion between sex, age, obesity and other comorbidities. Results: Compared to CG1 and CG2, AG showed a reduction of 31.5 to 36.5% in viral shedding (p < 0.0001), 70 to 85% and 70 to 73% in duration of COVID-19 clinical symptoms when including and not including anosmia and ageusia, respectively ((p < 0.0001 for both), and 100% in respiratory complications through the parameters of the Brescia COVID-19 Respiratory Scale (p < 0.0001). For every 1,000 confirmed cases for COVID-19, a minimum of 140 patients were prevented from hospitalization (p < 0.0001), 50 from mechanical ventilation, and five deaths, when comparing to age-, sex- and comorbidity-matched non-treated patients with similar initial disease severity at the moment of diagnosis. Conclusion: Apparent benefits of the combination between early detection and early pharmacological approaches for COVID-19 demonstrated to be consistent when when compared to different control groups of untreated patients. The potential benefits could allow a large number of patients prevented from hospitalizations, deaths and persistent symptoms after COVID-19 remission. The potential impact on COVID-19 disease course and numbers of negative outcomes and the well-established safety profile of the drugs proposed by the Pre-AndroCoV Trial led to ethical questions regarding the conduction of further placebo control randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for early COVID-19. Early pharmacological approaches including azithromycin in combination with any of the options between nitazoxanide, ivermectin or optionally hydroxychloroquine should be considered for those diagnosed with COVID-19 presenting less than seven days of symptoms. Of the three drugs, we opted for nitazoxanide, due to more extensive demonstration of in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity, proven efficacy against other viruses in humans, and steadier safety profile.","output":"Early COVID-19 Therapy with Azithromycin Plus Nitazoxanide, Ivermectin or Hydroxychloroquine in Outpatient Settings Significantly Reduced Symptoms Compared to Known Outcomes in Untreated Patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Polygenic scores can identify individuals with high disease risk based on inborn DNA variation.

The purpose of the current study was to help build a theory for how early repeating patterning knowledge contributes to early math development, focusing on development in children aged 4-6 years. The current study examined the relation between 65 preschool children's repeating patterning knowledge (via a fast, teacher-friendly measure) and their end-of-kindergarten broad math and numeracy knowledge, controlling for verbal and visual-spatial working memory (WM) skills as well as end-of-pre-K (pre-kindergarten) broad math knowledge. Relations were also examined between repeating patterning and specific aspects of numeracy knowledge-knowledge of the count sequence to 100 and the successor principle. Children's repeating patterning knowledge was significantly predictive of their broad math and general numeracy knowledge, as well as one specific aspect of their numeracy knowledge (counting to 100), even after controlling for verbal and visual-spatial WM skills. Further, repeating patterning knowledge remained a unique predictor of general numeracy knowledge and counting to 100 after controlling for end-of-pre-K broad math knowledge. The relation between repeating patterning and mathematics may be explained by the central role that identifying predictable sequences based on underlying rules plays in both. Theories of math development and early math instruction standards should thus give even greater attention to the role of children's repeating patterning knowledge.","output":"Finding patterns in objects and numbers: Repeating patterning in pre-K predicts kindergarten mathematics knowledge"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2014, an analysis was conducted to evaluate the hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemiology and disease burden in Germany.

The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein trimer mediates virus entry into host cells and cytopathic effects (syncytium formation). We studied the contribution of several S glycoprotein features to these functions, focusing on those that differ among related coronaviruses. Acquisition of the furin cleavage site by the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein decreased virus stability and infectivity, but greatly enhanced syncytium-forming ability. Notably, the D614G change found in globally predominant SARS-CoV-2 strains increased infectivity, modestly enhanced responsiveness to the ACE2 receptor and susceptibility to neutralizing sera, and tightened association of the S1 subunit with the trimer. Apparently, these two features of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein, the furin cleavage site and D614G, have evolved to balance virus infectivity, stability, cytopathicity and antibody vulnerability. Although the endodomain (cytoplasmic tail) of the S2 subunit was not absolutely required for virus entry or syncytium formation, alteration of palmitoylated cysteine residues in the cytoplasmic tail decreased the efficiency of these processes. As proteolytic cleavage contributes to the activation of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein, we evaluated the ability of protease inhibitors to suppress S glycoprotein function. Matrix metalloprotease inhibitors suppressed S-mediated cell-cell fusion, but not virus entry. Synergy between inhibitors of matrix metalloproteases and TMPRSS2 suggests that both host proteases can activate the S glycoprotein during the process of syncytium formation. These results provide insights into SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein-host cell interactions that likely contribute to the transmission and pathogenicity of this pandemic agent.IMPORTANCE The development of an effective and durable SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is essential for combating the growing COVID-19 pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein is the main target of neutralizing antibodies elicited during virus infection or following vaccination. Knowledge of the spike glycoprotein evolution, function and interactions with host factors will help researchers to develop effective vaccine immunogens and treatments. Here we identify key features of the spike glycoprotein, including the furin cleavage site and the D614G natural mutation, that modulate viral cytopathic effects, infectivity and sensitivity to inhibition. We also identify two inhibitors of host metalloproteases that block S-mediated cell-cell fusion, a process that contributes to the destruction of the virus-infected cell.","output":"Spike glycoprotein and host cell determinants of SARS-CoV-2 entry and cytopathic effects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to spread all over world and is outpacing the resources and capacity of health care systems. This rapidly spreading COVI D-19 infection is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has been challenging the medical community and keeping the whole world in great threat to an unprecedented degree. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review article is to describe details of social distancing, hand hygiene and wearing face masks including there role in controlling the current COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: We conducted an electronic search of Google Scholar, Scopus, Medline and PubMed databases for articles between June to September 2021. RESULTS: The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus is transmitted from person to person by respiratory droplets or contact with an infected person. There are no established medications and vaccine available until now to restrain the transmission of the COVID-19 infection. Currently, social distancing, hand hygiene and wearing a mask are key steps to lower the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in COVID-19 pandemic. As this infection is highly contagious via a respiratory pathway through coughing, sneezing and contact with an infected surface, the spread can be reduced by the proper practice of social distancing, hand hygiene or frequent hand washing and wearing mask. These universal precautions should be done as COVID-19 patients may be asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: Social distancing, hand washing and wearing face masks are cheap and widely acceptable methods for the prevention of the COVID-19 infection.

Pooling methods can enhance testing efficiency, but they are viable only at low incidences of the disease. We propose Smart Pooling, a machine learning method that uses clinical and sociodemographic data from patients to increase the efficiency of informed Dorfman testing for COVID-19 by arranging samples into all-negative pools. To do this, we ran an automated method to train numerous machine learning models on a retrospective dataset from more than 8000 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 from April to July 2020 in Bogot, Colombia. We estimated the efficiency gains of using the predictor to support Dorfman testing by simulating the outcome of tests. We also computed the attainable efficiency gains of non-adaptive pooling schemes mathematically. Moreover, we measured the false-negative error rates in detecting the ORF1ab and N genes of the virus in RT-qPCR dilutions. Finally, we presented the efficiency gains of using our proposed pooling scheme on proof-of-concept pooled tests.

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to our facility. Patients were divided into two groups based on the presence of GI symptoms and transaminitis at presentation. Univariable analysis was performed to assess the differences between study groups. Kruskal-Wallis and Pearson's chi-square tests were used to compare the median of continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of mechanical ventilation, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), and mortality after adjusting for baseline variables. Results: A total of 84 patients were analyzed. After adjusting for baseline comorbidities, presence of GI symptoms (aOR, adjusted odds ratio 4.2, 95% CI, 1.17-15.60, p=0.03) and transaminitis on admission (aOR 5.69, 95% CI, 1.47-21.99, p=0.01) were associated with CRS. Transaminitis on admission and elevated total bilirubin during hospitalization were associated with an increased need for mechanical ventilation (aOR 6.17, 95% CI, 1.49-25.44, p=0.02 and aOR 7.29, 95% CI, 1.73-30.75, p=0.007, respectively).

Conclusion: COVID-19 patients with transaminitis on admission had a higher risk of requiring mechanical ventilation and developing CRS. Patients with elevated AST on admission and elevated total bilirubin had higher mortality.

While rapid identification of viruses has been shown to reduce antibiotic use, the impact of detecting specific viruses on antibiotic utilization has not been ascertained. This study compared antibiotic utilization among hospitalized children who tested positive for different respiratory viruses at admission. METHODS A single-center study of hospitalized children under 21 years of age who tested positive at admission for at least 1 respiratory virus by multiplex polymerase chain reaction from October 1, 2012 to October 1, 2015 was performed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the association of testing positive for specific viruses with the use of antibiotics for  2 days, adjusted for demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS The study included 1416 patients with a median age of 2.1 years (interquartile range: 0.6-6.2 years). Patients positive for influenza (odds ratio: 2.0, 95% confidence interval: 1.1-3.4) and human metapneumovirus (odds ratio: 2.0, 95% confidence interval: 1.1-3.7) were more likely to receive  2 days of treatment compared with patients positive for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Other variables affecting prolonged use of antibiotics included respiratory support, primary nonrespiratory diagnosis, complex comorbid conditions and admission to the intensive care unit. CONCLUSIONS Providers are more likely to use antibiotics in non-RSV-infected patients compared with RSV.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to demonstrate the deployment of an automatic triage system to triage outpatients over the internet. METHODS: An automatic system was incorporated in the existing online appointment system of the hospital and deployed along with its on-site counterpart. Automatic query to the VPN travel and contact history database with each patient's National ID number was made for each attempt to acquire the patient's travel and contact history. Patients with relevant histories were denied registration or entry. Text messages were sent to patients without relevant history for the expedited route of entry if applicable. RESULTS: A total of 127857 visits was recorded. Among all the visits, 91195 were registered online. Seventy-one thousand eight hundred and sixteen of them generated text messages for expedited route of entry. Sixty-five patients had relevant histories revealed by the VPN database and were denied registration or entry.

Patients with primary immunodeficiency (PID) are in a particularly difficult situation. The purpose of the present study was to contribute to the very limited research on the everyday aspects of functioning in PID patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The survey included 85 adult PID patients treated with immunoglobulin replacement therapy in four reference centers for immunology. Everyday functioning of the patients as well as their opinion concerning new solutions in medical care were analyzed. RESULTS: During the pandemic, the percentage of patients experiencing fear/anxiety has increased from 47% to 70%. The wide dissemination of information about the SARS-CoV-2 in the media has increased anxiety in 40% of the patients. Patients diagnosed with PID were most afraid of the exposure to contact with strangers, especially in public places. As many as 67 respondents (79%) considered the introduction of restrictions concerning social functioning as good. Only every fifth person learned about the pandemic from reliable sources. Eighty three percent of the patients receiving immunoglobulin substitution experienced less fear of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patients positively evaluated the solutions related to the direct delivery of drugs to the place of residence in order to continue home IgRT therapy. Fifty three respondents (62.5%) believed that the possibility of a remote consultation was a very good solution. CONCLUSION: It is necessary to increase educational activities concerning the pandemic provided by health care professionals, as patients obtain information mainly from the media and the Internet, which adversely affects the feeling of anxiety. The pandemic, in addition to the very negative impact on patients and the deterioration of their daily functioning, has made patients appreciate their life more, devote more time to family and friends, and do things they like.","output":"A multicenter survey on the aspects of everyday life in adult patients with primary antibody deficiencies treated with immunoglobulin G replacement during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Domestic violence (DV) experienced by immigrant women is a public health concern.

Whether art influences the grief experience of families is largely unexplored. OBJECTIVE: To explore the influence of personalized paintings created to honor deceased critically ill patients on family members bereavement experience. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A qualitative descriptive analysis was conducted of semistructured interviews of grieving relatives who received a painting after the death of their loved one. The deceased patients were from a 21-bed medical-surgical intensive care unit. Eleven families were invited to receive a painting, of whom 1 family declined. A total of 22 family members of 10 patients who died in the intensive care unit were interviewed in the study between July 11, 2017, and May 19, 2019. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were enrolled in an end-of-life care program that elicits and implements wishes of patients and their families to bring peace during the dying process. Selected families of 10 decedents were invited to receive a painting to honor their loved one 1 to 10 months after the patients death. Using details about the patients life story, the artist created individualized paintings to commemorate each patient. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The experiences of family members receiving a personalized painting and its reported influence on their grieving experience. RESULTS: The family members of 10 decedents (mean [SD] age, 60 [14] years; 5 women [50%]; 8 White patients [80%]) were interviewed. The central theme of art to facilitate healing was illustrated through the following domains: the cocreation process, painting narratives, postmortem connections, and legacy. The process of cocreating the paintings with the artist and family members involved reminiscing, storytelling, and creativity. Family members emphasized the role of art to facilitate healing, exemplified through connections with images portrayed that deeply resonated with memories of their loved one. Participants indicated that the paintings validated that the patient was remembered, helped families feel less alone during a time of grief, honored the loved ones life, and enhanced connections between family members and clinicians. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This qualitative studys findings suggest that the creation of personalized paintings commemorating the lives of patients may help foster legacy and postmortem connections with clinicians and may help family members in their healing process.","output":"Experiences of Bereaved Family Members Receiving Commemorative Paintings: A Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"El objetivo del presente manuscrito es presentar el anlisis y descripcin del escenario que los profesionales de la salud han enfrentado para el tratamiento de los trastornos de la conducta alimentaria como resultado las medidas implementadas para el control de la pandemia por el nuevo cononavirus (COVID-19).

To understand how cellular conditions control capsid trafficking, we have tracked the subcellular fate of recombinant AAV2 (rAAV2) vectors using confocal immunofluorescence, three-dimensional infection analysis, and subcellular fractionation. Here we report that a population of rAAV2 virions enters the nucleus and accumulates in the nucleolus after infection, whereas empty capsids are excluded from nuclear entry. Remarkably, after subcellular fractionation, virions accumulating in nucleoli were found to retain infectivity in secondary infections. Proteasome inhibitors known to enhance transduction were found to potentiate nucleolar accumulation. In contrast, hydroxyurea, which also increases transduction, mobilized virions into the nucleoplasm, suggesting that two separate pathways influence vector delivery in the nucleus. Using a small interfering RNA (siRNA) approach, we then evaluated whether nucleolar proteins B23/nucleophosmin and nucleolin, previously shown to interact with AAV2 capsids, affect trafficking and transduction efficiency. Similar to effects observed with proteasome inhibition, siRNA-mediated knockdown of nucleophosmin potentiated nucleolar accumulation and increased transduction 5- to 15-fold. Parallel to effects from hydroxyurea, knockdown of nucleolin mobilized capsids to the nucleoplasm and increased transduction 10- to 30-fold. Moreover, affecting both pathways simultaneously using drug and siRNA combinations was synergistic and increased transduction over 50-fold. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that rAAV2 virions enter the nucleus intact and can be sequestered in the nucleolus in stable form. Mobilization from the nucleolus to nucleoplasmic sites likely permits uncoating and subsequent gene expression or genome degradation. In summary, with these studies we have refined our understanding of AAV2 trafficking dynamics and have identified cellular parameters that mobilize virions in the nucleus and significantly influence AAV infection.","output":"Enhancement of adeno-associated virus infection by mobilizing capsids into and out of the nucleolus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SUMMARY INTRODUCTION Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly described virus responsible for the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), named by the World Health Organization (WHO) in February/2020 Patients with Covid-19 have an incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) of 15 9-29% and sepsis is observed in all deceased patients Moreover, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is one of the major underlying causes of death among these patients In patients with DIC, there is a decrease in fibrinogen and an increase in D-dimer levels Some studies have shown that fibrinogen and one of its end products, D-dimer, might have a predictive value for mortality in patients with non-Covid sepsis secondary to complications of DIC Therefore, anticoagulation, considering its mortality benefits in cases of non-Covid sepsis, may also have an important role in the treatment of Covid-19 METHODS We reviewed the literature of all studies published by April 2020 on patients infected with Covid-19 Our review was limited to D-dimer and fibrinogen changes and anticoagulation recommendations RESULTS Anticoagulation therapy can be started following the DIC diagnosis in Covid-19 patients despite the bleeding risks In addition, the current evidence suggests a routine use of anticoagulation, particularly in patients with higher D-dimer levels (&amp;gt;3 0 &amp;#956;g/mL) CONCLUSION Covid-19 is a systemic, hypercoagulable disease requiring more studies concerning treatment Aanticoagulation is still an issue to be studied, but D-dimer rise and disease severity are the indicative factors to start treatment as soon as possible RESUMO INTRODUO O coronavrus da sndrome respiratria aguda grave 2 (SARS-CoV-2)  o vrus responsvel pelo surto recentemente batizado de doen?a pelo coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) pela Organizao Mundial de Sade (OMS) em fevereiro/2020 Os doentes com Covid-19 tm uma incidncia de sndrome de dificuldade respiratria aguda (SDRA) de 15,9-29% e sepse  observada em todos os pacientes que vm a bito Alm disso, a coagulao intravascular disseminada (DIC)  uma das principais causas subjacentes de morte entre esses pacientes Em pacientes com DIC, ocorre com uma diminuio do fibrinognio e um aumento dos nveis de dmero D Alguns estudos mostraram que o fibrinognio e um dos seus produtos finais, o dmero D, podem ter um valor preditivo para a mortalidade em pacientes com sepse n?o relacionada  Covid-19 decorrente de complicaes da DIC Portanto, a anticoagulao, considerando seus benefcios quanto  mortalidade na sepse n?o relacionada  Covid-19, pode tambm ter um papel importante no tratamento da Covid-19 MTODOS Realizamos uma revis?o de todos os estudos publicados at abril de 2020 sobre pacientes infectados com Covid-19 A nossa revis?o limitou-se a alteraes no dmero D, nos fibrinognios e recomendaes de anticoagulantes RESULTADOS A teraputica anticoagulante pode ser iniciada aps o diagnstico de DIC em pacientes com Covid-19 apesar dos riscos de hemorragia Alm disso, a evidncia atual sugere o uso rotineiro da anticoagulao, principalmente em pacientes com nveis mais elevados de dmero D (&amp;gt;3, 0 g/mL) CONCLUS?O A Covid-19  uma doen?a sistmica e hipercoagulvel que requer mais estudos em relao ao tratamento A anticoagulao ainda  uma quest?o a ser estudada, mas o aumento de dmeros D e a gravidade da doen?a s?o os fatores indicativos para o incio do tratamento o mais rpido possvel","output":"Fibrinogen and D-dimer variances and anticoagulation recommendations in Covid-19: current literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Outpatient follow-up is important in gynecologic cancer. During COVID-19, our center implemented telemedicine (telephone and video) visits to minimize the disruption in care. Telemedicine requires access to technology and a stable internet connection. Given our center takes care of a diverse, mixed-income population, our objective was to assess if there were identifiable differences in telemedicine utilization in a diverse mixed-income population of gynecologic cancer patients treated at a single institution. We collected data on patients seen at the outpatient Gynecologic Oncology clinic at our center who underwent an inperson or telemedicine visit (telephone or video) from 3/15/2020 to 6/15/2020 as part of a quality improvement initiative. For comparison, the same data was collected in the identical period in 2019. Visit type (new/return), visit mode (in-person, telephone, and video), recorded race, and insurance type were collected from the electronic medical record. Comparisons between variables were performed using Chi-square and multivariate logistic regression. From 3/2019 to 6/2019, 679 outpatient visits occurred, all of which were in-person. In the same time period in 2020, only 388 total patient visits occurred, representing a 42.9% decrease in volume. A majority of these visits were in-person with 228 visits (58.5%), while telemedicine accounted for 161 (41.5%) of visits with 96 (24.7%) by video and 65 (16.8%) by telephone. There was no change in the overall distribution by recorded race in patients seen between 2019 and 2020 (p=0.61). The use of telemedicine (video and telephone) was not different between commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid groups (p > 0.05). African American (AA) patients had a higher proportion of Medicaid and Medicare insurance compared to non-AA groups (Medicaid: 22.5% vs. 6.1%, Medicare: 37.3% vs. 26.0%. p<0.01). When looking at details of telemedicine use, AA were more likely to use telephone visits (AA: 27.5%, non-AA: 10.6%, p<0.01) and least likely to utilize video visits (AA: 17.6%, non-AA: 28.5%, p<0.05). On multivariate analysis, race did not independently predict telemedicine use over in-person visits (AA race- aOR: 0.70 95% CI: 0.57-1.45, p > 0.05), however, did show that patients with Medicaid and Medicare insurance were more likely to have a telemedicine visit than an inperson visit (Medicare: aOR: 1.81 95% CI: 1.09-3.01, p<0.05, Medicaid: aOR: 5.28 95% CI: 2.03-13.72, p<0.01). Additionally, those who had a new patient visit were less likely to attend a telemedicine visit and more likely to be seen in-person (aOR 0.12, 95% CI: 0.05-0.30, p<0.01). [Display omitted] The use of telemedicine drastically increased in 2020 due to the pandemic. After adjusting for covariates, race and insurance status did not affect access to telemedicine. The disproportionate use of video visits by race should be investigated as the use of video may be influenced by eHealth literacy, access to technology, and may be linked in the future with reimbursement incentives. Given the continued integration of telemedicine in oncology care, further research into patient and system factors affecting telemedicine access should be explored.

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on the quality of life of a population with hereditary gastrointestinal cancer predisposition syndromes and on the surveillance/oncological care program of patients enrolled in a dedicated registry. METHODS: The study was conducted by means of an online self-report survey during the first Italian national lockdown. The survey comprised four sections: demographics; perception/knowledge of COVID-19; impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on surveillance and cancer care; health status (SF-12 questionnaire). RESULTS: 211 complete questionnaires were considered. 25.12% of respondents reported being not at all frightened by COVID-19, 63.98% felt not at all or a little more fragile than the healthy general population, and 66.82% felt the coronavirus to be no more dangerous to them than the healthy general population. 88.15% of respondents felt protected knowing they were monitored by a team of dedicated professionals.

However, this test can take up to 2 d to complete, serial testing may be required to rule out the possibility of false negative results and there is currently a shortage of RT-PCR test kits, underscoring the urgent need for alternative methods for rapid and accurate diagnosis of patients with COVID-19. Chest computed tomography (CT) is a valuable component in the evaluation of patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nevertheless, CT alone may have limited negative predictive value for ruling out SARS-CoV-2 infection, as some patients may have normal radiological findings at early stages of the disease. In this study, we used artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to integrate chest CT findings with clinical symptoms, exposure history and laboratory testing to rapidly diagnose patients who are positive for COVID-19. Among a total of 905 patients tested by real-time RT-PCR assay and next-generation sequencing RT-PCR, 419 (46.3%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In a test set of 279 patients, the AI system achieved an area under the curve of 0.92 and had equal sensitivity as compared to a senior thoracic radiologist. The AI system also improved the detection of patients who were positive for COVID-19 via RT-PCR who presented with normal CT scans, correctly identifying 17 of 25 (68%) patients, whereas radiologists classified all of these patients as COVID-19 negative.

There have been other severe coronavirus outbreaks worldwide, namely, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV). Because the genetic diversity of coronaviruses renders the design of vaccines complicated, broad spectrum-anti-coronavirus drugs have become a critical approach to control the coronavirus epidemic. Cyclophilin A is an important protein needed for coronavirus replication, and its inhibitor cyclosporine has the ability to suppress coronavirus on a broad spectrum. CD147-S protein was found to be one route by which SARS-CoV-2 invades host cells, while CD147 was found to play a functional role in facilitating the infection of host cells by SARS-CoV. The CyPA/CD147 interaction may play a critical role in the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to enter the host cells. However, cyclosporine A has immunosuppressive effects, so the conditions for its use as an antiviral drug are limited. As a result, cyclosporine A analogues without immunosuppressive side effects have attracted lots of interest. This review primarily discusses the drug development prospects of cyclophilin A as a therapeutic target for the treatment of coronavirus infection, especially coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and non-immunosuppressive cyclosporine analogues.","output":"Cyclophilin A and CD147: novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this chapter, we discuss potential incidents associated with SARS-CoV-2 experimental work in high containment research laboratories. The risk landscape in high containment laboratories is changing due to the strong innovation drive of the life sciences research. Thus, the WHO has recommended life sciences organizations to incorporate good research practices and ethical principles into a risk-based approach of the biorisk management (BRM). Currently, BRM systems in high containment laboratories are predominantly steered by operational personnel and laboratory professional. It is well known that without having a systematic approach and leadership support from the organization, the BRM system in the high containment laboratory will not be sustainable. Even though the roles of organizations and their leadership in establishing the BRM system are spelt out in many international standards, guidance documents and national legislations, operational aspects of these roles are rarely discussed.It is therefore important for everyone to understand about their roles in organizational processes (communication, decision, and performance evaluation) involved in implementation of BRM related operational activities. In this chapter, discussion is based on operational activities of four main organizational behaviors that are considered to have strengthened BRM systems in high containment laboratories: (1) displaying a visible commitment and support to the BRM system from different levels of management, (2) developing a competent and responsible workforce with BRM technical skills and problem identification/solving skills, (3) integrating learning and improvement principles into the BRM system, and (4) enhancing the continuous motivation of laboratory personnel to avoid complacency. The categorization of these organizational behaviors is based on the International Atomic Energy Agency's principles and guidance for strengthening the safety and security culture in nuclear facilities. Furthermore, we encourage the laboratory management to identify gaps in processes and activities related to those organizational behaviors so that one could rapidly address biosafety and biosecurity vulnerabilities in high containment laboratories.","output":"Strengthening Biorisk Management in Research Laboratories with Security-Sensitive Biological Agents Like SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 occurred in Denmark on 27 February 2020.

Using bibliometric methods in a non-expert perspective, in a review of 34 published articles on the COVID-19 and drug-repurposing, we investigated obvious and less obvious points of consensus on drug candidates. To establish these two types of consensus, we first implemented document clustering. Within a set of five clustered papers, we established an obvious consensus, relying solely on the occurrence of entities by using term frequency and inverse document frequency and a comparison of mentioned drugs, finding that remdesivir and chloroquine were discussed with a certain degree of agreement. For the less obvious consensus, we created a drug entity co-occurrence network to establish low-high centrality combinations to probe the crucial drugs found in article clustering that are not plainly apparent through the mere counting of the occurrence of drug entities occurrences. Lopinavir emerged as having possibly potent effects in spite of underuse, while the mainstream of studies focus more on drugs such as chloroquine that enjoy explicit consent.

The rACC is a key hub of the default mode network, which prior studies indicate is hyperactive in major depressive disorder. Because default mode network downregulation is reliant on input from the salience network and frontoparietal network, an important question is whether rACC connectivity with these systems contributes to depression improvement. METHODS Our study evaluated this hypothesis in outpatients (N = 238; 151 female) enrolled in the Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response for Clinical Care (EMBARC) 8-week randomized clinical trial of sertraline versus placebo for major depressive disorder. Depression severity was measured using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and electroencephalography was recorded at baseline and week 1. Exact low-resolution electromagnetic tomography was used to compute activity from the rACC, and key regions within the default mode network (posterior cingulate cortex), frontoparietal network (left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), and salience network (right anterior insula [rAI]). Connectivity in the theta band (4.5-7 Hz) and beta band (12.5-21 Hz) was computed using lagged phase synchronization. RESULTS Stronger baseline theta-band rACC-rAI (salience network hub) connectivity predicted greater depression improvement across 8 weeks of treatment for both treatment arms (B = -0.57, 95% confidence interval = -1.07, -0.08, p = .03). Early increases in theta-band rACC-rAI connectivity predicted greater likelihood of achieving remission at week 8 (odds ratio = 2.90, p = .03). CONCLUSIONS Among patients undergoing treatment, theta-band rACC-rAI connectivity is a prognostic, albeit treatment-nonspecific, indicator of depression improvement, and early connectivity changes may predict clinically meaningful outcomes.","output":"Pretreatment Rostral Anterior Cingulate Cortex Connectivity With Salience Network Predicts Depression Recovery: Findings From the EMBARC Randomized Clinical Trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID pandemic has had a high psychological impact on healthy populations. Increased levels of perceived stress, depression, and insomnia are expected, especially in people with pre-existing medical conditions, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), who seem to be particularly vulnerable. However, the difference in psychological distress frequency between asthma and COPD patients is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To compare the prevalence of depression, perceived stress related to COVID, post-traumatic stress, and insomnia in asthma and COPD patients at a pulmonology clinic in Santa Marta, Colombia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was designed. The patients were contacted by telephone. An electronic link was sent to those who accepted. The questionnaire asked for perceived stress related to COVID-19, post-traumatic stress symptoms, depressive symptoms, and insomnia risk. RESULTS: 148 asthma patients and 144 COPD patients participated in, between 18 and 96 years. The prevalence of high COVID-19 perceived stress was 10.6% (n = 31); post-traumatic stress risk, 11.3% (n = 33); depression risk, 31.5% (n = 92); and insomnia risk, 57.7% (n = 169). No significant differences were found between asthma and COPD in indicators of psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS: Asthma and COPD patients present similar frequencies of depression risk, COVID-19 perceived stress, post-traumatic stress risk, and insomnia risk during the Colombian lockdown. It is essential to evaluate and manage psychological distress among asthma and COPD patients.

We evaluated the relationship between prostate specific antigen and the risk of aggressive prostate cancer developing in men of various ages. MATERIALS AND METHODS This longitudinal cohort study consisted of 849 men (122 with and 727 without prostate cancer) with serial prostate specific antigen measurements participating in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of men by prostate specific antigen and age who died of prostate cancer or in whom aggressive prostate cancer developed (death from prostate cancer, a prostate specific antigen 20 ng/ml or greater, or Gleason score 8 or greater). RESULTS No participants between 75 and 80 years old with a prostate specific antigen less than 3.0 ng/ml died of prostate cancer. In contrast, men of all ages with a prostate specific antigen of 3.0 ng/ml or greater had a continually increasing probability of death from prostate cancer (Fisher's exact test p <0.001). The time to death or diagnosis of aggressive prostate cancer after age 75 years was not significantly different between the prostate specific antigen categories of 3 to 3.9 and 4 to 9.9 ng/ml (p = 0.634), whereas the time to death or diagnosis of high risk prostate cancer was significantly longer for the prostate specific antigen category of less than 3 vs 3 ng/ml or greater (p = 0.019).

METHODS: We undertook a systematic search of three databases using a tiered search strategy. Studies were included if they: (a) assessed employment conditions such as working hours, precarious employment, contract type, insecurity, and flexible work, or psychosocial workplace exposures such as violence, harassment and bullying, social support, job demand and control, effort-reward imbalance, and organizational justice; (b) included a validated mental health measure; and (c) presented results specific to young people aged &#8804; 30 years or were stratified by age group to provide an estimate for young people aged &#8804; 30 years. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Exposures (ROBINS-E) tool. RESULTS: Nine studies were included in the review. Four were related to employment conditions, capturing contract type and working hours. Five studies captured concepts relevant to psychosocial workplace exposures including workplace sexual harassment, psychosocial job quality, work stressors, and job control. The quality of the included studies was generally low, with six of the nine at serious risk of bias. Three studies at moderate risk of bias were included in the qualitative synthesis, and results of these showed contemporaneous exposure to sexual harassment and poor psychosocial job quality was associated with poorer mental health outcomes among young workers. Longitudinal evidence showed that exposure to low job control was associated with incident depression diagnosis among young workers. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this review illustrate that even better studies are at moderate risk of bias. Addressing issues related to confounding, selection of participants, measurement of exposures and outcomes, and missing data will improve the quality of future research in this area and lead to a clearer understanding of how employment conditions and psychosocial workplace exposures impact the mental health of young people. Generating high-quality evidence is particularly critical given the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on young people's employment.

This study aims to analyze the relationship between sarcopenia measured by psoas muscle index on computer tomography scans and the presence of postoperative complications in colorectal cancer surgery. Materials and Methods: In a prospective study we recorded data from 51 patients who underwent colorectal cancer surgery in the Mures County Clinical Hospital, Romania. Total psoas muscle area and psoas density were measured at the level of the third lumbal vertebra (L3) for further index calculation. We also evaluated the general characteristics and laboratory analyses to obtain more information about status of the patients. Short-term postoperative complications were scored according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. Results: The majority of the 51 patients were male (61%) and the median age was 65 years. More than half of the cancer was located in the rectum (56.9%), a quarter in the right colon (25.5%), the rest in the sigmoid (11.8%), and the left colon (5.9%). Twenty-one patients (41.2%) developed a complication, five (9.8%) of these were Clavien-Dindo grade 3, 4 or 5 (high grade) and sixteen (31.3%) grade 1 or 2 (low grade). The low- and high-grade groups showed a significantly lower right psoas muscle area, left psoas muscle area, total psoas muscle area, and psoas muscle index (p < 0.001 in all cases). Among laboratory analyses, a significantly lower perioperative hematocrit, hemoglobin, and albumin level were found in patients who developed complications. Furthermore we observed that an elevated serum C-reactive protein level was associated with a higher grade of complication (p < 0.043). Conclusions: The psoas muscle index (PMI) influence on the postoperative outcome is an important factor in our single center prospective study and it appears to be a good overall predictor in colorectal surgery. A lower PMI is directly associated with a low or high grade complication by Clavien-Dindo classification.

As an automatic tool, deep learning methods can be utilized to perform semantic segmentation of affected lung regions, which is important to establish disease severity and prognosis prediction.

The aims of this study were to assess the impact of repeated blood samplings on patients anaemic state using standard-volume tubes, in comparison with the hypothetical use of low-volume tubes and to evaluate the transfusion policy adopted. Study design and methods Transfusion data of mechanically ventilated non-bleeding patients with COVID-19 disease hospitalized in ICU for a minimum of 20 days were recorded. The total volume of blood drawn for samplings with standard-volume tubes and the corresponding red blood cell mass (RBCM) removed during hospitalization for each patient were calculated and compared with the hypothetical use of low-volume tubes. Results Twenty-four patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Ten patients were anaemic at ICU admission (41.7%). Overall, 6,658 sampling tubes were employed, for a total of 16,786 mL of blood. The median RBCM subtracted by blood samplings per patient accounted for about one third of the total patients RBCM decrease until discharge. The use of low-volume tubes would have led to a median saving of about one third of the drawn RBCM. Eleven patients were transfused (45.8%) at a mean Hb value of 7.7 ( 0.5) g/dL. Conclusion The amount of blood drawn for sampling has a significant role in the development of anaemia and the use of low-volume tubes could minimize the problem.

HMGB1 is a nuclear protein released extracellularly during proinflammatory lytic cell death or secreted by activated macrophages, NK cells, and additional cell types during infection or sterile injury. Extracellular HMGB1 orchestrates central events in inflammation as a prototype alarmin. TLR4 and the receptor for advanced glycation end products operate as key HMGB1 receptors to mediate inflammation. METHODS: Standard ELISA and cytometric bead array-based methods were used to examine the kinetic pattern for systemic release of HMGB1, ferritin, IL-18, IFN-, and MCP-1 before and during treatment of four children with critical MAS. Three of the patients with severe underlying systemic rheumatic diseases were treated with biologics including tocilizumab or anakinra when MAS developed. All patients required intensive care therapy due to life-threatening illness. Add-on etoposide therapy was administered due to insufficient clinical response with standard treatment. Etoposide promotes apoptotic rather than proinflammatory lytic cell death, conceivably ameliorating subsequent systemic inflammation. RESULTS: This therapeutic intervention brought disease control coinciding with a decline of the increased systemic HMGB1, IFN-, IL-18, and ferritin levels whereas MCP-1 levels evolved independently. CONCLUSION: Systemic HMGB1 levels in MAS have not been reported before. Our results suggest that the molecule is not merely a biomarker of inflammation, but most likely also contributes to the pathogenesis of MAS. These observations encourage further studies of HMGB1 antagonists. They also advocate therapeutic etoposide administration in severe MAS and provide a possible biological explanation for its mode of action.","output":"Therapeutic administration of etoposide coincides with reduced systemic HMGB1 levels in macrophage activation syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Objective markers of cardiac function are limited in the outpatient setting and may be beneficial for monitoring patients with chronic cardiac conditions.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty\\\\two patients with unexplained dyspnea undergoing level 3 invasive cardiopulmonary exercise test at a tertiary medical center were included in the final analysis. We obtained scale and direct Fick measurements of stroke volume and cardiac output before and immediately after invasive cardiopulmonary exercise test. Stroke volume and cardiac output from a cardiac scale and the direct Fick method correlated with r=0.81 and r=0.85, respectively (P<0.001 each). The mean absolute error of the scale estimated stroke volume was ?1.58 mL, with a 95% limits of agreement of ?21.97 to 18.81 mL.

This study proposes and tests a theoretical framework to explore the psychological mechanisms of conformity consumer behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results indicate that pandemic severity positively affect conformity consumer behavior, sense of fear plays a mediating role between pandemic severity and conformity consumer behavior, and sense of control does not play a moderating role. This implies that fear drives conformity consumer behavior and people may tend to consume in this way when they perceive a strong sense of fear no matter how strong their sense of control is.

Objective: To describe the patterns of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) and acquired drug resistance (ADR) in HIV-1 infected patients followed in Europe, to compare its patterns in late presenters (LP) vs non-late presenters (NLP), and to analyze the most prevalent drug resistance mutations among HIV-1 subtypes. Methods: Our study included clinical, socio-demographic, and genotypic information from 26,973 HIV-1 infected patients from the EuResist Integrated Database (EIDB) between 1981 and 2019. Results: Among the 26,973 HIV-1 infected patients in the analysis, 11,581 (42.9%) were ART-na?ve patients and 15,392 (57.1%) were ART-experienced. The median age was 37 (IQR: 27.0-45.0) years old and 72.6% were males. The main transmission route was through heterosexual contact (34.9%) and 81.7% of patients originated from Western Europe. 71.9% of patients were infected by subtype B and 54.8% of patients were classified as LP. The overall prevalence of TDR was 12.8% and presented an overall decreasing trend (p for trend < 0.001), the ADR prevalence was 68.5% also with a decreasing trend (p for trend < 0.001). For LP and NLP, the TDR prevalence was 12.3 and 12.6%, respectively, while for ADR, 69.9 and 68.2%, respectively. The most prevalent TDR drug resistance mutations, in both LP and NLP, were K103N/S, T215rev, T215FY, M184I/V, M41I/L, M46I/L, and L90M. Conclusion: Our study showed that the overall TDR (12.8%) and ADR (68.5%) presented decreasing trends during the study time period. For LP, the overall TDR was slightly lower than for NLP (12.3 vs 12.6%, respectively); while this pattern was opposite for ADR (LP slightly higher than NLP).

The interactions among market sizes, MNF's competition with local rival and the global tax rules play key roles in the MNF's decisions. In this paper, we study the preferences of a MNF and its contract manufacturer (CM) over two manufacturing outsourcing structures and investigate whether their objective conflicts can be reconciled. The MNF relies on the CM for production and sells goods in both Chinese and Southeast Asian markets. It is optional for the MNF to use a CM located in China, but has to suffer from the CM's differential prices because of China's partial value-added tax (VAT) refund policy. It is also optional for the MNF to use a CM located in Southeast Asia, resulting in uniform production fee for the goods sold in two markets. The former is traditional outsourcing structure (TS), and the latter is shifted outsourcing structure (SS). Interestingly, we find that, the MNF may first prefer SS, then prefer TS, and back to prefer SS, as the relative market potential between the Southeast Asian market and the Chinese market increases. The CM's preferences may switch twice, too. We identify the opportunities where the preferences of the MNF and the CM are aligned, which are driven by China's partial VAT refund policy.","output":"Conflict management in a multinational firm's production shifting decisions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is a historically unprecedented shift in demographics towards seniors, which will result in significant housing development over the coming decade. This is an enormous opportunity for real-estate operators to innovate and address the demand in this growing market. However, investments in this area are fraught with risk. Seniors often have more health issues, and Covid-19 has exposed just how vulnerable they are -- especially those living in close proximity. Conventionally, most services for seniors are\\"high-touch\\", requiring close physical contact with trained caregivers. Not only are trained caregivers short in supply, but the pandemic has made it evident that conventional high-touch approaches to senior care are high-cost and greater risk. There are not enough caregivers to meet the needs of this emerging demographic, and even fewer who want to undertake the additional training and risk of working in a senior facility, especially given the current pandemic. In this article, we rethink the design of senior living facilities to mitigate the risks and costs using automation. With AI-enabled pervasive automation, we claim there is an opportunity, if not an urgency, to go from high-touch to almost\\"no touch\\"while dramatically reducing risk and cost.

By the end of November 2021, it had spread and approached fixation in South Africa, and had been detected on all continents. We analyzed the exponential growth of Omicron over the four-week periods in two most populated South Africas provinces, Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal, arriving at the doubling time estimates of respectively 3.3 days [95% CI: 3.2-3.4 days] and 2.7 days [95% CI: 2.3-3.3 days]. Similar or even shorter doubling times were observed in other locations: Australia (3.0 days), New York State (2.5 days), UK (2.4 days), and Denmark (2.0 days). Log- linear regression suggests that the spread began in Gauteng around October 11, 2021, however, due to presumable stochasticity in the initial spread, this estimate can be inaccurate. Phylogenetics-based analysis indicates that the Omicron strain started to diverge in between October 6 and October 29, 2021. We estimated that the weekly growth of the ratio of Omicron to Delta is in the range 7.2-10.2, considerably higher than the growth of the ratio of Delta to Alpha (estimated to be in in the range 2.5-4.2), and Alpha to pre-existing strains (estimated to be in the range of 1.8-2.7). High relative growth does not necessarily imply higher Omicron infectivity. A two-strain SEIR model suggests that the growth advantage of Omicron may stem from immune evasion, which permits this VOC to infect both the recovered and the fully vaccinated individuals. As we demonstrated within the model, immune evasion is more concerning than increased transmissibility, because it can facilitate larger epidemic outbreaks.","output":"Omicron strain spreads with the doubling time of 3.2-3.6 days in South Africa province of Gauteng that achieved herd immunity to Delta variant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in cancellation of medical peer meetings.

So far it has not been investigated whether a surgical mask itself can be a source of microbial transmission. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the microbiological contamination of surgical masks during dental treatment and the transfer of microorganisms from the mask to the hands. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five dental treatment modalities were studied: carious cavity preparation (P-caries, n = 10), tooth substance preparation (P-tooth, n = 10), trepanation and root canal treatment (P-endo, n = 10), supragingival ultrasonic application (US-supra, n = 10), and subgingival periodontal ultrasonic instrumentation (US-sub, n = 10). Bacterial contamination of mask and gloves worn during treatment was tested by imprinting on agar plates. Additionally, before masks were tested, their outer surface was touched with a new sterile glove. This glove was also imprinted on agar. Bacteria were identified by MALDI TOF mass spectrometry. Colony-forming units (CFU) were scored: score 0: 0 CFU, score 1: < 10(2) CFU, score 2: > 10(2) CFU, score 3: dense microbial growth. RESULTS: All masks and all gloves used during treatment displayed bacterial contamination (sample scores 0/1/2/3: masks 0/46/3/1 and gloves 0/31/10/9). After touching the masks with new sterile gloves, microorganisms were recovered with the following contamination scores: P-caries: 4/6/0/0, P-tooth: 2/8/0/0: P-endo: 7/3/0/0, US-supra: 0/9/1/0, US-sub: 2/8/0/0. No statistically significant differences were detected between the treatment modalities. Streptococci spp. and Staphylococci spp. representing the oral and cutaneous flora dominated. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical masks are contaminated after aerosol-producing dental treatment procedures. Used masks have a potential to be a source of bacterial contamination of the hands. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Dental staff should avoid touching the outer surface of masks with their hands to prevent transmission of pathogens. It is recommendable to change the mask after each treated patient followed by hand disinfection.","output":"Contamination of surgical mask during aerosol-producing dental treatments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: After the first COVID-19 case detected on 8 December 2019 in Wuhan, the Provincial Capital of Hubei, the epidemic quickly spread throughout the whole country of China. Low developmental levels are often associated with infectious disease epidemic, this study attempted to test this notion with COVID-19 data. METHODS: Data by province from 8 December 2019 to 16 February 2020 were analysed using regression method. Outcomes were days from the first COVID-19 case in the origin of Hubei Province to the date when case was first detected in a destination province, and cumulative number of confirmed cases. Provincial gross domestic products (GDPs) were used to predict the outcomes while considering spatial distance and population density. RESULTS: Of the total 70 548 COVID-19 cases in all 31 provinces, 58 182 (82.5%) were detected in Hubei and 12 366 (17.5%) in other destination provinces. Regression analysis of data from the 30 provinces indicated that GDP was negatively associated with days of virus spreading (?=-0.2950, p<0.10) and positively associated with cumulative cases (?=97.8709, p<0.01) after controlling for spatial distance. The relationships were reversed with ?=0.1287 (p<0.01) for days and ?=-54.3756 (p<0.01) for cumulative cases after weighing in population density and controlling for spatial distance. CONCLUSION: Higher levels of developmental is a risk factor for cross-province spread of COVID-19. This study adds new data to literature regarding the role of economic growth in facilitating spatial spreading of infectious diseases, and provides timely data informing antiepidemic strategies and developmental plan to balance economic growth and people's health.","output":"Levels of economic growth and cross-province spread of the COVID-19 in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To determine the effects of selective transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) in the normal canine liver.

Computed tomography (CT) and histology were performed during an 8-week observation period; biochemical analysis data were obtained during a 12-week observation period after TAE. RESULTS Embolization was successful in all dogs and did not induce any change in the clinical appearance of dogs. Postoperative CT was consistent with recanalization of the artery within 2 weeks of embolization in all dogs. Hepatic enzyme levels increased temporarily after embolization but gradually returned to normal ranges. Histological examinations did not differ between treated and untreated liver tissues. CONCLUSION TAE appears safe in normal dogs observed for 12 weeks. Arterial recanalization seems to occur within 2 weeks after injection of GSPs in the left hepatic artery.

Our current communication shares a protocol for donor and transplant recipient selection during the COVID-19 pandemic to continue lifesaving kidney transplantation. This protocol was created utilizing the guidelines of various organizations and from the clinical experience of the authors and will continue to evolve as more is understood about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and how it affects organ donors and transplant recipients.

Methods: A prospective study was done in Mahatma Gandhi Hospital Jaipur for the transplant done from July 2020 to February 2021. A total of 115 patients from 20 th July to 28 th February were considered for the study. Results: All 115 patients who were COVID negative on reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay and high-resolution computed tomography were considered for the transplant.

The concentration-to-dose ratio (C/D), a measure of a medication's rate of metabolism and clearance, may increase during an acute infection due to decreased medication metabolism and clearance. CASE REPORT: A 56-year-old White man was restarted on clozapine and titrated up to 350 mg/d with therapeutic steady-state levels (C/D 1.11) on hospital day (HD) 69. At this time, he was also being treated for COPD exacerbation. For the next month, he continued to complain of cough, but vital signs and chest x-ray remained normal. Labs were unremarkable except for occasional leukocytosis that would resolve on repeat evaluation. A routine clozapine level drawn on HD 104, resulted on day 108 and showed clozapine toxicity with C/D 4.05, although the patient was asymptomatic. After receipt of labs on day 109, showing elevated WBC count, he was immediately sent to the emergency room where he was admitted for treatment of pneumonia. On return to the state hospital, the patient was continued on 100 mg clozapine and titrated to 200 mg/d based on low drug levels. He continued to do well on 200 mg/d clozapine with C/D averaging 1.13 (range, 0.75-1.52).

Multiple features were assessed including neck disability, kinesiophobia, quality of life, cervical kinematics, proprioception, activity of superficial neck flexor muscles, maximum neck flexion and extension strength, and perceived exertion during submaximal contractions. Overall, those with RNP (n = 22) and CNP (n = 8) presented with higher neck disability, greater kinesiophobia, lower quality of life, slower and irregular neck movements, and less neck strength compared to controls (n = 15). Prediction analysis in the RNP group revealed that a higher number of previous pain episodes within the last 12 months along with lower neck flexion strength were predictors of higher neck disability at a 6-month follow-up. This preliminary study shows that participants with RNP presented with some degree of altered neuromuscular features and poorer psychological function with respect to healthy controls and these features were similar to those with CNP.

How to maintain safety? What is reactive hazard? What is biohazard? Chemical or biotransformation means change. Any changes have irreversible consequences. Managing the changes can help us, while changes can also be harmful. The first-line of defense on any potential unwanted transformations is isolation or containment. WHO defines four-risk groups of biosafety levels. There are six key knowledge bases for biosafety. With chemical safety, substance identification is the first step. The global harmonized system (GHS) of classification and labeling is generally agreed by the world bodies. The hazards are divided into three categoriesphysical, health, and environmental hazards. Chemical reactivity hazard is a situation where an uncontrolled reaction could result directly or indirectly in serious harm to people, property, or equipment. Fire and explosion are common reactivity hazards. To safe guard processes and facility, one needs to first identify the threat, or screening for reactivity hazards. Combustion processes proceed with chain reactions and the reaction is highly exothermic. Combined with the high-activation energy, combustion leads to large-temperature dependence. The overall reaction products can also vary (partial oxidation versus total oxidation). Partial oxidation reactions are important in chemical industry. Pyrolysis and gasification of biomass, for example, are useful technologies in biomass conversion. An explosion is a fast, transient, exothermic reaction. Unintended and accidental explosions can occur due to (1) The accumulation of reactive chemicals (gas, liquid, or solid) in confined space; (2) Leakage of significant amount of reactive chemicals (gas, liquid, or solid) to atmosphere or environment; or (3) Reactor runaway.

The manuscript covers approaches to the synthesis of 5-ene-4-thiazolidinone derivatives: modification of the C5 position of the basic core; synthesis of the target compounds in the one-pot or multistage reactions or transformation of other related heterocycles. The most prominent pharmacological profiles of 5-ene derivatives of different 4-thiazolidinone subtypes belonging to hit-, lead-compounds, drug-candidates and drugs as well as the most studied targets have been discussed. Currently target compounds (especially 5-en-rhodanines) are assigned as frequent hitters or pan-assay interference compounds (PAINS) within high-throughput screening campaigns. Nevertheless, the crucial impact of the presence/nature of C5 substituent (namely 5-ene) on the pharmacological effects of 5-ene-4-thiazolidinones was confirmed by the numerous listed findings from the original articles. The main directions for active 5-ene-4-thiazolidinones optimization have been shown: i) complication of the fragment in the C5 position; ii) introduction of the substituents in the N3 position (especially fragments with carboxylic group or its derivatives); iii) annealing in complex heterocyclic systems; iv) combination with other pharmacologically attractive fragments within hybrid pharmacophore approach. Moreover, the utilization of 5-ene-4-thiazolidinones in the synthesis of complex compounds with potent pharmacological application is described.

U.S. counties with high levels of ethnic divisions fared worse than their less-divided counterparts after lockdowns in both COVID-19 cases and related deaths. Ethnic diversity had little effect, except in areas with high racial segregation. Crisis-response policies led to smaller mobility reductions and less mask-wearing in ethnically divided counties. These results are not driven by a lack of physical public goods, socioeconomic differences, or by the prevalence of high-risk populations.

The use of stigmatizing language for the purpose of blaming sparked a debate. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify social stigma and negative sentiment toward the blameworthy agents in social communities. METHODS: We enabled a tailored text-mining platform to identify data in their natural settings by retrieving and filtering online sources, and constructed vocabularies and learning word representations from natural language processing for deductive analysis along with the research theme. The data sources comprised of ten news websites, eleven discussion forums, one social network, and two principal media sharing networks in Taiwan. A synthesis of news and social networking analytics was present from December 30, 2019, to March 31, 2020. RESULTS: We collated over 1.07 million Chinese texts. Almost two-thirds of the texts on COVID-19 came from news services (n=683,887, 63.68%), followed by Facebook (n=297,823, 27.73%), discussion forums (n=62,119, 5.78%), and Instagram and YouTube (n=30,154, 2.81%). Our data showed that online news served as a hotbed for negativity and for driving emotional social posts. Online information regarding COVID-19 associated it with China-and a specific city within China through references to the \\"Wuhan pneumonia\\"-potentially encouraging xenophobia. The adoption of this problematic moniker had a high frequency, despite the World Health Organization guideline to avoid biased perceptions and ethnic discrimination. Social stigma is disclosed through negatively valenced responses, which are associated with the most blamed targets.

Stigmatizing language linked to the COVID-19 pandemic shows a lack of civic responsibility that encourages bias, hostility, and discrimination. Frequently used stigmatizing terms were deemed offensive, and they might have contributed to recent backlashes against China by directing blame and encouraging xenophobia.

This study proposes an inventory policy using the renewal reward theory for maximizing profit for the manufacturer under study.

Established ARDS is defined as maintaining a PaO2/FiO2 &#8804; 200 mmHg on PEEP &#8805; 10 cmH2O and FiO2 &#8805; 0.5 after 12  3 h of routine intensive care. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to receive either dexamethasone plus standard intensive care or standard intensive care alone. Patients in the dexamethasone group will receive an intravenous dose of 20 mg once daily from day 1 to day 5, followed by 10 mg once daily from day 6 to day 10. The primary outcome is 60-day mortality. The secondary outcome is the number of ventilator-free days, defined as days alive and free from mechanical ventilation at day 28 after randomization. All analyses will be done according to the intention-to-treat principle. DISCUSSION: This study will assess the role of dexamethasone in patients with established moderate-to-severe ARDS caused by SARS-CoV-2. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04325061 .

However, the rapid improvement of a child's condition after RAS administration may influence a caregiver's decision to follow this recommendation. Currently, the evidence on the effect of RAS on referral completion is limited. In this study, we investigated the relationship between RAS implementation and administration and referral completion. Methods and Findings: An observational study accompanied the roll-out of RAS in three malaria endemic settings in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Nigeria and Uganda. Community health workers and primary health centres enrolled children under five years with suspected severe malaria before and after the roll-out of RAS. All children were followed up 28 days after enrolment to assess their treatment seeking pathways, treatments received, and their health outcome. In total, 8,365 children were enrolled, 77% of whom fulfilled all inclusion criteria and had a known referral completion status. Referral completion was 67% (1,408/2,104) in DRC, 48% (287/600) in Nigeria and 58% (2,170/3,745) in Uganda. In DRC and Uganda, RAS users were less likely to complete referral than RAS non-users in the pre-roll-out phase (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.48, 95% CI 0.30-0.77 and aOR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.58-0.88, respectively). Among children seeking care from a primary health centre in Nigeria, RAS users were less likely to complete referral compared to RAS non-users in the post-roll-out phase (aOR = 0.18, 95% CI 0.05-0.71). In Uganda, among children who completed referral, RAS users were significantly more likely to complete referral on time than RAS non-users enrolled in the pre-roll-out phase (aOR = 1.81, 95% CI 1.17-2.79). Conclusions: The findings of this study raise legitimate concerns that the roll-out of RAS may lead to lower referral completion in children who were administered pre-referral RAS. To ensure that community-based programmes are effectively implemented, barriers to referral completion need to be addressed at all levels. Alternative effective treatment options should be provided to children unable to complete referral.","output":"Pre-referral rectal artesunate and referral completion among children with suspected severe malaria in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria and Uganda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Evidence in humans suggests a correlation between nicotine smoking and severe respiratory symptoms with COVID-19 infection.

Design/methodology/approach: A sample consisting of 1,008 individuals who have experienced the COVID-19 health-care system was drawn from four different regions of Saudi Arabia using the simple random sampling technique. The survey was conducted using an online survey and 1,008 respondents answered, based on their experience and knowledge of the COVID-19 health-care system. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was applied to test the proposed research model. Findings: The study findings suggest that service system satisfaction (SAT) significantly mediates the role of the HSQ in delivering and enhancing the QOL. HSQ also has a significant role to play on the SAT as well as the QOL. These findings contribute to the body of knowledge on SDL in the context of HSQ in understanding the significant role of technologies can play in enhancing service satisfaction and better QOL during a crisis such as COVID-19. This study also improves the understanding of the importance of customer-centricity, real-time visibility through tracking and tracing of service flow, agile decision-making, fewer but better-defined service objectives, and finally shaping mindsets and behaviors of all the relevant parties involved in the HSQ service delivery process. Research limitations/implications: One of the major limitations of this study is that, although COVID-19 is an ongoing global pandemic, cross-sectional data were collected in only one country. The findings may not be generalizable across subsequent waves of the pandemic. The best practices of HSQ could be studied around the globe and the results used to support continuous improvement.

Our hypothesis is that there are regional differences in stroke outcome depending on location during the COVID-19 study period which influences stroke epidemiology and clinical stroke practice. METHODS: : The American Heart Association's Get with the Guidelines (GWTG) database was used to evaluate the following categories: code stroke, diagnosis of stroke upon discharge, inpatient mortality, modified Rankin Score (mRS) upon discharge (morbidity), and time since last known well (LKW). Stroke registry data from February through June 2019 and 2020 were collected for retrospective review. RESULTS: : The total number of strokes decreased in the US and CA, but increased in SHS during the COVID-19 study period. The US and SHS demonstrated no change in stroke mortality, but CA demonstrated a higher stroke mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was greater loss of independence with increased stroke morbidity in the US during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was a significant increase in time since LKW in the US and SHS, and an increase trend in time since LKW in CA during the COVID-19 study period. DISCUSSION: : To understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on stroke epidemiology, we propose that all stroke inpatients should receive a SARS-CoV-2 detection test and this result be entered into the GWTG database. We demonstrate that the regional distribution of stroke mortality in the US changed during the COVID-19 study period, with increased stroke mortality in CA. Stroke morbidity throughout the US was significantly worse during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In the United Arab Emirates, video and audio consultations have been implemented to deliver health services during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate whether differences exist in physicians' attitudes and perceptions of video and audio consultations when delivering telemedicine services during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This survey was conducted on a cohort of 880 physicians from outpatient facilities in Abu Dhabi, which delivered telemedicine services during the COVID-19 pandemic between November and December 2020. In total, 623 physicians responded (response rate=70.8%). The survey included a 5-point Likert scale to measure physician's attitudes and perceptions of video and audio consultations with reference to the quality of the clinical consultation and the professional productivity. Descriptive statistics were used to describe physicians' sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex, designation, clinical specialty, duration of practice, and previous experience with telemedicine) and telemedicine modality (video vs audio consultations). Regression models were used to assess the association between telemedicine modality and physicians' characteristics with the perceived outcomes of the web-based consultation. RESULTS: Compared to audio consultations, video consultations were significantly associated with physicians' confidence toward managing acute consultations (odds ratio [OR] 1.62, 95% CI 1.2-2.21; P=.002) and an increased ability to provide patient education during the web-based consultation (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.04-4.33; P=.04). There was no significant difference in physicians' confidence toward managing long-term and follow-up consultations through video or audio consultations (OR 1.35, 95% CI 0.88-2.08; P=.17). Video consultations were less likely to be associated with a reduced overall consultation time (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.51-0.93; P=.02) and reduced time for patient note-taking compared to face-to-face visits (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.36-0.65; P<.001). Previous experience with telemedicine was significantly associated with a lower perceived risk of misdiagnosis (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.3-0.71; P<.001) and an enhanced physician-patient rapport (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.26-4.9; P=.008). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that video consultations should be adopted frequently in the new remote clinical consultations. Previous experience with telemedicine was associated with a 2-fold confidence in treating acute conditions, less than a half of the perceived risk of misdiagnosis, and an increased ability to provide patients with health education and enhance the physician-patient rapport. Additionally, these results show that audio consultations are equivalent to video consultations in providing remote follow-up care to patients with chronic conditions. These findings may be beneficial to policymakers of e-health programs in low- and middle-income countries, where audio consultations may significantly increase access to geographically remote health services.","output":"Physicians' Attitudes Toward Telemedicine Consultations During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study is to estimate the cumulative incidence, patient characteristics, and potential risk factors for secondary hemorrhage after total laparoscopic hysterectomy. METHODS All women who underwent total laparoscopic hysterectomy at Paul's Hospital between January 2004 and April 2012 were included in the study. Patients who had bleeding per vaginam between 24 hours and 6 weeks after primary surgery were included in the analysis. RESULTS A total of 1613 patients underwent total laparoscopic hysterectomy during the study period, and 21 patients had secondary hemorrhage after hysterectomy. The overall cumulative incidence of secondary hemorrhage after total laparoscopic hysterectomy was 1.3%. The mean size of the uterus was 541.4 g in the secondary hemorrhage group and 318.9 g in patients without hemorrhage, which was statistically significant. The median time interval between hysterectomy and secondary hemorrhage was 13 days. Packing was sufficient to control the bleeding in 13 patients, and 6 patients required vault suturing. Laparoscopic coagulation of the uterine artery was performed in 1 patient. Uterine artery embolization was performed twice in 1 patient to control the bleeding. CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that secondary hemorrhage is rare but may occur more often after total laparoscopic hysterectomy than after other hysterectomy approaches. Whether it is related to the application of thermal energy to tissues, which causes more tissue necrosis and devascularization than sharp culdotomy in abdominal and vaginal hysterectomies, is not clear. A large uterus size, excessive use of an energy source for the uterine artery, and culdotomy may play a role.","output":"Secondary hemorrhage after total laparoscopic hysterectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Descriptions of clinical characteristics of patients hospitalised withCOVID-19, their clinical course and short-term inpatient and outpatient outcomes in deprived urban populations in the UK are still relatively sparse.

We analyzed data on endemic fluorosis collected in Ningxia, a typical high-fluorine area in the north of China. Fluorosis cases were identified in 539 villages in 1981, in 4449 villages in 2010, and in 3269 villages in 2017. These were located in 19 administrative counties. In 2017, a total of 1.07 million individuals suffered from fluorosis in Ningxia, with more children suffering from dental fluorosis and skeletal fluorosis. Among Qingshuihe River basin disease areas, the high incidence of endemic fluorosis is in Yuanzhou District and Xiji County of Guyuan City. The paper holds that the genesis of the high incidence of endemic fluorosis in Qingshui River basin is mainly caused by chemical weathering, evaporation and concentration, and dissolution of fluorine-containing rocks around the basin, which is also closely related to the semi-arid geographical region background, basin structure, groundwater chemical characteristics, and climatic conditions of the basin. The process of mutual recharge and transformation between Qingshui River and shallow groundwater in the basin is intense. There is a close coupling relationship between the power of central and southern Ningxia disease areas and Qingshui River watershed of excess fluorine water. Because the traditional drinking water source of the residents in the basin is shallow groundwater, the underground water is the main cause of the high incidence of endemic fluorosis. The results show that Xiji County and Yuanzhou District were the areas of high incidence of endemic fluorosis which gradually decreased to the middle and lower reaches of Qingshui River. In space, distribution characteristics are Qingshui River source area > Qingshui River valley basin area, tributary area > trunk stream area, upstream area > middle reaches area> downstream area of Qingshui River.

We then discuss potential solutions in the realm of translational bioinformatics. RECENT FINDINGS: Current case definitions are inconsistent and do not capture the underlying pathophysiology of MIS-C, which remains poorly understood. Although overall mortality is low, some patients rapidly decompensate, and a test to identify those at risk for severe outcomes remains an unmet need. Treatment consists of various combinations of immunoglobulins, corticosteroids, and biologics, based on extrapolated data and expert opinion, while the benefits remain unclear as we await the completion of clinical trials.

Influenza causes a heavy disease burden in older adults, but can be alleviated by vaccination. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of a potential government-funded seasonal influenza vaccination program in older adults in China. METHODS We characterized the health and economic impact of a fully funded influenza vaccination program for older adults using China-specific influenza disease burden, and related cost data, etc. Using a decision tree model, we calculated the incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of vaccination from the societal perspective, at a willingness-to-pay threshold equivalent to GDP per capita (US$8840). Moreover, we estimated the threshold vaccination costs, under which the fully funded vaccination program is cost-effective using GDP per capita as the willingness-to-pay threshold. RESULTS Compared to current self-paid vaccination, a fully funded vaccination program is expected to prevent 19,812 (95% uncertainty interval, 7150-35,783) influenza-like-illness outpatient consultations per year, 9418 (3386-17,068) severe acute respiratory infection hospitalizations per year, and 8800 (5300-11,667) respiratory excess deaths due to influenza per year, and gain 70,212 (42,106-93,635) QALYs per year.

It is not known whether as pre-exposure prophylaxis it may prevent COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To compare the incidence of COVID-19 in Spanish patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases treated with and without hydroxychloroquine. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective electronic record review, from February 27th to June 21st, 2020, of patients with autoimmune inflammatory diseases followed at two academic tertiary care hospitals in Seville, Spain. The cumulative incidence of confirmed COVID-19, by PCR or serology, was compared between patients with and without hydroxychloroquine as part of their treatment of autoimmune inflammatory diseases. RESULTS: Among 722 included patients, 290 (40%) were receiving hydroxychloroquine. During the seventeen-week study period, 10 (3.4% [95% CI: 1.7%-6.7%] cases of COVID-19 were registered among patients with hydroxychloroquine and 13 (3.0% [1.6%-5.1%]) (p = 0.565) in those without hydroxychloroquine. COVID-19 was diagnosed by PCR in four (1.4%, 95% CI 0.38%-3.5%) subject with hydroxychloroquine and six (1.4%, 95% CI 0.5%-3.0%) without hydroxychloroquine (p = 0.697). Three patients on hydroxychloroquine and four patients without hydroxychloroquine were admitted to the hospital, none of them required to be transferred to the intensive care unit and no patient died during the episode.

The influenza virus genome is an 8-segment single-stranded RNA with high potential for in situ recombination. Two segments code for the hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) antigens used for host-cell entry. At present, 16 H and 9 N subtypes are known, for a total of 144 possible different influenza subtypes, each with potentially different host susceptibility. With >10,000 species of birds found in nearly every terrestrial and aquatic habitat, there are few places on earth where birds cannot be found. The avian immune system differs from that of humans in several important features, including asynchronous B and T lymphocyte systems and a polymorphic multigene immune complex, but little is known about the immunogenetics of pathogenic response. Postbreeding dispersal and migration and a naturally high degree of environmental vagility mean that wild birds have the potential to be vectors that transmit highly pathogenic variants great distances from the original sources of infection.","output":"Ecology of Avian Influenza Virus in Birds"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Increasing influenza vaccination coverage in school-aged children may substantially reduce community transmission. School-located influenza vaccinations (SLIV) aim to promote vaccinations by increasing accessibility, which may be especially beneficial to race/ethnicity groups that face high barriers to preventative care. Here, we evaluate the effectiveness of a city-wide SLIV program by race/ethnicity from 2014 to 2018. METHODS: We used multivariate matching to pair schools in the intervention district in Oakland, CA with schools in a comparison district in West Contra Costa County, CA. We distributed cross-sectional surveys to measure caregiver-reported student vaccination status and estimated differences in vaccination coverage levels and reasons for non-vaccination between districts stratifying by race/ethnicity. We estimated difference-in-differences (DID) of laboratory confirmed influenza hospitalization incidence between districts stratified by race/ethnicity using surveillance data. RESULTS: Differences in influenza vaccination coverage in the intervention vs. comparison district were larger among White (2017C18: 21.0% difference [95% CI: 9.7%, 32.3%]) and Hispanic/Latino (13.4% [8.8%, 18.0%]) students than Asian/Pacific Islander (API) (8.9% [1.3%, 16.5%]), Black (5.9% [?2.2%, 14.0%]), and multiracial (6.3% [?1.8%, 14.3%)) students. Concerns about vaccine effectiveness or safety were more common among Black and multiracial caregivers. Logistical barriers were less common in the intervention vs. comparison district, with the largest difference among White students. In both districts, hospitalizations in 2017C18 were higher in Blacks (Intervention: 111.5 hospitalizations per 100,00; Comparison: 134.1 per 100,000) vs. other races/ethnicities. All-age influenza hospitalization incidence was lower in the intervention site vs. comparison site among White/API individuals in 2016C17 (DID ?25.14 per 100,000 [95% CI: ?40.14, ?10.14]) and 2017C18 (?36.6 per 100,000 [?52.7, ?20.5]) and Black older adults in 2017C18 (?282.2 per 100,000 (?508.4, ?56.1]), but not in other groups.

Although there are very few studies describing the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infections in patients with prostate cancer, these patients are likely to be more susceptible to COVID-19 than healthy people because of their immunosuppressed state. However, there is no evidence that prostate cancer is a risk factor for COVID-19. METHODS: We searched the Wanfang database, the China Science Journal Citation Report (VIP database), the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Web of Science, EMBASE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library for studies related to the topic. We designed a standardized data extraction sheet and used Epidata software 3.1 for data extraction. In accordance with the Cochrane 5.1.0 standard, both a quality assessment and a risk assessment were carried out for the research meeting the inclusion criteria. The data were analyzed using Revman 5.3 and Stata 13.0 software. RESULTS: The study integrated existing research findings and a meta-analysis of the data to investigate the prevalence of prostate cancer in males infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the adverse clinical outcomes in male patients with or without COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The results of this research may provide a basis for judging if prostate cancer is a risk factor for males infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the findings can effectively help to prevent COVID-19 in patients with prostate cancer.

Our data pertain to the 3135 US counties across 51 states. We have considered around 20 variables relevant to health, healthcare, health outcomes and lifestyle factors affecting Covid19 cases and deaths. We have used New York Times Covid data from January 2020 through May 2021 and University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute data on the county level health factor and outcome indicators. Methods: Given the discrete nature of the Covid data, the count data regression model is set up as vehicle for our empirical work. Traditional Poisson regression could not be applied due to overdispersion. Instead, we have used the negative binomial regression, suitable for nonnegative count dependent variable. The negative binomial regression allows the variance to exceed the mean. The form of the model equation for negative binomial regression is the same as that for Poisson regression. The log of the outcome is predicted with a linear combination of the predictors. We have specifically applied the generalized negative binomial model to allow the natural log of  to vary, observation by observation, as a linear combination of another set of covariates. Results: Empirical estimates derived show that many of the chosen factors have significant effect on Covid, in varying degrees. For example, alcohol consumption, overcrowding in living conditions, lack of food security and absence of health insurance are significant factors in Covid 19 case and death. We also find that smoking and pre-existing diabetes are not as significant factors as many other studies have portrayed.

METHODS: We describe a multidisciplinary vascular access team's development to improve frontline providers' workflow by placing central venous and arterial catheters. Herein we describe the development, organization, and processes resulting in the rapid formation and deployment of this team, reporting on notable clinical issues encountered, which might serve as a basis for future quality improvement and investigation. We describe a retrospective, single-center descriptive study in a large, quaternary academic medical center in a major city. The COVID-19 vascular access team included physicians with specialized experience in placing invasive catheters and whose usual clinical schedule had been lessened through deferment of elective cases. The target population included patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 in the medical ICU (MICU) needing invasive catheter placement. The line team placed all invasive catheters on patients in the MICU with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Primary data collected were the number and type of catheters placed, time of team member exposure to potentially infected patients, and any complications over the first three weeks. Secondary outcomes pertained to workflow enhancement and quality improvement. 145 invasive catheters were placed on 67 patients. Of these 67 patients, 90% received arterial catheters, 64% central venous catheters, and 25% hemodialysis catheters. None of the central venous catheterizations or hemodialysis catheters were associated with early complications. Arterial line malfunction due to thrombosis was the most frequent complication.

Clinical, demographic, and microbiologic data were compared with those of patients hospitalized during the same period of 2019. RESULTS: Among 26,012 patients admitted in the first semester of 2020, 1,182 had COVID-19. In patients with COVID-19, we observed 107 BSIs, with an incidence rate of 8.19 episodes per 1000 patient-days. This incidence was significantly higher than in patients without COVID-19 (2.72/1000 patient-days) and in patients admitted in 2019 (2.76/1000 patient-days). In comparison with patients without COVID-19, BSIs onset in patients with COVID-19 was delayed during the course of hospitalization (16.0 vs 5 days). Thirty-day mortality among patients with COVID-19 was 40.2%, significantly higher than in patients without COVID-19 (23.7%).

Though complete lockdown is epidemiologically effective, because it eliminates infectious contacts, it comes with significant costs. Several recent studies have suggested that a plausible compromise strategy for minimizing epidemic risk is periodic closure, in which populations oscillate between wide-spread social restrictions and relaxation. However, no underlying theory has been proposed to predict and explain optimal closure periods as a function of epidemiological and social parameters. In this work we develop such an analytical theory for SEIR-like model diseases, showing how characteristic closure periods emerge that minimize the total outbreak, and increase predictably with the reproductive number and incubation periods of a diseaseC as long as both are within predictable limits. Using our approach we demonstrate a sweet-spot effect in which optimal periodic closure is maximally effective for diseases with similar incubation and recovery periods.

The considerable psychic and social repercussions of the pandemic mobilized a significant anguish of death. The sudden onset of the pandemic was followed by spectacular, high-profile deaths that fascinated the imagination, listing it in the order of traumatic events, provoking reactions of astonishment, flight and avoidance. GOAL: The objective of this study is to determine the symptomatology of post-traumatic stress disorder, as well as the resilience, associated with the Covid-19 pandemic in the Western Region of Cameroon. METHODOLOGY: The research was carried out following the model of general population mental health surveys. The availability of area frames (sampling) made it possible to opt for probabilistic calculations. First and second year master's students in clinical psychology from Dschang University were involved in data collection. They benefited from a two-day seminar on data collection techniques in the general population. The calculated sample size is 384 households. The anticipated response rate, set at 90%, made it possible to increase robustness and to anticipate a total sample of 424 households, spread over 3 districts of Bafoussam and Dschang, according to the choice previously made. The study followed the ethical provisions of the Helsinki Protocol. The data collection tools used are: the Impact of Event Scale-Revised and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. RESULTS: 409 subjects were recruited, representing a completion rate of 106.5%. 70.7% of subjects exhibited symptoms of PTSD. These symptoms are more often mild (40.9%) or moderate (25.6%). Women are more affected (73.7%) by PTSD than men (67.9%). In addition to sex and age, area of residence and marital status, appear to be significantly associated with symptoms of PTSD: subjects under 35 years of age have a significantly higher prevalence rate than those over 35; the rate of PTSD is significantly higher in subjects living in urban areas than in those living in rural areas; single subjects are more affected by PTSD (40.1%) than married subjects (26.7%). The average score recorded on the CD-RISC is 64.3, the standard deviation is 15.3 and the coefficient of variation is 24%. This average falls into the second quartile of the distribution, indicating average resilience. CD-RISC scores are not affected by gender, age, marital status, level of education, or occupational status. These characteristics are therefore not factors of resilience. CONCLUSION: The Covid-19 pandemic has had a psychological impact in Cameroon which has made it a major psychosocial stressor. More than 6 in 10 people have symptoms of PTSD. But this symptomatology is often weak or moderate, testifying to an effective resilience, to balance the traumatic effects of the pandemic.","output":"Traumatisme et rsilience associs  la pandmie de la COVID-19 dans les villes de Bafoussam et de Dschang au Cameroun"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 crisis necessitated abrupt transition to remote learning in medical schools.

In the healthcare industry, Internet of Things (IoT) driven fog computing is being developed to speed up the services for the general public and save billions of lives. This new computing platform, based on the fog computing paradigm, may reduce latency when transmitting and communicating signals with faraway servers, allowing medical services to be delivered more quickly in both spatial and temporal dimensions. One of the necessary qualities of computing systems that can enable the completion of healthcare operations is latency reduction. Fog computing can provide reduced latency when compared to cloud computing due to the use of only low-end computers, mobile phones, and personal devices in fog computing. In this paper, a new framework for healthcare monitoring for managing real-time notification based on fog computing has been proposed.

We examined the degree of reperfusion with the expanded TICI (eTICI) scale and association with outcomes in the HERMES collaboration of recent endovascular trials. METHODS The HERMES Imaging Core, blind to all other data, evaluated angiography after endovascular therapy in HERMES. A battery of TICI scores (mTICI, TICI, TICI2C) was used to define reperfusion of the initial target occlusion defined by non-invasive imaging and conventional angiography. RESULTS Angiography of 801 subjects was available, including 797 defined by non-invasive imaging (154 internal carotid artery (ICA), 583 M1, 60 M2) and 748 by conventional angiography (195 ICA, 459 M1, 94 M2). Among 729 subjects in whom the reperfusion grade could be established, using eTICI (3=100%, 2C=90-99%, 2b67=67-89%, 2b50=50-66%) of the conventional angiography target occlusion, there were 63 eTICI 3 (9%), 166 eTICI 2c (23%), 218 eTICI 2b67 (30%), 103 eTICI 2b50 (14%), 100 eTICI 2a (14%), 19 eTICI 1 (3%), and 60 eTICI 0 (8%). Modified Rankin Scale shift analyses from baseline to 90 days showed that increasing TICI grades were linked with better outcomes, with significant distinctions between TICI 0/1 versus 2a (p=0.028), 2a versus 2b50 (p=0.017), and 2b50 versus 2b67 (p=0.014). CONCLUSIONS The benefit of endovascular therapy in HERMES was strongly associated with increasing degrees of reperfusion defined by eTICI.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey. METHODS: Clinical nurses were conveniently recruited by an online link in three provinces out of Hubei, including Hunan (Central south), Chongqing (Southwest) and Xinjiang (Northwest) during 4-10 February 2020. A structured questionnaire was distributed by an online investigation system. Information on sociodemographic characteristics, willingness, possible influencing factors (previous experience, health status, training conditions, perceptions on volunteering to practice in Hubei, family attitude, and insurance) was collected. Binary logistic regression was conducted to explore the association of different factors with the willingness decision of nurses. RESULTS: A total of 11,183 nurses participated in this survey and a high proportion of them were willing to volunteer to practice in Hubei combating the epidemic. Nurses who were likely to volunteer had the following characteristics: younger, unmarried, members of the Communist Party of China, with senior professional qualification, working in critical care departments, with support from their families, with adequate training and learning, with good health status and low levels of anxiety. The regression model could explain 31.1% of the variances of the willingness decision of nurses. CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of nurses in China were willing to practice in Hubei during the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic. Adequate training and psychological support would facilitate nurses to volunteer during the outbreak of an infectious disease. IMPACT: The study identified a high proportion of nurses in China were willing to practice in Hubei combating the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic.

First, it is suggested that anti-vector immunity takes place as the regimen of homologous vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine is applied and interferes with efficacy of the vaccine when the interval between prime and boost doses is less than three months. Second, longitudinal studies suggest that ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine provides sub-optimal efficacy against UK variant of SARS-CoV-2, which appears to have an increased transmissibility over the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 among vaccinated people. At the moment, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine is able to reduce the severity of symptoms and transmissibility;however, if the vaccinated individuals do not maintain everyday preventive actions, they could turn into potential spreaders, thus accelerating the process of generation of new viral variants due to the selective pressure of immune response. Prediction and possible consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 evolution and repeated anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations are discussed.

It is important to consider the effect that this change in method of delivery has had on experience. Method An anonymous survey was distributed to determine the benefits and challenges from participants and facilitators with at least a month of virtual Balint Group experience. The open-ended survey questions captured extended answer responses from 16 students and trainees, and 5 (co-)facilitators, within Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust. The qualitative feedback was analysed by thematic analysis, identifying three main themes. Result The first theme of practicalities was centred around access to the group. The virtual format had benefits in terms of reducing travel and time commitment and so improving attendance. However, disadvantages were in technological issues and finding a private and safe environment, individuals often not leaving the work environment on which they were reflecting. The second theme of communication identified how virtual methods are a less natural way of interacting (for example sequential point making), losing both immediacy of reactions and non-verbal communication. There was a loss of essential communication cues, with disjointed conversation affecting contribution. The third theme of group dynamics had some advantages, feeling less intimidating virtually. Yet disadvantages included loss of group cohesion, with participants not building the same relationships (on arriving and leaving a group space), and trust. The more subtle emotions in the group might be missed and opinions given less openly. The facilitators needed to be more directive and experienced difficulties maintaining group engagement and managing the frame. Conclusion The advantages of virtual format are more based on accessibility and the disadvantages more experiential. There are elements of being physically remote that lead to a disembodied experience, that might impact on capacity to reflect emotionally. This might make it more difficult to identify unconscious processes and the experience might be more cognitive. There is a risk that virtually participants will feel more alone with difficult feelings and unsupported by the group. When mental health is being affected by social isolation due to the pandemic, having groups virtually can mimic this isolation in working life. Overall the preference remained for an in-person group.

We aimed to use a human factors approach (the science concerned with understanding the interactions between humans and other elements in a complex system) to identify where systemic vulnerabilities may exist throughout the patient/provider experience with telemedicine. Methods: A total of 23 patients scheduled for telemedicine consults were observed during visits with providers. A trained human factors observer documented disruptions to system efficiency (eg communication breakdowns, connectivity problems and interruptions) and invited patients and providers to take a survey investigating perceptions of telemedicine technology usability, satisfaction with the experience and opportunities to improve the process. Results: Visits lasted an average of 17 minutes, 20 seconds and each visit had an average of 6 disruptions. Inefficiencies were categorized into 13 categories consisting mainly of interruptions (21, 15.22%), Internet connectivity issues (21, 15.22%), nonoptimal device setup (19, 13.77%) and repeat communication (18, 13.04%).

This was done by involving the public in the design, conduct, and dissemination of a randomised trial. METHODS: Using a reflexive approach, we describe the processes of development, conduct, and dissemination of The Peoples Trial. RESULTS: Over 3000 members of the public, from 72 countries, participated in The Peoples Trial. Through a series of online surveys, the public designed a trial called The Reading Trial. They chose the question the trial would try to answer and decided the components of the trial question. In December 2019, 991 participants were recruited to a trial to answer the question identified and prioritised by the public, i.e. Does reading a book in bed make a difference to sleep in comparison with not reading a book in bed? We report the processes of The Peoples Trial in seven phases, paralleling the steps of a randomised trial, i.e. question identification and prioritisation, recruitment, randomisation, trial conduct, data analysis, and sharing of findings. We describe the decisions we made, the processes we used, the challenges we encountered, and the lessons we learned. CONCLUSION: The Peoples Trial involved the public successfully in the design, conduct, and dissemination of a randomised trial demonstrating the potential for such initiatives to help the public learn about randomised trials, to understand why they matter, and to be better equipped to think critically about health claims.

The virus has rapidly spread in humans, causing the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic. Recent studies have shown that, similarly to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 utilises the Spike glycoprotein on the envelope to recognise and bind the human receptor ACE2. This event initiates the fusion of viral and host cell membranes and then the viral entry into the host cell. Despite several ongoing clinical studies, there are currently no approved vaccines or drugs that specifically target SARS-CoV-2. Until an effective vaccine is available, repurposing FDA approved drugs could significantly shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study we attempted to overcome the limitation of in silico virtual screening by applying a robust in silico drug repurposing strategy. We combined and integrated docking simulations, with molecular dynamics (MD), Supervised MD (SuMD) and Steered MD (SMD) simulations to identify a Spike protein - ACE2 interaction inhibitor. Our data showed that Simeprevir and Lumacaftor bind the receptor-binding domain of the Spike protein with high affinity and prevent ACE2 interaction.","output":"An integrated drug repurposing strategy for the rapid identification of potential SARS-CoV-2 viral inhibitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to analyse the characteristics and predictors of death in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Spain. METHODS: Retrospective observational study of the first consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay in 127 Spanish centres until March 17, 2020. The follow-up censoring date was April 17, 2020. We collected demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and complications data. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with death. RESULTS: Of the 4,035 patients, males accounted for 2,433/3,987 (61.0%), the median age was 70 years, and 2,539/3,439 (73.8%) had >1 comorbidity. The most common symptoms were a history of fever, cough, malaise, and dyspnoea. During hospitalization 1,255/3,979 (31.5%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, 736/3,988 (18.5%) were admitted to intensive care units, and 619/3,992 (15.5%) underwent mechanical ventilation.

The QI initiatives, as implementation strategies, include a bundle of evidence-based interventions adapted for implementation in China. During the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), fear of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, national lockdowns, and altered health care priorities have highlighted the program's importance in improving STEMI care quality. This study aims to minimize the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the quality of STEMI care, by developing interventions that optimize the QI initiatives, implementing and evaluating the optimized QI initiatives, and developing scale-up activities of the optimized QI initiatives in response to COVID-19 and other public health emergencies. METHODS: A stepped wedge cluster randomized control trial will be conducted in three selected cities of China: Wuhan, Suzhou, and Shenzhen. Two districts have been randomly selected in each city, yielding a total of 24 registered hospitals. This study will conduct a rollout in these hospitals every 3 months. The 24 hospitals will be randomly assigned to four clusters, and each cluster will commence the intervention (optimized QI initiatives) at one of the four steps. We will conduct hospital-based assessments, questionnaire surveys among health care providers, community-based household surveys, and key informant interviews during the trial. All outcome measures will be organized using the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, maintenance) framework, including implementation outcomes, service outcomes (e.g., treatment time), and patient outcomes (e.g., in-hospital mortality and 1-year complication). The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research framework will be used to identify factors that influence implementation of the optimized QI interventions. DISCUSSION: The study findings could be translated into a systematic solution to implementing QI initiatives in response to COVID-19 and future potential major public health emergencies. Such actionable knowledge is critical for implementors of scale-up activities in low- and middle-income settings. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ChiCTR 2100043319 .

Several mutations in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 have already been detected, and their effect in immune system evasion and enhanced transmission as a cause of increased morbidity and mortality are being investigated. From pathogenic and epidemiological perspectives, spike proteins are of prime interest to researchers. This study focused on the unique variants of S proteins from six continents Asia, Africa, Europe, Oceania, South America, and North America. In comparison to the other five continents, Africa (29.065%) had the highest percentage of unique S proteins. Notably, only North America had 87% (14046) of the total (16143) specific S proteins available in the NCBI database(across all continents). Based on the amino acid frequency distributions in the S protein variants from all the continents, the phylogenetic relationship implies that unique S proteins from North America were significantly different from those of the other five continents. Overtime, the unique variants originating from North America are most likely to spread to the other geographic locations through international travel or naturally by emerging mutations. Hence it is suggested that restriction of international travel should be considered, and massive vaccination as an utmost measure to combat the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. It is also further suggested that the efficacy of existing vaccines and future vaccine development must be reviewed with careful scrutiny, and if needed, further re-engineered based on requirements dictated by new emerging S protein variants.","output":"Implications Derived from S-Protein Variants of SARS-CoV-2 from Six Continents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES This study investigated the psychosocial responses of children and their parents to pandemic disasters, specifically measuring traumatic stress responses in children and parents with varying disease-containment experiences. METHODS A mixed-method approach using survey, focus groups, and interviews produced data from 398 parents. Adult respondents completed the University of California at Los Angeles Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Reaction Index (PTSD-RI) Parent Version and the PTSD Check List Civilian Version (PCL-C). RESULTS Disease-containment measures such as quarantine and isolation can be traumatizing to a significant portion of children and parents. Criteria for PTSD was met in 30% of isolated or quarantined children based on parental reports, and 25% of quarantined or isolated parents (based on self-reports). CONCLUSIONS These findings indicate that pandemic disasters and subsequent disease-containment responses may create a condition that families and children find traumatic. Because pandemic disasters are unique and do not include congregate sites for prolonged support and recovery, they require specific response strategies to ensure the behavioral health needs of children and families.

METHODS: A multicenter, retrospective cohort study was conducted. The cohort consisted of adult patients (18 years of age and older) requiring ECMO in the period from March 1, 2020, to September 30, 2020. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality after ECMO initiation assessed with a time to event analysis at 90 days. Multivariable Cox proportional regression was used to determine factors associated with in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Overall, 292 patients from 17 centers comprised the study cohort. Patients were 49 (interquartile range, 39-57) years old and 81 (28%) were female. At the end of the follow-up period, 19 (6%) patients were still receiving ECMO, 25 (9%) were discontinued from ECMO but remained hospitalized, 135 (46%) were discharged or transferred alive, and 113 (39%) died during the hospitalization. The cumulative in-hospital mortality at 90 days was 42% (95% confidence interval [CI], 36%-47%). Factors associated with in-hospital mortality were age (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.31; 95% CI, 1.06-1.61 per 10 years), renal dysfunction measured according to serum creatinine level (aHR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.01-1.45), and cardiopulmonary resuscitation before ECMO placement (aHR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.01-3.46).

It was found that both the amount of these compounds in tea and the antioxidant activity of tea infusions were largely determined by the origin of tea leaves as well as the processing method, which can modify the content of the studied components up to several hundred-fold. The group of green teas was the best source of phenolic compounds (110.73 mg/100 mL) and magnesium (1885 g/100 mL) and was also characterised by the highest antioxidant activity (59.02%). This type of tea is a great contributor to the daily intake of the studied components. The average consumption of green tea infusions, assumed to be 3C4 cups (1 L) a day, provides the body with health-promoting polyphenol levels significantly exceeding the recommended daily dose. Moreover, drinking one litre of an unfermented tea infusion provides more than three times the recommended daily intake of manganese. Tea infusions can be a fairly adequate, but only a supplementary, source of potassium, zinc, magnesium, and copper in the diet. Moreover, it could be concluded that the antioxidant activity of all the analysed types of tea infusions results not only from the high content of phenolic compounds and manganese but is also related to the presence of magnesium and potassium.","output":"Tea as a Source of Biologically Active Compounds in the Human Diet"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 is a threat to the health and well-being of millions of lifes across the globe.

Manual titration polysomnography and the 90th or 95th percentiles of pressure titrated by automatic CPAP (APAP) are the current standard for determining fixed pressure. Pressures programmed at an arbitrary fixed value, or at preset values based on body mass index (BMI) or by predictive formulas, are presented as alternative forms. This study aimed to evaluate the residual apneaChypopnea index (r-AHI) in polysomnography with CPAP therapy using pressure determined by formula and assess its feasibility to start treatment. METHODS: Patients referred for CPAP therapy were followed up in three outpatient assessments and underwent polysomnography study with pressure CPAP obtained by formula. RESULTS: The study sample consisted of 80 patients, 41 women; age 58.6  11.3 years, BMI 34.1  7.5 kg/m(2) and cervical circumference 42.0  4.2 cm.

Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study drawn from a national surveillance system with propensity score-matched analysis. All cases with suspected MIS-C were reported to the French National Public Health Agency. Confirmed MIS-C cases fulfilling the World Health Organization definition were included. The study started on April 1, 2020, and follow-up ended on January 6, 2021. Exposures: IVIG and methylprednisolone vs IVIG alone. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was persistence of fever 2 days after the introduction of initial therapy or recrudescence of fever within 7 days, which defined treatment failure. Secondary outcomes included a second-line therapy, hemodynamic support, acute left ventricular dysfunction after first-line therapy, and length of stay in the pediatric intensive care unit. The primary analysis involved propensity score matching with a minimum caliper of 0.1. Results: Among 181 children with suspected MIS-C, 111 fulfilled the World Health Organization definition (58 females [52%]; median age, 8.6 years [interquartile range, 4.7 to 12.1]).

Developing countries, especially in their rural areas, suffer from a lack of healthcare facilities, poverty and high rate of illiteracy. Motivated by the huge socio-economic gap between the developed and the developing worlds, there have been several studies into the COVID-19 pandemic management in developing countries. However, none of these research works emphasised the health cultural beliefs of any developing economy as a basis for their recommendations. Specifically, this paper discusses the pandemic situation in Nigeria with emphasis on the prevalent health cultural beliefs of the citizens of the country, especially those living in rural communities. This is important because each local community defines a socio-ecological cluster of people who are more tightly knitted together in terms of language, relationship, culture, religion, social amenities, business, leadership and so on. As such, there is a need to prepare the socio-ecological units to be more resistant to the spread of the virus; a weaker social-ecological unit will entail a higher risk of community transmissions.

When ectopically expressed, ORF8b inhibited IRF3-mediated IFN- expression induced by Sendai virus and poly(I:C). ORF8b was found to act at a step upstream of IRF3 to impede the interaction between IRF3 kinase IKK and chaperone protein HSP70, which is required for the activation of IKK and IRF3. An infection study using recombinant wild-type and ORF8b-deficient MERS-CoV further confirmed the suppressive role of ORF8b in type I IFN induction and its disruption of the colocalization of HSP70 with IKK. Ectopic expression of HSP70 relieved suppression of IFN- expression by ORF8b in an IKK-dependent manner. Enhancement of IFN- induction in cells infected with ORF8b-deficient virus was erased when HSP70 was depleted.

At present, more than 40 different drugs are being explored for efficacy against COVID-19, including antivirals and immune modulating compounds. Unfortunately, many of these drugs are associated with side effects that limit their use to the most severe cases and thereby prevent their use as prophylactics. This commentary describes drug formulation strategies that can be used to maintain the efficacy of these drugs through controlled release, targeted delivery, and non-viral nucleic acid delivery. If successful, these approaches could enable the expanded use of drugs to reduce the mortality of this devastating disease and equip healthcare providers with the tools to accelerate our recovery from this pandemic and improve our response to the next outbreak of a novel pathogenic virus.

The current approach to prevent airborne disease transmission is an extraoral aerosol suction unit: a stand-alone vacuum module with a segmented arm and cup. Despite the need for disease control in dental offices, these units are rarely seen due to the loud noise produced by vacuum, bulky size, and high cost. This paper describes the aerodynamic design optimization of an affordable, 3D printable, Extraoral Vacuum Aerosol Cup (EVAC) that can be directly connected to existing standard 7/16 central vacuum high-volume evacuator (HVE) valves used for intraoral saliva absorption in a dental office. These HVEs are typically unsuitable for extraoral suction due to their low vacuum force. However, they can be used for extraoral suction, if the cup attachment is aerodynamically optimized for maximum suction efficiency. Fifteen different designs of EVAC are proposed and their suction processes were simulated with computational fluid dynamics. Droplets of various sizes are released to mimic the droplets produced during dental operation. The suction performances of EVACs with different sizes and shapes were compared to find out the designs with optimal performance. Prototypes of the optimized EVAC are 3D printed and tested at a dental office. Development and manufacturing of such a device will largely reduce the COVID-19 infection risk, thus improving the safety protection for both patients and doctors at dental offices.","output":"Computational Fluid Dynamics Optimization of an Extraoral Vacuum Aerosol Cup for Airborne Disease Control in Dental Offices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Decision-making autonomy may have played a crucial role in protecting, or on the contrary, intensifying the onset of negative psychological outcomes for workers with roles with responsibilities during the lockdown due to the Covid-19 crisis. The present study analyzed the emotional dimension of workaholism in relation to emotional exhaustion, considering decision-making autonomy as a moderator of this relationship, in a sample of 101 managers and freelancers in the middle of the lockdown in Italy (early April 2020). Results showed that the relationship between negative (workaholic) emotions and emotional exhaustion was moderated by decision-making autonomy and this moderation differed for managers and freelancers. In particular, the results showed that in the target of managers high levels of negative emotional experiences related to workaholism and low decision-making autonomy are associated with higher levels emotional exhaustion, while high levels of emotional experiences linked to workaholism and high decision-making autonomy produced significantly lower levels of emotional exhaustion. On the contrary, low levels of job autonomy were associated to higher level of emotional exhaustion when negative (workaholic) emotions were low for the freelancers. Limitations are related to the limited sample and the cross-sectional nature of the study. Practical implications lie in considering decision-making autonomy as a double-edged sword, such that when low it could be a risk for managers and when high it could be a risk for freelancers.","output":"Negative (Workaholic) Emotions and Emotional Exhaustion: Might Job Autonomy Have Played a Strategic Role in Workers with Responsibility during the Covid-19 Crisis Lockdown?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Study aimed to recognize crises management level and its Relationship to Psychological Stress Among Academic Leaders at King Khalid University in the light of Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) and to clarify the differences between variables of crises management and psychological stress among a sample of academic leaders according to college type, gender, experience years, and administrative position The study relied on the descriptive analytical method and suitable tools were used to assess the study variables that are : Crises management scale ( prepared by the researchers ) and psychological stress among academic leaders during Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) ( prepared by the researchers ) The study sample consisted of a random sample of (124) leaders of academic staff members and reached the following results: the level of crises management for the dimensions: for mitigation and readiness, confrontation and response, rebalance and a construction and the continuous learning from the crisis reached (2 01) as a relative weight and (67%) percentage that is an average degree the level of psychological stresses for the dimensions: personal field and work field reached a relative weight of (2 30) and (77%) percentage that is an average degree among academic leaders during Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) There is a reverse correlation between crises management and psychological stresses of academic Leaders during Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) Also, there are significant statistical difference between crises management and psychological stresses among academic leaders during Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) attributed to the variable of college type, gender and experience and there are no difference for the variable of administrative position The study recommended the necessity of spreading the culture of crises management among academic leaders by preparing guidelines clarifying how to deal with crises and holding periodical training sessions in the field of crises management [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Journal of Education - Sohag University is the property of Journal of Education - Sohag University and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Crises management and its Relationship to Psychological Stress Among Academic Leaders at King Khalid University in the light of Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: At the time of the COVID-19 epidemic, it is useful to look at what lessons (digital) history can give us about the past pandemics and dealing with them. We show that the Google Ngram (GNV) can discover hidden patterns in history and, therefore, can be used as a window into history. By using the approach of Digital Humanities, we analysed the epidemiological literature on the development of the Russian flu pandemic for hints on how the COVID-19 might develop in the following years. Objective: Our study is searching for evidence that the COVID-19 is not a unique phenomenon in human history. We are testing the hypothesis that the flu-like illness that caused loss of taste and smell in the late 19th century (Russian flu) was caused by a coronavirus. We are aware that it is difficult to formulate a hypothesis for a microbiological aetiology of a pandemic that occurred 133 years ago. But differentiating an influenza virus infection from a COVID-19 patient purely on the clinical ground is difficult for a physician because the symptoms overlap. The most crucial observation of similarities between the Russian flu pandemic and COVID-19 is the loss of smell and taste (anosmia and ageusia). The objective was to calculate the ratio of increasing to decreasing trends in the changes in frequencies of the selected words representing symptoms of the Russian flu and COVID-19. Methods: The primary methodological concept of our approach is to analyse the ratio of increasing to decreasing trends in the changes in frequencies of the selected words representing symptoms of the Russian flu and COVID-19 with the Google NGram analytical tool. Initially, keywords were chosen that are specific and common for the Russian flu and COVID-19. We show the graphic display on the Y-axis what percentage of words in the selected corpus of books (collective memory) over the years (X-axis) make up the word. To standardise the data, we requested the data from 1800 to 2019 in English, German and Russian (to 2012) book corpora and focused on the ten years before, during and after the outbreak of the Russian flu. We compared this frequency index with non-epidemic periods to test the model analytical potential and prove the signification of the results. Results: The COVID-19 is not a unique phenomenon because the Russian flu was probably the coronavirus infection. Results show that all the three analysed book corpora (including newspapers and magazines) show the increase in the mention of the symptoms loss of smell and loss of taste during the Russian flu (1889-1891), which are today undoubtedly proven to be key symptoms of COVID-19. In the English corpus, the frequency rose from 0.0000040433 % in 1880 to 0.0000047123 % in 1889. The frequency fell sharply after the pandemic stopped in 1900 (0.0000033861%). In the Russian corpus, the frequency rises from 0 % in 1880 to 0.0000004682 % in 1889 and decreased rapidly after the pandemic (1900 = 0.0000011834 %). In the German corpus, the frequency rose from 0.0000014463 % in 1880 to 0.0000018015 % in 1889 and decreased also rapidly after the pandemic (1900 = 0.0000016600 %). According to our analysis of historical records with the approach of GNV, 1) the natural length of a pandemic is two to five years; 2) the pandemic stops on their own; 3) the viruses weaken over time; 4) the so-called herd immunity is not necessary to stop the pandemic; 5) history has shown that a significant crisis does not need to occur after the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: According to our study, the Google Books Ngram Viewer (GNV) gives a clear evidence of the influence that social changes have on word frequency. The results of this study open a discussion on the usefulness of the Google Ngram insights possibilities into past socio-cultural development, i.e. epidemics and pandemics that can serve as lessons for today. We showed hidden patterns of conceptual trends in history and their relationships with current development in the case of the pandemic COVID-19. The benefit of this method could help complement historical medical records, which are often woefully incomplete. However, this method comes with severe limitations and can be useful only under cautious handling and testing. Despite the numerous indications we have shown, we are aware that this thesis still cannot be confirmed and that it is necessary to require further historical and medical research.

Antibodies to the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the spike protein are frequently encoded by IGHV3-53/3-66 with a short CDR H3. Germline-encoded sequence motifs in CDRs H1 and H2 play a major role, but whether any common motifs are present in CDR H3, which is often critical for binding specificity, have not been elucidated. Here, we identify two public clonotypes of IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD antibodies with a 9-residue CDR H3 that pair with different light chains. Distinct sequence motifs on CDR H3 are present in the two public clonotypes that appear to be related to differential light chain pairing. Additionally, we show that Y58F is a common somatic hypermutation that results in increased binding affinity of IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD antibodies with a short CDR H3.

METHODS: : We conducted an observational, prospective case series study in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. Clinical outcome data (Intensive Care Unit admission and mortality) were collected from all patients until discharge. Viremia was determined longitudinally during hospitalisation, in plasma and serum samples collected sequentially, using two commercial and standardised RT-PCR techniques approved for use in diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Viral load (copies/mL and log10) was determined with quantitative TaqPath?COVID-19 test. Persistent viremia (PV) was defined as two or more consecutive quantifiable viral loads detected in blood samples (plasma/serum) during hospitalisation. RESULTS: : SARS-CoV-2 viremia was studied in 57 hospitalised COVID-19 patients. PV was detected in 16 (28%) patients. All of them, except for one who rapidly progressed to death, cleared viremia during hospitalisation. Poor clinical outcome occurred in 62.5% of patients with PV, while none of the negative patients or those with sporadic viremia presented this outcome (p<0.0001). Viral load was significantly higher in patients with PV than in those with Sporadic Viremia (p<0.05). Patients presented PV for a short period of time: median time from admission was 5 days (Range=2-12) and 4.5 days (Range=2-8) for plasma and serum samples, respectively. Similar results were obtained with all RT-PCR assays for both types of samples.

Methods A gas blender with a sequential gas delivery breathing circuit and software enabling prospective arterial blood gas targeting was used to implement rapid isocapnic lung changes in the partial pressure of blood oxygen (PaO2). Lung PO2 was initially lowered to induce a low baseline [dOHb]. PaO2 was then rapidly raised to PaO2  100 mmHg for 10 seconds and then rapidly returned to baseline. Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) MRI signal changes were measured over time. Results Arrival delay, signal amplitude and change in BOLD discriminated between large arteries, tissue and veins. The median half-time of BOLD signal in the middle cerebral artery was 1.7 s, indicating minimal dispersion confirming effective rapid modulation of pulmonary venous PO2. The contrast-to-noise ratio in the cortex was 3.

Aims To examine the effects of medication, placebo and supportive care on treatment outcome, and the relationships of expectations and therapeutic alliance to improvement. METHOD A total of 88 participants were randomised to 8 weeks of treatment with supportive care alone or combined with double-blind treatment with placebo or antidepressant medication. Expectations of medication effectiveness, general treatment effectiveness and therapeutic alliance were measured (trial registration at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00200902). RESULTS Medication or placebo plus supportive care were not significantly different but had significantly better outcome than supportive care alone. Therapeutic alliance predicted response to medication and placebo; expectations of medication effectiveness at enrolment predicted only placebo response. CONCLUSIONS Pill treatment yielded better outcome than supportive care alone. Medication expectations uniquely predicted placebo treatment outcome and were formed by time of enrolment, suggesting that they were shaped by prior experiences outside the clinical trial.","output":"Role of pill-taking, expectation and therapeutic alliance in the placebo response in clinical trials for major depression."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As of March 13, 2020, the director general of the World Health Organization (WHO) considered Europe as the centre of the global COVID-19 outbreak.

Today, about 34.3% (Cabinet Office Government of Japan 2010) of Japanese households keep some kind of pet. It is evident from the multiple social surveys that a strong attachment to pets has emerged since the mid-1990s. On 11 March 2011, the Tohoku region in Japan was struck by a large earthquake and the tsunami that followed. This was the largest earthquake on record in Japan. The Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant was seriously damaged and released radiation which continues to be an ongoing issue for those living in that part of Japan. The serious damage to humans and other animals caused by the tsunami and the radioactive contamination is outlined. The author provides an overview of the study and shows research questions. Then, she reviews the relevant literature, noting that most of the studies are set in a Western context and pointing to the contributions that might be made by considering how one highly developed Asian society has responded to the plight of pet owners following a major disaster.

However, the exact underlying mechanism of its protective effect on mitochondrial function remains unknown. Here we examined whether the beneficial effect of HSPB8 on OGD/R-induced cell death is associated with mitophagy in mouse neuroblastoma Neuro2a (N2a) cells. METHODS Using the mouse transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) model and mouse neuroblastoma Neuro2a (N2a) cell cultures subjected to OGD/R, we employed western-blot, RT-PCR and immunostaining to analyze the change of expression pattern of HSPB8 and mitophagic flux after brain I/R both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, via overexpressing HSPB8 or knocking down HSPB8 expression with siRNA in N2a cell, we evaluated the effect of HSPB8 on mitochondrial function during OGD/R. The impact of HSPB8 on mitophagic pathway was also assessed. Finally, mitotophagy inhibitors (CQ and Mdivi-1) were adopted to verify the involvement of mitophagy in HSPB8- induced neuroprotection. RESULTS HSPB8 could be up-regulated by brain I/R both in vivo and in vitro. Mitophagy enhancement coincided with induction of HSPB8 during I/R. Overexpression of HSPB8 reinforced I/R-induced mitophagy in OGD/R-treated mouse N2a cells and HSPB8 silence suppressed mitophagy process. Inhibition of mitophagy compromised neuroprotection conferred by HSPB8 overexpression. CONCLUSIONS HSPB8 promoted OGD/R-induced mitophagy, which restored the mitochondrial function and contributed to the decrease in cell apoptosis after OGD/R. Therefore, HSPB8 could be a favorable neuroprotective agent for cerebral I/R related disorders.","output":"Heat Shock Protein B8 (HSPB8) Reduces Oxygen-Glucose Deprivation/Reperfusion Injury via the Induction of Mitophagy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Whether risk genes of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from genome-wide association study could play their regulatory roles by interacting with host genes that were interacted with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteins was worthy of exploration.

Therefore, further descriptions of the pathological processes in those animals that show symptoms similar to those described in humans affected by COVID-19 would be highly valuable. The potential for companion animals to contribute to the continued transmission and community spread of this known human-to-human disease is an urgent issue to be considered. Forty animals with pulmonary pathologies were studied by chest X-ray, ultrasound analysis, and computed tomography. Nasopharyngeal and rectal swabs were analyzed to detect canine pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. An additional twenty healthy dogs living in SARS-CoV-2-positive households were included. Immunoglobulin detection by several immunoassays was performed. Our findings show that sick dogs presented severe alveolar or interstitial patterns with pulmonary opacity, parenchymal abnormalities, and bilateral lesions. The forty sick dogs were negative for SARS-CoV-2 but Mycoplasma spp. was detected in 26 of 33 dogs. Five healthy and one pathological dog presented IgG against SARS-CoV-2.

Adherence to dietary quality indices also have shown to have potential favorable effects on obesity-related health outcomes. However, no study has examined the interaction between rs17782313 and the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score and the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS) on cardio-metabolic risk factors and hypothalamic hormones. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to examine whether adherence to these dietary quality indices modifies the association of the MC4R rs17782313 polymorphism with cardio-metabolic risk factors and hypothalamic hormones among obese adults. METHOD: Two hundred eighty-eight healthy obese adults were recruited in this cross-sectional study. Diet quality indices, including DASH score and MDS, were calculated from a validated 147-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). MC4R s17782313 genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). An ANCOVA multivariate interaction model was used to assess the gene-diet interaction. RESULTS: Significant interactions were detected between DASH score and MC4R rs17782313 genotypes on systolic blood pressure (SBP), atherogenic index of plasma (AIP), and serum glucose and triglyceride (TG) among the female group (p(Interaction) < 0.05). In the male group, there were gene-DASH and gene-MDS interactions in relation to serum glucose concentration and plasma -melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH) levels, but these were found only in multi-adjusted interaction models (p(Interaction) < 0.05).

In particular, with the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) last year, in order to reduce contact, some IoT devices, such as robots, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and unmanned vehicles, have played a great role in temperature monitoring, goods delivery, and so on. In this paper, we study the real-time task allocation problem of heterogeneous UAVs searching and delivering goods in the city. Considering the resource requirement of task and resource constraints of the UAV, when the resource of a single UAV cannot meet the requirement of the task, we propose a method of forming a UAV coalition based on contract net protocol. We analyze the coalition formation problem from two aspects: mission completion time and UAVs energy consumption. Firstly, the mathematical model is established according to the optimization objective and condition constraints. Then, according to the established mathematical model, different coalition formation algorithms are proposed. To minimize the mission completion time, we propose a two-stage coalition formation algorithm. Aiming at minimizing the UAVs energy consumption, it is transformed into a zero-one integer programming problem, which can be solved by the existing solver. Then, considering both mission completion time and energy consumption, we propose a coalition formation algorithm based on a resource tree.

However, these anticipated outcomes are marred by patient loss to follow-up (LTFU) which is currently exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic. This study aims to determine the prevalence and potential risk factors to LTFU among HIV/AIDS patients on ART at two rural district hospitals in South Africa. Methods:  This is a retrogressive observational study whereby a cohort of HIV/AIDS patients was retrospectively followed from 2010 to 2017 until loss to follow-up occurred or until the end of the observation period at Carolina and Embhuleni hospitals. An institutional based retrospective cohort study was undertaken among children, adolescents and adults living with HIV/AIDS and attending ART clinic between January 1, 2010 and June 30, 2017. Loss to follow up was defined as not taking an ART refill for a period of 90 days or longer from the last attendance for refill and not yet classified as dead or transferred-out patient. Patient information was obtained from the routine hospitals records, and the data were analysed using Generalized gamma distribution to identify the predictors of loss to follow up among HIV/AIDS patients while Kaplan-Meier model was used to estimate and compare the LTFU survival probabilities of heterogenous groups among the patients. Results:  Of the 357 patients, 60.5% were female. The mean (SD) age of the cohort was 36.2 (14.1), 15.4 (3.5), and 5.1 (3.5) years for adults, adolescents, and children, respectively. From 357 HIV/AIDS patients, 93 (26.05%) were lost to follow-up. Empirical results show that the Weibull distribution gives the best fit to the data.

METHODS The dataset for this retrospective analysis consisted of 713 (343 female) patients who underwent liver MRI between 2017 and 2019. In total, 553 of these subjects had a confirmed diagnosis of liver cirrhosis, while the remainder had no history of liver disease. T2-weighted MRI slices at the level of the caudate lobe were manually exported for DTL analysis. Data were randomly split into training, validation, and test sets (70%/15%/15%). A ResNet50 convolutional neural network (CNN) pre-trained on the ImageNet archive was used for cirrhosis detection with and without upstream liver segmentation. Classification performance for detection of liver cirrhosis was compared to two radiologists with different levels of experience (4th-year resident, board-certified radiologist). Segmentation was performed using a U-Net architecture built on a pre-trained ResNet34 encoder. Differences in classification accuracy were assessed by the 2-test. RESULTS Dice coefficients for automatic segmentation were above 0.98 for both validation and test data. The classification accuracy of liver cirrhosis on validation (vACC) and test (tACC) data for the DTL pipeline with upstream liver segmentation (vACC = 0.99, tACC = 0.96) was significantly higher compared to the resident (vACC = 0.88, p < 0.01; tACC = 0.91, p = 0.01) and to the board-certified radiologist (vACC = 0.96, p < 0.01; tACC = 0.90, p < 0.01).

A secondary goal is to ascertain the effects on sleep duration, sleepiness, daytime functioning, use of hypnotics, and adverse events. METHODS A systematic computerized search will be performed in the following online databases: PubMed, EMBASE (on Ovid), Cochrane Library, PsycINFO (on Ovid), SPORTDiscus (on EBSCOhost), CINHAL (on EBSCOhost), Clinicaltrials.gov , WHO International Clinical Trials Registry, OpenGrey, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. Bibliographies of all included studies as well as any other relevant reviews identified via the search will be screened. Randomized trials using aerobic, resistance, or meditative movement exercise interventions which target sleep as a primary or secondary outcome will be included. The primary outcome will be differences in sleep quality at post-intervention. Secondary outcomes will be adverse events, differences in sleep duration, daytime sleepiness and functioning, and the use of hypnotics at post-intervention. Two authors will independently screen the identified records. Disagreement will be resolved by consensus or if no consensus can be reached by adjudication of a designated third reviewer. Data extraction will be done independently by two authors using a standardized and piloted data extraction sheet. Bias in individual studies will be assessed using the revised Cochrane risk of bias tool. The certainty of evidence across all outcomes will be evaluated using the CINeMA (Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis) framework. A frequentist network meta-analysis will be conducted.

In addition to Cuba being a destination for leisure tourists in the Caribbean, the renowned Cuban medical system attracts thousands of health tourists seeking low-cost but high-quality treatment. This paper demonstrates how Cuba's unique response to the pandemic, which included sending thousands of medical staff abroad, can inform structural and global issues and contribute to a more sustainable future. Design/methodology/approach: The research in this study is primarily drawn from published academic and media sources that address Cuba's medical system, its health tourism and the government's response to the recent pandemic. The author, a political scientist and an author of many publications on Cuba, and the PI of a study focused on Cuban tourism, will also draw on her expertise. Findings: This paper addresses the Cuban Government's ongoing response to the COVID-19 pandemic and places this response in the context of Cuba's medical system, its health tourism and related diplomacy. It reveals key lessons from Cuba's response for other tourist destination states and, more broadly, for the worldwide response to global outbreaks and the management of health systems. The findings will further research in diplomacy and tourism as well as inform policy and practice. Research limitations/implications: This paper explores an ongoing topic and thus further research will be required following the pandemic. Practical implications: This research note offers important implications for practice including providing accurate, research-based information that challenges misinformation about Cuba's health system, its medical diplomacy program, health tourism and its response to COVID-19.

The COVID-19 pandemic has a major influence on human life, healthcare systems, and the economy. There are a large number of methods available for predicting the incidence of the virus. A complex and non-stationary problem such as the COVID-19 pandemic is characterized by high levels of uncertainty in its behavior during the pandemic time. The fuzzy logic, especially Type-2 Fuzzy Logic, is a robust and capable model to cope with high-order uncertainties associated with non-stationary time-dependent features. The main objective of the current study is to present a novel Deep Interval Type-2 Fuzzy LSTM (DIT2FLSTM) model for prediction of the COVID-19 incidence, including new cases, recovery cases, and mortality rate in both short and long time series. The proposed model was evaluated on real datasets produced by the world health organization (WHO) on top highly risked countries, including the USA, Brazil, Russia, India, Peru, Spain, Italy, Iran, Germany, and the U.K. The results confirm the superiority of the DIT2FLSTM model with an average area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 96% and a 95% confidence interval of [92-97] % in the short-term and long-term. The DIT2FLSTM was applied to a well-known standard benchmark, the Mackey-Glass time-series, to show the robustness and proficiency of the proposed model in uncertain and chaotic time series problems. The results were evaluated using a 10-fold cross-validation technique and statistically validated through the t-test method. The proposed DIT2FLSTM model is promising for the prediction of complex problems such as the COVID-19 pandemic and making strategic prevention decisions to save more lives.","output":"A Novel Deep Interval Type-2 Fuzzy LSTM (DIT2FLSTM) Model Applied to COVID-19 Pandemic Time-Series Prediction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pain catastrophizing (PC), defined as an exaggerated negative cognitive-affective orientation toward pain, is one of the strongest psychological predictors of pain outcomes. Although regularly included as a process variable in clinical trials, there have been no comprehensive reviews of how it can be modified. Using a registered protocol (PROSPERO 2016 CRD42016042761), we searched MEDLINE, PsychINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, and CENTRAL up to November 2016 for all randomized controlled trials measuring PC in adults with chronic noncancer pain. Two authors independently screened studies and assessed bias risk using the Cochrane tool. Quality of evidence was rated according to Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation criteria. We included 79 studies (n = 9,914), which mostly recruited participants with musculoskeletal pain and had low risk of bias. Meta-analyses (standardized mean difference) showed 9 interventions had efficacy compared with waitlist/usual care or active control, although evidence quality was often low. The best evidence (moderate-high quality) was found for cognitive-behavioral therapy, multimodal treatment, and acceptance and commitment therapy. Effects were generally of medium strength and had questionable clinical significance. When only the 8 studies targeting people with high PC were included, effects were larger and more consistent. Multimodal treatment showed the strongest effects when all studies were considered, whereas cognitive-behavioral therapy had the best evidence among targeted studies. PERSPECTIVE PC is a modifiable characteristic but most interventions produce only modest benefit unless targeted to people with high PC. More research into theory-driven interventions matched to specific patient profiles is required to improve treatment efficacy and efficiency.","output":"How Can We Best Reduce Pain Catastrophizing in Adults With Chronic Noncancer Pain?

METHODS In May 2020, we conducted an online survey of 19 carceral systems that provided methadone and/or buprenorphine treatment for incarcerated populations before COVID-19. Eleven survey items examined challenges and changes to these programs as a result of the pandemic. Sixteen of 19 programs (84%) responded to the survey. RESULTS Ten out of 16 systems reported downsizing their OAT programs. Seven of 16 systems made changes to medication dispensation processes. Half of systems report challenges implementing physical distancing (n = 8), and/or obtaining personal protective equipment (n = 8). In 13 out of 16 systems some OAT program participants were released early due to COVID-19 infection risk. CONCLUSIONS Jails and prisons with existing OAT programs have curtailed their operations in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the robust evidence base around OAT for treating opioid use disorder and averting overdose deaths, guidance is needed on maintaining and ramping up medication access as carceral facilities grapple with implementing COVID-19 mitigation.","output":"Early Effects of COVID-19 on Programs Providing Medications for Opioid Use Disorder in Jails and Prisons."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM This prospective observation study evaluated the incidence of secondary bleeding after proctological surgery without interruption of oral anticoagulant or platelet-inhibitor treatments. METHOD The number of episodes of postoperative bleeding was identified prospectively from the day of surgery to the last follow-up visit in consecutive patients operated on during 2010 in two units dedicated to proctology. RESULTS A total of 2513 procedures were performed in 2314 patients (1379 men), 46  16 years of age. Secondary bleeding occurred after 115 (4.6%) procedures, no later than day 24 after surgery, requiring rehospitalization in 86% of cases and further surgery and/or transfusion in 36%. The highest frequency was noted after surgery for haemorrhoids (haemorrhoidopexy, 7.9%; haemorrhoidectomy, 6.2%) (P = NS and transanal excision of rectal tumours (6.5%). On multivariate analysis, the frequency was significantly increased by clopidogrel (15%) [relative risk (RR) = 10). In patients on oral anticoagulants, bleeding occurred in 23% (RR = 5.8) if the anticoagulants were not interrupted and in 57% (RR = 42) if the anticoagulants were discontinued and replaced with heparin. CONCLUSION During proctological surgery the overall risk of postoperative bleeding is low, but it can occur up to 3 weeks after surgery and is often severe. Maintenance treatment with oral anticoagulants is the most important risk factor, aggravated by a change to heparin.

Although some scenarios of a radiologic event can be impossible to be prepared for, the effort put toward educating and better preparing for these types of events can help minimize some of the issues. The different areas discussed in this review include radioisotopes of concern, detection of radiation dose, biological effects of ionizing radiation exposures, low dose effects, targeted and non-targeted effects (NTE), psychological effects, mitigations, with a brief mention of other considerations such as medical preparedness, communication, policy implications and ethical issues. This review also discusses solutions to rectify the issues faced at hand that may come up in the event of a radiologic terrorist attack. CONCLUSIONS A review of recent work in the area shows that a multi-layered and interdisciplinary approach is needed to prepare for a radiological terrorist attack. As well as medical preparedness, the approach needs to include sociological and psychological planning as well as an understanding of ethical issues. Since the likely 'dirty bomb' scenarios may involve low dose exposures to high numbers of people, a much better theoretical and practical understanding of low dose radiobiology and the development of robust low dose exposure biomarkers is needed as part of an integrated plan.","output":"Radiobiological and social considerations following a radiological terrorist attack; mechanisms, detection and mitigation: review of new research developments."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The leading risk factor for Clostridioides (Clostridium) difficile infection (CDI) is broad-spectrum antibiotics, which lead to low microbial diversity, or dysbiosis.

ICU survivors often experience cognitive, mental and physical impairments as part of a condition called Post- Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS). While there are several ICU follow-up programs, there is variability in their structure and approach. We describe the creation and implementation of a Post-ICU Recovery Clinic (PIRC). Methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted and included all patients seen in a PIRC of a quaternary health system from December 2019 to September 2020. PIRC visit variables included scores on several validated questionnaires screening for mental health and cognitive disorders, 6-minute walk test, pulmonary function test, change in occupational and driving status, and referrals made during PIRC visit. Statistics reported reflect exclusion of the missing data points. Results: The criteria utilized for patient selection was circulatory shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), mechanical ventilation &gt;7 days, ICU admission &gt;7 days, delirium, cardiac arrest and COVID-19 with ICU stay &gt;2 days. A total of 63 patients were seen in PIRC, 41% of those were ARDS survivors. Given the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine was shortly implemented and 62% of the visits were virtual. Median age (IQR) was 59.1 (49.2-71.6), 59% were male, with near equal Caucasian and African American distribution. All patients who had an in-person visit were seen by a critical care physician and advance practice provider, pharmacist, psychiatrist and physical therapist during the visit. 36% screened positive for anxiety or depression as identified by the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ- 4), and 11% screened positive for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) identified by the Primary Care PTSD Screen for DSM-5 (PC-PTSD-5). Of the patients seen with in-person visit, 45% had either mild or moderate cognitive impairment identified by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA). Median 6-minute walk distance was 66% predicted. Median FEV1, FVC, and DLCO was 86, 80, and 60% predicted respectively. From the 61% of patients who were working and 91% who were driving prior to hospitalization, only 22% and 65% had returned to those activities respectively. Thirty four (56%) patients had at least one referral made, with some patients receiving up to 6 referrals. Conclusion: A high prevalence of PICS and social impairments were identified in ICU survivors at a PIRC. Incorporating an inter-disciplinary team approach and standardized surveys were imperative to recognize these impairments in order to support return to the best state of recovery possible.","output":"Aiding the recovery of ICU survivors: Creation and implementation of a post-ICU recovery clinic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Endoscopists are at high risk of allowing transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during gastrointestinal endoscopy (GIE) procedures under pandemic conditions.

Although the usefulness of personal protective equipment for preventing COVID-19 dissemination has been well reported, measures to address infected aerosol escaping during endoscopic forceps use have been neglected. Pathogen-contaminated aerosol from the endoscopic forceps channel, leading into the gastrointestinal lumen, has been confirmed and is a highly problematic source of infection. We developed a technique that entails covering the forceps entry/exit hole with a vinyl bag, thereby preventing contamination of the endoscopy room by the infected aerosol that escapes from this hole.

Specific treatment adjustments for individual patients have not been widely reported. The impact of treatment changes on the outcome of cancer patients have also not been well documented. We report the experience of a large Australian metropolitan multisite cancer service that undertook proactive review of systemic anti-cancer therapy (SACT) of all patients in response to the pandemic. The aim was to re-balance the risks and benefits of current treatment strategies in light of the pandemic. Method From March-April 2020, all current SACT orders (excluding those related to clinical trials) were reviewed by an independent team of clinicians. Patients on curative therapy, or with large perceived benefit were reviewed but not included in further processing. For all other SACT orders, a documented recommendation regarding planned treatment was sent to the patient's individual clinician for consideration. A categorical assessment of the recommendations is presented. Results 570 SACT orders were reviewed, pertaining to 317 patients. 731 individual recommendations were made. The cohort consisted of 130 males and 187 females, with a median age of 62 years. Treatment was undertaken with curative intent in 38% of patients, while 62% of patients were treated with palliative intent. Distribution by tumour types was typical of epidemiology and casemix of a metropolitan oncology service. The most frequent recommendations made by the independent review team were: no change (23%), change in formulation of same drug (9%), shorten duration of treatment (9%), treatment break (8%), re-evaluate benefit of current treatment (8%), treatment cessation (7%), and referral for home-based treatment (6%). Overall, 71% of recommendations of the review team were accepted by the patient's individual clinician. A variation to recommendations suggested by the review team was implemented for 8% of SACT orders. Recommendations which were not implemented were mostly initiated by the patient's individual clinician (70%), while 14% were due to patient choice.

Preparations of the plant have recently gained increasing popularity in other parts of the world, and are presently also accessible via online platforms, e.g. as food supplements. Kratom has been considered a botanical of possible health concern by the FDA and EFSA, which together with its increasing popularity, makes kratom a subject of international concern.

The aim of the present project was to conduct an assessment of potential health risks associated with oral use of kratom\\\\based preparations. The animal and human data that were evaluated in the course of the current assessment indicate that kratom consumption has the potential to not only lead to adverse neurological effects, including addiction and withdrawal syndrome, but also to elicit distinct organ toxicity with respect to e. g. liver and kidney as target organs.

Of the 86 identified complications, (45/812 (5.5%) were distal, 41/171 (24%) were proximal; p=<0.001) with a complication, Rate of complications was not associated with caudal block (OR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.41-1.09; p=0.11). On univariable analysis, age (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.04-1.20; p=0.04), surgical duration (OR 1.02; 95% CI 1.01-1.02; p=<0.001), prematurity <32 weeks (OR 4.38, 95% CI 1.54-4.11 p=<0.001) and position of meatus as proximal (OR 5.38 95% CI 3.39-8.53; p=<0.001) were associated with an increased rate of complications. However, on multivariable analysis, associations of age (OR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.05-1.22; p=0.001), surgery duration (OR: 1.01, 95% CI: 1.01-1.02; p=<0.001) and meatal position (OR: 3.85, 95% CI: 2.32-6.39; p=<0.001) were associated with increased rate of complications. CONCLUSION Our data suggests that meatal location, older age, extreme prematurity and surgical duration are associated with increased incidence of complications (urethra-cutaneous fistula and glanular dehiscence) following hypospadias correction.

METHODS: A retrospective investigation was made on the medical records of the patients with severe and critical patients with COVID-19 pneumonia from January to February 2020. First, the patients who received corticosteroid treatment were compared with patients without given corticosteroid treatment. Then a propensity score matching method was used to control confounding factors. Cox survival regression analysis was used to evaluate the effect of corticosteroid therapy on the mortality of severe and critical patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 371 severe and critical patients were included in our analyses. 209 patients were treated with corticosteroid therapy. Most of them were treated with methylprednisolone (197[94.3%]). The median corticosteroid therapy was applied 3(IQR 2-6) days after admission, 13(IQR 10-17) days after symptoms appeared. Temperature on admission(OR=1.255,[95%CI 1.021-1.547],p=0.032), ventilation(OR=1.926,[95%CI 1.148-3.269],p=0.014) and ICU admission(OR=3.713, [95%CI 1.776-8.277],p<0.001) were significantly associated with corticosteroids use. After PS matching, the cox regression survival analysis showed that corticosteroid use was significantly associated with a lower mortality rate (HR=0.592, [95%CI 0.406-0.862], p=0.006). CONCLUSION: Corticosteroid therapy use in severe and critical patients with COVID-19 pneumonia leads to lower mortality but may cause other side effects.

However, no known study has examined the prevalence, determinants, or correlates of posttraumatic growth (PTG) in this population. METHODS: Data were analyzed from a prospective cohort of FHCWs at an urban tertiary care hospital in New York City (NYC). Assessments were conducted during the spring 2020 pandemic peak (Wave 1) and seven months later (Wave 2). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify Wave 1 sociodemographic, occupational, and psychosocial factors associated with PTG at Wave 2, and the association between aspects of PTG with burnout and pandemic-related PTSD symptoms at Wave 2. RESULTS: A total 76.8% of FHCWs endorsed moderate or greater PTG; the most prevalent domains were increased appreciation of life (67.0%), improved relationships (48.7%), and greater personal strength (44.1%). Non-White race/ethnicity, greater levels of positive emotions, pandemic-related PTSD symptoms, dispositional gratitude, and feelings of inspiration were independently associated with PTG. At Wave 2, endorsement of spiritual growth during the pandemic was associated with 52% and 44% lower odds of screening positive for pandemic-related PTSD symptoms and burnout, respectively; greater improvement in relationships was associated with 36% lower odds of screening positive for burnout. LIMITATIONS: Single institution study and use of self-report instruments.

This study aimed to identify phenolic ingredients in Camellia fascicularis (C. fascicularis) and investigate its possible underlying anti-inflammatory mechanism in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced human monocytes (THP-1) macrophages. Methods C. fascicularis polyphenols (CFP) were characterized by ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) combined with quadrupole-time-of-flight mass/mass spectrometry (Q-TOF-MS/MS). The THP-1 cells were differentiated into macrophages under the stimulation of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and then treated with LPS to build a cellular inflammation model. The cell viability was detected by CCK-8 assay. The levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were assessed by flow cytometry. The secretion and expression of inflammatory cytokines were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In addition, the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-B) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways were analyzed by Western blotting. Results Twelve phenolic constituents including (C)-epicatechin, casuariin, agastachoside, etc. in CFP were identified. The CCK-8 assay showed that CFP exhibited no significant cytotoxicity between 100 and 300 g/mL. After treated with CFP, the release of ROS was significantly suppressed. CFP inhibited inflammation in macrophages by attenuating the polarization of LPS-induced THP-1 macrophages, down-regulating the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1 and TNF-, and up-regulating the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Western blotting experiments manifested that CFP could markedly inhibit the phosphorylation of p65, ERK and JNK, thereby suppressing the activation of NF-B and MAPK signaling pathways. Conclusion These findings indicated that CFP exerted anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting the activation NF-B and MAPK pathways which may induce the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

Mathematical modelling can help predict how missed/delayed MDA will affect short-term epidemiological trends and elimination prospects by 2030. METHODS: Two onchocerciasis transmission models (EPIONCHO-IBM and ONCHOSIM) are used to simulate microfilarial prevalence trends, elimination probabilities and age profiles of Onchocerca volvulus microfilarial prevalence and intensity for different treatment histories and transmission settings, assuming no interruption, a 1-y (2020) interruption or a 2-y (2020C2021) interruption. Biannual MDA or increased coverage upon MDA resumption are investigated as remedial strategies. RESULTS: Programmes with shorter MDA histories and settings with high pre-intervention endemicity will be the most affected. Biannual MDA is more effective than increasing coverage for mitigating COVID-19s impact on MDA. Programmes that had already switched to biannual MDA should be minimally affected. In high-transmission settings with short treatment history, a 2-y interruption could lead to increased microfilarial load in children (EPIONCHO-IBM) and adults (ONCHOSIM). CONCLUSIONS: Programmes with shorter (annual MDA) treatment histories should be prioritised for remedial biannual MDA. Increases in microfilarial load could have short- and long-term morbidity and mortality repercussions.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, household-based serosurvey between October 22, 2020, and November 8, 2020. Participants were interviewed at home and tested for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins in a Luminex based assay. A positive serology was defined as a sample that reacted with both SARS-CoV-2 proteins (100% sensitivity, 99.7% specificity). The overall weighted, age-standardized prevalence was estimated and the infection-to-case ratio was calculated to determine the proportion of undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infections. RESULTS: A total of 1233 participants from 292 households were included (mean age, 32.4 years; 764 [61.2%] were women). The overall weighted, age-standardized SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 16.6% (95% CI 14.0-19.5). The estimated infection-to-case ratio was 292:1. Prevalence was higher among participants  40 years than among those ?18 years (21.2% vs 14.9%, respectively; p?0.05). It was also higher in participants who reported hospitalization than among those who did not (29.8% vs 16.0%, respectively; p?0.05).

Depletion of IFITM2 reduced viral RNA production from 31- (B.1.1.7) to 755-fold (P.1). In comparison, silencing of IFITM1 had little effect, while knock-down of IFITM3 resulted in an intermediate phenotype. Strikingly, silencing of IFITM2 generally reduced infectious virus production in Calu-3 cells to near background levels. An antibody directed against the N-terminus of IFITM2 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 VOC replication in iPSC-derived alveolar epithelial type II cells.

Aim of this study is to investigate the use and effect of prone position in this population during the first 2020 pandemic wave. METHODS: Retrospective, multicentre, national cohort study conducted between February 24 and June 14, 2020, in 24 Italian Intensive Care Units (ICU) on adult patients needing invasive mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure caused by COVID-19. Clinical data were collected on the day of ICU admission. Information regarding the use of prone position was collected daily. Follow-up for patient outcomes was performed on July 15, 2020. The respiratory effects of the first prone position were studied in a subset of 78 patients. Patients were classified as Oxygen Responders if the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio increased  20 mmHg during prone position and as Carbon Dioxide Responders if the ventilatory ratio was reduced during prone position. RESULTS: Of 1057 included patients, mild, moderate and severe ARDS was present in 15, 50 and 35% of patients, respectively, and had a resulting mortality of 25, 33 and 41%. Prone position was applied in 61% of the patients. Patients placed prone had a more severe disease and died significantly more (45% vs. 33%, p < 0.001). Overall, prone position induced a significant increase in PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, while no change in respiratory system compliance or ventilatory ratio was observed. Seventy-eight % of the subset of 78 patients were Oxygen Responders. Non-Responders had a more severe respiratory failure and died more often in the ICU (65% vs. 38%, p = 0.047).

The identification that many biological condensates display liquid properties led to the proposal that liquidCliquid phase separation (LLPS) drives their formation. The concept of LLPS is a paradigm shift in cellular structure and organization. There is an unprecedented momentum to revisit long-standing questions in virology and to explore novel antiviral strategies. In the first part of this review, we focus on the state-of-the-art about biomolecular condensates. In the second part, we capture what is known about RNA virus-phase biology and discuss future perspectives of this emerging field in virology.","output":"Liquid Biomolecular Condensates and Viral Lifecycles: Review and Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"T cells of the adaptive immune system provide effective protection to the human body against numerous pathogenic challenges. Current labelling methods of detecting these cells, such as flow cytometry or magnetic bead labelling, are time consuming and expensive. To overcome these limitations, the label-free method of digital holographic microscopy (DHM) combined with deep learning has recently been introduced which is both time and cost effective. In this study, we demonstrate the application of digital holographic microscopy with deep learning to classify the key CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets. We show that combining DHM of varying fields of view, with deep learning, can potentially achieve a classification throughput rate of 78,000 cells per second with an accuracy of 76.2% for these morphologically similar cells. This throughput rate is 100 times faster than the previous studies and proves to be an effective replacement for labelling methods.","output":"High throughput hemogram of T cells using digital holographic microscopy and deep learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Relatives of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) face a challenging situation: they often experience an existential crisis with great emotional stress and at the same time they are often actively involved in therapeutic decisions. The visiting restrictions of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have created new challenges in providing support to relatives. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this work is to present current and new developments in supporting relatives of critically ill patients in the form of a narrative review. RESULTS: In recent years, numerous new approaches and projects to support relatives have been developed. They can be assigned to the following six areas: 1) presence of relatives in the ICU, 2) proactive involvement in care, 3) structured communication/information and online offers, 4) multidisciplinary cooperation, 5) organizational management and 6) follow-up offers. The evidence and the current implementation status of these measures are very heterogeneous internationally and nationally. CONCLUSIONS: Measures for providing support for ICU relatives are diverse. Some can even be implemented despite visit bans.

As a secondary analysis from the multicenter INSPIRE study (NCT01602211), we examined baseline data from relapse-free HCT adult survivors (2 to 10 years after allogeneic or autologous HCT) to investigate the association between driving distances and patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures of distress and physical function. We analyzed predictors of elevated distress and impaired physical function using logistic regression models that operationalized driving distance first as a continuous variable and separately as a dichotomous variable (<100 versus 100+ miles). Of 1136 patients available for analysis from 6 US centers, median driving distance was 82 miles and 44% resided 100+ miles away from their HCT centers. Elevated distress was reported by 32% of patients, impaired physical function by 19%, and both by 12%. Driving distance, whether operationalized as a continuous or dichotomous variable, had no impact on distress or physical function in linear regression modeling (95% confidence interval, 1.00 to 1.00, for both PROs with driving distance as a continuous variable). In contrast, chronic graft-versus-host-disease, lower income, and lack of Internet access independently predicted both elevated distress and impaired physical function. In summary, we found no impact of driving distance on distress and physical function among HCT survivors.

In 2007, a sentinel surveillance system was established in Madagascar, with the aim of rapidly identifying potential epidemics of febrile or diarrhoeal syndromes and issuing alerts. We present the health and process indicators for the five years during which this system was constructed, showing the spatiotemporal trends, early-warning sign detection capability and process evaluation through timely analyses of high-quality data. Methods: The Malagasy sentinel surveillance network is currently based on data for fever and diarrhoeal syndromes collected from 34 primary health centres and reported daily via the transmission of short messages from mobile telephones. Data are analysed daily at the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar to make it possible to issue alerts more rapidly, and integrated process indicators (timeliness, data quality) are used to monitor the system. Results: From 2007 to 2011, 917,798 visits were reported. Febrile syndromes accounted for about 11% of visits annually, but the trends observed differed between years and sentinel sites. From 2007 to 2011, 21 epidemic alerts were confirmed. However, delays in data transmission were observed (88% transmitted within 24 hours in 2008; 67% in 2011) and the percentage of forms transmitted each week for validity control decreased from 99.9% in 2007 to 63.5% in 2011.

METHODS: A total of 563 chest CT scans of 380 patients (227/380 were diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia) from 5 hospitals were collected to train our deep learning (DL) model. Lung regions were extracted by U-net, then transformed and fed to pre-trained ResNet-50-based IDANNet (Identification and Analysis of New covid-19 Net) to produce a diagnostic probability. Fivefold cross-validation was employed to validate the application of our model. Another 318 scans of 316 patients (243/316 were diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia) from 2 other hospitals were enrolled prospectively as the RWDs to testify our DL model's performance and compared it with that from 3 experienced radiologists.

Several radiological examinations are identified as low-value examinations as they do not lead to a change in diagnosis or course of treatment. Even so, such examinations are frequently performed. Many measures for reducing low-value imaging have been carried out with variable outcomes. While there is little evidence as to why some measures work and others do not, adjusting to the context seems important for success. The objective of this study was to investigate which measures stakeholders consider appropriate for reducing the use of low-value imaging and what it takes to make them work. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted among radiographers, radiologists, radiological department managers, hospital clinicians, general practitioners, and health government/authorities representatives. The interview guide covered two broad areas: Experience with low-value services, and possible future measures deemed appropriate for reducing low-value services. Data were analysed in line with a qualitative framework analysis. RESULTS: The analysis included information from 27 participants. All participants acknowledged that low-value imaging was a problem, but few had very specific suggestions on reducing this in practice. Suggested measures were to stop referrals from being sent, provide support in assessing referrals, or change the healthcare system. Identified facilitators were categorised as management and resources, evidence, and experienced value. In general, appropriate measures should be practical, well-founded, and valuable.

Using the roadmap of the continuous quality improvement theory, the purpose of this quantitative study was to examine the relationship between the independent variables (joint education class participation, body mass index [BMI], A1c, and smoking) and dependent variables (PJI and LOS). To evaluate the relationship with PJI, a logistical regression analyzed the sample population of 1216 patients and indicated a relationship between joint education class attendance and PJI among total hip patients, but not total knee patients when controlling for the other variables. The regression also indicated a significant relationship between BMI and smoking and PJIs, but it did not show a relationship between A1c/diabetes and PJI. To evaluate the relationship between joint class education and LOS a Poisson regression indicated that those who did not attended the joint education class, whether they had total hips or total knees, had a longer postoperative LOS.

This study was performed to explore the effects of the alveolar epithelial glycocalyx on the epithelial barrier, specifically on TJ proteins, in ARDS. We used C57BL/6 mice and human lung epithelial cell models of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ARDS. Changes in alveolar permeability were evaluated via pulmonary histopathology analysis and by measuring the wet/dry weight ratio of the lungs. Degradation of heparan sulfate (HS), an important component of the epithelial glycocalyx, and alterations in levels of the epithelial TJ proteins (occludin, zonula occludens 1, and claudin 4) were assessed via ELISA, immunofluorescence analysis, and western blotting analysis. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the mRNA of the TJ protein. Changes in glycocalyx and TJ ultrastructures in alveolar epithelial cells were evaluated through electron microscopy. In vivo and in vitro, LPS increased the alveolar permeability and led to HS degradation and TJ damage. After LPS stimulation, the expression of the HS-degrading enzyme heparanase (HPA) in the alveolar epithelial cells was increased. The HPA inhibitor N-desulfated/re-N-acetylated heparin alleviated LPS-induced HS degradation and reduced TJ damage. In vitro, recombinant HPA reduced the expression of the TJ protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and inhibited its mRNA expression in the alveolar epithelial cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate that shedding of the alveolar epithelial glycocalyx aggravates the epithelial barrier and damages epithelial TJ proteins in ARDS, with the underlying mechanism involving the effect of HPA on ZO-1.","output":"Alveolar epithelial glycocalyx shedding aggravates the epithelial barrier and disrupts epithelial tight junctions in acute respiratory distress syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The B-SNIP consortium identified three brain-based Biotypes across the psychosis spectrum, independent of clinical phenomenology.

Empirical studies so far concentrated on capturing the nonlinear relationship, by applying a simple linear model and by including corruption as a quadratic term.

The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence and risk factors associated with olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients. METHODS: We conducted an observational, retrospective study on 376 patients with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to the San Gerardo Hospital in Monza, Italy, from March to July 2020. All patients answered a phone questionnaire providing information on age, sex, smoking status, and clinical characteristics. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated through logistic regression models including relevant covariates. RESULTS: The prevalence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions in COVID-19 patients was 33.5 and 35.6%, respectively. Olfactory dysfunctions were significantly directly associated with current smoking and history of allergy, the multivariable ORs being 6.53 (95% CI 1.16-36.86) for current smokers versus never smokers, and 1.89 (95% CI 1.05-3.39) for those with an allergy compared to those without any allergy. Respiratory allergy in particular was significantly associated with olfactory dysfunctions (multivariable OR 2.30, 95% CI 1.02-5.17). Significant inverse associations were observed for patients aged 60 years or more (multivariable OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.19-0.57) and hospitalization (multivariable OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.06-0.89). Considering gustatory dysfunctions, after allowance of other variables a significant direct association was found for respiratory allergies (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.03-4.86), and an inverse association was found only for hospitalization (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06-0.76). CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that current smoking and history of allergy (particularly respiratory) significantly increase the risk for smell loss in COVID-19 patients; the latter is also significantly associated to taste loss. Hospitalization has an inverse association with the risk of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions, suggesting that these may be symptoms characteristics of less severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Risk Factors for Olfactory and Gustatory Dysfunctions in Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Psychological distress (PD) is prevalent among university students, especially women. Nursing students from various countries have shown prevalence of PD from 26,6% to 65.3% during the COVID-19 pandemic. In Canada, most nursing students work during their studies, increasing sources of stress and, in turn, the risk of PD. This study aims to evaluate the associations between psychosocial stressors from academic studies and PD, school-work-life conflicts (SWLC), and the intention to quit the nursing program (ITQ) among nursing students;and, subsequently, to suggest adapted support strategies reducing psychosocial stressors from nursing studies. Material and Methods: This study relies on a mixed-method design. First, quantitative data will be collected through a survey completed by 225 nursing students from two nursing schools in Quebec, Canada. Poisson regression model will be used to evaluate whether the stressors increase the prevalence of PD, SWLC, and ITQ. A qualitative phase will involve focus groups with nursing students, teachers, and other nursing school staff to co-construct the support strategies. Results: First, we will identify psychosocial stressors associated to PD, SWLC, and ITQ. Then, we will elaborate support strategies in response to the problems and needs previously identified.

The aim of this study was to measure hydroxychloroquine and its metabolite levels in whole blood samples of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjogrens syndrome (SS) and scleroderma (Scl) by a robust, simple and accurate validated tandem mass spectrometric method, and to investigate the relationship between these levels with drug-related adverse effects and disease activity scores. The validated LCCMS/MS method was applied to measure blood hydroxychloroquine and its metabolite levels of patients with RA, SLE, SS, Scl. Various haematological and biochemical parameters were measured with Beckman-Coulter AU 5800 and Beckman Coulter LH 780 analyzers, respectively. QTc intervals were calculated with Bazetts formula, and the patients were followed up by clinicians in terms of clinical findings and adverse effects. Hydroxychloroquine levels of patients were similar to previous studies. There was a negative correlation between disease activity scores and hydroxychloroquine levels, while the highest correlation was between QTc interval, creatinine and GFR levels with desethylchloroquine. Bidetylchloroquine had the highest correlation with RBC count and liver function tests.

Since the British Thoracic Society encourages ACP in chronic respiratory disease, the objective was to systematically review ACP practice in chronic respiratory disease, attitudes of patients and HCPs and barriers and facilitators related to engagement in ACP. METHODS We systematically searched 12 electronic databases for empirical studies on ACP in adults with chronic respiratory diseases. Identified studies underwent full review and data extraction. RESULTS Of 2509 studies, 21 were eligible: 10 were quantitative studies. Although a majority of patients was interested in engaging in ACP, ACP was rarely carried out. Many HCPs acknowledged the importance of ACP but were hesitant to initiate it. Barriers to engagement in ACP were the complex disease course of patients with chronic respiratory diseases, HCPs' concern of taking away patients' hopes and lack of continuity of care. The identification of trigger points and training of HCPs on how to communicate sensitive topics were identified as facilitators to engagement in ACP. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, ACP is surprisingly uncommon in chronic respiratory disease, possibly due to the complex disease course of chronic respiratory diseases and ambivalence of both patients and HCPs to engage in ACP. Providing patients with information about their disease can help meeting their needs. Additionally, support of HCPs through identification of trigger points, training and system-related changes can facilitate engagement in ACP.

Several studies already reported different strains and an increase in the mutation rate. Particularly, mutations in SARS-CoV-2 spike-glycoprotein are of great interest as it mediates infection in human and recently approved mRNA vaccines are designed to induce immune responses against it. We analyzed 1,036,030 SARS-CoV-2 genome assemblies and 30,806 NGS datasets from GISAID and European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) focusing on non-synonymous mutations in the spike protein. Only around 2.5% of the samples contained the wild-type spike protein with no variation from the reference. Among the spike protein mutants, we confirmed a low mutation rate exhibiting less than 10 non-synonymous mutations in 99.6% of the analyzed sequences, but the mean and median number of spike protein mutations per sample increased over time. 5,472 distinct variants were found in total. The majority of the observed variants were recurrent, but only 21 and 14 recurrent variants were found in at least 1% of the mutant genome assemblies and NGS samples, respectively. Further, we found high-confidence subclonal variants in about 2.6% of the NGS data sets with mutant spike protein, which might indicate co-infection with various SARS-CoV-2 strains and/or intra-host evolution. Lastly, some variants might have an effect on antibody binding or T-cell recognition.

The high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) serves as a highly conserved chromosomal protein inside the cell and a prototypical damage-associated molecular pattern molecule outside the cell. HMGB1 has been shown to play a pathogenic role in viral infectious diseases and to regulate the lytic replication of KSHV. However, its functional effects on the KSHV life cycle in KSHV-infected cells have not been fully elucidated. Here, we explored the role of the intracellular and extracellular HMGB1 in KSHV virion production by employing CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HMGB1 knockout in the KSHV-producing iSLK BAC16 cell line. Intracellular HMGB1 formed complexes with various proteins, and the abundance of HMGB1-interacting proteins changed during latent and lytic replication. Moreover, extracellular HMGB1 was found to enhance lytic replication by phosphorylating JNK. Of note, the expression of viral genes was attenuated during lytic replication in HMGB1-knockout iSLK BAC16 cells, with significantly decreased production of infectious virions compared to that in wild-type cells. Collectively, our results demonstrate that HMGB1 is an important cellular cofactor that affects the generation of infectious KSHV progeny during lytic replication. Author Summary The high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) has many intra- and extracellular biological functions with an intricate role in various diseases. In certain viral infections, HMGB1 affects the viral life cycle and pathogenesis. In this study, we explored the effects of HMGB1 knockout on the production of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). HMGB1 knockout decreased virion production in KSHV-producing cells by decreasing the expression of viral genes. The processes by which HMGB1 affects KSHV production may occur inside or outside of infected cells. For instance, several cellular and viral proteins interacted with intracellular HMGB1 in a nucleosomal complex; whereas extracellular HMGB1 induced JNK phosphorylation, thus enhancing lytic replication. Our results suggest that both intracellular and extracellular HMGB1 are necessary for efficient KSHV replication. Thus, HMGB1 may represent an effective therapeutic target for the regulation of KSHV production.","output":"HMGB1 knockout decreases Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus virion production in iSLK BAC16 cells by attenuating viral gene expression."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has negatively affected the lives of people with disabilities; therefore, they need fast vaccination allocation.

This research aims to isolate and study the binding affinity of -sitosterol for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) main protease (Mpro). Methods: Extraction and column chromatography was performed to isolate the -sitosterol from an n-hexane extract of Muntingia calabura bark followed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), high-performance TLC (HPTLC), Fourier-Transform infrared (FTIR), and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. The molecular docking studies were performed on SARS-CoV-2 Mpro to determine the binding affinity of the -sitosterol using PyRx Virtual Screening Tool.

RT-qPCR is the gold standard test, and comparison of methodologies and reagents, utilizing patient samples, is important to establish reliable diagnostic pipelines. METHODS: Here, we assessed indirect methods that require RNA extraction with direct RT-qPCR on patient samples. Four different RNA extraction kits (Qiagen, Invitrogen, BGI and Norgen Biotek) were compared. For detection, we assessed two recently developed Taqman-based modules (BGI and Norgen Biotek), a SYBR green-based approach (NEB Luna Universal One-Step Kit) with published and newly-developed primers, and clinical results (Seegene STARMag RNA extraction system and Allplex 2019-nCoV RT-qPCR assay). We also tested and optimized direct, extraction-free detection using these RT-qPCR systems and performed a cost analysis of the different methods evaluated here. RESULTS: Most RNA isolation procedures performed similarly, and while all RT-qPCR modules effectively detected purified viral RNA, the BGI system provided overall superior performance (lower detection limit, lower Ct values and higher sensitivity), generating comparable results to original clinical diagnostic data, and identifying samples ranging from 65 copies to 2.1  10(5) copies of viral genome/l. However, the BGI detection system is more expensive than other options tested here. With direct RT-qPCR, simply adding an RNase inhibitor greatly improved detection, without the need for any other treatments (e.g. lysis buffers or boiling). The best direct methods detected ~ 10 fold less virus than indirect methods, but this simplified approach reduced sample handling, as well as assay time and cost. CONCLUSIONS: With extracted RNA, the BGI RT-qPCR detection system exhibited superior performance over the Norgen system, matching initial clinical diagnosis with the Seegene Allplex assay. The BGI system was also suitable for direct, extraction-free analysis, providing 78.4% sensitivity. The Norgen system, however, still accurately detected samples with a clinical Ct < 33 from extracted RNA, provided significant cost savings, and was superior to SYBR green assays that exhibited reduced specificity.

The author predicts the change in indicators of sustainable development under the influence of the economic crisis of 2020. Using the regression analysis method, the dependence of indicators of sustainable development of the economy on financial mechanisms of crisis management is revealed, which are annual inflation of consumer prices, the Gini index (income inequality), R&D expenses and the total amount of investment in the economy. Findings: It is justified that thanks to the use of financial mechanisms of economic crisis management, the damage from the 2020 crisis, expressed in a reduction in indicators of sustainable development, can be reduced by an average of 14.94%. Originality/Value: The example of the top 12 countries affected by COVID-19 shows that the impact of the global economic crisis of 2020 on sustainable development can be substantially mitigated through financial mechanisms of their management. To do this, annual inflation of consumer prices in 2020 should be reduced by 2.15% compared to 2019, the Gini index (income inequality) - by 41.69%, R&D spending should be increased by 11.58%, and the total investment in the economy - by 2.32%.","output":"Implications of the 2020 Global Economic Crisis for Sustainable Development and Financial Mechanisms for Their Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Protecting Personally identifiable information (PII) and Protected health Information (PHI) is always challenging in this digital era. An ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 called as coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), has forced people towards digital transaction of data all over the world. Telemedicine allows health care service providers to evaluate, diagnose and treat patients at a distance using telecommunications tools and technology. Patients communicate the medical reports, medical images and related documents by email. Data that carries PHI information, is communicated via public networks in the form of image and are vulnerable. An effective encryption technique is always in need to transfer such information securely. Visual Secret Sharing (VSS) scheme is an efficient encryption scheme that decodes the image by dividing into number of shares. Individual shares do not reveal any secret and stacking of all shares can reveal the secret image. In this article, Semantic Visual Secret Sharing scheme (SVSS) is proposed, which can be applicable for both gray-scale and color images. In this SVSS, the secret color image I is converted into semantic image SI by reducing the pixel errors. This SI decreases the encoding complexity without affecting the quality. The proposed SVSS avoids pixel expansion issues faced by traditional VSS schemes. Also, the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) value of the reconstructed secret color image shows better quality of the reconstructed secret image. The pixel errors that get introduced during share generation phase is reduced. The experimental result shows the effectiveness of the proposed SVSS and ensures secure transmission.","output":"Secured Communication Method using Visual Secret Sharing Scheme for Color Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the clinical and epidemiological characteristics and outcomes of Coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 patients. METHODS: In this large cohort study, 15,409 confirmed patients with the COVID-19 of different severities were followed-up from three specialized COVID-19 hospitals between March 18 and October 11, 2020 in Iraqi Kurdistan. The predictors of mortality and severity were examined in binary logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The incidence rate of severe/critical status was 12.3% with a median age of 36.0 and case fatality rate (CFR) of 1.98%. The incidence rate of severe/critical conditions and CFR rose with increased age groups; except for 0C14 years (11.9%). The incidence rate of severe/critical patients and CFR was 8.3% and 0.5%, 21.1% and 4.0%, and 23.7% and 8.7% in 15C49 years, 50C64 years, and 65 and older age groups, respectively. The severity of the disease and CFR was associated with coexisting chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (18.2% and 3.1%) and diabetes mellitus (19.8% and 3.4%). The asymptomatic patients (8400 and 54.5%) had statistically higher CFR; 2.3% versus 1.6% (P = 0.006). The most common symptoms on diagnosis were fever (31.9%), cough (23.5%), loss of smell/taste (16.3%), sore throat (15.7%), shortness of breath (9.8%), and headache (9.5%). The results showed that being older was the only predictor of mortality and severity in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: This region has a low incidence of severe-critic status and CFR. The patients with coexisting medical conditions are more likely to have severe conditions and die of COVID-19.

Their use is not without controversy, which makes regulation and control crucial for food safety and public health. Among food additives, silicone-based antifoaming agents (polysiloxanes or E900) are difficult to analyze and quantify due to their polymeric nature. Currently, there is no official method of quantifying this additive in foods. In this context, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a quantitative method for speciation analysis of silicon compounds almost without known interferents. In this work, we describe the evolution of the regulation of the E900 additive, discuss different analytic methods quantifying polydimethylsiloxanes (PDMS), and propose a new method based on NMR suitable for analyzing the content of E900 in the form of PDMS in various types of food from dietary oils to marmalades and jellies, among others. The proposed method consists of a previous quantitative concentration of PDMS by liquid-liquid extraction and the monitoring of the quantification using a bis(trimethylsilyl)benzene (BTMSB) standard to control the variability, ranging within 2-7%, depending on the food.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Whole Genome Sequence (WGS) of Indonesia were obtained from GISAID data base. The 54 data were taken from March to September 10(th), 2020. The sequences corresponded to Spike Protein (SP), 3-chymotrypsin like protease (3CLpro), and papain like protease (PLpro) were selected. The Wuhan genome was used as reference. RESULTS: In total WGS from Indonesia, we found 5 major clades, which dominated as G clade, where the mutation of D614G was found. This D614G was identified as much as 59%, which mostly reported in late samples submitted. Beside D614G mutation, we report three unique mutations: A352S, S477I, and Q677H.

Thus we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize the current studies to investigate impact of frailty on COVID-19 outcomes and provide evidence-based decisions in clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to synthesize the current studies to investigate impact of frailty on COVID-19 outcomes and provide evidence-based decisions in clinical practice. DESIGN: A systematic review and Meta-analysis of 16 cohort studies. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with COVID-19.

On the one hand, accessibility to trustworthy and timely information, whilst on the other, the adoption of preventive behaviors may be both crucial. However, despite the abundance of communication strategies, their effectiveness has been scarcely evaluated or merely circumscribed to the scrutiny of public affairs. To study the influence of communication strategies on the spreading dynamics of an infectious disease, we implemented a susceptible-exposed-infected-removed-dead (SEIRD) epidemiological model, using an agent-based approach. Agents in our systems can obtain information modulating their behavior from two sources: (i) through the local interaction with other neighboring agents and, (ii) from a central entity delivering information with a certain periodicity. In doing so, we highlight how global information delivered from a central entity can reduce the impact of an infectious disease and how informing even a small fraction of the population has a remarkable impact, when compared to not informing the population at all. Moreover, having a scheme of delivering daily messages makes a stark difference on the reduction of cases, compared to the other evaluated strategies, denoting that daily delivery of information produces the largest decrease in the number of cases. Furthermore, when the information spreading relies only on local interactions between agents, and no central entity takes actions along the dynamics, then the epidemic spreading is virtually independent of the initial amount of informed agents. On top of that, we found that local communication plays an important role in an intermediate regime where information coming from a central entity is scarce.

The weighted overlay analysis was performed to identify the COVID Vulnerability Zone (CVZ) with the inclusion of four thematic layers such as COVID-cases, quadrant ine follow up cases population density and COVID -19 testing centres. Additionally, the travellers log was also analysed to determine the source of virus to the state. Results: As a result, the study highlighted the COVID C 19 Vulnerability Zone (CVZ) which was categorized into five vulnerability classes such as Very low, Low, Moderate, High and Very high vulnerability. Conclusion: Additionally the authors concluded the flow of victims with the travel history to trace out the spread of diseases in the state of Tamil Nadu. As a conclusion, the GIS have the potential to identify the spatial distribution, pattern, concentration of the virus spread and also it determines health status of the local community.","output":"A spatial exploratory study on COVID-19 disaster - current outbreak in Tamil Nadu, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND It is known that pregnant women are more susceptible to viral infectious diseases, with an attendant risk of adverse foetal and maternal outcomes. The objective of this descriptive study is to evaluate the epidemiologic and clinical pattern, as well as the obstetric and COVID-19 outcome among pregnant women seen at a tertiary hospital in Southern, Nigeria. METHODS This was a descriptive prospective study of all pregnant women seen and diagnosed with COVID-19 based on positive RT-PCR for SARS-COV-2, at the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital, Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria from March 2020 to August 2020. RESULTS Seven (5.2%) pregnant patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 out of 134 patients. The common presenting symptoms were fever 4(57.1%), Productive cough 3 (42.9%), shortness of breath 3 (42.9%), myalgia 3 (42.9%), rhinorrhoea 3 (42.9%), and anosmia 3 (42.9%). The majority (85.7%) of patients were in the second and third trimesters at diagnosis. All deliveries occurred at term, with a mean gestational age of 380.82 weeks. Four patients (57.1%) had caesarean section (CS) deliveries for obstetric indications. No adverse outcomes were recorded for mothers and babies with birth weight ranging from 2.5 to 3.5 Kg. No case fatality was recorded. CONCLUSION In this study, pregnant women with COVID-19 did not have adverse maternal and foetal outcome. The pattern of symptoms and the presence of severe disease also did not differ from what is observed in the general non-pregnant population.

Many health systems have transitioned to providing outpatient care via telehealth; however, there is an opportunity to utilize telehealth for inpatients to promote physical distancing. OBJECTIVE This article evaluates the use of a rapidly implemented, secure inpatient telehealth program. METHODS We assembled a multidisciplinary team to rapidly design, implement, and iteratively improve an inpatient telehealth quality improvement initiative using an existing videoconferencing system at our academic medical center. We assigned each hospital bed space a unique meeting link and updated the meeting password for each new patient. Patients and families were encouraged to use their own mobile devices to join meetings when possible. RESULTS Within 7 weeks of go-live, we hosted 1,820 inpatient telehealth sessions (13.3 sessions per 100 bedded days). We logged 104,647 minutes of inpatient telehealth time with a median session duration of 22 minutes (range 1-1,961). There were 5,288 participant devices used with a mean of 3 devices per telehealth session (range 2-22). Clinicians found they were able to build rapport and perform a reasonable physical exam. CONCLUSION We successfully implemented and scaled a secure inpatient telehealth program using an existing videoconferencing system in less than 1 week. Our implementation provided an intuitive naming convention for providers and capitalized on the broad availability of smartphones and tablets. Initial comments from clinicians suggest the system was useful; however, further work is needed to streamline initial setup for patients and families as well as care coordination to support clinician communication and workflows.

These results suggest that Brucella mainly infected harbor seals from the environment while weaning, and the bacteria were cleared during the early life stage of the seals. In spotted seals, however, antibodies were also detected in adults, suggesting that spotted seals could become infected with Brucella even as adults.

DESIGN: A systematic review of published evidence. The review was conducted and reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses. DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive search of published literature was conducted. In addition, relevant grey literature sources and bibliographical references of included studies were searched for potentially eligible evidence. STUDY SELECTION: Studies published between January 2010 and November 2020 were eligible for inclusion. To be eligible, studies had to report on interventions/strategies targeted at women, the general public or healthcare workers, aimed at improving the timely diagnosis of breast and/or cervical cancers in LMIC settings. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Literature search, screening, study selection, data extraction and quality appraisal were conducted by two independent reviewers. Evidence was synthesised and reported using a global taxonomy framework for early cancer diagnosis. RESULTS: From the total of 10 593 records identified, 21 studies conducted across 20 LMICs were included in this review. Most of the included studies (16/21) focused primarily on interventions addressing breast cancers; two focused on cervical cancer while the rest examined multiple cancer types. Reported interventions targeted healthcare workers (12); women and adolescent girls (7) and both women and healthcare workers (3). Eight studies reported on interventions addressing access delays; seven focused on interventions addressing diagnostic delays; two reported on interventions targeted at addressing both access and diagnostic delays, and four studies assessed interventions addressing access, diagnostic and treatment delays. While most interventions were demonstrated to be feasible and effective, many of the reported outcome measures are of limited clinical relevance to diagnostic timeliness. CONCLUSIONS: Though limited, evidence suggests that interventions aimed at addressing barriers to timely diagnosis of breast and cervical cancer are feasible in resource-limited contexts. Future interventions need to address clinically relevant measures to better assess efficacy of interventions.

Importance. A better understanding of the immune memory and functional humoral immunity directed at the emerging Variants of Concern (VoC) strains after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is essential for predicting the longevity of heterotypic protection. Objective. The aim of our study was to characterize functional humoral immunity (including memory B cell response) after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and to determine/compare the reactivity of COVID-19 vaccine-induced memory B cells to the emerging SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern (VoC). Design, setting, participants and interventions. We designed an exploratory longitudinal observational (convenience sample-based) study at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN that enrolled and followed naive subjects and recovered COVID-19 subjects from Olmsted County, MN and surrounding areas after COVID-19 vaccination in January-June 2021. The study enrolled 17 relatively healthy subjects, 59% females and 94% White/Non-Hispanic or Latino with median age at enrollment 41 years.

Main outcomes and measures. Spike-specific humoral and memory B cells responses were assessed over time after vaccination against the original Wuhan-Hu-1/vaccine and against emerging VoC strains/antigens. Results. We observed a robust neutralizing antibody response after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination, but a reduction in the functional antibody activity to several of the emerging SARS-CoV-2 VoC. Consistent with this, we also found differences in the number of isotype-switched/IgG+ MBCs responding to homologous and variant receptor-binding domain/RBDs after vaccination. We found a reduction of MBCs reactive to RBDs of Beta, Gamma and Delta SARS-CoV-2 VoC strains. Conclusion and relevance. In this exploratory study in subjects following receipt of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, we found differences in antibody titers observed for VoCs after vaccination that are accompanied with, and can partially be explained by, decreased MBC reactivity against the VoCs.

The survey included socio-demographic and health-related questions, questions related to HBM and TPB dimensions, and intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Associations between questionnaire variables and COVID-19 vaccination intention were assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Eighty percent of 398 eligible respondents stated their willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine. A unified model including HBM and TPB predictor variables as well as demographic and health-related factors, proved to be a powerful predictor of intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine, explaining 78% of the variance (adjusted R squared = 0.78).

On cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging, the mass had an inhomogeneous signal intensity without infiltration of surrounding tissue. Late gadolinium enhancement imaging showed subtle hyperenhancement. Tissue characterization by means of parametric mapping revealed very low native T1 relaxation times and increased T2 relaxation times. In conclusion, the epipericardial mass showed fibrofatty inflammatory markers, suggestive of EFN. The chest pain resolved spontaneously. Follow-up CT 3 months later showed a marked regression of the mass which confirmed the diagnosis EFN. DISCUSSION: Epipericardial fat necrosis is a benign and self-limiting inflammatory cause of chest pain, which can be diagnosed with multi-modality imaging and must not be overlooked in the differential diagnosis of patients with acute pleuritic chest pain.","output":"Case report: epipericardial fat necrosisa rare cause of chest pain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current findings is important in raising clinicians' awareness of the possibility of coincident acute macular neuroretinopathy (AMN) and COVID\\\\19 as a potential cause of retinal vascular damage and ischemia.","output":"Acute macular neuroretinopathy as a manifestation of coronavirus disease 2019: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Globally, Nigeria ranks third among the countries with the highest number of People Living with HIV (PLHIV). Given that HIV/AIDS knowledge is a key factor that determines the risk of transmission and certain attitudes towards PLHIV, there is a need to understand the trend of HIV knowledge within the population for the purpose of assessing the progress and outcome of HIV prevention strategies. The aim of the study was to understand the trends of HIV/AIDS knowledge and attitude towards PLHIV between 2007 to 2017 among Nigerian women, and to investigate change in the factors associated with HIV/AIDS knowledge and attitude towards PLHIV over years. METHODS Data were derived from three Nigerian Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (2007, 2011 and 2016-2017) among women aged 15-49 years old from each geo-political zone (South South, South East, South West, North East, North West, North Central) in Nigeria. Participants who did not answer questions related to HIV/AIDS knowledge and attitude were excluded from the study. The final sample sizes were 17,733 for 2007, 26,532 for 2011 and 23,530 for 2017. In descriptive statistics, frequencies represented the study sample, while percentages represented weighted estimates for the population parameters. Rao-Scott chi-square test for complex survey design studies was used to assess bivariable associations. Factors associated with outcome variables were examined using the survey-weighted multivariable logistic regression models for the complex survey design while controlling for potential confounding variables. RESULTS There was a relatively high level of HIV/AIDS knowledge level in 2007 and 2016-2017 surveys (64.6 and 64.1%, respectively), however a decrease in HIV/AIDS knowledge trend was observed in 2011 (45.6%). The positive attitude towards PLHIV progressively increased across the years (from 40.5 to 47.0% to 53.5%). Multivariable analysis revealed that women who had a higher educational level, higher wealth index, and lived in urban areas had higher odds for HIV/AIDS knowledge and positive attitude towards PLHIV across the years. In addition, the Northern zones had predominantly higher knowledge and attitude levels. CONCLUSIONS Our study found increasing tendency for high HIV/AIDS knowledge and positive attitude towards PLHIV over the years. Women's age, wealth index, education level and residence were consistently associated with knowledge and attitude over the years. There is a need for more pragmatic HIV/AIDS-related knowledge action plan to target to cover all age groups, all geo-political zones while paying close attention to the rural areas and the less educated women. In addition, more replicative studies of HIV/AIDS knowledge and attitude trends is crucial in monitoring of the progress of HIV interventions in the country in the coming years.","output":"Trends of HIV/AIDS knowledge and attitudes among Nigerian women between 2007 and 2017 using Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey data."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: This study aimed to explore the impact of early neighborhood cohesion, and its mechanism, on cognitive function in later life. Methods: In total, 10,727 Chinese elderly, aged 60-90, forming two datasets (2014 and 2018) from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) were used as a sample. Childhood neighborhood cohesion was measured by the extent of how much neighbors were willing to help and how close-knit neighbors were. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD-10) were used to assess the cognitive functions and depression of the elderly. We used a structural equation model to examine the relationship between early neighborhood cohesion and late-life cognitive function and conducted bootstrapping analyses to assess the mechanism. Results: Cognitive function was positively predicted by childhood neighborhood cohesion (? = 0.06, p < 0.001), and cognitive function of the elderly were also positively predicted through the mediating effects of childhood friendships, which included depression and social activity participation as two chain paths. Conclusion: The findings suggest that childhood neighborhood cohesion positively predicts cognitive function among elderly people through the mediating roles of childhood friendship, depression, and social activity engagement. Childhood neighborhood cohesion is correlated with better childhood friendships, then to fewer depression symptoms and greater elderly social activity participation, and finally to better cognitive functions in the elderly.","output":"The Impact of Early Neighborhood Cohesion, and Its Mechanism, on Cognitive Function in Later Life"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent signs of progress in functional foods and nutraceuticals highlighted the favorable impact of bioactive molecules on human health and longevity. As an outcome of the fermentation process, an increasing interest is developed in bee products. Bee bread (BB) is a different product intended for humans and bees, resulting from bee pollen's lactic fermentation in the honeycombs, abundant in polyphenols, nutrients (vitamins and proteins), fatty acids, and minerals. BB conservation is correlated to bacteria metabolites, mainly created by Pseudomonas spp., Lactobacillus spp., and Saccharomyces spp., which give lactic acid bacteria the ability to outperform other microbial groups. Because of enzymatic transformations, the fermentation process increases the content of new compounds. After the fermentation process is finalized, the meaningful content of lactic acid and several metabolites prevent the damage caused by various pathogens that could influence the quality of BB. Over the last few years, there has been an increase in bee pollen fermentation processes to unconventional dietary and functional supplements. The use of the chosen starters improves the bioavailability and digestibility of bioactive substances naturally found in bee pollen. As a consequence of enzymatic changes, the fermentation process enhances BB components and preserves them against loss of characteristics. In this aspect, the present review describes the current biotechnological advancements in the development of BB rich in beneficial components derived from bee pollen fermentation and its use as a food supplement and probiotic product with increased shelf life and multiple health benefits.","output":"Biotechnological Processes Simulating the Natural Fermentation Process of Bee Bread and Therapeutic Properties-An Overview."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundFractures associated with skin wounds are termed open fractures.

Access to these images prevents the need for clinicians to uncover and re-examine wounds which reduces the risk of infection.ProblemA retrospective audit revealed only 10% of open fracture patients records contained a wound photograph at our hospital. This was attributed to technical difficulties with existing hospital camera software applications and patient confidentiality issues preventing use of personal mobile devices.AimsWe aimed to develop a new process to improve compliance to wound photography in open fracture patients.Methods and resultsDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Microsoft Teams became available for PC and mobile devices in our trust. A channel was set up in this software enabling secure sharing of photographs across devices. Photographs could be captured using a mobile phone without the image being saved on the device and then accessed through the PC software application. Images could then be transferred to patients electronic records and stored. A photography consent form was developed and stored using the same method. Details of this intervention were circulated via departmental and induction meetings. Our work demonstrates leadership qualities through setting a new direction to securely photograph and store images to improve patient care.

Mental healthcare for healthcare workers (HCWs) should receive serious consideration. This study served to determine the mental-health outcomes of 1,556 HCWs from 45 countries who participated in the COVID-19 IMPACT project, and to examine the predictors of the outcomes during the first pandemic wave. Methods: Outcomes assessed were self-reported perceived stress, depression symptom, and sleep changes. The predictors examined included sociodemographic factors and perceived social support. Results: The results demonstrated that half of the HCWs had moderate levels of perceived stress and symptoms of depression. Half of the HCWs (n = 800, 51.4%) had similar sleeping patterns since the pandemic started, and one in four slept more or slept less. HCWs reported less perceived stress and depression symptoms and higher levels of perceived social support than the general population who participated in the same project. Predictors associated with higher perceived stress and symptoms of depression among HCWs included female sex, not having children, living with parents, lower educational level, and lower social support.

Methods: In accordance with the systematic approach of a scoping review, a literature search was conducted in national and international medical literature databases using a search string. The search in the databases was limited to the period from 01.01.2000 to 15.11.2020 and has been subsequently completed by hand search until 08.03.2021. A hand search, even beyond 15.11.2020, seemed necessary and reasonable, since due to the dynamics of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, a large number of articles and regulations are being published very quickly at short notice. Results: The literature search resulted in the following number of hits in the databases listed below: PubMed: 165 articles. Cochrane: 1 review and 35 studies. Web of Science: 217 articles. Robert Koch Institute: 49 articles . Thus, a total of 467 hits were identified, with a total of 124 hits being duplicates. From these, 138 articles were considered relevant to the COVID-19 infection surveillance situation in Germany based on established criteria.

We undertook a literature review to assess the usefulness of screening for peripheral venous thrombosis or pulmonary thrombosis in patients admitted with COVID-19. Outside of the ICU setting, D-dimer elevation on presentation or marked increase from baseline should alert the need for doppler ultrasound scan of the lower limbs. In the ICU setting, consideration should be given to routine screening with doppler ultrasound, given the high prevalence of thrombosis in this cohort despite standard anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis. However, absence of lower limb thrombosis on ultrasound does not exclude pulmonary venous thrombosis. Screening with CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is not justified in patients on the general wards, unless there are clinical features and/or marked elevations in markers of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy. However, the risk of pulmonary embolism or pulmonary thrombosis in ICU patients is very high, especially in patients on ECMO, where studies that employed routine screening for thrombosis with CT scanning have uncovered up to 100% incidence of pulmonary thrombosis despite standard anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis. Therefore, in patients at low bleeding risk and high clinical suspicion of venous thromboembolism, therapeutic anticoagulation should be considered even before screening, Our review highlights the need for increased vigilance for VTE, with a low threshold for doppler ultrasound and CTPA in high risk in-patient cohorts, where clinical features and D-dimer levels may not accurately reflect the occurrence of pulmonary thromboembolism.","output":"Screening for venous thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is the process by which fecal microbiota are donated from a healthy individual and subsequently transplanted into a diseased or young individual. The mechanism by which FMT is effective is believed to be due to enhanced beneficial microbes, increased microbiome diversity, and restored normal flora. Beneficial gut microorganisms not only play a role in maintaining an intestinal barrier and metabolizing nutrients, but importantly, these microbes help regulate local and systemic immune function. Although FMT has been described for several centuries, only recently has it been utilized as a mainstream therapy in humans and significantly considered for applications in other species. In humans and animals, gastrointestinal diseases are by far the most widely accepted FMT-treatable conditions; however, recent research has shown exceptional promise for FMT being used to treat or prevent other conditions, including those outside of the gastrointestinal tract.

Addressing apical support at the time of the hysterectomy is crucial to minimizing the risk of posthysterectomy prolapse. Barriers to addressing apical support include the lack of experience in laparoscopic suturing and knot tying that require advanced skills and dexterity. The K-technique is a novel modification of the uterosacral ligament suspension procedure using the knot-less barbed suture technology, rendering suturing easier and quicker to perform. METHOD The vaginal cuff epithelium is closed with 2 unidirectional barbed sutures that are started at the lateral fornices and ran until the midsection. The same sutures will then serially purchase the anterior and posterior vaginal endopelvic fascia and the midsegment of the uterosacral ligament. Two more passes are thrown through the same structures, yet farther laterally, back and forth. A video illustration of the procedure is attached. RESULTS Eighteen patients underwent the procedure with no urinary tract injuries documented by cystoscopy and no postoperative morbidity documented during the 6-week postoperative follow-up period.

The effect of sEVs derived from clots acquired from patients who had undergone mechanical thrombectomy on healthy human CEC permeability was also evaluated. CEC-sEVs/tPA administered 4 h after eMCAO reduced infarct volume by 36%, increased recanalization of the occluded MCA, enhanced cerebral blood flow (CBF), and reduced blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage. Treatment with CEC-sEVs given upon reperfusion after 2 h tMCAO significantly reduced infarct volume by 43%, and neurological outcomes were improved in both CEC-sEVs treated models. CEC-sEVs/tPA reduced a network of microRNAs (miRs) and proteins that mediate thrombosis, coagulation, and inflammation. Patient-clot derived sEVs increased CEC permeability, which was reduced by CEC-sEVs.

After infection with the flu virus, there is a 6-to 10-fold increase in the risk of acute myocardial infarction and a 3 C to 8-fold increase in the risk of stroke. COVID-19 is associated with arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, car-diac arrhythmias, myocarditis, high risk of acute myocardial infarction, and heart failure. The article presents the data of our own research, indicating that the transferred COVID-19 disease increases the risk of acute coronary syndrome, regardless of the presence of risk factors for cardiovascular events. Prevention of the development of influenza complications is the early administration of etiotropic antiviral therapy. Numerous studies confirm the effectiveness of the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir in the treatment of influenza. The use of oseltamivir reduces the severity of clinical manifestations, reduces the duration of the disease, reduces the risk of complications and death. The most effective measure to prevent influenza and COVID-19 is specific immunization. In some cases, chemoprophylaxis can be used. The article discusses studies on the effectiveness of influenza chemoprophylaxis with the use of neuraminidase inhibitors. ? 2021, Remedium Group Ltd.

Hence, we aim to evaluate the prevalence and outcomes of COVID-19 related cardiovascular complications and secondary infection and their possibility as potential triggers for the stroke. METHODS: Data from observational studies describing the complications [acute cardiac injury (ACI), cardiac arrhythmias (CA), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), septic shock, secondary infection] and outcomes of COVID-19 hospitalized patients from December 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020, were extracted following PRISMA guidelines. Adverse outcomes defined as intensive care units, oxygen saturation less than 90%, invasive mechanical ventilation, severe disease, and in-hospital mortality. The odds ratio and 95% confidence interval were obtained, and forest plots were created using random-effects models. A short review of these complications as triggers of stroke was conducted. RESULTS: 16 studies with 3480 confirmed COVID-19 patients, prevalence of ACI [38%vs5.9%], CA [26%vs5.3%], DIC [4%vs0.74%], septic shock [18%vs0.36%], and infection [30%vs12.5%] was higher among patients with poor outcomes. In meta-analysis, ACI [aOR:9.93(95%CI:3.95-25.00], CA [7.52(3.29-17.18)], DIC [7.36(1.24-43.73)], septic shock [30.12(7.56-120.10)], and infection [10.41(4.47-24.27)] had higher odds of adverse outcomes. Patients hospitalized with acute ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage, had complications like pulmonary embolism, venous thromboembolism, DIC, etc. and had poor outcomes CONCLUSION: The complications like acute cardiac injury, cardiac arrhythmias, DIC, septic shock, and secondary infection had poor outcomes.

The present study aimed to investigate the association of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) with disease severity and clinical course of COVID-19. METHODS: We prospectively recruited consecutive hospitalised adult patients with COVID-19 in a 3-month period. Demographic, laboratory, clinical and vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) features were recorded at entry, and all patients were prospectively followed-up. Severe liver fibrosis was defined as an LSM value higher than 9.6 kPA. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to reveal factors associated with disease severity and outcomes. RESULTS: Out of 98 eligible patients with COVID-19, 12 (12.2%) had severe liver fibrosis. Patients with severe liver fibrosis had higher baseline disease severity (P = .022), more commonly required oxygen treatment at entry (P = .010), and had intensive-care unit (ICU) requirements during the 6 (1-39)-day median follow-up time (P = .017). The presence of severe liver fibrosis was independently associated with disease severity (odds ratio (OR): 7.685, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.435-41.162, P = .017) and ICU requirement (OR: 46.656, 95% CI: 2.144-1015.090, P = .014). LSM was correlated with alanine aminotransferase levels (P = .005, r: 0.283), but not with other markers of acute hepatic injury or inflammation. CONCLUSION: Initial VCTE application might help physicians identify patients who are more likely to have severe illness or worse clinical outcomes, in addition to other well-established clinical and laboratory factors. Further multicentre prospective studies are warranted to validate our results.","output":"Liver stiffness is associated with disease severity and worse clinical scenarios in coronavirus disease 2019: A prospective transient elastography study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coordination polymers with a new rigid ligand 1,3-bis(1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)adamantane (L) were prepared by its reaction with cadmium(II) or silver(I) nitrates.

Here, we correlated protein-level mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus to clinical outcome. METHODS: Mutations in viral sequences from the GISAID virus repository were evaluated by using hCoV-19/Wuhan/WIV04/2019 as the reference. Patient outcomes were classified as mild disease, hospitalization and severe disease (death or documented treatment in an intensive-care unit). Chi-square test was applied to examine the association between each mutation and patient outcome. False discovery rate was computed to correct for multiple hypothesis testing and results passing FDR cutoff of 5% were accepted as significant. RESULTS: Mutations were mapped to amino acid changes for 3,733 non-silent mutations. Mutations correlated to mild outcome were located in the ORF8, NSP6, ORF3a, NSP4, and in the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein N. Mutations associated with inferior outcome were located in the surface (S) glycoprotein, in the RNA dependent RNA polymerase, in ORF3a, NSP3, ORF6 and N. Mutations leading to severe outcome with low prevalence were found in the ORF3A and in NSP7 proteins. Four out of 22 of the most significant mutations mapped onto a 10 amino acid long phosphorylated stretch of N indicating that in spite of obvious sampling restrictions the approach can find functionally relevant sites in the viral genome.

Effective prognostic markers and prediction models are needed. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) provides a comprehensive assessment of the physiological changes in the respiratory, cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems in a controlled laboratory environment. It has shown promise as a prognostic factor for other chronic respiratory conditions. We sought to evaluate the prognostic value of CPET in predicting outcomes in longitudinal studies of ILD. MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were used to identify studies reporting the prognostic value of CPET in predicting outcomes in longitudinal studies of ILD.

Impressive efforts have led to rapid development of multiple efficacious vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, however concerns remain over the degree of protection vaccination offers to immunocompromised recipients. To answer this question, we have designed a prospective study to evaluate response to vaccination in patients with haematological malignancies (Harrington, Leukaemia 2021; Harrington, BJHaem, 2021). 103 patients were included with samples collected in 60 patients after first dose and 71 patients following second dose. We have analysed humoral and T cell response to a first dose of vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in patients post allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and compared those to patients with CML or MPN. Methods: ELISA plates were coated with antigen Nuclear (N) protein or the S protein. Serial dilutions of plasma were added to wells and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Control reagents included N-specific monoclonal antibody, S-specific monoclonal antibody, negative control plasma, positive control plasma and blank wells. Secondary antibody was added and incubated for 1h at room temperature. IgG was detected using goat-anti-human-Fc-AP and plates read at 405 nm. Where an EC50 was not reached at 1:25, a plasma was considered seropositive if the OD at 405nm was 4-fold above background and a value of 25 was assigned. T cell functionality was assessed using intracellular cytokine staining after incubation with SARS-CoV-2 specific peptides covering immunogenic domains of the Spike (S) protein. A response was considered positive if there was a 3-fold increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine expression from baseline, and above a threshold of 0.01. Specific peptides (0.25 g/ml), anti-CD28 and BFA were added to cells. Unstimulated cells were utilised as negative controls. Cells were stained with viability dye, then with antibodies directed against surface markers, and fixed and permeabilised prior to staining for intracellular cytokines TNFa and IFNg. Gating on lymphocytes, single cells, live cells, CD3+ cells, CD4+ cells and CD4- (CD8+) was performed. Results: Of the 103 patients included in this study, post vaccination evaluation on 56 patients have been analysed so far, including 37 patients with chronic myeloid malignancies (MPN n=21 and CML n=16) and 19 patients post HSCT. From the latter group, median time since transplant was 53.9 months (18.7 to 76.8) with 12 participants on extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) therapy for graft versus host disease (GvHD) with median frequency of 24.5 days (14-42). BNT162b2 vaccine was administered to 48 patients (85.7%). An anti-S IgG response was observed after a first dose in 16/21 (76.1%) of the MPN group and 14/16 (87.5%) of CML patients, but in only 7/19 (36.8%) of post HSCT patients (Fishers Exact Test - p=0.02/0.002, Fig 1a). Of the latter group a low positive value where an EC50 was not reached was observed in 4/19 (21.1%) and a moderate response in 3/19 patients (15.8%). Of the 12 patients with active GvHD on ECP, a positive response was observed in 4 patients (33.3%), however only one patient recorded a response where an EC50 was measurable. A T cell response was observed in 16/20 (80%) of the MPN group and 14/15 (93.3%) of those with CML after a single dose, with a polyfunctional T cell response (>1 cytokine) observed in 65% and 80% respectively. In comparison only 5/19 patients (38.5%) post HSCT mounted a T cell response (p=0.027/p=0.002, Fig 1b), with a CD4+ response in 4 (30.8%) and a CD8+ response in 3 (23.1%). In this group, a polyfunctional T cell response was found in 4/19 patients (30.8%). 33.3% of patients with GVHD requiring ECP had a T cell response, compared with 42.9% in post HSCT without GVHD. Summary: Despite encouraging results of antibody and T cell response to a first vaccination dose in patients with chronic myeloid malignancies, these results raise concerns regarding the humoral and T cell responses to vaccination in patients post HSCT, recognised as a particularly immunosuppressed group. Further longitudinal data is required to determine if these results translate into a reduction in cases and severity of infection in these groups. We are currently analysing the response to a second vaccine injection and responses to sequential doses of vaccination across the whole cohort will be presented.

The Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's disease focuses only on 6 behaviors. Nonetheless, impulsivity could affect the entire range of human practices. Because of their heterogeneity and undefined boundaries, it is not clear what conditions should be considered as Impulse Control Disorders. This results in poorly standardized scientific literature and underdiagnosis. OBJECTIVE We aimed to create a comprehensive list of possible manifestations of drug-induced Impulse Control Disorders in Parkinson's disease and test it on pharmacosurveillance data. METHODS PubMed was used to identify reviews in English about Impulse Control Disorders in Parkinson's disease. Mentioned conditions were charted and translated to the lexicon of MedDRA, ICD-11, and DSM-5. The relevant MedDRA terms were used to test potential association with dopamine agonists on the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System. RESULTS 50 reviews published between 2001 and 2020 were identified. 66 conditions were collected as possible Impulse Control Disorders. Pathological gambling, shopping, eating and sexuality, dopamine dysregulation syndrome, hobbyism and punding were the most frequently mentioned, together with leisure activities, body-focused compulsivity, disruptive, impulse control and conduct disorders, and substance abuse. All these conditions were disproportionately reported with dopamine agonists, except for substance abuse.

Thrombosis may cause deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, and ischemic stroke, collectively the most common causes of death and disability in the developed world. Treatment for the prevention of thromboembolic diseases using anticoagulants such as heparin, coumarins, thrombin inhibitors, or antiplatelet drugs increase the risk of bleeding and are associated with an increase in potentially life-threatening hemorrhage, partially offsetting the benefits of reduced coagulation. Thus, drug development aiming at novel targets is needed to provide efficient and safe anticoagulation. Within the last decade, experimental and preclinical data have shown that some coagulation mechanisms principally differ in thrombosis and hemostasis. The plasma contact system protein factors XII and XI, high-molecular-weight kininogen, and plasma kallikrein specifically contribute to thrombosis, however, have minor, if any, role in hemostatic coagulation mechanisms. Inherited deficiency in contact system proteins is not associated with increased bleeding in humans and animal models. Therefore, targeting contact system proteins provides the exciting opportunity to interfere specifically with thromboembolic diseases without increasing the bleeding risk. Recent studies that investigated pharmacologic inhibition of contact system proteins have shown that this approach provides efficient and safe thrombo-protection that in contrast to classical anticoagulants is not associated with increased bleeding risk.

The signalling mechanism whereby these stimuli evoke TF expression entails activation of NADPH oxidase, upstream from activation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor that drives the induced transcription of the TF gene. When single-stranded RNA viruses are taken up into cellular endosomes, they stimulate endosomal formation and activation of NADPH oxidase complexes via RNA-responsive toll-like receptor 7. It is therefore proposed that SARS-CoV-2 infection of endothelial cells evokes the expression of TF which is contingent on endosomal NADPH oxidase activation.

Methods In this study, 100 patients undergoing MVD were randomly allocated to the control (normal saline, 2 ml) or ramosetron (ramosetron, 0.3 mg) groups at the end of surgery. The incidence and severity of PONV, need for rescue antiemetics, patient satisfaction score, duration of hospital stay, and the occurrence of adverse events were evaluated 48 h post-surgery. Results Data obtained from 97 patients were included in the final analysis. The incidence of PONV was significantly lower in the ramosetron group than in the control group throughout the 48-h postoperative period (29.2% vs. 51.0%, p=0.028). A similar trend was observed with regard to PONV severity (p=0.041). The need for rescue antiemetics, satisfaction score, duration of hospital stay, and the occurrence of adverse events did not significantly differ between the groups. Conclusion Prophylactic ramosetron administration reduced the incidence and severity of PONV in patients undergoing MVD without causing serious adverse events. Thus, ramosetron use may improve patient recovery following MVD.","output":"Antiemetic prophylaxis with ramosetron for postoperative nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing microvascular decompression: a prospective, randomized controlled trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is faced with the dual epidemics of HIV/AIDS and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes and mental illnesses are the five major NCDs, causing death globally with low-income and middle-income countries, contributing 78% of all NCD deaths and 85% of premature deaths. There has been increased interest in the integration of HIV and NCDs care, especially in SSA that accounts for 55% of people living with HIV (PLHIV) globally. This systematic review and meta-analysis will estimate the overall prevalence or incidence of NCDs (or its risk factors) among adults living with HIV in SSA. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines will be used. Two authors will independently screen the title and abstracts of the articles identified from the search. Study participants will be any adult (18 years old) living with HIV in SSA. Exposure of interest will be HIV (with or without ART). Outcomes of interest are prevalence or incidence of any NCD/NCD risk factors. A random-effects meta-analysis will be used to estimate pooled prevalence or incidence of the five major NCDs among PLHIV, using Stata software. (2) test and I(2) statistic will be used to measure statistical heterogeneity between studies. If there is significant heterogeneity, subgroup analysis will be used to investigate potential sources. Publication bias will be assessed using funnel plots and the Stata metabias command. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical review will not be required because it is a systematic review.

D-dimer is a product that is a part of fibrin abasement, which can be used as a test for the diagnosis of thrombotic disorders. Higher D-dimer levels are a strong indicator of mortality in patients with active COVID-19. This study aimed to determine the relationship between D-dimer levels and the clinical prognosis of COVID-19 patients. This observational, prospective study was conducted between April 2020 and September 2020. All patients with COVID-19 infection were considered for this study, along with their D-dimer values. Patients with higher D-dimer levels and pre-existing morbidities experienced a longer hospital stay and increased complications when compared to patients without pre-existing morbidities. Abnormally elevated D-dimer levels were frequently observed upon admission due to COVID-19 and are analogous to the increased occurrence of critical illness, thrombotic events, acute kidney injury, and death. Therefore, D-dimer levels could be a valuable clinical biomarker and an important indicator of prognosis for patients with COVID-19 with pre-existing morbidities.

METHODS: We undertook a test negative case control study to estimate the overall and age-specific (6 months-17 years, 18C64 years, 65 years old) IVE against medically attended POCT-confirmed influenza. The study took place over the winter of 2019C2020 and was nested within twelve general practices that are part of the Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC), the English sentinel surveillance network. RESULTS: 648 POCT were conducted. 193 (29.7%) of those who were swabbed had received the seasonal influenza vaccine. The crude unadjusted overall IVE was 46.1% (95% CI: 13.9C66.3). After adjusting for confounders the overall IVE was 26.0% (95% CI: 0C65.5). In total 211 patients were prescribed an antimicrobial after swab testing. Given a positive influenza POCT result, the odds ratio (OR) of receiving an antiviral was 21.1 (95%CI: 2.4C182.2, p = <0.01) and the OR of being prescribed an antibiotic was 0.6 (95%CI: 0.4C0.9, p = <0.01). DISCUSSION: Using influenza POCT in a primary care sentinel surveillance network to estimate IVE is feasible and provides comparable results to published IVE estimates. A further advantage is that near patient testing of influenza is associated with improvements in appropriate antiviral and antibiotic use.

Method: Retrospective cohort with 215 patients (57.2% men; age = 29  4) with corrected TOF (median of three years, ranging from 0.33 to 51) that underwent EPS between 2009-2020. The primary outcome was composed of death, implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) requirement and hospitalization. Results: Pre-syncope (EPS = 4.7%, No-EPS = 0%; p = 0.004), syncope (EPS = 7.1%, No-EPS = 1.7%; p = 0.056) and palpitations (EPS = 31%, No-EPS = 5.8%; p < 0.001) were symptoms that justified electrophysiological investigation. ICD was implanted in 24% of EPS and 0.6% of No-EPS (p=0.001). Twenty-six percent of the EPS group presented non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, while 0% in No-EPS (p = 0.012). The EPS group had more atrial fibrillation or atrial Flutter (35.7% vs. 6.9%; p < 0.001).

The questionnaire consisted of 29, 5, and 4 items about COVID-19 knowledge, preventive behaviors, and risk perceptions, respectively. A total of 251 health care workers completed the questionnaire. The mean age of the participants was 33.888.72 years old, and the sample consisted of 68 males (27.08%) and 183 females (72.91%). While there was no difference between the percentage of correct answers given by female and male participants to knowledge-based questions (p>0.05), the percentage of correct answers to the questions on preventive behaviors was significantly higher in female participants than in males (p<0.001). The overall average percentages of correct responses were 91.66% for knowledge-based questions and 85.96% for preventive behavior questions.

However, the usefulness of this marker for predicting acute kidney injury (AKI) progression is unclear. METHODS: This retrospective study was based on the Chang Gung Research Database. Patients admitted to the intensive care unit with a diagnosis of stage 1 or 2 AKI were identified. The primary outcome was a composite of progression to stage 3 AKI, requirement of renal replacement therapy, or 14-day in-hospital mortality. The association between NLR and the primary outcome was examined using a logistic regression model and multivariable analysis. The nonlinearity and cutoff points of this relationship were determined using a restricted cubic spline model. RESULTS: A total of 10,441 patients were enrolled. NLR level at the time of stage 1C2 AKI diagnosis was a marker of adverse outcomes. After adjustment for confounders, NLR was independently associated with the composite outcome of AKI progression, renal replacement therapy, or mortality. The restricted cubic spline model revealed a J-shaped curve, with the lowest odds ratio for an NLR between 7 and 38. Subgroup analysis revealed linear and J-shaped relationships between NLR and the primary outcome in patients admitted to the intensive care unit for medical reasons and for cardiovascular surgery, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: NLR is an independent marker of AKI progression and in-hospital mortality. Because it is readily available in daily practice, it might be used for risk stratification in the AKI population.

OBJECTIVES: The goal of our retrospective, observational analysis was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous (s.c.) canakinumab in combination with our standard of care (SOC) treatment of selected patients with COVID-19 with respiratory failure and elevated reactive pro-inflammatory markers. METHODS: Eight participants received two doses of s.c. canakinumab 150 mg (or 2 mg/kg for participants weighing 40 kg) in addition to SOC. 12 patients received only SOC treatment. RESULTS: Canakinumab treatment reduced the need for mechanical ventilation and reduced proinflammatory markers, resulting in an amelioration of the final outcome, with respect to the control group who received SOC alone. The treatment was safe and well tolerated; no adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION: The use of canakinumab (300 mg, s.c.) in the early stage of COVID-19 with mild-to-moderate respiratory failure was superior to SOC at preventing clinical deterioration and may warrant further investigation as a treatment option for patients with COVID-19 who experience a hyperinflammatory response in the early stage of the disease.","output":"Early use of canakinumab to prevent mechanical ventilation in select COVID-19 patients: A retrospective, observational analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization has recently defined the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection a pandemic.

Children, although important drivers of silent transmission, are not included in the current COVID-19 vaccination campaigns. Objective: To estimate the benefits of identifying silent infections among children as a proxy for their vaccination. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study used an age-structured disease transmission model, parameterized with census data and estimates from published literature, to simulate the estimated synergistic effect of interventions in reducing attack rates during the course of 1 year among a synthetic population representative of the US demographic composition. The population included 6 age groups of 0 to 4, 5 to 10, 11 to 18, 19 to 49, 50 to 64, and 65 years or older based on US census data. Data were analyzed from December 12, 2020, to February 26, 2021. Exposures: In addition to the isolation of symptomatic cases within 24 hours of symptom onset, vaccination of adults was implemented to reach a 40% to 60% coverage during 1 year with an efficacy of 95% against symptomatic and severe COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: The combinations of proportion and speed for detecting silent infections among children that would suppress future attack rates to less than 5%. Results: In the base-case scenarios with an effective reproduction number Re = 1.2, a targeted approach that identifies 11% of silent infections among children within 2 days and 14% within 3 days after infection would bring attack rates to less than 5% with 40% vaccination coverage of adults. If silent infections among children remained undetected, achieving the same attack rates would require an unrealistically high vaccination coverage (&#8805;81%) of this age group, in addition to 40% vaccination coverage of adults. The estimated effect of identifying silent infections was robust in sensitivity analyses with respect to vaccine efficacy against infection and reduced susceptibility of children to infection. Conclusions and Relevance: In this simulation modeling study of a synthetic US population, in the absence of vaccine availability for children, a targeted approach to rapidly identify silent COVID-19 infections in this age group was estimated to significantly mitigate disease burden. These findings suggest that without measures to interrupt transmission chains from silent infections, vaccination of adults is unlikely to contain the outbreaks in the near term.","output":"Simulated Identification of Silent COVID-19 Infections Among Children and Estimated Future Infection Rates With Vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Locked nucleic acid (LNA) is a nucleic acid analog containing one or more LNA nucleotide monomers with a bicyclic furanose unit locked in an RNA-mimicking sugar conformation.

Efforts to protect at risk communities are needed. This study explored the acceptability of offering accommodation to support self-isolation among at risk populations, to prevent transmission of Covid-19 within vulnerable households. METHODS: Mixed methods design structured in two phases. Phase 1: Survey of 545 individuals who had provided consent to be contacted about ongoing research projects into infection control. Phase 2: Semi-structured interviews with 19 participants from ethnic minority and low income communities. RESULTS: Many survey and interview participants viewed the provision of accommodation as important and necessary in certain contexts. Of the 110 survey respondents, 85 (77%) said that they were not able to isolate at home. Among this group, 24 (28%) said they would accept accommodation and 23 (27%) said that they would probably accept. Of those unable to isolate at home, and at high risk if they caught the virus (N = 36) or living with someone at high risk (N 18), 19 (35%) said that they would accept, and 12 (22%) said they would probably accept accommodation. Factors influencing uptake of accommodation included perceived 1) household vulnerability 2) virus exposure and 3) lack of isolation at home options. Barriers to accepting the accommodation offer included 1) able to isolate at home 2) wanting to be with family 3) caring responsibilities 4) mental wellbeing concerns 5) concerns about moving when ill and 6) infection control concerns. Participants raised issues that should be addressed before accommodation is offered, including questions regarding who should use temporary accommodation and when, and how infection control in temporary accommodation would be managed. CONCLUSION: The provision of accommodation to prevent within household transmission of Covid-19 is viewed as acceptable, feasible and necessary by some people who are concerned about infection transmission in the home and are unable to self-isolate or socially distance at home. Different households will have different requirements, e.g., those with caring responsibilities, and to overcome these challenges additional support may be needed for the provision of accommodation to be feasible to those who could benefit most.

The magnitudes of these effects have not been compared at equivalent anesthetic doses. We hypothesized that upper airway closing pressure is less negative and genioglossus activity is lower during deep compared with shallow anesthesia. METHODS In a randomized controlled crossover study of 12 volunteers, anesthesia with propofol or sevoflurane was titrated using a pain stimulus to identify the threshold for suppression of motor response to electrical stimulation. Measurements included bispectral index, genioglossus electromyography, ventilation, hypopharyngeal pressure, upper airway closing pressure, and change in end-expiratory lung volume during mask pressure drops. RESULTS A total of 393 attempted breaths during occlusion maneuvers were analyzed. Upper airway closing pressure was significantly less negative at deep versus shallow anesthesia (-10.8  4.5 vs. -11.3  4.4 cm H2O, respectively [mean  SD]) and correlated with the bispectral index (P < 0.001), indicating a more collapsible airway at deep anesthesia. Respiratory genioglossus activity during airway occlusion was significantly lower at deep compared with light anesthesia (26  21 vs. 35  24% of maximal genioglossus activation, respectively; P < 0.001) and correlated with bispectral index (P < 0.001). Upper airway closing pressure and genioglossus activity during airway occlusion did not differ between sevoflurane and propofol anesthesia. CONCLUSIONS Propofol and sevoflurane anesthesia increased upper airway collapsibility in a dose-dependent fashion with no difference at equivalent anesthetic concentrations. These effects can in part be explained by a dose-dependent inhibiting effect of anesthetics on respiratory genioglossus activity.","output":"Effects of Depth of Propofol and Sevoflurane Anesthesia on Upper Airway Collapsibility, Respiratory Genioglossus Activation, and Breathing in Healthy Volunteers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that untreated overt and subclinical thyroid disorders and autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT) are associated with mental and physical complaints in the general population.

Monitoring the burden of disease by serological assay could be used as an early warning system for imminent outbreaks as an increased seroprevalance often precedes larger outbreaks. However, the multitude of highly pathogenic viruses necessitates the need to identify specific antibodies against several targets from both humans as well as from potential reservoir animals such as bats. In order to address this, we have developed a broadly reactive multiplex microsphere immunoassay (MMIA) for the detection of antibodies against several highly pathogenic viruses from both humans and animals. To this aim, nucleoproteins (NP) of Ebola virus (EBOV), Marburg virus (MARV) and nucleocapsid proteins (NP) of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus, Rift Valley fever virus and Dobrava-Belgrade hantavirus were employed in a 5-plex assay for IgG detection. After optimisation, specific binding to each respective NP was shown by testing sera from humans and non-human primates with known infection status. The usefulness of our assay for serosurveillance was shown by determining the immune response against the NP antigens in a panel of 129 human serum samples collected in Guinea between 2011 and 2012 in comparison to a panel of 88 sera from the German blood bank. We found good agreement between our MMIA and commercial or in-house reference methods by ELISA or IIFT with statistically significant higher binding to both EBOV NP and MARV NP coupled microspheres in the Guinea panel. Finally, the MMIA was successfully adapted to detect antibodies from bats that had been inoculated with EBOV- and MARV- virus-like particles, highlighting the versatility of this technique and potentially enabling the monitoring of wildlife as well as human populations with this assay. We were thus able to develop and validate a sensitive and broadly reactive high-throughput serological assay which could be used as a screening tool to detect antibodies against several highly pathogenic viruses.","output":"Development of a multiplex microsphere immunoassay for the detection of antibodies against highly pathogenic viruses in human and animal serum samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is pertinent to examine potentially detrimental impacts of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on young people.

As practices are now considering reintroduction of elective endoscopy, we conducted a survey of North American practices to identify reactivation barriers and strategies. Methods We designed and electronically distributed a web-based survey to North American gastroenterologists consisting of seven domains: institutional demographics, impact of COVID-19 on endoscopy practice, elective endoscopy resumption plans, anesthesia modifications, personal protective equipment (PPE) policies, fellowship training and telemedicine use. Responses were stratified by practice type: ambulatory surgery center (ASC) or hospital-based. Results In total, 123 practices (55% ASC-based and 45% hospital-based) responded. At the pandemics peak (as reported by the respondent), practices saw a 90% drop in endoscopy volume with most centers planning to resume elective endoscopy a median of 55 days after initial restrictions. Declining community prevalence of COVID-19, PPE availability, and pre-procedure SARS-CoV-2 testing availability were ranked as the three primary factors influencing reactivation timing. ASC-based practices were more likely to identify pre-procedure testing availability as a major factor limiting elective endoscopy resumption (p=0.001). Pre-procedure SARS-CoV-2 testing was planned by only 49.2% of practices overall; when testing is performed and negative, 52.9% of practices will continue to utilize N95 masks. Conclusion This survey highlights barriers and variable strategies for reactivation of elective endoscopy services following the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results suggest that more widespread access to pre-procedure SARS-CoV-2 tests with superior performance characteristics is needed to increase provider and patient comfort in proceeding with elective endoscopy.","output":"Plans to Reactivate Gastroenterology Practices Following the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Survey of North American Centers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cardiac complications may develop in a proportion of patients with the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which may influence their prognosis. OBJECTIVES: To assess the role of cardiac injury biomarkers measured on admission and during hospitalization as risk factors for subsequent death in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out involving cohort studies that compared the levels of cardiac injury biomarkers in surviving and dead COVID-19 patients. Cardiac injury is defined as an elevation of the definitive markers (cardiac troponin (cTnI and cTnT) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)) above the 99th percentile upper reference limit. Secondary markers included creatine kinase-myocardial bound (CK-MB), myoglobin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and C-reactive protein (CRP). The risk of death and the differences in marker concentrations were analyzed using risk ratios (RRs) and standardized mean differences (SMDs), respectively. RESULTS: Nine studies met the inclusion criteria (1799 patients, 53.36% males, 20.62% with cardiac injury). The risk of death was significantly higher in patients with elevated cTn than those with normal biomarker levels (RR = 5.28, P < 0.0001). Compared to survivors, dead patients had higher levels of cTn (SMD = 2.15, P=0.001), IL-6 (SMD = 3.13, P=0.03), hs-CRP (SMD = 2.78, P < 0.0001), and CK-MB (SMD = 0.97, P < 0.0001) on admission and a significant rise of plasma cTnT during hospitalization. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients with elevated cTn on admission, possibly due to immune-mediated myocardial injury, are at increased risk for mortality. This requires further radiographic investigations, close monitoring, and aggressive care to reduce the risk of severe complications and death.","output":"Cardiac Injury Biomarkers and the Risk of Death in Patients with COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Photolyases and cryptochromes are evolutionarily related flavoproteins, which however perform distinct physiological functions. Photolyases (PHR) are evolutionarily ancient enzymes. They are activated by light and repair DNA damage caused by UV radiation. Although cryptochromes share structural similarity with DNA photolyases, they lack DNA repair activity. Cryptochrome (CRY) is one of the key elements of the circadian system in animals. In plants, CRY acts as a blue light receptor to entrain circadian rhythms, and mediates a variety of light responses, such as the regulation of flowering and seedling growth. RESULTS: We performed a comprehensive evolutionary analysis of the CRY/PHR superfamily. The superfamily consists of 7 major subfamilies: CPD class I and CPD class II photolyases, (6C4) photolyases, CRY-DASH, plant PHR2, plant CRY and animal CRY. Although the whole superfamily evolved primarily under strong purifying selection (average  = 0.0168), some subfamilies did experience strong episodic positive selection during their evolution. Photolyases were lost in higher animals that suggests natural selection apparently became weaker in the late stage of evolutionary history. The evolutionary time estimates suggested that plant and animal CRYs evolved in the Neoproterozoic Era (~1000C541 Mya), which might be a result of adaptation to the major climate and global light regime changes occurred in that period of the Earths geological history.","output":"Evolutionary History of the Photolyase/Cryptochrome Superfamily in Eukaryotes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the last period of lockdown because of the Covid-19 pandemic influence, a lot of mental health professionals were able to continue working online, assisting their patients from home too. Even if there are still some doubts about videoconferencing psychotherapy (VCP), a lot of studies indicate that VCP can be feasible and clinically effective, in fact the online therapy is becoming increasingly popular, reducing distances even during the current pandemic. The aim of this study is to analyze the degree of satisfaction after using VCP in a sample of psychotherapists freely recruited through the publication on social media of a specially created questionnaire. The collected data were analyzed by performing descriptive statistics to show the qualitative and quantitative composition of the sample examined. A tree classification model was created to predict the liking of the remote therapeutic intervention based on the socio-demographic characteristics, previous experiences and aspects of psychotherapeutic orientation of the therapists recruited in the study. Through a decision tree that explains which variables are related to positive responses, the following characteristics were found to predict the degree of satisfaction of the psychotherapists in using the VCP: belonging to a specific age group;having previously used VCP;and belonging to a specific psychotherapeutic orientation. According to the results, the first two important characteristics of the psychotherapists to influence the satisfaction in their use of VCP (belonging to the specific age group 45-65 and having previously used VCP) are probably a matter that can be linked to the degree of professional maturity and experience. The innovation of this research is to highlights the real impact of the distance therapy on the main therapeutic models, concluding that to have a certain level of proficiency, according the own orientation, in the use of the VCP may influence the level of satisfaction of the psychotherapists.","output":"Satisfaction degree in the using of VideoConferencing Psychotherapy in a sample of Italian psychotherapists during Covid-19 emergency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the United States, nursing is the largest healthcare profession, with over 3 2 million registered nurses (RNs) nationwide and comprised of mostly women Foreign-trained RNs make up 15 percent of the RN workforce For over half a century, the U S healthcare industry has recruited these RNs in response to nurse shortages in hospitals and nursing homes Philippines-trained RNs make up 1 out of 20 RNs in this country and continue to be the largest group of foreign-trained nurses today Recently, the news media has publicized the many deaths of Filipino RNs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States Given the imperial historical ties between these two countries in the context of the nursing profession and the enduring labor inequities that persist, this nationally representative study is one of the few to our knowledge to not only quantitatively examine the current work differences in characteristics and experiences of Philippines-trained RNs and U S -trained white RNs practicing in the United States today, but to also do so from an intersectionality lens The overall aim of this paper is to illuminate how these differences may serve as potential factors contributing to the disproportionate number of Filipino nurses' COVID-19 related vulnerability and deaths in the workplace (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","output":"From imperialism to inpatient care: Work differences of filipino and white registered nurses in the united states and implications for covid-19 through an intersectional lens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a fatal disease in domestic and nondomestic felids caused by feline coronavirus (FCoV).

Post-Liver transplant (LT) de novo or recurrent viral infection continues to cause major allograft dysfunction, leading to poor graft and patient survival in untreated patients. Availability of highly effective antiviral drugs has significantly improved post-LT survival. Patients transplanted for chronic hepatitis B infection should receive life-long nucleos(t)ide analogues, with or without HBIg for effective viral control. Patients with chronic hepatitis C should be commenced on directly acting antiviral (DAA) drugs prior to transplantation. DAA therapy for post-LT recurrent hepatitis C infection is associated with close to 100% sustained virological response (SVR), irrespective of genotype. De novo chronic Hepatitis E infection is an increasingly recognised cause of allograft dysfunction in LT recipients. Untreated chronic HEV infection of the graft may lead to liver fibrosis and allograft failure. Similarly, CMV and EBV can reactivate leading to systemic illness following liver transplantation. With COVID-19 pandemic, post-transplant patients are at risk of SARS-Co-V2 infection. Majority of the LT recipients require hospitalisation, and the mortality in this population is around 20%.

Many innovative solutions have been suggested to deal with the possible shortage in desperate situations like disasters, pandemics and resource-limited settings. Although splitting of invasive ventilation has been reported previously, no attempts to split non-invasive respiratory support have been reported. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to test the feasibility of splitting the bCPAP assembly using a T-piece splitter in a simulation model. METHODS: A pilot simulation-based study was done to split a single bCPAP assembly using a T-piece. Other materials consisted of a heated humidification system, an air oxygen blender, corrugated inspiratory and expiratory tubing, nasal interfaces and two intercostal chest tube drainage bags. Two pressure manometers were used simultaneously to measure delivered pressures at different levels of set bCPAPs at the expiratory limb of nasal interfaces. RESULTS: Pressures measured at the expiratory end of two nasal interfaces were 5.1 and 5.2 cm H(2)O, respectively, at a flow of 6 L/min and a water level of 5 cm H(2)O in both chest bags. When tested across different levels of set continuous positive airway pressure (3C8 cmH(2)O) and fractional inspired oxygen concentration (0.30C1.0), measured parameters corresponded to set parameters.

METHODS: We conducted in-depth interviews with 24 nurses, social workers, and doctors serving both HIV-positive and HIV-negative PWID at 13 needle and syringe programs (NSPs) and 4 AIDS Centers (HIV treatments centers) in Kazakhstan from May to August 2020. Participants were asked how the COVID-19 pandemic had impacted their PWID clients' risks, their organizational environment, and the services offered to PWID over the prior 3C6 months. Thematic content analysis was used to elicit findings. FINDINGS: The COVID-19 pandemic considerably impacted NSP and AIDS Center operations. Participants perceived high risks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection for themselves and their clients, as well as pandemic-related increases in substance use and HIV risks for clients. Organizations instituted several policy and regulatory changes to adapt to the pandemic, most notably tasking NSPs with delivering HIV medications; these changes necessitated new roles and responsibilities for many providers. Despite this stressful changing environment and increased service demands, participants still shared examples of persistence and resilience as they worked to meet client needs during these challenging times. DISCUSSION: NSPs in Kazakhstan are well-positioned to reach key populations with crucial information and flexible services during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, they need recognition as essential organizations and additional equipment and staff support to protect staff and clients, maintain pandemic-related regulatory changes, and address additional challenges such as overdose prevention among clients.","output":"HIV Care Continuum Services for People Who Inject Drugs in Kazakhstan During COVID-19: A Qualitative Study of Service Provider Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: and Objective: COVID-19 originated in Wuhan, China and expanded to different geographical location of the world with variation in its sequence due to mutation, consequent alteration in different protein structures;resulting in different interaction with the host body. The highly infectious and diverge character of the virus makes it imperative to identify the promising inhibitory compounds for RdRp, 3CLpro and PLpro as suitable antiviral drug target so that viral duplication can be prevented in the host body. Methods: : RdRp, 3CLpro and PLpro sequences of Indian patients were retrieved from the database and MSA was employed to identify mutation at nsp 3, nsp 5 and nsp 12. Protein structures were modeled considering all possible combination of sequences abundant in India and docking was performed with repurposed drugs, currently under trial for COVID-19, using Autodock Vina to find out the suitable ones considering the mutational spectra of SARS-CoV-2 in India. Results: : PLpro is found to be most vulnerable to mutations with four mutations found in >5% studied population whereas in 3CLpro none observed at the frequency > 5%, so far. Two mutations were reported among Indian population (>5%) at RdRp. Therefore 3CLpro and RdRp were further analysed as a suitable target for repurposed drugs. Elbasvir has come up as the most suitable drug to inhibit the activity of RdRp in Indian population, followed by Remdesivir and Methylprednisolone. TMC 310911, Lopinavir and Elbasvir again, found to be the best candidates for inhibiting 3CLpro. Interpretation and Conclusions: Remdesivir and Lopinavir(alone or in combination with Ritonavir), the most popular drugs of choice at recent times may be suitable to be used in Indian population, considering the mutational variations in Indian population. Among others, Elbasvir, TMC 310911 and Methylprednisolone are good choices for treating COVID-19.","output":"Identification of best suitable repurposed drugs considering mutational spectra at RdRp (nsp12), 3CLpro (nsp 5) and PLpro (nsp 3) of SARS-CoV-2 in Indian population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The efficacies of disinfection by sodium hypochlorite, accelerated hydrogen peroxide (AHP), and quaternary ammonium compound (QUAT) commonly used in health care facilities were determined using the surrogate viruses murine norovirus (MNV-1) and feline calicivirus (FCV). METHODS A virus suspension of known concentration (with or without a soil load) was deposited onto stainless steel discs under wet or dry load conditions and exposed to defined concentrations of the disinfectant/cleaning agent for 1-, 5-, or 10-minute contact time using the quantitative carrier test (QCT-2) method.

The diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is difficult early in the illness, because its presentation resembles that of other nonspecific viral fevers, such as dengue. Dengue fever is endemic in many of the countries in which the large SARS outbreaks occurred in early 2003. Misdiagnosis may have serious public health consequences. We aimed to determine simple laboratory features to differentiate SARS from dengue. Methods. We compared the laboratory features of 55 adult patients with SARS at presentation (who were all admitted before radiological changes had occurred) and 147 patients with dengue. Features independently predictive of dengue were modeled by multivariate logistic regression to create a diagnostic tool with 100% specificity for dengue. Results. Multivariate analysis identified 3 laboratory features that together are highly predictive of a diagnosis of dengue and able to rule out the possibility of SARS: platelet count of <140  10(9) platelets/L, white blood cell count of <5  10(9)cells/L, and aspartate aminotransferase level of >34 IU/L. A combination of these parameters has a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 100%. Conclusions. Simple laboratory data may be helpful for the diagnosis of disease in adults admitted because of fever in areas in which dengue is endemic when the diagnosis of SARS needs to be excluded. Application of this information may help to optimize the use of isolation rooms for patients presenting with nonspecific fever.","output":"Use of Simple Laboratory Features to Distinguish the Early Stage of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome from Dengue Fever"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 has become a major health event that endangers public health throughout China and the world raising international concern This study aims","output":"Characteristics and Associations with Severity in COVID-19 Patients: A Multicentre Cohort Study from Jiangsu Province, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In December 2019, pneumonia cases of unknown origin were reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. Identified as the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the number of cases grew rapidly by human-to-human transmission in Wuhan. Social media, especially Sina Weibo (a major Chinese microblogging social media site), has become an important platform for the public to obtain information and seek help. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyze the characteristics of suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients who asked for help on Sina Weibo. METHODS: We conducted data mining on Sina Weibo and extracted the data of 485 patients who presented with clinical symptoms and imaging descriptions of suspected or laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19. In total, 9878 posts seeking help on Sina Weibo from February 3 to 20, 2020 were analyzed. We used a descriptive research methodology to describe the distribution and other epidemiological characteristics of patients with suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection. The distance between patients' home and the nearest designated hospital was calculated using the geographic information system ArcGIS. RESULTS: All patients included in this study who sought help on Sina Weibo lived in Wuhan, with a median age of 63.0 years (IQR 55.0-71.0). Fever (408/485, 84.12%) was the most common symptom. Ground-glass opacity (237/314, 75.48%) was the most common pattern on chest computed tomography; 39.67% (167/421) of families had suspected and/or laboratory-confirmed family members; 36.58% (154/421) of families had 1 or 2 suspected and/or laboratory-confirmed members; and 70.52% (232/329) of patients needed to rely on their relatives for help. The median time from illness onset to real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing was 8 days (IQR 5.0-10.0), and the median time from illness onset to online help was 10 days (IQR 6.0-12.0). Of 481 patients, 32.22% (n=155) lived more than 3 kilometers away from the nearest designated hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that patients seeking help on Sina Weibo lived in Wuhan and most were elderly. Most patients had fever symptoms, and ground-glass opacities were noted in chest computed tomography. The onset of the disease was characterized by family clustering and most families lived far from the designated hospital. Therefore, we recommend the following: (1) the most stringent centralized medical observation measures should be taken to avoid transmission in family clusters; and (2) social media can help these patients get early attention during Wuhan's lockdown. These findings can help the government and the health department identify high-risk patients and accelerate emergency responses following public demands for help.","output":"Mining the Characteristics of COVID-19 Patients in China: Analysis of Social Media Posts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To assess the homology and phylogenetic relationship between porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) Anhui strains and other PEDV strains, molecular homology and phylogenetic analyses of Anhui PEDV field strains were compared with those of reference strains.

Participants: 141 COVID-19 patients with laboratory confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in the year 2020. Main Outcome Measures: Risk-stratified treatment decision, rate of hospitalization and all-cause death. Results: Of 335 positively PCR-tested COVID-19 patients, 127 were treated with the triple therapy. 104 of 127 met the defined risk stratification criteria and were included in the analysis. In addition, 37 treated and eligible patients who were confirmed by IgG tests were included in the treatment group (total N=141). 208 of the 335 patients did not meet the risk stratification criteria and were not treated.

In Vitro, PSPAs significantly suppressed pyroptosis and restricted NLRP3 inflammasome activation in alveolar macrophages infected with KP. As for the mechanism, PSPAs promote mitophagy by recruiting Parkin to the mitochondria. PSPAs-conferred mitophagy increased mitochondrial membrane potential and decreased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial DNA, resulting in impaired NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In addition, the promotion of mitophagy by PSPAs required the Nrf2 signaling pathway.

Slot blots or RNase protection assays were done on AP RNA from 3-, 6-, 12-, 18- and 24-mo-old male F344 rats consuming food ad libitum (AL) or food restricted (FR; to 60% of AL food intake) from 6 wk. Both AL and FR rats gained body weight during the study (P < 0.05), but FR rats weighed 40% less (P < 0.0001). Messenger RNA levels were expressed in two ways, i.e., per total AP and per microgram total AP RNA. Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA/g RNA was higher (P < 0.0005) in FR than in AL rats at all ages. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)  mRNA declined with age (P < 0.05) in AL but not FR rats and was reduced by FR up to 12 mo (P < 0.01). Growth hormone (GH) mRNA/g RNA declined with age (P < 0.05) in AL but not FR rats, and total GH mRNA in the AP was reduced by FR at early ages (P < 0.05). FR reduced prolactin (PRL) mRNA and its age-related increase (P < 0.0005). Levels of luteinizing hormone (LH)  and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)  mRNAs did not differ between AL and FR rats until 12 mo, but thereafter rose in FR (LH  mRNA; P < 0.01, FSH  mRNA; P < 0.05). Many of these changes in gene expression corroborate previously reported hormonal changes in FR rodents and mutant mice with extended life spans, and thus provide further support for the hypothesis that an altered hormonal milieu contributes to the antiaging effects of food restriction.","output":"Food Restriction Differentially Affects Pituitary Hormone mRNAs throughout the Adult Life Span of Male F344 Rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A pandemia da Covid-19 tem sido marcada por um perodo de isolamento social Por isso, h uma tendncia das atividades de lazer se alterarem ou se adaptarem s opes dentro das residncias Por meio de uma pesquisa bibliogrfica e da aplicao de um questionrio online, buscamos comparar as atividades de lazer vivenciadas antes e durante a pandemia e, ainda, procuramos compreender a importancia atribuda por adultos e idosos ao lazer Como resultados, constatamos que os (as) participantes alteraram significativamente seus hbitos de lazer, principalmente no que se refere aos interesses sociais, fsico-esportivos e tursticos Alm disso, a grande maioria entende o lazer como algo fundamental na vida e uma parcela dos (as) pesquisados (as) tem percebido menos tempo livre para usufru-lo no perodo de isolamento social, pois o trabalho e as tarefas do dia a dia est?o cada vez mais imbricados The Covid-19 pandemic has been marked by a period of social isolation Therefore, there is a tendency for leisure activities to change or adapt to options within the homes Through a bibliographic search and the application of an online questionnaire, we seek to compare the leisure activities experienced before and during the pandemic and, still, we try to understand the importance attributed by adults and elderly people to leisure As a result, we found that the participants significantly changed their leisure habits, especially with regard to social, physical-sporting and tourist interests In addition, the vast majority understand leisure as something fundamental in life and a portion of those surveyed has perceived less free time to enjoy it in the period of social isolation, as work and day-to-day tasks are increasingly imbricated","output":"Impacts of the covid-19 pandemic on adult and elderly leisure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article analyses the ways in which educators of schools located in the riverside areas of Pantanal in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul (Brazil) - Escolas das guas (Schools in riverside areas) - organized themselves to maintain schooling in the period of the pandemic generated by COVID-19 For the development of this work, a qualitative perspective was adopted Data collection took place with a survey and study of local documentation and open interviews, via WhatsApp application, between April and June 2020, with the school management and teachers from these schools The analysis of the educational situation was carried out considering the social policies context, which allowed the perception that vulnerable populations may be more fragile in exceptional situations Education, mediated by Escolas das guas, was found to be one of the only links between local population and public power ? 2020 Universidade Estadual de Ponta Grossa, Editora All rights reserved","output":"Schooling of children and adolescents from Pantanal (Brazil) in times of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several diagnostic tools have been developed for clinical and epidemiological assays.

Through a comprehensive strategy, potential 16 mer antigenic peptides suited for antibody-based SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis were identified. A systematic scan of the three structural proteins (S,N and M) and the non-structural proteins (ORFs) present in the SARS-CoV-2 virus was conducted through the combination of immunoinformatic methods, peptide SPOT synthesis and an immunoassay with cellulose-bound peptides (Pepscan). The Pepscan filter paper sheets with synthetic peptides were tested against pools of sera of COVID-19 patients. Antibody recognition showed a strong signal for peptides corresponding to the S, N and M proteins of SARS-CoV-2 virus, but not for the ORFs proteins. The peptides exhibiting higher signal intensity were found in the C-terminal region of the N protein. Several peptides of this region showed strong recognition with all three immunoglobulins in the pools of sera. The differential reactivity observed between the different immunoglobulin isotypes (IgA, IgM and IgG) within different regions of the S and N proteins, can be advantageous for ensuring accurate diagnosis of all infected patients, with different times of exposure to infection.

The chapter also reviews genetic pharmacology as it relates to antiviral antisense research and drug development. Antisense oligonucleotides are selective compounds by virtue of their interaction with specific segments of RNA. For potential antivirals, identification of appropriate target RNA sequences for antisense oligonucleotides is performed at two levels: the optimal gene within the virus, and the optimal sequence within the RNA. The importance of these oligonucleotide modifications in designing effective drugs is just now being evaluated, both in animal model systems and in the clinic. The first generation of widely used antisense oligonucleotides has been the phosphorothioate (PS) compounds and a body of data on biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism in animals and in humans is now available. Since the identification and sequencing of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), there has been a strong interest in identifying a potent oligonucleotide inhibitor that would have the potential for development as a therapy for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Numerous phosphorothioate oligonucleotides, with no apparent antisense sequence specificity, can have an anti-herpes simplex virus (HSV) effect. Oligonucleotides can be effective anti-influenza agents in cell culture assays. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) X protein that is a transactivator has been also reported to be targeted successfully by antisense oligonucleotides in vivo. Several of picornaviruses have been targets for antisense oligonucleotide inhibition, and the studies demonstrate the versatility of the antisense approach. However, the fact that oligonucleotides may contribute numerous mechanisms toward the antiviral activity, in addition to the antisense mechanism, may in some cases be an asset in the pursuit of clinically useful antiviral drugs.","output":"Antisense Inhibition of Virus Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Each day thousands of children across the world die as a result of infection.

Based upon data arising from S1 sequence and phylogenetic analyses, the three IBV isolates were genetically different from other known IBV types, which represented a novel genotype (GI-29). Virus cross-neutralization tests, using CoV/ck/China/I0111/14 as a representative, showed that genotype GI-29 was antigenically different from all other known IBV types, thus representing a novel serotype. Complete genomic analysis showed that GI-29 type viruses were closely related to and might originate from a GX-YL5-like virus by accumulation of substitutions in multiple genes. These GI-29 viral genomes are still evolving and diverging, particularly in the 3 region, although we cannot rule out the possibility of recombination events occurring.

We sought to examine colchicine's effects on circulating inflammatory and metabolic molecules in adults with obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS). METHODS: Blood samples were collected pre- and post-intervention during a double-blind randomized controlled trial in which 40 adults with obesity and MetS were randomized to colchicine 0.6 mg or placebo twice-daily for 3 months. Serum samples were analyzed for 1305 circulating factors using the SomaScan Platform. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used to adjust the false discovery rate (FDR) for multiple testing. RESULTS: At baseline, age (48.0  13.8 vs. 44.7  10.3 years) and BMI (39.8  6.4 vs. 41.8  8.2 kg/m2) were not different between groups. After controlling for the FDR, 34 molecules were significantly changed by colchicine. Colchicine decreased concentrations of multiple inflammatory molecules, including C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, and resistin, in addition to vascular-related proteins (e.g., oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor, phosphodiesterase 5A). Conversely, relative to placebo, colchicine significantly increased concentrations of eight molecules including secreted factors associated with metabolism and anti-thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: In adults with obesity, colchicine significantly affected concentrations of proteins involved in the innate immune system, endothelial function and atherosclerosis, uncovering new mechanisms behind its cardiometabolic effects.

The analysis of the data generated a general overview of the actions performed in relation to the meal, while also showing differences in actions taken based on income and gender. Women were significantly more price conscious than men and to a larger extent used technical assistance to find somewhere to eat. When travelling alone they also reported eating faster than at home and bringing back food and eat at the hotel room more often than men did. Men, in contrast, exhibited an inclination towards seeking social contexts to insert themselves in during dinners when travelling alone, as to be able to eat together with other people.

METHODS From January 2004 to December 2011, from our prospective cohorts of RCVS and CeAD, we studied patients with both conditions. RESULTS Of 173 RCVS cases and 285 CeAD cases, 20 patients (18 women, 2 men; mean age 41 years) had both RCVS and CeAD. Main associated conditions were migraine (12/20) and postpartum (5/18). Clinical features included severe headache in all patients, neck pain in 15, focal neurologic deficit in 9, and seizures in 4. Pain was the only symptom in 10 patients. All patients had multifocal cerebral vasoconstriction. There were brain lesions in 12 patients, cortical subarachnoid hemorrhage in 11, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in 4, intracerebral hemorrhage in 3, and infarcts in 4. CeAD involved one artery in 13 patients and multiple arteries in 7. CeAD mostly affected vertebral arteries (25 of 30 CeAD). Only one vertebral CeAD was associated with a related symptomatic infarct. At 3 months, 18 patients had fully recovered, all patients showed reversal of cerebral vasoconstriction, and 21 dissected arteries had normalized, whereas 9 arteries showed residual stenosis (7) and/or aneurysm (3). CONCLUSION The association of RCVS and CeAD was found in 12% of our patients with RCVS and 7% of our patients with CeAD. Underlying mechanisms are unknown.

Materials and methods: This study is an observational study that was performed on sixteen children, 7-11 years of age, who needed incisor proclination in more than one tooth. In this study, patients were followed until the end of their orthodontic therapy. The variables evaluated were the maxillary arch length, arch depth, intercanine distance, and intermolar distance in pre- and posttreatment. To assess intra-examiner reliability, 10 plaster models were randomly selected and re-measured. Results: In all the cases, the newly designed removable appliance was used and in all showed a significant increase in arch length, arch depth, intercanine distance, and intermolar distance. The correction was achieved within 1-9 months depending on the patient's compliance. Conclusion: There was a significant increase in all aspects of arch length and depth after using this appliance. The procedure is a simple and effective method that is recommended for compliant patients needing proclination of more than one anterior tooth; especially in dental class III, pseudo-class III patients, and the first phase of class II division 2 skeletal treatments.

Drawing on in-depth interviews with family members in the intensive care unit (ICU) during an end-of-life hospitalization and into their bereavement period up to six months after the death of the patient, this article examines bereaved family members' experiences of grief by examining three aspects from the end-of-life hospitalization and decision-making in the ICU that informed their subsequent bereavement experiences. First, this article explores how the process of advance care planning (ACP) shaped family experiences of grief, by demonstrating that even prior informal conversations around end-of-life care outside of having an advance directive in the hospital was beneficial for family members both during the hospitalization and afterwards in bereavement. Second, clinicians' compassionate caring for both patients and families through the \\"little things\\" or small gestures were important to families during the end-of-life hospitalization and afterwards in bereavement. Third, the transition time in the hospital before the patient's death facilitated family experiences of grief by providing a sense of support and meaning in bereavement. The findings have implications for clinicians who provide end-of-life care by highlighting salient aspects from the hospitalization that may shape family grief following the patient's death. Most importantly, the notion that ACP as a social process may be a \\"gift\\" to families during end-of-life decision-making and carry through into bereavement can serve as a motivator to engage patients in ACP.","output":"Beyond the hour of death: Family experiences of grief and bereavement following an end-of-life hospitalization in the intensive care unit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although myocarditis can be a severe cardiac complication of COVID-19 patients, few data are available in the literature about the incidence and clinical significance in patients affected by SARS-CoV-2.

We retrospectively evaluated all the consecutive patients admitted for COVID-19 without exclusion criteria. Suspect myocarditis was defined according to current guidelines. Age, sex, in-hospital death, length of stay, comorbidities, serum cardiac markers, interleukin-6, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and therapy were recorded. Between March 4 to May 20, 2020, 1169 patients with COVID-19 were admitted in 3 Italian Medicine wards. 12 patients (1%) had suspected acute myocarditis; 5 (41.7%) were men, mean age was 76 (SD 11.34; median 78.5 years); length of stay was 38 days on average (SD 8, median value 37.5); 3 (25%) patients died. 8 (66.7%) had a history of cardiac disease; 7 (58.33%) patients had other comorbidities like diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or renal insufficiency.

One reason for their decline is thought to be a high susceptibility to (infectious) diseases because cheetahs in zoos suffer from high disease-induced mortality. Data on the health status of free-ranging cheetahs are scarce, and little is known about their exposure and susceptibility to infectious diseases. We determined seroprevalences to nine key viruses (feline herpesvirus 1, feline calicivirus, feline parvovirus, feline coronavirus, canine distemper virus, feline immunodeficiency virus [FIV], puma lentivirus, feline leukemia virus, and rabies virus) in 68 free-ranging cheetahs on east-central Namibian farmland, 24 nonvaccinated Namibian captive cheetahs, and several other wild carnivore species and conducted necropsies of cheetahs and other wild carnivores. Eight of 11 other wild carnivores were seropositive for at least one of the viruses, including the first record of an FIV-like infection in a wild felid west of the Kalahari, the caracal (Felis caracal). Seroprevalences of the free-ranging cheetahs were below 5% for all nine viruses, which is significantly lower than seroprevalences in nonvaccinated captive cheetahs and those for five of seven viruses in previously studied free-ranging cheetahs from north-central Namibia (L. Munson, L. Marker, E. Dubovi, J. A. Spencer, J. F. Evermann, and S. J. O'Brien, J. Wildl. Dis. 40:23-31, 2004). There was no clinical or pathological evidence of infectious diseases in living or dead cheetahs. The results suggest that while free-ranging wild carnivores may be a source of pathogens, the distribution of seroprevalences across studies mirrored local human population density and factors associated with human habitation, probably reflecting contact opportunities with (nonvaccinated) domestic and feral cats and dogs.

At 0 and 12 weeks, patients wore an Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometer for 7 days and completed surveys, body size measurements, and an optional 6-minute walk test. Participants could not be masked to their intervention arm, but people assessing the body size and 6-minute walk test outcomes were masked. The primary outcomes were adherence (eg, Fitbit wear and text response rate) and self-assessed acceptability of the intervention. The intervention would be considered feasible if we observed at least 80% complete follow-up and 70% adherence and satisfaction, a priori. RESULTS: From 2018 to 2020, we screened 240 patients; 53.3% (128/240) of patients were ineligible and 26.7% (64/240) declined to participate. A total of 44 patients (44/240, 18%) were randomized to the intervention (n=22) or control (n=22) groups. Of these, 57% (25/44) were women; 68% (30/44) identified as White and 25% (11/44) identified as Asian American or Pacific Islander; and 77% (34/44) had a 4-year college degree. The median age at enrollment was 54 years (IQR 45-62 years). Follow-up at 12 weeks was 91% (40/44) complete. In the intervention arm, patients wore Fitbit devices on a median of 67 out of 84 (80%) study days and responded to a median of 17 out of 27 (63%) questions sent via SMS text message. Among 19 out of 22 (86%) intervention patients who completed the feedback survey, 89% (17/19) were satisfied with the Fitbit device; 63% (12/19) were satisfied with the SMS text messages; 68% (13/19) said the SMS text messages motivated them to exercise; 74% (14/19) said the frequency of SMS text messages (1-3 days) was ideal; and 79% (15/19) said that receiving SMS text messages in the morning and evening was ideal. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study demonstrated that many people receiving chemotherapy for CRC are interested in participating in digital health physical activity interventions. Fitbit adherence was high; however, participants indicated a desire for more tailored SMS text message content. Studies with more socioeconomically diverse patients with CRC are required.

The economic importance of beach tourism for many destinations has led many governments to reopen tourist beaches, as soon as the number of infection cases decreased. The objective of this paper is to provide a scientific basis for understanding the key issues for beach tourism management in these circumstances. These issues include risk perception, environmental considerations directly related to beaches and COVID-19, and management strategies designed to limit the risk of contagion on the beach. The contribution of this paper lies in its interdisciplinary approach to delivering the findings from the latest studies, highly relevant for beach tourism, in psychology, health science, and environmental science (often in preprint and in press format). Particular attention was given to identifying the knowledge gaps evident in the areas of COVID-19 risk perception, with the drivers explaining the risk-taking behavior and the protective strategies employed by beachgoers. Gaps were also found in areas such as the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in bathing waters and the sand, the potential of contaminated sand being a viable route of transmission, and the impact of the use of chemical disinfectants on the marine environment and on bathers. The paper identifies research prospects in these areas, additionally pointing out other questions such as new carrying capacity methods, the opportunity given by COVID-19 in estimation of the impacts of visitation and beach-litter.","output":"Beach Tourism in Times of COVID-19 Pandemic: Critical Issues, Knowledge Gaps and Research Opportunities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The authors present the case of a 79-year-old woman who presented with chronic secretory diarrhoea and severe electrolyte imbalance.

While single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) are commonly considered as driving virus adaption, RNA recombination events that delete or insert nucleic acid sequences are also critical. Whole genome targeting sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 is typically achieved using pairs of primers to generate cDNA amplicons suitable for next-generation sequencing (NGS). However, paired-primer approaches impose constraints on where primers can be designed, how many amplicons are synthesized and requires multiple PCR reactions with non-overlapping primer pools. This imparts sensitivity to underlying SNVs and fails to resolve RNA recombination junctions that are not flanked by primer pairs. To address these limitations, we have designed an approach called Tiled-ClickSeq, which uses hundreds of tiled-primers spaced evenly along the virus genome in a single reverse-transcription reaction. The other end of the cDNA amplicon is generated by azido-nucleotides that stochastically terminate cDNA synthesis, removing the need for a paired-primer. A sequencing adaptor containing a Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) is appended to the cDNA fragment using click-chemistry and a PCR reaction generates a final NGS library. Tiled-ClickSeq provides complete genome coverage, including the 5UTR, at high depth and specificity to the virus on both Illumina and Nanopore NGS platforms. Here, we analyze multiple SARS-CoV-2 isolates and clinical samples to simultaneously characterize minority variants, sub-genomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs), structural variants (SVs) and D-RNAs. Tiled-ClickSeq therefore provides a convenient and robust platform for SARS-CoV-2 genomics that captures the full range of RNA species in a single, simple assay.","output":"Tiled-ClickSeq for targeted sequencing of complete coronavirus genomes with simultaneous capture of RNA recombination and minority variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Client-Centered Representative Payee (CCRP) is an intervention modifying implementation of a current policy of the US Social Security Administration, which appoints organizations to serve as financial payees on behalf of vulnerable individuals receiving Social Security benefits. By ensuring beneficiaries bills are paid while supporting their self-determination, this structural intervention may mitigate the effects of economic disadvantage to improve housing and financial stability, enabling self-efficacy for health outcomes and improved antiretroviral therapy adherence. This randomized controlled trial will test the impact of CCRP on marginalized people living with HIV (PLWH). We hypothesize that helping participants to pay their rent and other bills on time will improve housing stability and decrease financial stress. METHODS: PLWH (n = 160) receiving services at community-based organizations will be randomly assigned to the CCRP intervention or the standard of care for 12 months. Fifty additional participants will be enrolled into a non-randomized (choice) study allowing participant selection of the CCRP intervention or control. The primary outcome is HIV medication adherence, assessed via the CASE adherence index, viral load, and CD4 counts. Self-assessment data for ART adherence, housing instability, self-efficacy for health behaviors, financial stress, and retention in care will be collected at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. Viral load, CD4, and appointment adherence data will be collected at baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months from medical records. Outcomes will be compared by treatment group in the randomized trial, in the non-randomized cohort, and in the combined cohort. Qualitative data will be collected from study participants, eligible non-participants, and providers to explore underlying mechanisms of adherence, subjective responses to the intervention, and implementation barriers and facilitators. DISCUSSION: The aim of this study is to determine if CCRP improves health outcomes for vulnerable PLWH. Study outcomes may provide information about supports needed to help economically fragile PLWH improve health outcomes and ultimately improve HIV health disparities. In addition, findings may help to refine service delivery including the provision of representative payee to this often-marginalized population.

We assessed family disruption and family functioning with measures of key family\\\\level and parenting dimensions, including family cohesion, conflict and routines, and parents harsh discipline, lax discipline and warmth. In all models, pre\\\\pandemic parent emotional distress, financial strain and child maladjustment were included as covariates. METHODS: The sample included 204 families, comprised of parents who had children (M (Age) = 4.17; 45.1% girls). Parents (M (Age) = 27.43) completed the first survey prior to COVID\\\\19 onset in the United States, a second survey after COVID\\\\19 onset in May 2020 and a third survey two weeks later. RESULTS: Analyses were conducted in a model\\\\building fashion, first computing structural equation models for each family and parenting dimension separately, then advancing significant dimensions into one integrated model for the family\\\\level factors and a second model for parenting quality factors. Results provided more support for the family disruption hypothesis across all tests. In the family\\\\level domain, decreases in family cohesion and increases in family conflict each uniquely predicted subsequent child maladjustment. In the parenting domain, increases in harsh discipline and lax discipline each uniquely predicted subsequent child maladjustment. Family routines and parental warmth were not associated with child adjustment. However, parents emotional distress prior to the pandemic exhibited a robust association with childrens internalizing problems. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that efforts to support families in adapting to unique conditions of the pandemic will yield the greatest effect for child adjustment. Specifically, interventions should include efforts to help families maintain cohesion and manage conflict, and help parents minimize increases in harsh and lax discipline.","output":"Family vulnerability and disruption during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic: prospective pathways to child maladjustment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to examine the attitudes of professional footballers towards help-seeking behaviours related to mental health symptoms and the impact of a mental health awareness video on these help-seeking behaviours. The secondary objective was to evaluate whether the mental health awareness video was feasible in professional football. METHODS: A quasi-experimental study based on a one-group pretest post-test was conducted using a questionnaire. Attitude, help-seeking behaviours and confidence were measured with validated questionnaires, including the Attitudes Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help-Short Form (ATSPPH-SF) and General Help-Seeking Questionnaire (GHSQ). RESULTS: Sixty-five professional footballers (63% men; 37% women) were enrolled in the study. The mean ATSPPH-SF score was 18.1 at pretest and 19.4 at post-test (p=0.00). The mean GHSQ score was 47.6 at pretest and 48.9 at post-test (p=0.00). The level of confidence in helping someone experiencing mental health symptoms was 11.1 at pretest and 11.7 at post-test (p=0.00).

No BLPD was observed following autologous HSCT, so risk factor analyses were confined to the 1542 allogeneic HSCT. Factors assessed were HLA-mismatching (?1 antigen), T cell depletion (TCD), presence of acute GvHD (grades IICIV), donor type (related vs unrelated), age of recipient and donor, and underlying disease. Factors found to be statistically significant included patients transplanted for immune deficiency and CML, donor age ?18 years, TCD, and HLA-mismatching, with recipients of combined TCD and HLA-mismatched grafts having the highest incidence. Factors found to be statistically significant in a multiple regression analysis were TCD, donor age and immune deficiency, although 7/8 of the patients with immunodeficiencies and BLPD received a TCD graft from a haploidentical parent.

Many different secondary bacterial diseases occur in PRRS virus (PRRSV)-infected pigs. However, to date, establishing a reproducible experimental model of PRRSV infection in weaned pigs, with subsequent clinical disease following secondary bacterial challenge, has been difficult. PRRSV is frequently isolated during outbreaks from weak-born piglets affected by secondary bacterial diseases. This study was performed to investigate the potential role of intrauterine PRRSV infection on piglet susceptibility to secondary bacterial infection. PRRSV-free pregnant sows were intranasally infected at 98 days of gestation with PRRSV strain SD 23983. All piglets born to the PRRSV-infected sows were viremic. Piglets were removed from the sows at birth and deprived of colostrum. Piglets from PRRSV-infected and noninfected sows were randomly assigned to Streptococcus suis challenge or control subgroups. At 5 days of age, piglets were challenged intranasally with strain MN 87555 of S. suis type II. Total and differential leukocyte counts were performed on blood samples collected at 3 days of age. The numbers of leukocytes, lymphocytes, and monocytes were significantly reduced in the PRRSV-infected piglets. Lesions were observed in bone marrow, brain, lung, heart, spleen, lymph node, tonsil, and thymus of PRRSV-infected piglets. Thymus/body weight ratios of in utero PRRSV-infected piglets were significantly reduced compared to those of non-PRRSV-infected piglets, and thymic lesions were characterized by severe cortical depletion of thymocytes. Lesions were not observed in piglets born to PRRSV-free sows. Overall, 20 out of 22 piglets in the PRRSV-S. suis dual-infection group died within 1 week after challenge with S. suis (10 of 11 in each of two trials). This contrasts with 1 of 18 piglets in the PRRSV-infection-only group and 5 of 23 piglets in the S. suis-challenge-only group (1 of 12 in trial 1 and 4 of 11 in trial 2). No piglets died in the uninfected control groups. Most of the piglets in the PRRSV-S. suis dual-infection group developed suppurative meningitis. S. suis type II was recovered from their brains and joints.

Underlying the dissatisfaction were assumptions which need to be clarified for example that mass as being identical to holy communion is considered the only way to fulfill the Sundays obligations. In fact, there are a number of religious practices and doctrinal teachings that could serve as better alternatives to the eucharistic celebration on Sundays. This paper concludes that online mass is not the right solution to the problem of worship during the pandemic.

Therefore, this study was aimed at examining its possible role in predicting severity and intrahospital mortality of COVID-19, alongside with other laboratory and biochemical procedures, clinical signs, symptoms, and comorbidity. This study, approved by the Ethical Committee of Clinical Center Kragujevac, was designed as an observational prospective cross-sectional clinical study which was conducted on 127 patients with diagnosed respiratory COVID-19 viral infection from April to August 2020. The primary goals were to determine the predictors of COVID-19 severity and to determine the predictors of the negative outcome of COVID-19 infection. All patients were divided into three categories: patients with a mild form, moderate form, and severe form of COVID-19 infection. All biochemical and laboratory procedures were done on the first day of the hospital admission. Respiratory (p < 0.001) and heart (p = 0.002) rates at admission were significantly higher in patients with a severe form of COVID-19. From all observed hematological and inflammatory markers, only white blood cell count (9.43  4.62, p = 0.001) and LDH (643.13  313.3, p = 0.002) were significantly higher in the severe COVID-19 group. We have observed that in the severe form of SARS-CoV-2, the levels of superoxide anion radicals were substantially higher than those in two other groups (11.3  5.66, p < 0.001) and the nitric oxide level was significantly lower in patients with the severe disease (2.66  0.45, p < 0.001). Using a linear regression model, TA, anosmia, ageusia, O2 -, and the duration at the ICU are estimated as predictors of severity of SARS-CoV-2 disease. The presence of dyspnea and a higher heart rate were confirmed as predictors of a negative, fatal outcome. Results from our study show that presence of hypertension, anosmia, and ageusia, as well as the duration of ICU stay, and serum levels of O2 - are predictors of COVID-19 severity, while the presence of dyspnea and an increased heart rate on admission were predictors of COVID-19 mortality.","output":"Predicting Severity and Intrahospital Mortality in COVID-19: The Place and Role of Oxidative Stress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has played an important role in the increase of loss of follow up for cancer cases in general. Especially in gastrointestinal cancer, during this pandemic, the routine outpatients often refused tp continue treatment planning, starting earlier from the pandemic. This leads to increasing emergency presentations of the gastrointestinal cancer patients, and, as we know, delayed presentation and emergency operations do not fare as well as elective and well-prepared treatments, and there are more post-operative morbidities. Method(s): This retrospective study started from March up to August 2020, including all gastrointestinal cancer patients, already diagnosed during the pandemic and with no previous treatment. The recurrence cases were be excluded from this study. Each stage of gastrointestinal cancer was reported after finishing the staging of the cancer. Elective or emergency treatment was evaluated. Result(s): During our last 5 months, we reported 48 cases of gastrointestinal cancer patients. 33 patients were already diagnosed as colorectal adenocarcinoma, 28 patients had large bowel obstruction and need emergent operation. The 15 other patients had malignant biliary obstruction due to advanced stage periampullary tumors, including pancreatic head adenocarcinoma, distal and proximal cholangiocarcinoma, with signs and symptoms of cholangitis. Four patients in the colorectal cancer group did not survive, all of them had large bowel closed loop perforation associated with the obstruction before and prolonged sepsis. In the periampullary cancer group, palliative surgery was done in all of the cases, 2 patients had unfavorable outcomes associated with delayed biliary obstruction and severe cholangitis on presentation. Conclusion(s): The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has had a great impact in the delayed presentation of gastrointestinal cancer patients.

We assessed whether markers of endothelial damage and immune dysregulation were associated with organ failure, thrombus formation, and death. Approach and Results: Markers of endothelial damage (VWF:Ag [von Willebrand factor antigen], PAI-1 [plasminogen activator inhibitor-1], syndecan-1, TFPI [tissue factor pathway inhibitor], and soluble thrombomodulin), complement activation (C5a and C5b-9), cytokines (IL [interleukin]-6, TNF [tumor necrosis factor]-, and IL-2R), and neutrophil extracellular traps (cell-free DNA, nucleosomes, and myeloperoxidase-DNA) were measured at intensive care unit admission in 82 patients with COVID-19. We also analyzed the histological composition of thrombi collected in critically ill living patients successfully weaned from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Beside respiratory failure, VWF:Ag, PAI-1, TFPI, and syndecan-1 were independently associated with liver injury and multiorgan failure development, underlining the direct role of endotheliopathy in organ failure. Nucleosomes were also associated with liver injury, multiorgan failure, and death which occurred in 38%, 60%, and 27% of patients, respectively. Moreover, dysregulated immune response including cytokines, complement, and neutrophil extracellular traps was associated with markers of endothelial damage, respiratory failure, and liver injury. COVID-19 thrombi retrieved from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuitry contained accumulation of neutrophils, VWF, and significantly higher amount of neutrophil extracellular traps when compared with non-COVID-19 thrombi.

Oligodendrocyte precursor cells are involved in maintaining blood-brain barrier integrity during the development. However, whether oligodendrocyte precursor cell could sustain blood-brain barrier permeability during ischemic brain injury is unknown. Here, we investigate whether oligodendrocyte precursor cell transplantation protects blood-brain barrier integrity and promotes ischemic stroke recovery. Adult male ICR mice (n = 68) underwent 90 min transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. After ischemic assault, these mice received stereotactic injection of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (6  105). Oligodendrocyte precursor cells transplantation alleviated edema and infarct volume, and promoted neurological recovery after ischemic stroke. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells reduced blood-brain barrier leakage via increasing claudin-5, occludin and -catenin expression. Administration of -catenin inhibitor blocked the beneficial effects of oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Wnt7a protein treatment increased -catenin and claudin-5 expression in endothelial cells after oxygen-glucose deprivation, which was similar to the results of the conditioned medium treatment of oligodendrocyte precursor cells on endothelial cells. We demonstrated that oligodendrocyte precursor cells transplantation protected blood-brain barrier in the acute phase of ischemic stroke via activating Wnt/-catenin pathway.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are states of chronic inflammation and indicate advanced metabolic disease. The purpose of this observational study was to characterize the risk of hospitalization for Covid-19 in patients with NAFLD/NASH and evaluate the mitigating effect of various metabolic treatments. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of electronic medical record data of 26,896 adults from a 12-hospital Midwest healthcare system with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR from March 1, 2020 to Jan 26, 2021. Variable selection was guided by LASSO and multiple imputation was used to account for missing data. Multivariable logistic regression and competing risk models were used to assess odds of being hospitalized within 45 days of Covid-19 diagnosis. Analysis assessed the risk of hospitalization among patients with a prescription for metformin and statin use within the 3 months prior to the SARS-CoV-2 PCR result, history of home glucagon-like-peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) use, and history of metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS). Interactions were assessed by gender and race. RESULTS: A history of NAFLD/NASH was associated with increased odds of admission for Covid-19, (OR 1.88 95% CI 1.57-2.26, p<0.001)) and mortality (OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.45-2.67, p < 0.001). Each additional year of having NAFLD/NASH was associated with a significant increased risk of being hospitalized for Covid-19 (OR 1.24 95% CI 1.14-1.35, p<0.001). NAFLD/NASH increased risk of hospitalization in men, but not women, and increased risk of hospitalization in all non-white racial/ethnic subgroups. Medication treatments for metabolic syndrome were associated with significantly reduced risk of admission: OR 0.81 (0.67-0.99, p<0.001) for home metformin use and OR 0.71 (0.65-0.83, p<0.001) for home statin use. MBS was associated with a significant decreased risk of admission: OR 0.48 (0.33-0.69, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: NAFLD/NASH is a significant risk factor for hospitalization for Covid-19, and appears to account for risk attributed to obesity. Other significant risks include factors associated with socioeconomic status and other comorbidities, such as history of venous thromboembolism. Treatments for metabolic disease mitigated risks from NAFLD/NASH. More research is needed to confirm risk associated with visceral adiposity, and patients should be screened for and informed of treatments for metabolic syndrome.","output":"Metabolic Surgery May Protect Against Admission for Covid-19 in Persons with Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The natural history of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) in Western populations is still debated, especially for those <7 mm. Reporting data of a large single-center cohort managed with watchful waiting is therefore interesting. METHODS From January 2011 to June 2019, 662 UIAs were followed up by yearly MR angiography. Morphologically stable UIAs were managed conservatively while unstable UIAs were offered treatment. The patients' clinical and radiological data were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS UIAs were 4 mm in 60%, 4.1-7.0 mm in 33%, and >7 mm in 7%. They were located on the anterior circulation in 90% of cases. The mean follow-up duration was 51.32 months for a total of 2831 aneurysm-years. During follow-up, 37 UIAs (5.5%) were treated because of an increase in size, and 8 UIAs were treated because of patient decision. Three aneurysms ruptured during follow-up for an annual risk of rupture of 0.1% (95% CI 0% to 0.24%). No risk factors for rupture were identified. The three ruptured cases made an excellent recovery. During follow-up, annual mortality from unrelated causes was 0.8% (95% CI 0.51% to 1.18%). CONCLUSIONS This single-center cohort evaluated our watchful waiting policy applied in two-thirds of all incidental UIAs. Morphological change of UIAs during follow-up led to treatment in 5.5% of cases. With such a management paradigm, we found a low rupture rate in these selected UIAs and the mortality was unrelated to aneurysms.","output":"Results of watchful waiting of unruptured intracranial aneurysms in a Western patient population: a single-center cohort."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The sharing economy gains momentum and develops a major economic impact on traditional markets and firms.

Usual dietary intakes of participants during the preceding year were examined using a food frequency questionnaire. Data on dietary TAC from foods was gathered from published databases that provided the antioxidant capacity for each food item, measured by ferric reducing antioxidant power. Participants: Cases were individuals with pathologically confirmed glioma that were diagnosed during the last month (n = 128). Controls were individuals, aged between 20 and 75 years, who were hospitalized or were outpatients referred to other wards of the same hospitals (n = 256). Results: Compared with participants in the lowest quartile, those in the highest quartile of dietary TAC had a lower odds of glioma (OR: 0.28, 95%CI: 0.15-0.45). This association was strengthened when potential confounders were taken into account (OR: 0.13; 95%CI: 0.05-0.35).

The aim of the present paper was to describe the impact of this lockdown on the treatment of injuries. METHODS: We collected hospital data on injury diagnoses from a national emergency preparedness register established during the pandemic. We identified the number of injured patients per day in the period 1 January-30 June 2020, and analysed the change in patient volumes over two three-week periods before and during the lockdown by sex, age, level of care, level of urgency, type of contact and type of injury. RESULTS: Compared to pre-lockdown levels, there was an overall reduction of 43% in injured patients during the first three weeks of lockdown. The decrease in patient contacts did not differ by sex, but was most pronounced among young people. Substantial reductions were observed for both acute and elective treatment and across all levels of care and types of contact, with the exception of indirect patient contacts. The change in patient contacts varied considerably by injury type, with the largest reduction observed for dislocations/sprains/strains. The decrease was much lower for burns/corrosions and poisoning. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial reduction in the treatment of injuries was observed during lockdown in Norway.

CONCLUSIONS Heat inactivation of blood samples at 56  for 30 min does not obviously affect the results of immunochromatography and chemiluminescent immunoassay for detection of SARS-COV-2 antibodies but can reduce the risk of infection for the operators. Heat-inactivated samples can not be used in fluorescence immunochromatography for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection.","output":"[Effect of heat inactivation of blood samples on the efficacy of three detection methods of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Natural climate solutions (NCS)actions to conserve, restore, and modify natural and modified ecosystems to increase carbon storage or avoid greenhouse gas (GHG) emissionsare increasingly regarded as important pathways for climate change mitigation, while contributing to our global conservation efforts, overall planetary resilience, and sustainable development goals. Recently, projections posit that terrestrial-based NCS can potentially capture or avoid the emission of at least 11 Gt (gigatons) of carbon dioxide equivalent a year, or roughly encompassing one third of the emissions reductions needed to meet the Paris Climate Agreement goals by 2030. NCS interventions also purport to provide co-benefits such as improved productivity and livelihoods from sustainable natural resource management, protection of locally and culturally important natural areas, and downstream climate adaptation benefits. Attention on implementing NCS to address climate change across global and national agendas has grownhowever, clear understanding of which types of NCS interventions have undergone substantial study versus those that require additional evidence is still lacking. This study aims to conduct a systematic map to collate and describe the current state, distribution, and methods used for evidence on the links between NCS interventions and climate change mitigation outcomes within tropical and sub-tropical terrestrial ecosystems. Results of this study can be used to inform program and policy design and highlight critical knowledge gaps where future evaluation, research, and syntheses are needed. METHODS: To develop this systematic map, we will search two bibliographic databases (including 11 indices) and 67 organization websites, backward citation chase from 39 existing evidence syntheses, and solicit information from key informants. All searches will be conducted in English and encompass subtropical and tropical terrestrial ecosystems (forests, grasslands, mangroves, agricultural areas). Search results will be screened at title and abstract, and full text levels, recording both the number of excluded articles and reasons for exclusion. Key meta-data from included articles will be coded and reported in a narrative review that will summarize trends in the evidence base, assess gaps in knowledge, and provide insights for policy, practice, and research. The data from this systematic map will be made open access.

Transmission rates vary from region to region, and are influenced by many factors including population susceptibility, travel and uptake of preventive measures. To date there have been relatively few studies examining the impact of the pandemic in poor, rural regions of India. We report on a study examining COVID-19 burden in a rural community in Tamil Nadu. Methods: : The study was undertaken in a population of approximately 130000 people, served by the Rural Unit of Health and Social Affairs (RUHSA), a community health center of CMC, Vellore. We established and evaluated a COVID-19 PCR-testing programme for symptomatic patients C testing was offered to 350 individuals, and household members of test-positive cases were offered antibody testing. We also undertook two COVID-19 seroprevalence surveys in the same community, amongst 701 randomly-selected individuals. Results: : There were 182 positive tests in the symptomatic population (52.0%). Factors associated with test-positivity were older age, male gender, higher socioeconomic status (SES, as determined by occupation, education and housing), a history of diabetes, contact with a confirmed/suspected case and attending a gathering (such as a religious ceremony, festival or extended family gathering). Amongst test-positive cases, 3 (1.6%) died and 16 (8.8%) suffered a severe illness. Amongst 129 household contacts 40 (31.0 %) tested positive. The two seroprevalence surveys showed positivity rates of 2.2% (July/Aug 2020) and 22.0% (Nov 2020). 40 tested positive (31.0%, 95% CI: 23.02 -38.98). Our estimated infection-to-case ratio was 31.7. Conclusions: : A simple approach using community health workers and a community-based testing clinic can readily identify significant numbers of COVID-19 infections in Indian rural population. There appear, however, to be low rates of death and severe illness, although vulnerable groups may be under-represented in our sample.

Additionally, we observe significant relationships between intracranial T cell phenotypes and the distribution of T cell clonotypes intracranially and peripherally. We found that the phenotype, clonotype, and overall number of MBM-infiltrating T cells were associated with response to ICI, suggesting that ICI-responsive MBMs interact with peripheral blood in a manner similar to extracranial lesions.

To identify surveys that included questions about disability during the COVID-19 pandemic, in the period 2020C2021; and based on this, to determine what actions the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean implemented in the areas of education, health, and social protection that explicitly included the population with disabilities. METHODS. Documents from the national statistics institutes of the countries of the region were reviewed, as well as the Socioeconomic Impact Assessment platform and webpages of international institutions such as the World Bank, the United Nations Development Program, and the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, seeking to identify national or regional surveys implemented during 2020 and the first half of 2021. Additionally, a documentary analysis was conducted of the measures implemented in the health, education, and social protection sectors in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These documents were studied to determine whether the population with disabilities was explicitly mentioned. RESULTS. Twenty-three countries in Latin America and the Caribbean collected information from statistical surveys during 2020C2021. Of these, only four (Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, and Peru) included questions on disability in their national surveys and although some specific surveys were conducted for the population with disabilities, in the region there is a general lack of associated data on this population during the pandemic. Only 10 countries explicitly included the population with disabilities in health measures, 12 in education, and 13 in social protection. CONCLUSIONS. The lack of data on the population with disabilities in the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean during the COVID-19 pandemic shows that this population remains invisible in information collection processes. This is associated with the low number of countries that explicitly included the population with disabilities in policies implemented to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.","output":"Recoleccin de datos durante la pandemia por la COVID-19 y la inclusin de la poblacin con discapacidad en Amrica Latina y el Caribe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral infections are known to be the main trigger for Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations. Face masks are acknowledged for effective viral aerosol shedding reduction.

We aimed to evaluate the variation on severe AECOPD (sAECOPD) rate in a Portuguese COPD cohort during the first COVID-19 lockdown and following months. This retrospective self-controlled study enrolled 322 adult patients followed at COPD-specialized consultation in a tertiary hospital from February 2016 to July 2020, of whom 286 met inclusion criteria. Severe AECOPD events were registered from March 2020 (beginning of state of emergency) until July 2020. From 2016 to 2019 there was a mean of 38 patients per year with sAECOPD. During 2020, 11 patients experienced sAECOPD. Over the course of 2020 there was a 73.4% (p < 0.001) decrease in sAECOPD events comparing with previous years' average. After the end of State of Emergency, the rate of sAECOPD events also declined by 74.6% (p < 0.001) comparing with the same timeline of previous years. Results were consistent and statistically significant when comparing 2020 with each of previous years for every period of analysis.

Among the complex taxa, Cx. pipiens (with two forms pipiens and molestus) and Cx. quinquefasciatus are the most ubiquitous mosquitoes in temperate and tropical regions respectively. Mosquitoes of this taxa lack of morphological differences between females, but have frank behavioral and physiological differences and have different trophic preferences that influence their vectorial status. Hybridization may change the vectorial capacity of these mosquitoes, increasing vector efficiency and medical importance of resulting hybrids. METHODS: Culex pipiens s.l. from 35 distinct populations were investigated by the study of mtDNA, symbiotic bacterium Wolbachia pipientis, nuclear DNA and flanking region of microsatellite CQ11 polymorphism using PCR with diagnostic primers, RFLP analysis and sequencing. RESULTS: Six different mitochondrial haplotypes were revealed by sequencing of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene and three different Wolbachia (wPip) groups were identified. A strong association was observed between COI haplotypes/groups, wPip groups and taxa; haplogroup A and infection with wPipII appear to be typical for Cx. pipiens form pipiens, haplotype D and infection with wPipIV for form molestus, while haplogroup E, characteristic of Cx. quinquefasciatus, were correlated with wPipI and found in Cx. pipiens sl. from coastal regions of Southern Europe and Mediterranean region. Analysis of microsatellite locus and nuclear DNA revealed hybrids between Cx. pipiens form pipiens and form molestus, as well as between Cx. pipiens and Cx. quinquefasciatus, in Mediterranean populations, as opposed to Northern Europe. Phylogenetic analysis of COI sequences yielded a tree topology that supported the RFLP analysis with significant bootstrap values for haplotype D and haplogroup E. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular identification provides the first evidence of the presence of hybrids between Cx. quinquefasciatus and Cx. pipiens as well as cytoplasmic introgression of Cx. quinquefasciatus into Cx. pipiens as a result of hybridization events in coastal regions of Southern Europe and Mediterranean region. Together with observed hybrids between pipiens and molestus forms, these findings point to the presence of hybrids in these areas, with consequent higher potential for disease transmission.

In this chapter, a new measurement system is introduced to inform HIV/AIDS control cross the globe. All countries with data available on area size, total population and total number of persons living with HIV (PLWH) were included, yielding a sample of 148 countries. Four indicators, including the total count, population-based p rate, geographic area-based g rate and population and geographic area-based pg rate were used as a 4D system to describe the global HIV epidemic. The total PLWH count provided data informing resource allocation for individual countries to improve HIV/AIDS care; and the top five countries with highest PLWH count were South Africa, Nigeria, India, Kenya, and Mozambique. Information from the remaining three indicators provided a global risk profile of the HIV epidemic, supporting HIV/AIDS prevention programming strategies. Five countries with highest p rates were Swaziland, Botswana, Lesotho, South Africa, and Zimbabwe; five countries with highest g rates were Swaziland, Malawi, Lesotho, Rwanda, and Uganda; and five countries with highest pg rates were Barbados, Swaziland, Lesotho, Malta, and Mauritius. According to pg rates, two HIV hotspots (south and middle Africa and Caribbean region) and one HIV belt across Euro-Asian were identified. In addition to HIV/AIDS, the 4D measurement system can be used to describe morbidity and mortality for many diseases across the globe.

Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a cause of morbidity and mortality in beef cattle, especially in feedlots. METHODOLOGY This study investigated the morbidity and mortality of BRD in a beef cattle feedlot in southeastern Brazil using: clinical diagnoses, therapy, morbidity, and mortality. Pulmonary fragments were collected from five steers, on feed from 3-32 days, with lesions of pneumonia for identification of BRD infectious agents PCR. RESULTS 188,862 steers were on feed and morbidity was 7.05% (13,315/188,862), mortality 0.64% (1,214/188,862). The causes of morbidity were: BRD (6.13%), lameness (0.29%), trauma (0.21%), clostridiosis (0.13%) and polioencephalomalacia, PEM (0.12%). The causes of mortality were: BRD (0.21%), trauma (0.17%), and clostridiosis (0.13%). When all sick cattle were considered (n=13,315), BRD (86.9%) was the principal cause of morbidity, followed by lameness (4.13%), trauma (3.05%), and clostridiosis (1.82%). The cost of BRD-associated cattle mortality and morbidity was estimated at $14,334.00/10,000 and $16,315.40/10,000 respectively. It was projected that the economic effects due to BRD-associated morbidity in Brazil were $6.31 million/annum, while losses due to mortality were $5.54 million, resulting in an annual loss of $11.85 million. Coinfections in cattle with pneumonia due to Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida were identified in 4/5 steers tested.

Now these criteria do not prove sufficient; numerous archaic interventions remain feasible and legally permissible, yet are now bywords for spurious care. Therefore, we propound another necessary condition for an intervention to become care: the physician must rationally judge the intervention to be conducive to the patient's good. Consequently, the right of access-to-care relies on physicians being free to practice medicine in accord with their consciences, conscience being the rational faculty with which they judge the reasonableness of even mundane medical decisions. Since physicians operate as part of a community, it is further necessary to consider when central bodies may reasonably compel physicians to engage in interventions that the physician believes are not consistent with the patient's good and/or are not congruent with the purposes of medicine.","output":"Access-to-Care and Conscience: Conflicting or Coherent?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Determination of lipoprotein size and subclasses distribution can provide more significant information on cardiovascular disease risk than measurement of traditional lipid parameters alone. Accordingly, we aimed to examine their potential relationship with the novel biomarker of endothelial dysfunction, such as endocan in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), since there are no studies concerning this issue. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This case-control study included a total of 42 individuals with T2D and 64 diabetes-free participants. Serum endocan, lipid parameters, and lipoprotein subclasses were measured. RESULTS: Patients with T2D exhibited higher proportion of the smallest high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles HDL 3c, as compared with diabetes-free participants (p=0.047). Higher serum endocan levels in T2D patients with low small dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles (sdLDL) %, as compared with corresponding group of diabetes-free subjects was shown (p<0.01). Univariate binary logistic analysis revealed significant positive association of endocan and LDL diameter (OR=1.686, p=0.004), and negative associations of endocan with proportions of sdLDL (OR=0.928, p=0.007) and HDL3b (OR=0.789, p=0.009) particles. In a multivariate analysis, LDL diameter and proportions of sdLDL and HDL3b subclasses remained independent predictors of endocan levels in tested population. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study showed that larger LDL diameters, but lower sdLDL and HDL3b proportions were associated with higher endocan levels in population with T2D.

However, suspect interviews in child sexual abuse (CSA) investigations is an understudied research area. In the present mixed-methods study, we examine Swedish (n = 126) and Norwegian (n = 52) police interviewers' self-reported goals, tactics, and emotional experiences when conducting interviews with suspected CSA offenders. The quantitative analyses found associations between the interviewers' self-reported goals, tactics, and emotions during these types of suspect interviews. Interviewers who reported experiencing more negative emotions were more likely to employ confrontational tactics. Specifically, anger was positively associated with the goal of obtaining a confession and with aggressive tactics like raising one's voice and emphasizing the seriousness of the crime. Frustration and disgust displayed similar patterns. Somewhat contrasting these quantitative results, the thematic analysis identified a strong consensus that emotions should not and do not affect the police interviewers' work. Furthermore, the police interviewers described a range of strategies for managing emotions during the interview and for processing their emotional reactions afterwards. The present findings highlight the relevance of emotional processes in CSA suspect interviews and provide an initial exploration of the potentially complex relationship between the goals, tactics, and emotional experiences of police interviewers who question CSA suspects.","output":"Swedish and Norwegian Police Interviewers' Goals, Tactics, and Emotions When Interviewing Suspects of Child Sexual Abuse"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As COVID-19 pandemic continues to explode, cancer centers worldwide are trying to adapt and are struggling with this constantly changing scenario.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess a recently CE-approved POCT, SARS-CoV-2 Ag Test on the LumiraDx&#8482; Platform (LumiraDx GmbH, Cologne, Germany) for the identification of SARS-COV-2 infected subjects at hospital setting. METHODS: LumiraDx POCT was implemented in three hospital settings: adult and pediatric emergency departments and occupational medicine department along two-month period during the second peak of Italian SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Rapid antigen testing was performed on direct nasal swabs and results were compared with those obtained by Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay. RESULTS: Overall sensitivity, specificity, NPV and PPV were 90.3%, 92.1%, 95.1%, and 84.9%, respectively, compared to reference method. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for symptomatic group were 89.3% [95% IC 84.2-93.3], 88.2% [95% IC 72.5-96.7], 97.8% [95% IC 94.6-99.1], and 58.8% [95% IC 48.4-68.5], respectively.

Rapid, accurate microbiological results may allow appropriate antibiotic therapy, withholding or adapting antibiotics, and thus reducing costs and risks of empirical antibiotic therapy. The objective of this proof-of-concept pilot study was to investigate the diagnostic yield of a new polymerase chain-reaction (PCR) and microarray-based rapid molecular diagnostic assay and compare the results to conventional microbiology cultures and clinical judgment. METHODS Bronchoalveolar lavage specimens were obtained from 35 patients undergoing bronchoscopy for diagnostic reasons. Cases (n = 22) consisted of patients with suspicion of pulmonary bacterial infection. Controls (n = 13) were identified among patients undergoing bronchoscopy for indications other than suspicion of infection. RESULTS Demographics were similar in cases and controls. The majority (73%) of patients with pulmonary infection were on empirical antibiotic therapy. Among the 22 cases, bacteria were identified by means of PCR in 77% (n = 17) as compared with 41% (n = 9) by culture (p = 0.030). In contrast, controls yielded a PCR positive result in 45% (n = 7), as compared with no positive cultures (p = 0.005). Compared with culture results, PCR had a sensitivity of 87.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 47.4-97.9) and specificity of 28.6% (95% CI 8.6-58.1) to diagnose bacterial infection. Compared with clinical judgment, corresponding figures were 77.3% (95% CI 54.5-91.1) and 46.2% (95% CI 19.3-74.8), respectively.

We explored the shift in patient demographics and clinical management of systolic heart failure (HF) patients during the COVID 19 outbreak. Purpose: To examine the impact of COVID 19 on the hospitalization rates of decompensated systolic HF patients in a tertiary hospital in Asia and delineate differences in the clinical characteristics and management of these patients. Methods: Data was extracted from the admission registry for systolic HF patients admitted to the tertiary hospital from January to June 2019 (pre- COVID) and the corresponding time period in 2020 during the COVID outbreak. We compared the demographics, clinical management and outcomes of these patients. Results: There was a significant reduction in patients admitted for systolic HF during the COVID period, 174 (6.3%) compared to 240 (8.5%) pre- COVID (p=0.001). The baseline demographics were similar except for the age of patients admitted during the COVID 19 period, which were younger at 66.113.5 compared to 69.913.9 pre-COVID (p=0.007). The mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was lower during the COVID period (22.910.1% vs 24.910.1%;p=0.032). More patients during the COVID period were placed on mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (p=0.001) and SGLT2 inhibitors (p<0.001). For those with recurrent admission for systolic HF, the number for HF admissions in the preceding one year was lower during COVID period compared to pre-COVID (0.20.5 vs 0.51.0 readmissions, p<0.001). There was no COVID 19 infection among those admitted for systolic HF. The 30-day all-cause mortality and readmission rates were comparable between both groups. Cardiac related mortalities were higher during the COVID 19 period compared to the pre-COVID period (77.8% vs 100.0%, p=1.000). No difference was observed in the length of stay nor proportion of patients who required a higher level of care in high dependency or intensive care unit during the COVID outbreak. Those who were admitted during the COVID period were more likely first presentation of decompensated systolic HF, 119 (68.4%) compared to 135 (56.3%) pre-COVID (p=0.014). Conclusion: Similar to the existing publications, there was a reduction in patients admitted for HF during the COVID period. However, for those who were admitted, these patients were younger and had lower LVEF. Most of them were first diagnosed with systolic HF during the hospitalizations. For those who had previous history of systolic HF, they had a lower number of HF admissions in the preceding one year compared to those who were admitted during the pre-COVID period. There was no difference in the 30-day mortality and utilization of high dependency or intensive care unit during the COVID outbreak.","output":"The impact of COVID 19 on heart failure hospitalization and management from an Asian perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"People who have had COVID-19 can suffer from the continuation of Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC), also known as long COVID, for months after infection.

Since older adults are at higher risk of severe illness and consequences from COVID, we hypothesize that they are more likely to become COVID long-haulers and report more symptoms at the time of diagnosis and three months after. We use a nationally representative sample of adults from the Understanding America Study COVID-19 Survey, from March to December 2020, to estimate the prevalence of long COVID and identify the most common long-term symptoms and how they vary by age. We use multilevel models to examine the determinants of symptom count and change over time. Among the 608 people with a COVID diagnosis, 83 (13.7%) aged over 65; almost half (47.9%) reported symptoms three months after diagnosis; the proportion did not differ across age groups. The most common symptoms were fatigue (25.0%), runny/stuffy nose (18.9%), body aches (16.4%), sneezing (15.1%), and headache (13.6%). These symptoms were consistent across age groups, while people aged 65 and older reported significantly less cough (2=3.96; P=0.05) and headache (2=4.24; P=0.04) compared to their younger counterparts.

On top of trial delays or even discontinuation which have been observed in all disease areas, NPIs altered transmission pattern of many seasonal respiratory viruses which followed regular patterns for decades before the pandemic. Clinical trial design based on pre-pandemic historical data therefore needs to be put in question. In this article, we show how knowledge-based mathematical modeling can be used to address this issue. We set up an epidemiological model of respiratory tract infection (RTI) sensitive to a time dependent between-host transmission rate and coupled this model to a mechanistic description of viral RTI episodes in an individual patient. By reducing the transmission rate when the lockdown was introduced in the United Kingdom in March 2020, we were able to reproduce the perturbed 2020 RTI disease burden data. Using this setup, we simulated several NPIs scenarios of various strength (none, mild, medium, strong) and conducted placebo-controlled in silico clinical trials in pediatric patients with recurrent RTIs (RRTI) quantifying annual RTI rate distributions. In interventional arms, virtual patients aged 1-5 years received the bacterial lysate OM-85 (approved in several countries for the prevention of pediatric RRTIs) through a pro-type I immunomodulation mechanism of action described by a physiologically based pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics approach (PBPK/PD). Our predictions showed that sample size estimates based on the ratio of RTI rates (or the post-hoc power of fixed sample size trials) are not majorly impacted under NPIs which are less severe (none, mild and medium NPIs) than a strict lockdown (strong NPI). However, NPIs show a stronger impact on metrics more relevant for assessing the clinical relevance of the effect such as absolute benefit. This dichotomy shows the risk that successful trials (even with their primary endpoints being met) still get challenged in risk benefit assessment during the review of market authorization. Furthermore, we found that a mild NPI scenario already affected the time to recruit significantly when sticking to eligibility criteria complying with historical data. In summary, our model predictions can help rationalize and forecast post-COVID-19 trial feasibility. They advocate for gauging absolute and relative benefit metrics as well as clinical relevance for assessing efficacy hypotheses in trial design and they question eligibility criteria misaligned with the actual disease burden.","output":"Viral kinetic modeling and clinical trial simulation predicts disruption of respiratory disease trials by non-pharmaceutical COVID-19 interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumo O objetivo deste estudo  discutir a reorganizao do processo de trabalho do Agente Comunitrio de Sade (ACS) em decorrncia da pandemia da Covid-19, considerando sua importancia enquanto um elo de articulao entre a comunidade e os servi?os de sade Foi realizada uma revis?o de literatura nas bases de dados Biblioteca Virtual em Sade, Scientific Electronic Library Online e Portal Brasileiro de Publicaes Cientficas em acesso aberto e revis?o documental de notas tcnicas e normativas das secretarias estaduais de sade do Brasil A anlise baseou-se nas premissas da Ateno Primria  Sade e nos eixos do trabalho do ACS, especialmente a competncia cultural e a orientao comunitria, buscando discutir as mudan?as introduzidas neste trabalho no que diz respeito aos seguintes aspectos: apoio s equipes de sade, utilizao da telessade e educao em sade Concluiu-se que a pandemia de Covid-19 demandou reorganizao do processo de trabalho e dos fluxos assistenciais, e para que o ACS continue desenvolvendo suas atividades deve-se garantir condies dignas de trabalho, capacitao e educao permanente, evidenciando-se inclusive, a preocupao quanto  possvel descontinuidade de outros cuidados necessrios para garantir a ateno  sade da populao no territrio Abstract This study discusses the reorganization of the Community Health Workers (CHWs) work process as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, considering its importance as a link between the community and the health services in the field of basic care The literature review comes from the following databases: Virtual Health Library, Scientific Electronic Library Online, and the Brazilian Scientific Publications Portal databases in open access and document review of technical and normative notes from the Municipal Health Secretariats in Brazil The analysis was based on the premises of Primary Health Care and on the axes of the CHW work, especially cultural competence and community orientation, aiming to discuss the changes introduced in this work regarding the following aspects: 1) health teams support, 2) use of telehealth, and 3) health education This study concluded that the Covid-19 pandemic demanded reorganization of the work process and assistance flows in the field of basic care In order for the CHW to continue developing their activities it is necessary to guarantee decent working conditions, training and continuing education, including the concern about the possible discontinuity of other care needed to ensure the population health care in the territory","output":"Community health workers: reflections on the health work process in Covid-19 pandemic times"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This commentary offers a short analysis of the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the relationship between football, and in particular the English Premier League, and the media.

Pre-pandemic, the health and social care sector represented a nominally, inherently and symbolically gendered sector. The workforce was overwhelmingly female and often over 50.

Retention was poor, causing issues for the long-term sustainability and quality of the sector.

Viruses are present in soil (i.e. up to 417  107 viruses per g TS-1 in wetlands) and can affect the behavior and ecology of other life forms (e.g. bacteria), which are remarkably important for maintaining environmental equilibrium. Also, SARS-CoV-2 can be found in soil (i.e. up to 550 copiesg-1). Considering that the SARS-CoV-2 is very recent, poor knowledge is available in the literature on persistence in the soil and reference has been made to coronaviruses and other families of viruses. For instance, the survival of enveloped viruses (e.g. SARS-CoV) can reach 90 days in soils with 10% of moisture content at ambient.

COVID-19 and related mitigation strategies may have exacerbated avoidance, and poor mental health may be bidirectionally related to avoiding care. This study estimated the prevalence of primary care avoidance during the pandemic in a national sample of trans and non-binary people in Canada with a primary care provider and examined the association between poorer self-rated mental health and avoidance. In Fall 2019, Trans PULSE Canada collected multi-mode survey data from trans and non-binary people. In September to October 2020, 820 participants completed a COVID-19-focused survey. In this cross-sectional analysis, multivariable logistic regression models estimated odds ratios adjusted for confounders and weighted to the 2019 sample. The analysis included 689 individuals with a primary healthcare provider, of whom 61.2% (95% CI: 57.2, 65.2) reported fair or poor mental health and 25.7% (95% CI: 22.3, 29.2) reported care avoidance during the pandemic. The most common reason for avoidance was having a non-urgent health concern (72.7%, 95% CI: 65.9, 79.5). In adjusted analyses, those with fair or poor mental health had higher odds of avoiding primary care as compared to those with good to excellent mental health (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.37; 95% CI: 1.50, 3.77). This relationship was similar when excluding COVID-related reasons for avoidance (AOR = 2.52; 95% CI: 1.52, 4.17).

With no cure or effective treatment currently insight, it is vital that factors are identified which will help prevent or delay both age-related and pathological cognitive decline and dementia. Observational data have suggested that hearing loss is a potentially modifiable risk factor for dementia, but no conclusive evidence from randomised controlled trials is currently available. METHODS: The HearCog trial is a 24-month, randomised, controlled clinical trial aimed at determining whether a hearing loss intervention can delay or arrest the cognitive decline. We will randomise 180 older adults with hearing loss and mild cognitive impairment to a hearing aid or control group to determine if the fitting of hearing aids decreases the 12-month rate of cognitive decline compared with the control group. In addition, we will also determine if the expected clinical gains achieved after 12 months can be sustained over an additional 12 months and if losses experienced through the non-correction of hearing loss can be reversed with the fitting of hearing aids after 12 months. DISCUSSION: The trial will also explore the cost-effectiveness of the intervention compared to the control arm and the impact of hearing aids on anxiety, depression, physical health and quality of life. The results of this trial will clarify whether the systematic correction of hearing loss benefits cognition in older adults at risk of cognitive decline. We anticipate that our findings will have implications for clinical practice and health policy development.

Recently, a high dose (HD) TIV was found to increase the level of antibody response in elderly patients compared to the standard dose (SD) TIV. We hypothesized that the HD TIV would be well-tolerated and more immunogenic compared to the SD TIV in pediatric subjects with ALL. PROCEDURE: This was a randomized, double-blind, phase I safety and immunogenicity trial comparing the HD to the SD TIV in children with ALL. Subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive either the HD (60g) or the SD (15g) TIV. Local and systemic reactions were solicited, hemagglutinin inhibition titers to influenza virus antigens were measured, and monitoring labs were collected prior to and/or after each vaccination. RESULTS: Fifty subjects were enrolled (34 HD, 16 SD). Mean age was 8.5 years; 63% were male, and 80% were in maintenance therapy. There were no significant differences reported in local or systemic symptoms. No severe adverse events were attributed to vaccination. No significant differences between the HD and SD TIV groups were noted for immune responses. CONCLUSIONS: No differences were noted between the HD and SD TIV groups for solicited systemic and local reactions.

Since currently no definitive therapies or vaccines for the SARS-CoV-2 virus are available, there is an urgent need to identify effective drugs against SARS-CoV-2 infection. One of the best-known targets available is the main protease of this virus, crucial for the processing of polyproteins codified by viral RNA. In this work, we used a computational virtual screening procedure for the repurposing of commercial drugs available in the DrugBank database as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Molecular docking calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been applied. The computational model was validated through a self-docking procedure. The screening procedure highlighted five interesting drugs that showed a comparable or higher docking score compared to the crystallographic compound and maintained the protein binding during the MD runs. Amongst these drugs, Ritonavir has been used in clinical trials with patients affected by COVID-19 and Nelfinavir showed anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. The five identified drugs could be evaluated experimentally as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease in view of a possible COVID-19 treatment. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

There is limited support for many of its key epidemiologic features, including the incubation period for clinical disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]), which has important implications for surveillance and control activities. Objective: To estimate the length of the incubation period of COVID-19 and describe its public health implications. Design: Pooled analysis of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported between 4 January 2020 and 24 February 2020. Setting: News reports and press releases from 50 provinces, regions, and countries outside Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Participants: Persons with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection outside Hubei province, China. Measurements: Patient demographic characteristics and dates and times of possible exposure, symptom onset, fever onset, and hospitalization. Results: There were 181 confirmed cases with identifiable exposure and symptom onset windows to estimate the incubation period of COVID-19. The median incubation period was estimated to be 5.1 days (95% CI, 4.5 to 5.8 days), and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 15.6 days) of infection. These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, 101 out of every 10 000 cases (99th percentile, 482) will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine. Limitation: Publicly reported cases may overrepresent severe cases, the incubation period for which may differ from that of mild cases. Conclusion: This work provides additional evidence for a median incubation period for COVID-19 of approximately 5 days, similar to SARS. Our results support current proposals for the length of quarantine or active monitoring of persons potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2, although longer monitoring periods might be justified in extreme cases.

This novel virus originated the most challenging pandemic in this century, causing economic and social upheaval internationally. The extreme infectiousness and high mortality rates incentivized the development of vaccines to control this pandemic to prevent further morbidity and mortality. This international scenario led academic scientists, industries, and governments to work and collaborate strongly to make a portfolio of vaccines available at an unprecedented pace. Indeed, the robust collaboration between public systems and private companies led to resolutive actions for accelerating therapeutic interventions and vaccines mechanism. These strategies contributed to rapidly identifying safe and effective vaccines as quickly and efficiently as possible. Preclinical research employed animal models to develop vaccines that induce protective and long-lived immune responses. A spectrum of vaccines is worldwide under investigation in various preclinical and clinical studies to develop both individual protection and safe development of population-level herd immunity. Companies employed and developed different technological approaches for vaccines production, including inactivated vaccines, live-attenuated, non-replicating viral vector vaccines, as well as acid nucleic-based vaccines. In this view, the present narrative review provides an overview of current vaccination strategies, taking into account both preclinical studies and clinical trials in humans.

This class of attractive genetic markers, along with point mutations, have been associated with the risk of developing a wide range of diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases. Several existing methods to detect SNPs and mutations in body fluids have faced limitations. Therefore, there is a need to focus on developing noninvasive future polymerase chain reaction (PCR)Cfree tools to detect low-abundant SNPs in such specimens. The detection of small concentrations of SNPs in the presence of a large background of wild-type genes is the biggest hurdle. Hence, the screening and detection of SNPs need efficient and straightforward strategies. Suitable amplification methods are being explored to avoid high-throughput settings and laborious efforts. Therefore, currently, DNA sensing methods are being explored for the ultrasensitive detection of SNPs based on the concept of nanotechnology. Owing to their small size and improved surface area, nanomaterials hold the extensive capacity to be used as biosensors in the genotyping and highly sensitive recognition of single-base mismatch in the presence of incomparable wild-type DNA fragments. Different nanomaterials have been combined with imaging and sensing techniques and amplification methods to facilitate the less time-consuming and easy detection of SNPs in different diseases. This review aims to highlight some of the most recent findings on the aspects of nanotechnology-based SNP sensing methods used for the specific and ultrasensitive detection of low-concentration SNPs and rare mutations.","output":"Application of Nanotechnology for Sensitive Detection of Low-Abundance Single-Nucleotide Variations in Genomic DNA: A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: In March 2020, due to the pandemic caused by COVID-19, a pilot experience of pharmaceutical continuity of care received by hospital outpatients was launched in Cantabria, a Spanish autonomous community. Thanks to this experience, the medication was dispensed by the hospital pharmacy through the community pharmacy of the patient's choice. Our objective was to estimate the costs avoided by this practice during the months of April and May 2020. Methods: The analysis of the economic impact was carried out in terms of saved costs, from the hospital and from the social perspective. Savings associated with the avoided home delivery of medication and avoided labor productivity losses were calculated, as well as the time associated with avoided trips in monetary terms. Results: A total of 2,249 hospital-dispensed drugs were delivered through the community pharmacy in the analyzed period, with an average of 57.7 daily deliveries. The experience, which involved one hospital and 262 pharmacies of Cantabria, saved patients 93,305 km in trips to the hospital, associated with an average time saving of 1,374 hours. In terms of costs, the hospital saved on shipments by courier, estimated at 30,205, since it was the community pharmacy and the distribution warehouses that delivered the drugs. From a social perspective, this initiative saved 23,309 due to the trips (8,907) and productivity losses (14,402) that were avoided.

People living with diabetes face multiple barriers to optimal diabetes care, including gaps in access to medical care and self-management education, diabetes distress, and high burden of treatment. Community paramedics (CPs) are uniquely positioned to support multidisciplinary care for patients with diabetes by delivering focused diabetes self-management education and support and bridging the gaps between patients and the clinical and community resources they need to live well with their disease. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a pragmatic single-arm prospective trial of a CP-led Diabetes Rescue, Engagement and Management (D-REM) programme that seeks to reduce diabetes distress. We will enrol 70 adults (18 years) with diabetes who have haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)9.0%, experienced an emergency department (ED) visit or hospitalisation for any cause within the prior 6 months, and reside in areas with available CP support in Southeast Minnesota (Olmsted, Freeborn and Mower counties) and Northwest Wisconsin (Barron, Rusk and Dunn counties). Participants will be identified using Mayo Clinic electronic health records, contacted for consent and enrolled into the D-REM programme. Visit frequency will be individualised for each patient, but will be an average of four CP visits over the course of approximately 1 month. Outcomes will be change in diabetes distress (primary outcome), confidence in diabetes self-management, health-related quality of life, self-reported hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia, HbA1c, ED visits and hospitalisations. Outcomes will be assessed on enrolment, programme completion and 3 months after programme completion. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board. Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and presentations. If demonstrated to be successful, this model of care can be implemented across diverse settings and populations to support patients living with diabetes.

We explore which factors may be predictive of ongoing symptoms and their severity, as well as conducting an in-depth analysis of symptom profiles. Finally, we explore which factors predict the presence and severity of cognitive symptoms, both throughout the ongoing illness and at the time of testing. The main finding from this first analysis is that that severity of initial illness is a significant predictor of the presence and severity of ongoing symptoms, and that some symptoms during the acute illness--particularly limb weakness--may be more common in those that have more severe ongoing symptoms. Symptom profiles can be well described in terms of 5 or 6 factors, reflecting the variety of this highly heterogenous condition suffered by the individual. Specifically, we found that neurological and fatigue symptoms during the initial illness, and that neurological, gastro-intestinal, and cardiopulmonary symptoms during the ongoing illness, predicted experience of cognitive symptoms.","output":"COVCOG 1: Factors predicting Cognitive Symptoms in Long COVID.

The effect of this substitution on both replication fitness and resistance to DAAs was evaluated using two genotype 3 subgenomic replicons. S98G had a modest effect on replication, but in combination with the previously characterized resistance-associated substitution (RAS), Y93H, resulted in a significant increase in daclatasvir resistance.

PTX3 is produced upon LPS-TLR4 stimulation in accordance with the lipid A structure of Shigella. In the plasma of infected patients, the level of PTX3 amount only correlates strongly with symptom severity. These results signal PTX3 as a novel player in Shigella pathogenesis and its potential role in fighting shigellosis. Finally, we suggest that the plasma level of PTX3 in shigellosis patients could act as a biomarker for infection severity.","output":"Role of a fluid-phase PRR in fighting an intracellular pathogen: PTX3 in Shigella infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In a previous randomised controlled trial (RCT) in hospital healthcare workers (HCWs), cloth masks resulted in a higher risk of respiratory infections compared with medical masks. This was the only published RCT of cloth masks at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To do a post hoc analysis of unpublished data on mask washing and mask contamination from the original RCT to further understand poor performance of the two-layered cotton cloth mask used by HCWs in that RCT. SETTING: 14 secondary-level/tertiary-level hospitals in Hanoi, Vietnam. PARTICIPANTS: A subgroup of 607 HCWs aged 18 years working full time in selected high-risk wards, who used a two-layered cloth mask and were part of a randomised controlled clinical trial comparing medical masks and cloth masks. INTERVENTION: Washing method for cloth masks (self-washing or hospital laundry). A substudy of contamination of a sample of 15 cloth and medical masks was also conducted. OUTCOME MEASURE: Infection rate over 4 weeks of follow up and viral contamination of masks tested by multiplex PCR. RESULTS: Viral contamination with rhinovirus was identified on both used medical and cloth masks. Most HCW (77% of daily washing) self-washed their masks by hand. The risk of infection was more than double among HCW self-washing their masks compared with the hospital laundry (HR 2.04 (95% CI 1.03 to 4.00); p=0.04). There was no significant difference in infection between HCW who wore cloth masks washed in the hospital laundry compared with medical masks (p=0.5). CONCLUSIONS: Using self-reported method of washing, we showed double the risk of infection with seasonal respiratory viruses if masks were self-washed by hand by HCWs. The majority of HCWs in the study reported hand-washing their mask themselves. This could explain the poor performance of two layered cloth masks, if the self-washing was inadequate. Cloth masks washed in the hospital laundry were as protective as medical masks. Both cloth and medical masks were contaminated, but only cloth masks were reused in the study, reiterating the importance of daily washing of reusable cloth masks using proper method. A well-washed cloth mask can be as protective as a medical mask.

In detail, a differential equation containing a power-law time dependent growth rate is proposed, whose solution, named Stretched Logistic Function, provides a modified version of the usual logistic function. The model equation is inspired by and applied to the recent spreading on COVID-19 disease in Italy, showing how the real dynamics of infection spreading is characterized by a time dependent dynamics.

Investigations upon genetic susceptibility profile to systemic complications during severe infections are a field of increasing scientific interest. Particularly when adaptive immune system is compromised or immature, innate immunity plays a key role in the immediate defense against invasive pathogens. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a serum protein that recognizes a wide range of pathogenic microorganisms and activates complement cascade via the antibody-independent pathway. More than 30% of humans harbor mutations in MBL gene (MBL2) resulting in reduced plasmatic levels and activity. Increased risk of infection acquisition has been largely documented in MBL-deficient patients, but the real impact of this form of innate immunosuppression upon clinical outcome is not clear. In critically ill patients higher incidence and worse prognosis of severe sepsis/septic shock appear to be associated with low-producers haplotypes. However an excess of MBL activation might be also harmful due to the possibility of an unbalanced proinflammatory response and an additional host injury. Strategies of replacement therapies in critically ill patients with severe infections are under investigation but still far to be applied in clinical practice.","output":"The Role of Mannose-Binding Lectin in Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Molnupiravir (MK-4482, EIDD-2801) is a promising orally bioavailable drug candidate for the treatment of COVID-19.

OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to assess perceived family impact and coping during the child's hospitalization for ALL treatment and identify potential predictors of perceived family impact. INTERVENTIONS/METHODS: A total of 212 families with children hospitalized participated. The hospitalization impact and coping scales were used to assess perceived family impact and coping, respectively. RESULTS: The mean (SD) total score for perceived family impact was 88.11 (22.39); social impact received the highest average score. The mean (SD) total score for family coping was 39.02 (9.84). A significant decrease in family coping was associated with more readmissions. Predictors of perceived family impact were severity of the child's illness, total days of all admissions, and coping, accounting for 37% of the observed variance. CONCLUSIONS: Families were moderately affected by children's hospitalizations; social functioning was most affected. Families' perceived coping effectiveness decreased as the readmissions increased. The higher risk category a child's diagnosis is, the longer a child's hospitalization is, and the less perceived coping effectiveness, the higher family perceived impact. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The findings provide a direction for the development of family-centered supportive intervention programs. Nurses should be aware that the total days of admission and severity of a child's illness are significant factors associated with perceived family impact and likely justify special attention.

METHODS: Consecutive patients from a prospective registry who underwent RFA of AF between April 2012 and March 2015 and were on apixaban or rivaroxaban were studied. Clinical variables and outcomes were noted. RESULTS: There were a total of 358 patients (n = 56 on apixaban and n = 302 on rivaroxaban). There were no differences in baseline characteristics between both groups. The last dose of rivaroxaban was administered the night before the procedure in 96% of patients. In patients on apixaban, 48% of patients whose procedure was in the afternoon took the medication on the morning of the procedure. TIA/CVA occurred in 2 patients (0.6%) in rivaroxaban group with none in apixaban group (p = 0.4). There was no difference in the rate of pericardial effusion between apixaban and rivaroxaban groups [1.7% vs 0.6% (p = 0.4)].

This study seeks to examine trends and correlates of individuals obtaining a THN kit in BC between 2017 and 2020. METHODS: Records of THN kits distributed between 2017 and 2020 were the primary source of data for this analysis. Frequency tables were used to describe characteristics of people obtaining kits from THN sites. Correlates of individuals obtaining a THN kit to replace a previous kit reported as used to reverse an overdose were assessed with multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2020, 240,606 THN kits were reported distributed by registered sites to members of the public, with 90,011 records indicating that a kit was obtained to replace a previous kit that had been used to reverse an overdose. There was a significant trend in increasing kits reported used by year (p < 0.01). The kit recipients risk of overdose was a significant predictor of having reported using a THN kit, and the strength of the association was dependent on gender (Male: Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 5.37 [95% confidence interval (CI) 5.08 C 5.67]; Female: AOR 8.35 [95% CI 7.90 C 8.82]; Trans and gender expansive: AOR 3.68 [95% CI 2.82 C 4.79]).

Blood use was categorised as for medical anaemia or haemorrhage, and appropriate or not. The qualitative component comprised a purposeful sample for focus group and individual semi-structured interviews. RESULTS: Of 239 patients sampled, 62% were transfused for medical anaemia and 38% for haemorrhage. In the medical anaemia group, compliance with age-appropriate transfusion thresholds was 69%.

In adults  18 years old with medical anaemia, 47.1% of orders would have resulted in a haemoglobin (Hb) > 8 g/dL. Six doctors participated in focus group and eleven in individual interviews. There was a lack of awareness of institutional transfusion guidelines, disagreement on appropriate RBC transfusion thresholds and comments that more than one RBC unit should always be transfused. Factors informing decisions to transfuse included advice from senior colleagues, relieving symptoms of anaemia and high product costs. CONCLUSION: Most orders were for two or more units. In medical anaemia, doctors compliance with RBC transfusion thresholds was reasonable; however, almost half of the orders would have resulted in overtransfusion.

Methods Ecological analysis using COVID-19 related mortality rates occurring by 24th April 2020, and ethnic composition of the population, across local authorities in England and Wales. Account is taken of age, population density, area deprivation and pollution. Results For every 1% rise in proportion of the population who are ethnic minority, COVID-19 related deaths increased by 5.10 (3.99 to 6.21) per million. This rise is present for each ethnic minority category examined. The size of this increase is a little reduced in a fully adjusted model, suggesting that some of the association results from ethnic minority people living in more densely populated, more polluted and more deprived areas. This estimate suggests that the average England and Wales COVID-19 related death rate would rise by 25% in a local authority with twice the average number of ethnic minority people. Discussion We find clear evidence that rates of COVID-19 related mortality within a local authority increase as the proportion of the population who are ethnic minority increases.

For this purpose, the ten most common ethical issues associated with scholarly authorship are used to set up a taxonomy of existing issues and raise awareness among the community to take precautionary measures and adopt best practices to minimize the negative impact of INAP. We confirm that intense international, interdisciplinary and complex collaborations are necessary, and INAP is an expression of this trend. However, perverse incentives aimed to increase institutional and personal publication counts and egregious instances of guest or honorary authorship are problematic. We argue that whether INAP is due to increased complexity and scale of science, perverse incentives or undeserved authorship, it could negatively affect known ethical issues of authorship at some level. In the long run, INAP depreciates the value of authorship status and may disproportionately impact junior researchers and those who contribute to technical and routine tasks. We provide two suggestions that could reduce the long-term impact of INAP on the reward system of science. First, we suggest further refinement of the CRediT taxonomy including better integration into current systems of attribution and acknowledgement, and better harmony with major authorship guidelines such as those suggested by the ICMJE. Second, we propose adjustments to the academic recognition and promotion systems at an institutional level as well as the introduction of best practices.","output":"An Ethical Exploration of Increased Average Number of Authors Per Publication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Background/aims: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at an increased risk of infection and mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. This study determined the illness severity and mortality amongst COVID-19 infected healthcare workers. Methods: The current study was a retrospective cohort study using population level data. Secondary analysis was conducted on collated data from the Public Health Emergency Operations Centre (PHEOC) at the State Ministry of Health. The cohort included all documented healthcare workers with confirmed COVID-19 infection (diagnosed by Polymerase Chain Reaction). Data were gathered from the COVID-19 patient database of the PHEOC, on demographics, place of work, illness severity and outcome. Descriptive statistics were reported on the cohort characteristics. Adjusted odds ratio was used to report the measure of association between illness severity and risk factors. Results: The mean age was 43 years and 50.5% of the cohort were female. Of the 301 healthcare workers, 187 patients were symptomatic with 32 requiring hospitalisation. From the available data, seven infected HCWs died of their COVID-19 infection, resulting in a case fatality ratio of 2.3%. A subgroup analysis was conducted on the health professionals infected: doctors (71.7%), nurses (27.3%), others (1%). Symptomatic cases were more inclined to progress to severe illness. Predictors of mortality assessed included age, sex, case class and illness severity. The logistic regression model was statistically significant, {chi}2(9)=16.965, = 0.049. Conclusion: Frontline healthcare workers are at an increased risk of exposure to COVID-19 infections. In Nigeria, there is a higher risk of experiencing a severe disease if symptomatic while infected with COVID-19. It is imperative that preventive strategies, proper education, and awareness are put in place to protect healthcare workers.","output":"Analysis of COVID-19 infection amongst healthcare workers in Rivers State, Nigeria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The electrophysiological study is an essential approach to perform the biology and basic medicine research. To achieve the intracellular electrophysiological investigation, electroporation is introduced as an effective and convenient strategy to achieve the intracellular access of electrogenic cells and obtain high-fidelity action potentials. However, seldom platform could provide a quantitative and dynamic strategy to assess the electroporation-induced membrane perforation and recovery during intracellular electrophysiological investigation. Here we develop a high-throughput, sensitive, and stable biosensing platform to assess the evolution of electroporated cell membrane dynamically and quantitatively based on the recorded intracellular electrophysiological signals of cardiomyocytes. Following the electroporation, the extracellular action potentials transiently convert to the intracellular action potentials, whose amplitude rapidly increases to the maximum and then gradually decays. The intracellular action potentials finally convert back to the extracellular action potentials. This biosensing platform can dynamically explore and characterize the evolution procedures of perforation, stabilization, and resealing of the cell membrane by intracellular recordings. Moreover, the effect of electroporation voltages on the cell membrane is segmentally and quantitatively analyzed, demonstrating that a higher electroporation voltage induced a longer resealing time within the safe range of electroporation voltage. We believed that this dynamic and quantitative electroporated membrane evolution biosensing assessment platform will be a promising tool to pave a new avenue to bridge the electrophysiology and electroporated membrane evolution.","output":"A dynamic and quantitative biosensing assessment for electroporated membrane evolution of cardiomyocytes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fangcang shelter hospitals were established in China during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as a countermeasure to stop the spread of the disease.

Here we explored the possibility that different statins might differ in their ability to exert protective effects based on computational predictions. Methods A Bayesian network tool was used to predict drugs that shift the host transcriptomic response to SARS-CoV-2 infection towards a healthy state. Drugs were predicted using 14 RNA-sequencing datasets from 72 autopsy tissues and 465 COVID-19 patient samples or from cultured human cells and organoids infected with SARS-CoV-2, with a total of 2,436 drugs investigated. Top drug predictions included statins, which were tested in Vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 and human endothelial cells infected with a related OC43 coronavirus. A database containing over 4,000 COVID-19 patients on statins was also analyzed to determine mortality risk in patients prescribed specific statins versus untreated matched controls. Findings Simvastatin was among the most highly predicted compounds (14/14 datasets) and five other statins were predicted to be active in > 50% of analyses. In vitro testing of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells revealed simvastatin to be a potent inhibitor whereas most other statins were less effective. Simvastatin also inhibited OC43 infection and reduced cytokine production in endothelial cells. Analysis of the clinical database revealed that reduced mortality risk was only observed in COVID-19 patients prescribed a subset of statins, including simvastatin and atorvastatin. Interpretation Different statins may differ in their ability to sustain the lives of COVID-19 patients despite having a shared target and lipid-modifying mechanism of action. These findings highlight the value of target-agnostic drug prediction coupled with patient databases to identify and validate non-obvious mechanisms and drug repurposing opportunities.

This study therefore aimed to test the acute effects of a single bout of RMT, with and without IH, on resting blood pressure (BP) and sleep. Fourteen prehypertensive elderly performed a 60-min session of (a) intermittent voluntary normocapnic hyperpnea (HYP) alone, (b) HYP in combination with IH (HYP&IH) and (c) a sham intervention in randomized order. BP, hemodynamics, heart rate variability (HRV), cardiac baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were assessed before and 15, 30 and 45 min after each intervention. Variables of sleep were assessed with actigraphy, pulse oximetry and with questionnaires during and after the night following each intervention. Neither HYP nor HYP&IH resulted in a decrease in BP. Repeated measures ANOVA revealed no significant interaction effect for systolic BP (p = 0.090), diastolic BP (p = 0.151), HRV parameters, BRS and PWV (all p > 0.095).

By competitive binding assay these MAbs were found to recognize at least 3 different epitopes. The reactivity of these MAbs with 6 viruses classified as FIPV type I (UCD-1, UCD-2, UCD-3, UCD-4, NW-1, and Black), feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) type II strain 79-1683, canine coronavirus (CCV) strain 1-71, and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) strains TO-163 and SH was examined by neutralization tests.

To our knowledge, no trials have yet been performed comparing these regimens head to head. We performed a network meta-analysis comparing the efficacy of NCCN-recommended chemotherapy regimens. METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from inception to February 2020. We included randomized clinical trials comparing adjuvant regimens in predominantly node-positive operable breast cancer patients. We compared (1) DDACT, (2) TCx4 cycles, (3) TAC, and (4) ACWKT. Common comparators were (5) AC, (6) ACT, and (7) ACD. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. The Cochrane risk of bias tool assessed quality of the studies. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated as measures of treatment effects with AC as reference. We used Bayesian hierarchical random-effects models with noninformative priors for mixed multiple treatment comparisons. Effectiveness was estimated by disease-free and overall survival using ORs. Sensitivity analyses were performed. Safety outcomes included febrile neutropenia. RESULTS: We identified 7 randomized controlled trials with 16,332 patients. TC (odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 0.71 [0.36-1.40]), TAC (0.77 [0.37-1.57]), ACWKT (0.68 [0.34-1.38]), and DDACT (0.72 [0.35-1.42]) were similar for overall survival.

However, approaches to identifying inadequate diets in clinical practice remain inconsistent, and dietary interventions (on both individual and public health policy levels) frequently focus on facilitating 'healthy choices', with limited emphasis on structural constraints. We examine the ethical implications of introducing a routine question in the medical history about ability to access food. Not collecting data on food security means that clinicians are unable to identify people who may benefit from support on an individual level, unable to consider relevant dietary risk factors for disease and disease progression and unable to monitor population trends and inequalities in dietary access in order to design effective policy interventions. We argue that the current lack of routine screening for food insecurity is inconsistent with our approach to other health behaviours (eg, smoking and alcohol use), as well as with doctors' frequent informal role as gatekeepers to the food aid system, and recent calls for governmental action on food insecurity and health inequalities from individual clinicians and professional bodies. Potential ethical barriers to asking patients about food security are addressed, including concerns about stigma, limiting autonomy, fair resource allocation, unclear professional remits and clinicians' ability to offer effective interventions. We suggest that there is an ethical imperative for doctors to ask patients about their ability to access healthy food.

Here in this study, we took the different targets of SARS-CoV-2 prepared in the Schrodinger maestro. The library of the DrugBank database is screened against the selected crucial targets. Our molecular docking, Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MMGBSA), and molecular dynamics simulation studies led to identifying dinaciclib and theodrenaline as potential drugs against multiple drug targets: main protease, NSP15-endoribonuclease and papain-like-protease, of SARS-CoV-2. Dinaciclib with papain-like protease and NSP15-endoribonuclease show the docking score of -7.015 and -8.737, respectively, while the theodrenaline with NSP15-endoribonuclease and main protease produced the docking score of -8.507 and -7.289, respectively. Furthermore, the binding free energy calculations with MM/GBSA and molecular dynamics simulation studies of the complexes confirm the reliability of the drugs.

This can include bacterial and viral infection, chronic inflammation and so-called sterile inflammation triggered by (internal) acute tissue injury. CRP is part of the ancient humoral immune response and secreted into the circulation by the liver upon respective stimuli. Its main immunological functions are the opsonization of biological particles (bacteria and dead or dying cells) for their clearance by macrophages and the activation of the classical complement pathway. This not only helps to eliminate pathogens and dead cells, which is very useful in any case, but unfortunately also to remove only slightly damaged or inactive human cells that may potentially regenerate with more CRP-free time. CRP action severely aggravates the extent of tissue damage during the acute phase response after an acute injury and therefore negatively affects clinical outcome. CRP is therefore a promising therapeutic target to rescue energy-deprived tissue either caused by ischemic injury (e.g., myocardial infarction and stroke) or by an overcompensating immune reaction occurring in acute inflammation (e.g., pancreatitis) or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS; e.g., after transplantation or surgery). Selective CRP apheresis can remove circulating CRP safely and efficiently. We explain the pathophysiological reasoning behind therapeutic CRP apheresis and summarize the broad span of indications in which its application could be beneficial with a focus on ischemic stroke as well as the results of this therapeutic approach after myocardial infarction.","output":"Selective Apheresis of C-Reactive Protein for Treatment of Indications with Elevated CRP Concentrations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 vaccination campaigns continue in the United States, with the expectation that vaccines will slow transmission of the virus, save lives, and enable a return to normal life in due course.

The observed patterns were compared to a forecast model of Wikipedia use, which was trained on data from 2015 to 2019. The model comprehensively analyzed specific articles and similarities between access count data from before (ie, several years prior) and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Wikipedia articles that were linked to those directly associated with the pandemic were evaluated in terms of degrees of separation and analyzed to identify similarities in access counts. We assessed the correlation between article access counts and the number of diagnosed COVID-19 cases and deaths to identify factors that drove interest in these articles and shifts in public interest during the subsequent phases of the pandemic. RESULTS: We observed a significant (P<.001) increase in the number of entries on Wikipedia medical articles during the pandemic period. The increased interest in COVID-19-related articles temporally correlated with the number of global COVID-19 deaths and consistently correlated with the number of region-specific COVID-19 deaths. Articles with low degrees of separation were significantly similar (P<.001) in terms of access patterns that were indicative of information-seeking patterns. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of Wikipedia medical article popularity could be a viable method for epidemiologic surveillance, as it provides important information about the reasons behind public attention and factors that sustain public interest in the long term. Moreover, Wikipedia users can potentially be directed to credible and valuable information sources that are linked with the most prominent articles.","output":"Assessing Public Interest Based on Wikipedia's Most Visited Medical Articles During the SARS-CoV-2 Outbreak: Search Trends Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Fear has always been closely linked to dentistry but it could be intensified by the objective risks imposed by the pandemic. The objective of this study was to determine the profile of the frightened dental patient during the COVID-19 pandemic and determine measures taken by dentists to reduce fear and increase security among their patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS An anonymous online survey was conducted between March 15 and April 15, 2021. The respondents were 2060 adult citizens of the Republic of Serbia. In addition to demographic data, data related to the COVID-19 pandemic, dental fear, and attitudes and fear of dental interventions during the ongoing pandemic were compiled. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics: the chi-square test and Pearson's coefficient. RESULTS Seventy percent of the respondents felt some level of fear of the ongoing pandemic, 50% felt fear of going to a dentist during the pandemic, 20% considered a dental office a hotspot for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and 43% would visit their dentist only in the case of emergency. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the attitudes and behavior of people pertaining to visits to dental offices. Identifying frightened patients and their opinions and fears at this challenging time would make it easier for dentists to include protocols in their everyday practice to increase a sense of security among their patients, such as implementing preventive measures in front of the patients, ensuring an empty waiting room, and providing telephone consultations.","output":"COVID-19: Another Cause of Dental Anxiety?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microorganisms are transmitted in hospitals mainly by contact, droplet, and airborne routes.

As at 18 December 2020, the continent reported 2,449,754 confirmed cases, 57,817 deaths and 2,073,214 recoveries. Urban cities in Africa have particularly suffered the brunt of coronavirus disease 2019 coupled with criticisms that the response strategies have largely been a one-size-fits-all approach. This article reviewed early evidence on urban health nexus with coronavirus disease 2019 preparedness and response in Africa. METHODS: A rapid scoping review of empirical and grey literature was done using data sources such as ScienceDirect, GoogleScholar, PubMed, HINARI and official websites of World Health Organization and Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. A total of 26 full articles (empirical studies, reviews and commentaries) were synthesised and analysed qualitatively based on predefined inclusion criteria on publication relevance and quality. RESULTS: Over 70% of the 26 articles reported on coronavirus disease 2019 response strategies across Africa; 27% of the articles reported on preparedness towards coronavirus disease 2019, while 38% reported on urbanisation nexus with coronavirus disease 2019; 40% of the publications were full-text empirical studies, while the remaining 60% were either commentaries, reviews or editorials. It was found that urban cities remain epicentres of coronavirus disease 2019 in Africa. Even though some successes have been recorded in Africa regarding coronavirus disease 2019 fight, the continents response strategies were largely found to be a one-size-fits-all approach. Consequently, adoption of Western elitist mitigating measures for coronavirus disease 2019 containment resulted in excesses and spillover effects on individuals, families and economies in Africa. CONCLUSION: Africa needs to increase commitment to health systems strengthening through context-specific interventions and prioritisation of pandemic preparedness over response. Likewise, improved economic resilience and proper urban planning will help African countries to respond better to future public health emergencies, as coronavirus disease 2019 cases continue to surge on the continent.","output":"Urban health nexus with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) preparedness and response in Africa: Rapid scoping review of the early evidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During early 2020, New York City became an epicenter for coronavirus disease 2019.

In this retrospective, single-center, observational study, we enrolled the initial 131 confirmed cases of COVID-19 at Jin-Yin-Tan Hospital who had at least one-time antibody tested during their hospitalization. The dynamic changes of IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein in 226 serum samples were detected by ELISA. The sensitivities of IgM and IgG ELISA detection were analyzed. Result showed that the sensitivity of the IgG ELISA detection (92.5%) was significantly higher than that of the IgM (70.8%) (P < 0.001). The meantimes of seroconversion for IgM and IgG were 6 days and 3 days, respectively. The IgM and IgG antibody levels peaked at around 18 days and 23 days, and then IgM fell to below the baseline level at about day 36, whereas IgG maintained at a relatively high level.

From February 14 to May 31, 2020, 29 patients: 23 men and 6 women, with an average age (SD) of 66.4 years (6,2) required tracheostomy. The average intensive care unit (ICU) stay was 36 days [31-56.5]. The average days on mechanical ventilation was 28,5 days (9.7). Mean time to tracheostomy was 15.2 days (9.5) with an average disconnection time after procedure of 11.3 days (7.4). The average hospital stay was 55 days [39-79]. A directly proportional relation between the number of days of MV and the number of days from ICU admission until tracheostomy showed a significant value of p = 0.008. For each day of delay in tracheostomy, the days of mechanical ventilation were increased by 0.6 days. There was no relation between days to tracheostomy and days to disconnection (p = 0.092).

The Chi-square test of independence was used to tabulate sex and age-related fatality ratios among deaths due to COVID-19-related complications. RESULTS: The drivers for COVID-19 spread were mass gatherings secondary to the countrys political landscape and repatriation of citizens from high-risk areas coupled with minimum use of public health interventions. The prevalence was higher in people aged 50C59 years, males and in urban areas. Men had an increased risk of COVID-19-related deaths (Case Fatality Ratio: 1.58 (95% CI 1.11C2.22) compared with women.

Drug repurposing, i.e., utilizing an approved drug for a different indication, offers a time- and cost-efficient alternative for making new (relevant) therapies available to physicians and patients. Considering given strategy, many approved and investigational antiviral compounds, alone or in various relevant combinations, used in the past to fight Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-1, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1, or Influenza viruses are being evaluated against the SARS-CoV-2. Triazavirin (TZV), a non-toxic broad--spectrum antiviral compound, is efficient against various strains of the Influenza A virus (Influenza Virus A, Orthomyxoviridae), i.e., swine flu (H1N1, or H3N2), avian influenza (H5N1, H5N2, H9N2, or highly pathogenic H7N3 strain), Influenza B virus (Influenza Virus B, Orthomyxoviridae), Respiratory Syncytial Virus (Orthopneumovirus, Pneumoviridae), Tick-Borne Encephalitis Virus (known as Forest-Spring Encephalitis Virus; Flavivirus, Flaviviridae), West Nile Virus (Flavivirus, Flavaviridae), Rift Valley Fever Virus (Phlebovirus, Bunyaviridae), and Herpes viruses (Simplexviruses, Herpesviridae) as well. In regard to COVID-19, the molecule probably reduced inflammatory reactions, thus limiting the damage to vital organs and reducing the need for therapeutic support, respectively. In addition, in silico computational methods indicated relatively satisfactory binding affinities of the TZV ligand to both structural (E)- and (S)-proteins, non-structural 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3-CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 as well as human angiotensin-I converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2). The interactions between TZV and given viral structures or the ACE-2 receptor for SARS-CoV-2 might effectively block both the entry of the pathogen into a host cell and its replication. Promising treatment patterns of COVID-19 positive patients might be also based on a suitable combination of a membrane fusion inhibitor (umifenovir, for example) with viral RNA synthesis and replication inhibitor (TZV).","output":"Triazavirin might be the new hope to fight Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To examine the ability of ras to activate signal transduction pathways in the absence of lipid modifications, fusion proteins were constructed that target ras(WT) or activated ras(61L) to cellular membranes as integral membrane proteins, using the first transmembrane domain of the E1 protein of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which contains a cis-Golgi targeting signal. Golgi-targeted derivatives of activated ras were completely inactive in transformation assays. However, when examined in focus formation assays, transformation of NIH3T3 cells were seen with derivatives of ras(61L) containing a mutated E1 targeting sequence that results in plasma membrane localization. Removal of the lipid modification sites in and upstream of the CAAX motif did not abrogate the transforming activity of plasma membrane-localized ras(61L) derivatives, indicating that these lipid modifications are not essential for ras activity, as long as the protein is correctly localized to the plasma membrane. Interestingly, the activity of integral membrane versions of ras(61L) was strictly dependent on a minimum distance between the transmembrane domain anchor region and the coding sequence of ras. Derivatives with only a 3-amino acid linker were inactive, while linkers of either 11- or 22-amino acids were sufficient to restore transforming activity. These results demonstrate that: (1) activated ras targeted to Golgi membranes is unable to cause transformation; (2) lipid modifications at the C-terminus are not required for the transforming activity of plasma membrane-anchored ras(61L) derivatives, and serve primarily a targeting function; (3) a transmembrane domain can effectively substitute for C-terminal modifications that would normally target ras to the inner surface of the plasma membrane, indicating that ras(61L) does not need to reversibly dissociate from the membrane as might be allowed by the normal lipidation; and (4) in order to function properly, there exists a critical distance that the ras protein must reside from the plasma membrane.","output":"Derivatives of activated H-ras lacking C-terminal lipid modifications retain transforming ability if targeted to the correct subcellular location"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The influence of bioinformatics is pervasive affecting many biological disciplines resulting in changes in biosciences globally but not so in, Nigeria as the course is never taught in any public tertiary institution.

A CT-based lung dystrophy severity score (DSS) has recently been proposed to predict recurrence following conservative therapy. This study compares the DSS in surgically and conservatively treated patients. METHODS This is a retrospective analysis of first episode PSP patients, comparing video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS; group A) to conservative treatment with or without chest drainage (group B). CT scans were reviewed for blebs or bullae, and patients were assigned DSS values and stratified into risk groups (low and high-grade). Primary end point was ipsilateral or contralateral recurrence. RESULTS Fifty-six patients were included, 33 received VATS and 23 conservative treatment. In total, 37.5 % experienced recurrence, with a 5-year estimated recurrence rate of 40.7 % (group A: 13.3 %; group B: 73.9 %; p < 0.001). In group B, detection of any dystrophic lesions resulted in significantly higher 5-year recurrence rates (86.7 vs. 50.0 %; p = 0.03), there was no significant difference in group A (17.7 vs. 7.7 %; p = 0.50). Greater DSS values correlated with higher 5-year recurrence rates in group B (p = 0.02), but not in group A (p = 0.90). Comparing low- and high-grade patients in group B resulted in a significant 5-year recurrence rate of 53.8 versus 100 % (p = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS The DSS is useful to indicate VATS after the first episode. For routine application, assigning patients to low- and high-grade groups seems most practical. We recommend CT-evaluation for every PSP patient and early surgery for those with lesions exceeding one bleb. After VATS, the preoperative DSS is not beneficial in predicting recurrence.","output":"First Episode of Spontaneous Pneumothorax: CT-based Scoring to Select Patients for Early Surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Future healthcare systems will rely heavily on clinical decision support systems (CDSS) to improve the decision-making processes of clinicians.

Nevertheless, there are still no kinetic studies on this interaction. Consequently, in the present study, we successfully constructed the human FcRn (hFcRn) electrochemical receptor sensor. The signal amplification system formed by chitosan nanogold-hFcRn protein and horseradish peroxidase was used to simulate the cell signal amplification system in vivo, and the kinetic effects between seven IgG and hFcRn receptors from different species were quantitatively measured. The results showed that the interaction of these seven IgGs with hFcRn was similar to the catalytic kinetics of enzyme and substrate, and there was a ligand-receptor saturation effect. The order of the interconnect allosteric constants (K(a)), which is similar to the Michaelis constant (K(m)), was human IgG < bovine IgG < horse IgG < rabbit IgG < sheep IgG < donkey IgG < quail IgY. The results showed that hFcRn had the strongest ability to transport human IgG, which was consistent with the evolution of the system. Therefore, our hFcRn electrochemical receptor sensor can be used to measure and evaluate the interconnected allosteric network.

Algorithms should raise an alarm and provide a position estimate only when a drone is present, while not issuing alarms on birds, nor being confused by the rest of the scene. In particular, three original approaches based on different deep learning strategies are proposed and compared on a real-world dataset provided by a consortium of universities and research centers, under the 2020 edition of the Drone vs. Bird Detection Challenge. Results show that there is a range in difficulty among different test sequences, depending on the size and the shape visibility of the drone in the sequence, while sequences recorded by a moving camera and very distant drones are the most challenging ones.

Viruses may play an important role in the disease, as they seem to activate the 2-5-linked oligoadenylate (2-5A) pathway of the innate antiviral immune system. Our aim was to investigate this possibility. METHODS: Innate antiviral immune pathways were searched for type 1 diabetes-associated polymorphisms using genome-wide association study data. SNPs within 250kb flanking regions of the transcription start site of 64 genes were examined. These pathways were also investigated for type 1 diabetes-associated RNA expression profiles using laser-dissected islets from two to five tissue sections per donor from the Diabetes Virus Detection (DiViD) study and the network of Pancreatic Organ Donors (nPOD). RESULTS: We found 27 novel SNPs in genes nominally associated with type 1 diabetes. Three of those SNPs were located upstream of the 2-5A pathway, namely SNP rs4767000 (p = 1.03  10(?9), OR 1.123), rs1034687 (p = 2.16  10(?7), OR 0.869) and rs739744 (p = 1.03  10(?9), OR 1.123). We also identified a large group of dysregulated islet genes in relation to type 1 diabetes, of which two were novel. The most aberrant genes were a group of IFN-stimulated genes. Of those, the following distinct pathways were targeted by the dysregulation (compared with the non-diabetic control group): OAS1 increased by 111% (p < 1.00  10(?4), 95% CI ?0.43, ?0.15); MX1 increased by 142% (p < 1.00  10(?4), 95% CI ?0.52, ?0.22); and ISG15 increased by 197% (p = 2.00  10(?4), 95% CI ?0.68, ?0.18).

METHOD: A scoping review, based on the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines, was carried out between December 2019 and May 2020. The studies included male and female health professionals, who wore PPE during the global pandemic, in any given scenario. Headings and abstracts were analysed. Two independent investigators reviewed the full text. RESULTS: Eight publications were included. All of them focused on preventing pressure ulcers (PU) caused by PPE. Hygiene, hydration and the use of skin barriers were highlighted as preventive measures. There were different views around the type of humectant/skin barrier recommended to avoid skin damage. CONCLUSION: More studies identifying the most suitable strategies to maintain health professionals' skin integrity during the covid-19 pandemic are needed.","output":"Prevencin de lesiones cutneas causadas por productos y equipos de proteccin personal durante COVID-19: revisin de alcance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diarrhea occurs in 2-50% of cases of COVID-19 (8% is average across series). The diarrhea does not appear to account for the disease mortality and its contribution to the morbidity has not been defined, even though it is a component of Long Covid or post-infectious aspects of the disease. Even less is known about the pathophysiologic mechanism of the diarrhea. To begin to understand the pathophysiology of COVID-19 diarrhea, we exposed human enteroid monolayers obtained from five healthy subjects and made from duodenum, jejunum, and proximal colon to live SARS-CoV-2 and virus like particles (VLPs) made from exosomes expressing SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins (Spike, Nucleocapsid, Membrane and Envelope). Results: 1) Live virus was exposed apically for 90 min, then washed out and studied 2 and 5 days later. SARS-Cov-2 was taken up by enteroids and live virus was present in lysates and in the apical>>basolateral media of polarized enteroids 48 h after exposure. This is the first demonstration of basolateral appearance of live virus after apical exposure. High vRNA concentration was detected in cell lysates and in the apical and basolateral media up to 5 days after exposure. 2) Two days after viral exposure, cytokine measurements of media showed significantly increased levels of IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1. 3) Two days after viral exposure, mRNA levels of ACE2, NHE3 and DRA were reduced but there was no change in mRNA of CFTR. NHE3 protein was also decreased. 4) Live viral studies were mimicked by some studies with VLP exposure for 48 h. VLPs with Spike-D614G bound to the enteroid apical surface and was taken up; this resulted in decreased mRNA levels of ACE2, NHE3, DRA and CFTR. 4) VLP effects were determined on active anion secretion measured with the Ussing chamber/voltage clamp technique. S-D614G acutely exposed to apical surface of human ileal enteroids did not alter the short-circuit current (Isc). However, VLPS-D614G exposure to enteroids that were pretreated for 24 h with IL-6 plus IL-8 induced a concentration dependent increase in Isc indicating stimulated anion secretion, that was delayed in onset by 8 min. The anion secretion was inhibited by apical exposure to a specific calcium activated Cl channel (CaCC) inhibitor (AO1) but not by a specific CFTR inhibitor (BP027); was inhibited by basolateral exposure to the K channel inhibit clortimazole; and was prevented by pretreatment with the calcium buffer BAPTA-AM. 5) The calcium dependence of the VLP-induced increase in Isc was studied in Caco-2/BBe cells stably expressing the genetically encoded Ca2+ sensor GCaMP6s. 24 h pretreatment with IL-6/IL-8 did not alter intracellular Ca2+. However, in IL-6/IL-8 pretreated cells, VLP S-D614G caused appearance of Ca2+waves and an overall increase in intracellular Ca2+ with a delay of 10 min after VLP addition. We conclude that the diarrhea of COVID-19 appears to an example of a calcium dependent inflammatory diarrhea that involves both acutely stimulated Ca2+ dependent anion secretion (stimulated Isc) that involves CaCC and likely inhibition of neutral NaCl absorption (decreased NHE3 protein and mRNA and decreased DRA mRNA).","output":"SARS-COV-2 induced Diarrhea is inflammatory, Ca2+ Dependent and involves activation of calcium activated Cl channels"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 requires significant decision making and procedural planning. Use of tracheostomy can facilitate weaning from ventilation and potentially increase the availability of much needed intensive care unit (ICU) beds, however this being a high aerosol generating procedure it does put the health care worker to risk of transmission. Here we present our experience and protocols for performing tracheostomy in COVID-19 positive patients. Eleven tracheostomies were performed in COIVD-19 patients over a period of 2 months (MayCJune 2020) at this tertiary care hospital dedicated to manage COVID patients. All patients underwent open surgical tracheostomy, the specific indication, preoperative protocols, surgical steps and precautions taken have been discussed. Tracheostomy was done not before 10 days after initiation of mechanical ventilation. Patients cardiovascular vitals should show recovery with some spontaneous effort. There should be reduction in need for FiO(2) and ventilator requirements. Of total 11 tracheostomies performed only one patient had post procedure bleeding which was controlled conservatively. We have summarized our experience in performing tracheostomies in 11 such patients. Our guidelines and recommendations on tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic are presented in this study. We suggest tracheostomies to be done after 10 days of intubation with precautions and given indications with the idea of early weaning off of patient from ventilator and more availability of ICU beds which is already overwhelmed by patient load.","output":"Our Experience of Tracheostomy in COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is a proven method to treat large vessel occlusions in acute anterior circulation stroke. We compared the technical, imaging, and clinical outcomes of MT performed with either TREVO or Capture LP devices. METHODS There were 42 and 43 patients in the TREVO and Capture LP groups, respectively. Baseline variables, technical outcome (Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction, TICI), 24 hours imaging outcome, and 3-month clinical outcome (modified Rankin Scale, mRS) were prospectively recorded. The patients were stratified according to clot location, groups compared, and logistic regression models devised to study the effect of device selection on the clinical outcome. RESULTS The technical success rates were equal in both proximal (internal carotid artery and proximal M1 segment) and distal occlusions (distal M1 and M2 segments). The proportion of TICI 2b or 3 was 96% and 87% with TREVO and 87% and 89% with Capture LP (p=0.25 and p=0.80, respectively). Device selection did not significantly predict good clinical outcome (mRS 2) in either proximal or distal occlusions. In multivariate analysis, selecting Capture LP borderline significantly increased the odds of an excellent outcome close to sixfold both in proximal and distal occlusions (OR 6.7, 95% CI 0.82 to 53.7, p=0.08 and OR 5.7, 95% CI 0.88 to 37.8, p=0.07, respectively). CONCLUSIONS TREVO and Capture LP perform equally well in proximal and distal occlusions in the anterior circulation when technical and good clinical outcome are considered. Capture LP may have a small advantage in reaching mRS 1 at 3 months. However, this needs to be confirmed in a randomized study.","output":"TREVO and Capture LP have equal technical success rates in mechanical thrombectomy of proximal and distal anterior circulation occlusions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In literature and education policies, the teaching of English using remote learning strategies is recommended, but for the most part, some teachers are not pedagogically capacitated to teach their respective subjects using technology in South Africa. To explore the experiences of such teachers, this study sought to understand the models and pedagogical initiatives on the teaching of English through remote teaching and learning. Emergency remote teaching is one of the initiatives taken by resilient English teachers in resource-constrained township secondary schools in South Africa, during and after the COVID-19 outbreak. An interpretive, qualitative case study predicated on a constructivist framework was undertaken to explore how English teachers use remote learning strategies in teaching English as a second language in township secondary schools in Gauteng. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews (phone calls) and collecting documents in the form of class worksheet texts and homework activities produced and used by learners during remote learning. Data were analysed using an inductive thematic framework to answer the key research question: What are the digital pedagogic initiatives and strategies used by resilient English teachers to support learners during remote learning? Findings of the study indicate that collaboration, networking, social media communication and other digital literacy practices are teacher initiatives leading to the utilisation of digital connection platforms for socialisation, teaching and learning. Findings emphasise that English teachers should use distance learning, blended learning, mobile learning and online learning as strategies in times of crisis and in resource-constrained environments to help learners achieve their outcomes. Conclusions drawn support the fact that focusing on digital literacies in the English classroom supports proficiency in the use of the language. Participation in online learning programmes and utilisation of digital platforms provide learning opportunities for English learners in resource-constrained secondary schools. Learners eventually improve digital writing and reading skills when they participate in selected remote learning platforms. ? 2021 University of Pretoria.

Recently, two antiviral drugs have shown to be effective in reducing hospitalizations in clinical trials. In the present work, we use an agent-based mathematical model to assess the potential population impact of the use of antiviral treatments in four countries, corresponding to four current levels of vaccination coverage: Kenya, Mexico, United States (US) and Belgium, with 1.5, 38, 57 and 74% of their populations vaccinated. For each location, we varied antiviral coverage and antiviral effect in reducing viral load (25, 50, 75 or 100% reduction). Irrespective of location, widespread antiviral treatment of symptomatic infections (50% coverage) is expected to prevent the majority of COVID-19 deaths. Furthermore, even treating 20% of adult symptomatic infections, is expected to reduce mortality by a third in all countries, irrespective of the assumed treatment efficacy in reducing viral load. Our results suggest that early antiviral treatment is needed to mitigate transmission, with early treatment (within two days of symptoms) preventing 50% more infections compared to late treatment (started on days 3 to 5 after developing symptoms). Our results highlight the synergistic effect of vaccination and antiviral treatment: as vaccination rate increased, antiviral treatment had a bigger impact on overall transmission. These results suggest that antiviral treatments can become a strategic tool that, in combination with vaccination, can significantly control SASRS-CoV-2 transmission and reduce COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths.","output":"The role of antiviral treatment in curbing the COVID-19 pandemic: a modeling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Australian women's alcohol consumption has increased in frequency during COVID-19. Research suggests this is to cope with stress resulting from the pandemic and COVID-19 countermeasures that require social distancing. This is a critical public health concern because increased alcohol consumption, even for a short period, increases the myriad longer-term health risks associated with cumulative exposure to alcohol. This paper provides unique qualitative evidence of how health risk perceptions are re-focused toward the shorter-term during the pandemic, through analysis of interviews with 40 middle-aged Australian women (aged 45C64) representing a range of self-perceived drinking status' (occasional/light/moderate/heavy) before and then during the pandemic (n = 80 interviews). Our analysis captures women's risk horizons drifting away from the uncertain longer-term during COVID-19, toward the immediate need to get through the pandemic. We show how COVID-19 has increased the perceived value of consuming alcohol among women, particularly when weighed up against the social and emotional costs of reducing consumption. Our findings have implications for the delivery of alcohol-related health risk messages designed for middle-aged women both during, and into the recovery phases of the pandemic, who already consume more alcohol and experience more alcohol-related health risk than women in other age groups.","output":"Alcohol Consumption and Perceptions of Health Risks During COVID-19: A Qualitative Study of Middle-Aged Women in South Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The study sought to assess the fear of COVID-19 among the general population and suggested ways to reduce anxiety levels.

Aberrant expression of apolipoproteins is associated with metabolic abnormalities. Here we characterized apolipoprotein D (apoD) in triglyceride metabolism. Unlike canonical apolipoproteins that are mainly produced in the liver, apoD is an atypical apolipoprotein with broad tissue distribution. We show that circulating apoD is present mainly in HDL and, to a lesser extent, in LDL and VLDL and that its plasma levels were reduced in db/db mice with visceral obesity and altered lipid metabolism. Elevated apoD production, derived from adenovirus-mediated gene transfer, resulted in significant reduction in plasma triglyceride levels in mice. This effect was attributable to en-hanced LPL activity and improved catabolism of triglyceride-rich particles. In contrast, VLDL triglyceride production remained unchanged in response to elevated apoD production. These findings were recapitulated in high-fat-induced obese mice. Obese mice with elevated apoD production exhibited significantly improved triglyceride profiles, correlating with increased plasma LPL activity and enhanced postprandial fat tolerance. ApoD was shown to promote LPL-mediated hydrolysis of VLDL in vitro, correlating with its TG-lowering action in vivo. Apolipoprotein D plays a significant role in lipid metabolism.

The metal in situ growth is a common strategy to enhance the sensitivity of AuNP-ICA due to its superior signal amplification potential and simple operation. However, the detection distortion caused by metal self-nucleation during the growth process can seriously affect the accuracy and reproducibility of the strips. Methods: We present a pH-regulated gold in situ growth (GISG) strategy to amplify the colorimetric signal and demonstrate its application in improving the performance of traditional AuNP-ICA. The controllable growth signal amplification is achieved by lowering the pH of the growth solution to weaken the reducibility of hydroxylamine (HA), thus urging the crystallization and growth of Au(3+) on the AuNP surface instead of free reduction and self-nucleation. In addition, the mechanism of pH regulation on HA reducibility is elucidated by introducing an electron-donating or electron-withdrawing group to affect the electron density of hydroxyl group. Results: The proposed GISG strategy shows improved sensitivity, low background, robust operation, and good reproducibility. The LOD values of the designed GISG-amplified AuNP-ICA are as low as 0.0198 ng mL(-1) for hepatitis B surface antigen and 0.0125 ng mL(-1) for HIV-1 capsid p24 antigen, which are lower by about 500- and 70-fold, respectively, than those of the unamplified AuNP-ICA.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review of English-language articles related to telehealth in rheumatology was conducted on MEDLINE/PubMed, Web Of Science and Scopus. The strength of the evidence was graded using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach as well as the Oxford Levels of Evidence. The recommendations were developed using a modified Delphi technique to establish consensus. RESULTS: Three overarching principles and 13 recommendations were developed based on identified literature and consensus agreement. The overarching principles address telemedicine frameworks, decision-making, and modality. Recommendations 1-4 address patient suitability, triage, and when telemedicine should be offered to patients. Recommendations 5-10 cover the procedure, including the means, data safety, fail-safe mechanisms, and treat-to-target approach. Recommendations 11-13 focus on training and education related to telerheumatology. CONCLUSION: These recommendations provide guidance for the approach and use of telemedicine in rheumatology care to guide highest possible standards of clinical care and to enable equitable patient reach.

Blood, jejunal mucosa, intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) and lamina propria T lymphocyte (LPL) were harvested from suckling piglets at d 14, 17, 21, 28 and 35 of age and weaning piglets on d 0, 3, 7, 14 and wd 0, wd 3, wd 7, wd 14 and wd 21). The results showed that compared with the wd 0, early weaning significantly declined the average daily gain of postweaning 0-7 (wd 0-7) (P < 0.05), and jejunal villus height on wd 3 (P < 0.05), as well as increased the jejunal crypt depth of piglets on wd 7, 14 and 21 (P < 0.05). And there were no significant differences in average daily gain and villus height after suckling (P > 0.05).

And the serum interleukin-4 (IL-4) levels were increased at wd 14, wd 21, but the mucosa IL-4 concentration was strikingly increased on wd 7 (P < 0.05). Moreover, weaning led to the enhanced levels of interleukin-1b (IL-1b), interleukin-2 (IL-2) and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) in serum (P < 0.05), as well as declined the levels of sIL-2R in jejunal mucosa at wd 3 (P < 0.05). In suckling piglets, the serum immunoglobulin A (IgA), IL-4 and IL-2 levels were increased with increasing age (P < 0.05), whereas the jejunal mucosa IL-1b and serum sIL-2R levels were lower (P < 0.05). Furthermore, significantly lower CD4 percentage in peripheral blood T lymphocyte subsets were found at wd 3 and wd 7 (P < 0.05), whereas the CD8 percentage in peripheral blood T lymphocyte subsets were enhanced on wd 3 and wd 7 than wd 0 (P < 0.05). Moreover, the weaning piglets at wd 3 had a lower CD4/CD8 ratio than wd 0 (P < 0.05).

As an effort to control the disease spread, the Indian government declared a nationwide lockdown on March 25th, 2020. As dental treatment was considered high risk in the spread of COVID-19, dentistry became one of the most vulnerable professions during this time. Dental professionals had to face job layoffs, salary cuts in professional colleges, closure of private clinics resulting in huge psychological, moral, and financial crises. Studies during the previous and present pandemics have shown mental issues among health care workers necessitating institutional reforms, along with early care and support. A balance in the work-life amongst professionals is the key to better efficiency and, was majorly affected during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown due to sudden unexpected changes. Hence this study was conducted to understand the changes they underwent both at home and professional front with a hypothesis that physical and mental health, activities, relationship status, and workplace influence the work-life balance. METHODS: A pre-validated questionnaire survey was done on dentists across India. Structural Equation Modelling and path analysis were applied to the data collected. RESULTS: The results of the study supported the hypothesis that factors like physical and mental health, activities, relationship status, and workplace influenced the work-life balance directly. A significant imbalance was seen amongst the female dentists. CONCLUSION: The present study proved the unpreparedness among dental professionals.

DESIGN: Prospective quality improvement initiative. SETTING: Two long\\\\term chronic care campuses within a large academic healthcare organization. PARTICIPANTS: LTC residents with activated healthcare proxies who lacked DNH directives based on documentation in the electronic medical record (EMR) as of April 13, 2020. INTERVENTION: Using a structured discussion guide, trained healthcare staff from various disciplines contacted the residents' proxies to conduct COVID\\\\19 focused ACP discussions. Residents without DNH directives with COVID\\\\19 were prioritized. Preferences ascertained in the discussion were communicated to the residents' primary care teams and directives were updated in the EMR accordingly. MEASUREMENTS: Residents who acquired a new DNH directive during the study initiative were determined using the EMR. Subsequent changes in DNH orders, hospitalizations, and deaths were ascertained by retrospective chart review from the date of new DNH through August 5, 2020. RESULTS: At baseline, 315/581 (54%) of LTC residents did not have a DNH directive. Their mean age was 87 (9) years and 70% were female. Following ACP discussions, 124/315 (39%) of residents acquired a new DNH directive. Among residents with new DNH directives, 65/124 (52%) were diagnosed with COVID\\\\19 from April 2, 2020 to May 21, 2020.

SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two other coronaviruses that caused disease epidemic breakouts in humans in the last 2 decades, namely, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The similarities have enabled the scientists to apply the basic scientific discoveries garnered from studying the structure and modus operandi of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV to develop therapies that specifically target SARS-CoV-2 and to develop vaccines to prevent COVID-19. Targeted therapies, including the use of antibodies to prevent virus entry, nucleotide analogues to prevent viral replication, and inhibitors of proteases to prevent virion formation, among others, are being tested for their clinical efficacy. Likewise, complete sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 and identification of its structural and non-structural proteins have enabled development of RNA-, DNA-, and peptide -based vaccines as well attenuated viral vaccines to instigate the host immune responses. The clinical impacts of the basic science discoveries are amply evident on the rapid pace of progress in developing specific anti-viral therapies and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.

The 2H6-antigen binding fragment (Fab) forms a multimeric complex with the NS1 RNA-binding domain (RBD). T49, a residue which forms a direct hydrogen bond with double stranded RNA, in NS1 protein was found to be critical for its interaction with 2H6 antibody. NS1(RBD) has high affinity to 2H6 with K(D) of 43.5  4.24 nM whereas NS1(RBD)-T49A has more than 250 times lower affinity towards 2H6. Interestingly, the intracellular expression of 2H6-single-chain variable fragment (scFv) in mammalian cells caused a reduction in viral growth and the M1 viral protein level was significantly reduced in 2H6-scFv transfected cells in comparison to vector transfected cells at 12 h post infection. These results indicate that the tight binding of 2H6 to NS1 could lead to reduction in viral replication and release of progeny virus.

So, in-depth features of the ECG signals are extracted and captured from the suggested parallel 2-channel structure of 1-dimensional CNN network and 2-dimensional CNN network and then combined by feature fusion technique for more dependable classification results. Besides, Grid Search Optimized-Deep Neural Network (GSO-DNN) is adopted for higher classification accuracy.

In a multi-institutional study, all adult patients who tested positive for COVID-19 across five hospitals were identified and included from March 6th to April 16th, 2020. Hospitalization, intubation, and death were evaluated for association with blood type. Univariate analysis was conducted using standard techniques and logistic regression was used to determine the independent effect of blood type on intubation and/or death and positive testing. During the study period, there were 7648 patients who received COVID-19 testing throughout the institutions. Of these, 1289 tested positive with a known blood type. A total of 484 (37.5%) were admitted to hospital, 123 (9.5%) were admitted to the ICU, 108 (8.4%) were intubated, 3 (0.2%) required ECMO, and 89 (6.9%) died. Of the 1289 patients who tested positive, 440 (34.2%) were blood type A, 201 (15.6%) were blood type B, 61 (4.7%) were blood type AB, and 587 (45.5%) were blood type O. On univariate analysis, there was no association between blood type and any of the peak inflammatory markers (peak WBC, p = 0.25; peak LDH, p = 0.40; peak ESR, p = 0.16; peak CRP, p = 0.14) nor between blood type and any of the clinical outcomes of severity (admission p = 0.20, ICU admission p = 0.94, intubation p = 0.93, proning while intubated p = 0.58, ECMO p = 0.09, and death p = 0.49).

Blood type A had no correlation with positive testing (AOR: 1.00, CI: 0.88-1.13), blood type B was associated with higher odds of testing positive for disease (AOR: 1.28, CI: 1.08-1.52), AB was also associated with higher odds of testing positive (AOR: 1.37, CI: 1.02-1.83), and O was associated with a lower risk of testing positive (AOR: 0.84, CI: 0.75-0.95). Rh+ status was associated with higher odds of testing positive (AOR: 1.23, CI: 1.003-1.50). Blood type was not associated with risk of intubation or death in patients with COVID-19. Patients with blood types B and AB who received a test were more likely to test positive and blood type O was less likely to test positive.

The apparent inability of RNA viral replicons to infect contemporary akaryotic species suggests an early origin of RNA viruses and their subsequent loss in akaryotes. A census of virion morphotypes reveals that advanced forms were unique to viruses infecting a specific supergroup, while simpler forms were observed in viruses infecting organisms in all forms of cellular life. Results hint toward an ancient origin of viruses from an ancestral virus harboring either filamentous or spherical virions. Finally, phylogenetic trees built from protein domain and tRNA structures in thousands of genomes suggest that viruses evolved via reductive evolution from ancient cells.

METHODS: One hundred and sixty-four first-year college students answered twice-weekly questionnaires assessing stress exposure and perception, sleep duration, and sleep quality from January until May, 2020 (N=4,269 unique observations). RESULTS: Multilevel growth modeling revealed that prior to distance learning, student stress was increasing and sleep duration and quality were decreasing. After transitioning online, students stress exposure and perception trajectories immediately and continuously decreased; sleep quality initially increased but decreased over time; and sleep duration increased but then plateaued for the remainder of the semester. Days with higher stress exposure than typical for that student were associated with lower sleep quality, and both higher stress exposure and perception at the transition were linked with simultaneous lower sleep quality. Specific groups (e.g., females) were identified as at-risk for stress and sleep problems. CONCLUSION: Although transitioning to remote learning initially alleviated college students stress and improved sleep, these effects plateaued, and greater exposure to academic, financial, and interpersonal stressors predicted worse sleep quality on both daily and average levels. Environmental stressors may particularly dictate sleep quality during times of transition, but adaptations in learning modalities may help mitigate short-term detrimental health outcomes during global emergencies, even during a developmental period with considerable stress vulnerability. Future studies should examine longer-term implications of these trajectories on mental and physical health.","output":"Stress and Sleep Across the Onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Impact of Distance Learning on U.S. College Students Health Trajectories"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim Nutrition is the leading cause of chronic disease globally, yet it is unknown how much nutritional education GP trainees receive.

Much less is known about humans' ability to deploy such alpha lateralization in time, and to thus exploit alpha power as a spatio-temporal filter. Here we show that spatially lateralized alpha power does signify - beyond the direction of spatial attention - the distribution of attention in time and thereby qualifies as a spatio-temporal attentional filter. Participants (Na?=a?20) selectively listened to spoken numbers presented on one side (left vs right), while competing numbers were presented on the other side. Key to our hypothesis, temporal foreknowledge was manipulated via a visual cue, which was either instructive and indicated the to-be-probed number position (70% valid) or neutral. Temporal foreknowledge did guide participants' attention, as they recognized numbers from the to-be-attended side more accurately following valid cues. In the magnetoencephalogram (MEG), spatial attention to the left versus right side induced lateralization of alpha power in all temporal cueing conditions. Modulation of alpha lateralization at the 0.8-Hz presentation rate of spoken numbers was stronger following instructive compared to neutral temporal cues. Critically, we found stronger modulation of lateralized alpha power specifically at the onsets of temporally cued numbers. These results suggest that the precisely timed hemispheric lateralization of alpha power qualifies as a spatio-temporal attentional filter mechanism susceptible to top-down behavioural goals.","output":"Orienting auditory attention in time: Lateralized alpha power reflects spatio-temporal filtering"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study is to examine how content about the global coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak changed in the Japanese information environment through a c","output":"Suspicion Begets Idle Fearsa an Analysis of COVID-19 Related Topics in Japanese Media and Twitter"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) is a novel virus that has caused over 28 million cases worldwide and over 900,000 deaths since early 2020, rightfully being classified as a pandemic. COVID-19 is diagnosed via PCR testing which looks at cycle threshold values of two genes, N2 and E. This study examined cycle threshold values of COVID-positive patients at the VA hospital in Reno as well as other lab values and co-morbidities to determine if any could aid clinicians in predicting the need for hospitalization and higher levels of care. Multiple variables, including N2 cycle threshold (CT) value, absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), D-dimer, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen and ferritin were evaluated for potential associations with N2 CT value as well as required level of care (based on WHO ordinal score). The results suggest that patients with a N2 cycle threshold value less than 34 are 4 times more likely to have WHO ordinal scores of 4-8 (p=0.0021) while controlling for age and comorbidities (DM, cardiac, kidney and lung disease). Patients of age of 55 or greater were 15.18 times more likely to have WHO ordinal scores of 4-8 (p=0.012) controlling for N2 CT value and co-morbidities. Furthermore, patients with ALC less than 1 were 5.88 times more likely to have WHO ordinal score of 4-8 (p= 0.00024). N2 cycle threshold values also appear to be associated with many commonly obtained markers such as absolute lymphocyte count, white blood cell count, C-reactive protein and D-dimer. Patients with N2 CT values less than 34 were 3.49 times more likely to have ALC values less than 1, controlling for age and comorbidities (p=0.0072) while patients 55 or older were 6.66 times more likely to have ALC less than 1 (p=0.027). Finally, this study confirms previous conclusions that patients with advanced age had more severe infections and thus will likely require higher levels of care.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Sutures were prepared using standard techniques for sutured renorrhaphy during partial nephrectomy. Tested systems included knot/Hem-o-Lok?, Lapra-Ty?/Hem-o-Lok and Hem-o-Lok/Hem-o-Lok combinations. The saline filled tank was maintained at 37C. Vicryl?, Stratafix? polyglycolic acid-polycaprolactone or V-Loc? 180 sutures were suspended at 4 or 2 N. Suture material breakage or slippage was considered failure. RESULTS At 4 N 20% of sutures terminated with knot/Hem-o-Lok failed by 3 weeks compared to 56% and 100% terminated with Lapra-Ty/Hem-o-Lok and Hem-o-Lok/Hem-o-Lok, respectively (p <0.0001). The 55% and 100% of failures with Lapra-Ty/Hem-o-Lok and Hem-o-Lok/Hem-o-Lok, respectively, were generally due to slippage vs 11% with knot/Hem-o-Lok (p <0.0001). Overall failure rates with Lapra-Ty/Hem-o-Lok for zero to 4-zero sutures were 41% with Vicryl, 82% with polyglycolic acid-polycaprolactone and 24% with V-Loc 180 (p <0.0001). The only sutures without failure at 4 N with Lapra-Ty/Hem-o-Lok and knot/Hem-o-Lok closure systems were Vicryl zero, and V-Loc 2-zero and 3-zero. At 2 N Lapra-Ty/Hem-o-Lok failure (17.5% vs 0%, p = 0.039) and Hem-o-Lok/Hem-o-Lok failure (39% vs 16%, p = 0.074) were more common with polyglycolic acid-polycaprolactone than with V-Loc sutures. CONCLUSION Hem-o-Lok/Hem-o-Lok and Lapra-Ty/Hem-o-Lok combinations resulted in more frequent failures at 3 weeks or greater than knot/Hem-o-Lok. For all sutures tested knots were superior to Lapra-Tys to backstop Hem-o-Loks at 4 N. Preferably, Vicryl zero or V-Loc 2-zero/3-zero sutures should be used in combination with knots or Lapra-Tys at 4 N. Under these experimental conditions the Lapra-Ty/Hem-o-Lok combination did not reliably suspend the other sutures tested for 3 weeks. If Lapra-Ty/Hem-o-Lok or Hem-o-Lok/Hem-o-Lok combinations are used, we recommend closure at lesser tension and/or the use of appropriate sutures.","output":"Functional Duration of Closure Systems Used in Partial Nephrectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The continuous expansion of nosocomial infections around the globe has become a precarious situation. Key challenges include mounting dissemination of multiple resistances to antibiotics, the easy transmission and the growing mortality rates of hospital-acquired bacterial diseases. Thus, new ways to rapidly detect these infections are vital. Consequently, researchers around the globe pursue innovative approaches for point-of-care devices. In many cases the specific interaction of an antigen and a corresponding antibody is pivotal. However, the knowledge about suitable antigens is lacking. The aim of this study was to identify novel antigens as specific diagnostic markers. Additionally, these proteins might be aptly used for the generation of vaccines to improve current treatment options. Hence, a cDNA-based expression library was constructed and screened via microarrays to detect novel antigens of Klebsiella pneumoniae, a prominent agent of nosocomial infections well-known for its extensive antibiotics resistance, especially by extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). After screening 1536 clones, 14 previously unknown immunogenic proteins were identified. Subsequently, each protein was expressed in full-length and its immunodominant character examined by ELISA and microarray analyses. Consequently, six proteins were selected for epitope mapping and three thereof possessed linear epitopes. After specificity analysis, homology survey and 3d structural modelling, one epitope sequence GAVVALSTTFA of KPN_00363, an ion channel protein, was identified harboring specificity for K. pneumoniae. The remaining epitopes showed ambiguous results regarding the specificity for K. pneumoniae. The approach adopted herein has been successfully utilized to discover novel antigens of Campylobacter jejuni and Salmonella enterica antigens before. Now, we have transferred this knowledge to the key nosocomial agent, K. pneumoniae.

Social distancing measures complicate regular care and result in lifestyle changes, which may indirectly cause psychological stress and worsening of PD symptoms. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with increased psychological distress and decreased physical activity in PD, how these changes related to PD motor and non-motor symptom severity, and what frequency and burden of COVID-related stressors were. METHODS: We sent an online survey to the Personalized Parkinson Project (PPP) cohort (n = 498 PD patients) in the Netherlands. In the survey, we distinguished between COVID-related stressor load, psychological distress, PD symptom severity, and physical activity. We related inter-individual differences to personality factors and clinical factors collected before the pandemic occurred. RESULTS: 358 PD patients completed the survey between April 21 and May 25, 2020 (response rate 71.9%). Patients with higher COVID-related stressor load experienced more PD symptoms, and this effect was mediated by the degree of psychological distress. 46.6% of PD patients were less physically active since the COVID-19 pandemic, and reduced physical activity correlated with worse PD symptoms. Symptoms that worsened most were rigidity, fatigue, tremor, pain and concentration. Presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms (anxiety, depression) before the pandemic, as well as cognitive dysfunction and several personality traits predicted increased psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Our findings show how an external stressor (the COVID-19 pandemic) leads to a worsening of PD symptoms by evoking psychological distress as well as lifestyle changes (reduced physical activity).","output":"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Psychological Distress, Physical Activity, and Symptom Severity in Parkinsons Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The clinical manifestation of the recent pandemic COVID-19, caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, varies from mild to severe respiratory illness.

A number of mechanisms have been proposed as potential drivers of this association, which were, however, up until recently based rather on speculation than on investigational evidence. It has been recently come to light that the development of insulin resistance in the frame of COVID-19 is likely the driving force behind the development of overt hyperglycemia. This results through the infectious insult of the adipose tissue, and is observed in conjunction with aberrant adipokine secretion by host adipocytes, such as decreased adiponectin, as well as a switch towards an antiviral immune secretory profile. These data could have a considerable relevance not only for the management of hyperglycemia in the course of the infection but also for the overall understanding of the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 adipose tissue infection and hyperglycemia: A further step towards the understanding of severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND In the last few decades, endoscopic treatment of early neoplastic lesions in the esophagus has established itself as a valid and less invasive alternative to surgical resection. Endoscopic resection (ER) is the cornerstone of endoscopic therapy. Next to the curative potential of ER, by removing neoplastic lesions, ER may also serve as a diagnostic tool. The relatively large tissue specimens obtained with ER enable accurate histological staging of a lesion, allowing for optimal decision-making for further patient management. ER was pioneered in Japan, mainly for the resection of gastric lesions and squamous esophageal neoplasia, and also Western countries have been increasingly implementing ER in the treatment of early gastroesophageal neoplasia, mostly associated with Barrett's esophagus (BE). In BE, however, there is still a risk of metachronous lesions in the remainder of the Barrett's after focal ER. Additional treatment of all Barrett's mucosa is therefore advised. Currently, the most effective method for this is by using radiofrequency ablation (RFA). This review will provide an overview of indications for ER and RFA. Key Messages and Conclusions: Endoscopic management of early esophageal neoplasia is a safe and valid alternative to surgery and is nowadays the treatment of choice. ER is the mainstay of endoscopic management of early esophageal neoplasia since it allows for removal of neoplastic lesions and provides a large tissue specimen for histological evaluation. In case of early neoplasia in BE, focal ER should be complemented by eradication of the remaining Barrett's mucosa. RFA has proven to be a safe and effective modality to achieve complete eradication of Barrett's mucosa.","output":"Endoscopic Resection and Radiofrequency Ablation for Early Esophageal Neoplasia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current treatments for pneumonia (PNA) are focused on the pathogens. Mortality from PNA-induced acute lung injury (PNA-ALI) remains high, underscoring the need for additional therapeutic targets. Clinical and experimental evidence exists for potential sex differences in PNA survival, with males having higher mortality. In a model of severe pneumococcal PNA, when compared with male mice, age-matched female mice exhibited enhanced resolution characterized by decreased alveolar and lung inflammation and increased numbers of Tregs. Recognizing the critical role of Tregs in lung injury resolution, we evaluated whether improved outcomes in female mice were due to estradiol (E2) effects on Treg biology. E2 promoted a Treg-suppressive phenotype in vitro and resolution of PNA in vivo. Systemic rescue administration of E2 promoted resolution of PNA in male mice independent of lung bacterial clearance. E2 augmented Treg expression of Foxp3, CD25, and GATA3, an effect that required ER, and not ER, signaling. Importantly, the in vivo therapeutic effects of E2 were lost in Treg-depleted mice (Foxp3(DTR) mice). Adoptive transfer of ex vivo E2-treated Tregs rescued Streptococcus pneumoniaeCinduce PNA-ALI, a salutary effect that required Treg ER expression. E2/ER was required for Tregs to control macrophage proinflammatory responses. Our findings support the therapeutic role for E2 in promoting resolution of lung inflammation after PNA via ER Tregs.","output":"Estradiol resolves pneumonia via ER in regulatory T cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is a privilege to be Editor-in-Chief of the Annual Review of Applied Linguistics in 2020 as it celebrates its 40th year This is my fifth issue as Editor I will begin this short introduction by paying tribute, with the help of Bill Grabe (Northern Arizona University), to the founding editor of the journal, Robert Kaplan (1929C2020) Without Robert Kaplan, none of us would be reading these pages We will then turn to some comments from each of the previous editors on a few of the highlights of their time editing the journal, along with words for the future After this, I will describe some recent updates, go through a few of the historical successes of the journal, and then turn to the contents of the exciting current issue, Looking back and moving ahead ","output":"The Annual Review of Applied Linguistics at 40: Looking Back and Moving Ahead"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The advantages of using electron microscopy for rapid diagnosis of virus infection from clinical specimens, for identification of virus isolates with unusual properties, and for monitoring endogenous agents in cell cultures are illustrated by several actual cases that have occurred over the years.

Clotting times and coagulation factor assays were compared between fresh frozen plasma, COVID-19 convalescent plasma, and pathogen-reduced COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Measurements included prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time, fibrinogen, D-dimer, von Willebrand factor activity, von Willebrand factor antigen, coagulation factors II, V, VIICXII, protein S activity, protein C antigen, and alpha-2 plasmin inhibitor. Clotting times and coagulation factor assays were not different between COVID-19 convalescent plasma and fresh frozen plasma, except for protein C antigen. When compared to fresh frozen plasma and regular convalescent plasma, pathogen reduction treatment increased activated partial thromboplastin time and thrombin time, while reducing fibrinogen, coagulation factor II, V, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, protein S activity, and alpha-2 plasmin inhibitor. The coagulation profiles of human COVID-19 convalescent plasma and standard fresh frozen plasma are not different.

Respondents were classified as high or low symptomatic on each mental health scale and logistic regression revealed risk and protective factors associated with each outcome. Change in wellbeing from pre to during COVID-19 was also quantified. Results A large proportion of UK HCW had high mental health symptoms. Fixed risk factors of poor mental health included being female, being frontline, pre-existing mental health diagnoses, and experience of stressful/traumatic events. An additional set of controllable factors also significantly increased risk: PPE availability, workload, lack of COVID-19 preparation and training, and insufficient communication of clinical procedures. Resilience and sharing stress reduced risk, as did ethical support for those making treatment decisions. Allied HCW and managers were at elevated risk of high symptoms particularly PTSD.

Systematic protocols to guide telehealth-centered interventions in response to COVID-19 outbreaks have yet to be delineated. This article is intended to inform PA/LTC facilities and neighboring health care partners how to collaboratively utilize telehealth-centered strategies to improve outcomes in facility outbreaks. Methods: The University of Virginia rapidly developed a multidisciplinary telehealth-centered COVID-19 facility outbreak strategy in response to a LTC facility outbreak in which 41 (out of 48) facility residents and 7 staff members tested positive. This strategy focused on supporting the facility team remotely using rapidly deployed technologic solutions. Goals included (1) early identification of patients who need their care escalated, (2) monitoring and treating patients deemed safe to remain in the facility, (3) care coordination to facilitate bidirectional transfers between the skilled nursing facility (SNF) and hospital, and (4) daily facility needs assessment related to technology, infection control, and staff well-being. To achieve these goals, a standardized approach centered on daily multidisciplinary virtual rounds and telemedicine consultation was provided. Results: Over a month since the outbreak began, 18 out of 48 (38%) facility residents required hospitalization and 6 (12.5%) died. Eleven facility residents have since returned back to the SNF after recovering from their hospitalization. No staff required hospitalization. Conclusions: Interventions that reduce hospitalizations and mortality are a critical need during the COVID-19 pandemic. The mortality and hospitalization rates seen in this PA/LTC facility outbreak are significantly lower than has been documented in other facility outbreaks. Our multidisciplinary approach centered on telemedicine should be considered as other PA/LTC facilities partner with neighboring health care systems in responding to COVID-19 outbreaks.

Clinical and endoscopic characteristics, treatment outcomes, and the incidence of metachronous small-bowel angioectasia after PDI were evaluated. Results SSc patients with small-bowel angioectasia exhibited significantly lower hemoglobin levels and a significantly higher incidence of skin telangiectasia than those without small-bowel angioectasia. On a multivariate analysis of the presence of small-bowel angioectasia, anemia and skin telangiectasia were significant independent factors. SSc patients with small-bowel angioectasia included a higher proportion of women and exhibited a significantly higher incidence of metachronous small-bowel angioectasia than X [please define X]. The characteristics of small-bowel angioectasia and outcomes of PDI were not significantly different between the two groups. No post-treatment rebleeding cases or adverse events were noted. Conclusion CE should be performed for SSc patients with anemia and/or skin telangiectasia. PDI is effective for SSc patients with small-bowel angioectasia.","output":"Characteristics and Treatment Outcomes of Small-bowel Angioectasia in Systemic Sclerosis Patients: A Retrospective Observational Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Surveillance testing for infectious disease is an important tool to combat disease transmission at the population level. During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, RT-PCR tests have been considered the gold standard due to their high sensitivity and specificity. However, RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to return positive results when administered to individuals who are past the infectious stage of the disease. Meanwhile, antigen-based tests are often treated as a less accurate substitute for RT-PCR, however, new evidence suggests they may better reflect infectiousness. Consequently, the two test types may each be most optimally deployed in different settings. Here, we present an epidemiological model with surveillance testing and coordinated isolation in two congregate living settings (a nursing home and a university dormitory system) that considers test metrics with respect to viral culture, a proxy for infectiousness. Simulations show that antigen-based surveillance testing coupled with isolation greatly reduces disease burden and carries a lower economic cost than RT-PCR-based strategies. Antigen and RT-PCR tests perform different functions toward the goal of reducing infectious disease burden and should be used accordingly.","output":"Comparison of antigen- and RT-PCR-based testing strategies for detection of Sars-Cov-2 in two high-exposure settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Through the Silk Road, Chinese medicine has different degrees of absorption on different levels of indic medicine.

These worms are well-studied with a wealth of information available, for example on the genome, the gene expression, the immune system, the general biology, and ecology. These worms live in many habitats, and they had to find solutions for severe environmental challenges. The common compost worm, Eisenia fetida, has developed a unique mechanism to deal with intruding (nano)materials, bacteria, and viruses. It deals with the intruders by covering these with a defence toxin (lysenin) targeted to kill the intruder. We outline how this mechanism probably can be used as a therapeutic model for human COVID-19 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) and other corona viruses. ABSTRACT: Earthworms have been used for centuries in traditional medicine and are used globally as an ecotoxicological standard test species. Studies of the earthworm Eisenia fetida have shown that exposure to nanomaterials activates a primary corona-response, which is covering the nanomaterial with native proteins, the same response as to biological invaders such as a virus. We outline that the earthworm Eisenia fetida is possibly immune to COVID-19 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2), and we describe the likely mechanisms of highly receptor-specific pore-forming proteins (PFPs). A non-toxic version of this protein is available, and we hypothesize that it is possible to use the earthworms PFPs based anti-viral mechanism as a therapeutic model for human SARS-CoV-2 and other corona viruses. The proteins can be used as a drug, for example, delivered with a nanoparticle in a similar way to the current COVID-19 vaccines. Obviously, careful consideration should be given to the potential risk of toxicity elicited by lysenin for in vivo usage. We aim to share this view to activate its exploration by the wider scientific community while promoting a potential therapeutic development.","output":"The Curious Case of Earthworms and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During this unprecedented novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, there is an urgent need for empirical data to characterise its impact on the mental health and well-being of Australians.

Our study aims to explore the Lebanese CPs willingness to administer influenza vaccine, and to identify factors associated with this willingness. METHODS: This is a web-based, cross-sectional study, conducted over 2 months, from the 1st of November to the end of December 2020. Self-reported data were collected electronically from Lebanese CPs through an anonymous, questionnaire using google form. The collected data were analyzed using the statistical software SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences). Bivariate and multivariable analyses were performed to examine factors associated with the willingness of CPs to administer influenza vaccine. RESULTS: A total of 412 CPs participated in this survey of which 76.9% are willing to administer influenza vaccines. More than 90% of them had a good overall knowledge score and 88.8% of CPs showed a positive overall attitude score, particularly towards involvement of CPs in influenza vaccine provision. Their willingness to administer vaccine was positively associated with the younger age (aOR = 3.12 with 95% CI (1.597C4.040)), higher education level (aOR = 2.02 with 95% CI (1.093C3.741)), previous experience in immunization (aOR = 2.72 with 95% CI (1.320C5.627)) and urbanicity of pharmacy (aOR = 1.542 with 95% CI (1.219C4.627)).

EM during the first 20 weeks of 2020 was estimated by comparing observed mortality rates with expected mortality rates during the five previous years (N=2,379,792). EM variation by socioeconomic status (tertiles of income, education, Swedish-born, gainful employment) and age distribution (share of 70+ year-old persons) was explored based on Demographic Statistics Area (DeSO) data. Findings: An EM was first detected during the week of March 23-29 2020. During the peaking week of the epidemic (6-12 April 2020), an EM of 160% was observed: 211% in 80+ year-old women; 179% in 80+ year-old men. During the same week, the highest EM was observed for DeSOs with lowest income (171%), lowest education (162%), lowest share of Swedish-born (178%), and lowest share of gainfully employed (174%). There was a 1.2 to 1.7-fold increase in EM between those areas with a higher vs. lower proportion of young people. Interpretation: Living in areas with lower socioeconomic status and younger populations is linked to COVID-19 EM. These conditions might have facilitated the viral spread.

We evaluated the inter-rater reliability and accuracy of raters and an automated algorithm for assessing the collateral score (CS, range: 0-3) in acute ischemic stroke patients. METHODS Baseline CTA scans with an intracranial anterior occlusion from the MR CLEAN study (n=500) were used. For each core lab CS, ten CTA scans with sufficient quality were randomly selected. After a training session in collateral scoring, all selected CTA scans were individually evaluated for a visual CS by three groups: 7 radiologists, 13 junior and 9 senior radiology residents. Two additional radiologists scored CS to be used as reference, with a third providing a CS to produce a 2 out of 3 consensus CS in case of disagreement. An automated algorithm was also used to compute CS. Inter-rater agreement was reported with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Accuracy of visual and automated CS were calculated. RESULTS 39 CTA scans were assessed (1 corrupt CTA-scan excluded). All groups showed a moderate ICC (0.689-0.780) in comparison to the reference standard. Overall human accuracy was 65 7% and increased to 88 5% for dichotomized CS (0-1, 2-3). Automated CS accuracy was 62%, and 90% for dichotomized CS.

This new disease, due to its large diffusion, may significantly hamper the prognosis of other pathologies, such as ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) because of (a) a possible direct negative impact and (b) shortage of first response medical resources and increased delays to reperfusion. We report the case of a 68-year-old man admitted for anterior STEMI and asymptomatic COVID-19. Due to extended transportation delays to a cathlab, he received intravenous fibrinolytic therapy, which failed. Reperfusion was achieved with rescue coronary angioplasty, but the patient experienced two episodes of acute stent thrombosis at 2- and 36-hr following admission and despite optimal medical therapy. He finally died because of cardiogenic shock. This raises concerns about a possible increase in platelet aggregability associated with COVID-19 leading to an increased risk of stent thrombosis, particularly in the context of STEMI. This pleads for the promotion of primary coronary angioplasty as the first-choice revascularization technique in this population and the use of new generation P2Y12 inhibitors. In addition, the use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors may be considered in every STEMI patient with COVID-19 to prevent the risk of acute stent thrombosis.","output":"Insights for increased risk of failed fibrinolytic therapy and stent thrombosis associated with COVID-19 in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe response measures to an outbreak involving 128 (33.4%) coronavirus disease cases (46.1% asymptomatic) among 383 persons onboard a passenger ship.

According to the literature patients with serum 25(OH)D levels < 12 ng/ml are clearly deficient at all ages. Our aim was to assess COVID-19 mortality in the settings of severe 25(OH)D deficiency. Methods A cohort study of 357 COVID-19 patients was conducted. Subjects were monitored until discharge or in-hospital death. At admission, severity parameters (CRP, IL-6, Charlson Comorbidity Index etc.) were assessed. These parameters were compared regarding 25(OH)D levels threshold 12 ng/ml, where values below 12 ng/ml were considered absolute vitamin D deficiency. Results 25(OH)D levels at the time of admission were independently associated with mortality (p<0.05). Non-survivors (N=168) had lower 25(OH)D levels, SO2, higher age, CRP, viral load, and Charlson Comorbidity Index in comparison to survivors. Patients with serum 25(OH)D levels < 12 ng/ml had higher mortality (55% vs. 45 %), viral load (21.5 vs 23.1) and Charlson Comorbidity Index (5.3 vs 4.4) in comparison to those with serum 25(OH)D levels >12 ng/ml (p<0.05).

They are usually exposed to traumatic events leaving them at risk of developing mental health conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Increasing concern is being raised regarding the mental health impacts, specifically PTSD, among military personnel and firefighters. Objective: There is an increased exposure of firefighters and military personnel to traumatic events and the attendant risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder. It is crucial to ascertain the level of PTSD amongst this cohort and determinants to formulate policies and practices that mitigate the risk and protect public safety personnel. This scoping review sought to determine the prevalence of PTSD among this cohort globally and to explore determinants of this mental health condition. Methods: A literature search in databases including MEDLINE, CINAHL, PubMed, PsycINFO, and EMBASE was conducted electronically from May 2021 to 31 July 2021. Two reviewers independently assessed full-text articles according to the predefined inclusion criteria and screening process undertaken to identify studies for the review. Articles were screened with a third reviewer, resolving conflicts where necessary and further assessing them for eligibility. During article selection, the PRISMA checklist was adopted, and with the Covidence software, a total of 32 articles were selected for the final examination. For the eligible studies, data extraction was conducted, information was collated and summarized, and the findings were reported. Original qualitative and quantitative data on the prevalence and predictors of PTSD among veterans, military, and firefighters were reported. Results: The prevalence of PTSD was 57% for firefighters and 37.8% for military personnel. Demographic factors, job factors, social support, injuries, physical and psychological factors, and individual traits were the main predictors of PTSD in this cohort. Conclusion: This information is vital for developing and implementing prevention and intervention strategies for PTSD in military personnel and firefighters. Recognizing and addressing factors that predict PTSD will help to improve mental wellbeing and increase productivity.

Endothelial cells express Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the entrance door for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The hallmarks of severe illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection are increased levels of IL-6, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, ferritin, neutrophilia and lymphopenia, pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy and microthrombi of alveolar capillaries. The endothelial glycocalyx, a proteoglycan- and glycoprotein-rich layer covering the luminal side of endothelial cells, contributes to vascular homeostasis. It regulates vascular tonus and permeability, prevents thrombosis, and modulates leukocyte adhesion and inflammatory response. We hypothesized that cytokine production and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation associated with COVID-19 leads to glycocalyx degradation. A cohort of 20 hospitalized patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. Mechanisms associated with glycocalyx degradation in COVID-19 were investigated. Increased plasma concentrations of IL-6 and IL1-?, as well as increased lipid peroxidation and glycocalyx components were detected in plasma from COVID-19 patients compared to plasma from healthy subjects. Plasma from COVID-19 patients induced glycocalyx shedding in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and disrupted redox balance. Treatment of HUVECs with low molecular weight heparin inhibited the glycocalyx perturbation. In conclusion, plasma from COVID-19 patients promotes glycocalyx shedding and redox imbalance in endothelial cells, and heparin treatment potentially inhibits glycocalyx disruption.","output":"Heparin prevents in vitro glycocalyx shedding induced by plasma from COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence and rapid worldwide spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has prompted the scientific community to rapidly develop in vitro and in vivo models that could be applied in COVID-19 research.

Rural health professionals often experience geographical and professional isolation, which can impact their training and education. In New Zealand, during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, an established distance postgraduate rural medical programme replaced its in-person residentials with virtual workshops. This study aimed to gain insights into the student experience of the virtual workshops, with emphasis on exploring the effects of the absence of an in-person component. METHOD Qualitative exploratory design. All students who had completed a semester one 2020 University of Otago rural postgraduate module were invited by email to participate. Fifteen semi-structured interviews were conducted by video-conference. A thematic analysis was conducted using a general inductive approach. RESULTS Three themes captured the main issues. 1. Making sure everyone is in the same boat: the key roles of an in-person component were identified as consolidation of learning, benchmarking and connectedness. 2. Learning but not connecting: virtual workshops were well facilitated, allowed continuation of study and the convenience of staying home, however connectedness faded. 3. We've got to keep a human touch in a digital age: looking beyond the pandemic, opportunities for streamlining virtual content were identified, however there was concern around diminished communication and cultural aspects of learning and the absent connection with rural health services and communities. CONCLUSION A virtual workshop is valuable in the COVID-19 environment but does not replace an in-person component of a distance postgraduate training programme for rural medicine.","output":"Doing without the residential component of a blended postgraduate rural medical programme during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand: student perspectives."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the figure of ambassador is being increasingly called upon in the field of environmental health, its scope remains fuzzy and its success factors have been little studied. This article presents the results of a qualitative study performed over three years on a French citizen-sensor scheme for air quality. The scheme draws on volunteer citizens to measure fine particles by means of micro-sensors. Volunteers are also tasked with raising awareness in their entourage about environmental issues with the aim of changing peoples behaviour. We investigated this strategy and sought to identify the conditions that enable citizens to become effective clean air ambassadors. The schemes intervention logic was first reconstructed and a literature review of similar projects was conducted. Then, three surveys were carried out with the schemes volunteers. Each survey consisted of an observation of the volunteers practices and individual interviews (70 in all) in order to understand these citizen-sensors motivations and experiences, and characterize how they fulfilled their role. We concluded that, for citizen sensing, the scope and role of ambassador should be reconsidered insofar as these citizens serve as peer leaders and mediators.

Although there exist numerous genetic association studies pertinent to AD in different ethnicities, critical genetic factors and signaling pathways underlying its pathogenesis remain ambiguous. This study was aimed to analyze the genetic data retrieved from 32 Gene Expression Omnibus datasets belonging to diverse ethnic cohorts in order to identify overlapping differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Stringent selection criteria were framed to shortlist appropriate datasets based on false discovery rate (FDR) p-value and log FC, and relevant details of upregulated and downregulated DEGs were retrieved. Among the 32 datasets, only six satisfied the selection criteria. The GEO2R tool was employed to retrieve significant DEGs. Nine common DEGs, i.e., SLC5A3, BDNF, SST, SERPINA3, RTN3, RGS4, NPTX, ENC1 and CRYM were found in more than 60% of the selected datasets. These DEGs were later subjected to proteinCprotein interaction analysis with 18 AD-specific literature-derived genes. Among the nine common DEGs, BDNF, SST, SERPINA3, RTN3 and RGS4 exhibited significant interactions with crucial proteins including BACE1, GRIN2B, APP, APOE, COMT, PSEN1, INS, NEP and MAPT. Functional enrichment analysis revealed involvement of these genes in trans-synaptic signaling, chemical transmission, PI3K pathway signaling, receptorCligand activity and G protein signaling.

The onset of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome led this patient to receive endotracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation and subsequent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for life support. He was isolated in the negative air pressure room in the intensive care unit for infection control for this emerging respiratory infectious disease. This patient was also confronted with emotional pressures arising from the general uncertainty regarding the progress of this novel disease and from being isolated from the outside world. The care period was from April 5th to May 12th, 2020. The data was collected through direct care, written conversations, physical communication, observation, medical record reviews, diagnosis reports, and nursing assessments of physical, psychological, social, and spiritual distress. The health problems of this patient were identified as gas exchange disorder, infection, anxiety, and other problems. Our chest physiotherapy team comprised nurses, physicians, and respiratory therapists. After administering individualized treatments, including monitoring vital signs and installing an external life support system, the lung consolidation and lung collapse problems of the patient improved, allowing the ventilator to be removed. To address the patient's psychological problems, we used a humanoid diagram and whiteboard drawing as communication tools to explain to the patient the reasons for and functions of the different tubes on his body to reduce his anxiety and maintain the safe use of these tubes. Moreover, bedside care was replaced by mobile phone video and phone calls, allowing the patient to communicate with family members, which reduced his isolation-related anxiety and enhanced his compliance with treatment and care protocols. This experience supports the benefit of installing two-way video devices and viewing monitors in negative pressure rooms in the ICU to facilitate effective communications between patients, patient family members, and the medical team to reduce patient-perceived anxiety and social isolation.

METHODS: Between March 1, 2020 and April 30, 2020, 896 pregnant women were admitted to our Institution and tested for COVID-19. We collected information regarding their sociodemographic characteristics. Additional information on geographical area of residence, number of family members, number of family members tested positive for COVID-19, and clinical data was collected for women tested positive for COVID-19. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the risk of developing COVID-19 according to sociodemographic characteristics were estimated by unconditional logistic regression models. RESULTS: Among the 896 women enrolled, 50 resulted positive for COVID-19. Pregnant women aged &#8805;35 years had a significantly lower risk of developing the infection (crude OR = 0.29; 95% CI:0.16-0.55). Conversely, foreign women (crude OR = 3.32; 95% CI:1.89-5.81), unemployed women (crude OR = 3.09; 95% CI: 1.77-5.40), and women with an unemployed partner (crude OR = 3.16; 95% CI: 1.48-6.79) showed a significantly higher risk of infection.

This property is due to the Cry toxins encoded by plasmid genes and mostly produced during sporulation. B. thuringiensis contains a remarkable amount of extrachromosomal DNA molecules and a great number of plasmid rap-phr genes. Rap-Phr quorum sensing systems regulate different bacterial processes, notably the commitment to sporulation in Bacillus species. Rap proteins are quorum sensors acting as phosphatases on Spo0F, intermediate of the sporulation phosphorelay, and are inhibited by Phr peptides that function as signaling molecules. In this study, we characterize the Rap63-Phr63 system encoded by the pAW63 plasmid from the B. thuringiensis var. kurstaki HD73 strain. Rap63 has a moderate activity on sporulation and is inhibited by the Phr63 peptide. The rap63-phr63 genes are co-transcribed and the phr63 gene is also transcribed from a &#963;H-specific promoter. We show that Rap63-Phr63 regulates the sporulation together with the Rap8-Phr8 system harbored by the plasmid pHT8_1 of the HD73 strain. Interestingly, the deletion of both phr63 and phr8 genes in the same strain has a greater negative effect in sporulation than the sum of the loss of each phr gene. Despite the similarities in the Phr8 and Phr63 sequences, there is no crosstalk between the two systems. Our results suggest a synergism of these two Rap-Phr systems in the regulation of sporulation of B. thuringiensis at the end of the infectious cycle in insect, thus pointing out the role of the plasmids to the fitness of the bacteria.IMPORTANCEThe life cycle of Bacillus thuringiensis in insect larvae is regulated by quorum sensing systems of the RNPP family. After the toxemia caused by Cry insecticidal toxins, the sequential activation of these systems allows the bacteria to trigger a state of virulence (regulated by PlcR-PapR), then a necrotrophic lifestyle (regulated by NprR-NprX) and ultimately the sporulation is controlled by the Rap-Phr systems. Our study describes a new rap-phr operon carried by a B. thuringiensis plasmid and shows that the Rap protein has a moderate effect on sporulation. However, in combination with another plasmid rap-phr operon, both systems provide an effective control of sporulation when the bacteria develop in the cadavers of infected insect larvae. Overall, this study highlights the important adaptive role of the plasmid Rap-Phr systems in the developmental fate and the survival of B. thuringiensis within their ecological niche.","output":"Rap-Phr systems from pAW63 and pHT8-1 plasmids act together to regulate sporulation in the Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki HD73 strain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The provision of practical and emotional support for men who have been diagnosed with breast cancer in the UK falls primarily on their partners, close family members or friends.

However, interruption of inflammatory cytokine activation failed to attenuate ARDS, suggesting that other therapies are required to treat this illness and improve survival. Etoposide (ET), a cytotoxic agent, and prednisolone (PSL), a corticosteroid with strong anti-inflammatory activity, have been used to treat other disease involving similar cytokine-activated macrophages and hemophagocytic activity. However, they have not been previously tested as ARDS therapeutics alone or in combination. In the present study, we used a fatal ARDS mouse model induced via administration of -galactosylceramide and lipopolysaccharide, which resulted in the development of severe lung injury with hypercytokinemia and hemophagocytosis, all of which were observed in ARDS patients infected with highly pathogenic respiratory viruses. The ET and PSL combination therapy, but not ET or PSL alone, reduced the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells including macrophages, natural killer T cells, and neutrophils, and significantly improved the survival rate in this model. Furthermore, whereas ET alone improved lung edema, it did not increase the survival rate, indicating the necessity of PSL in the treatment of ARDS. Surprisingly, combination therapy did not reduce the production of cytokines and chemokines in the lungs, demonstrating that inflammatory cells, rather than hypercytokinemia, are the direct target of these compounds and primary cause of ARDS-related death.

The multiple mediator analyses showed that the mediating proportions of all four mediators ranged from 53.4% to 122.6%: among participants with two or more pain sites, the effect estimate reduced substantially, for example, HR reduced from 1.25 (95% CI: 1.21 to 1.30; two pain sites) to 1.07 (95% CI: 1.01 to 1.11; two pain sites). Interpretation: We found that higher number of pain sites was associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality compared to having no pain, and at least half of the association of chronic musculoskeletal pain with increased all-cause mortality may be accounted for by four mediators.

The volume focuses on Western Europe in the period 2007-2018 and considers both right-wing and left-wing populist parties. It critically assesses the concept and rise of populism, and includes case studies on Austria, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Denmark, Finland, the United Kingdom, Greece, and Italy. The authors apply an original typology of party strategic responses to political competitors, which allows them to map interactions between populist and non-populist parties in different countries. They also assess the links between ideology and policy, the goals of different populist parties, and how achieving power affects these parties. The volume provides important lessons for the study of political competition, particularly in the aftermath of a crisis and, as such, its framework can inform future research in the post-Covid-19 era. This wide-ranging study will appeal to students and scholars of political science interested in populism and political competition;and will appeal to policy makers and politicians from across the political spectrum. ? 2021 selection and editorial matter, Daniele Albertazzi and Davide Vampa;individual chapters, the contributors.

AE are commonly reported among multi-drug resistance tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients in Ethiopia. However, predictors of AE among MDR-TB patients were limited in Ethiopia. Thus, the current study aimed to develop and validate a score to predict the risks of major AE among MDR-TB patients in Southern Ethiopia. METHODS: A retrospective follow-up study design was employed among MDR-TB patients from 2014C2019 in southern Ethiopia at selected hospitals. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm was used to select the most potent predictors of the outcome. The adverse event risk score was built based on the multivariable logistic regression analysis. Discriminatory power and calibration were checked to evaluate the performance of the model. Bootstrapping method with 100 repetitions was used for internal model validation. RESULTS: History of baseline khat use, long-term drug regimen use, and having coexisting disorders (co-morbidity) were predictors of AEs. The score has a satisfactory discriminatory power (AUC = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.68, 0.82) and a modest calibration (Prob > chi(2) = 0.2043). It was found to have the same c-statistics after validation by bootstrapping method of 100 repetitions with replacement. CONCLUSION: A history of baseline khat use, co-morbidity, and long-term drug regimen use are helpful to predict individual risk of major adverse events in MDR-TB patients with a satisfactory degree of accuracy (AUC = 0.77).","output":"A Score to Predict the Risk of Major Adverse Drug Reactions Among Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis Patients in Southern Ethiopia, 2014C2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is currently facing another severe pandemic, Covid-19, just four decades after the start of AIDS, and the still increasing incidence of HIV infection continues to be one of the greatest global health challenges. The way the latter was confronted is of fundamental importance for a serious discussion on global health, ethics and human rights, and this experience could and can still be applied to Covid-19. The Covid-19 pandemic has specific characteristics and these will be discussed, in relation to vaccine research and especially to the global right to equal access to products proven to be safe and effective. The article focusses primarily on issues related to Covid-19 vaccines, especially the appropriate use and limits on placebo, the right to post-trial access to placebo arm participants, and the use of an active control for subsequent Phase-3 trials after the approval of other safe and efficacious vaccines. Most importantly, it will emphasise that access to Covid-19 vaccines is a human right, which presupposes the establishment of appropriate ethical standards to ensure universal, equal, and affordable access to healthcare and to vaccines for all, and the imperative need for suspension of patents for products developed for Covid-19. It will consider the role of social determinants that contribute to the severity of Covid-19 and that must be addressed to effectively curb the current syndemic.","output":"Ethical limits to placebo use and access to Covid-19 vaccines as a human right."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper we develop an agent-based model for a fine-grained computational simulation of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. This model is calibrated to reproduce several characteristics of COVID-19 transmission, accounting for its reproductive number, the length of incubation and generation periods, age-dependent attack rates, and the growth rate of cumulative incidence during a sustained and unmitigated local transmission. An important calibration outcome is the age-dependent fraction of symptomatic cases, with this fraction for children found to be one-fifth of such fraction for adults. We then apply the model to compare several intervention strategies, including restrictions on international air travel, case isolation, social distancing with varying levels of compliance, and school closures. School closures are not found to bring decisive benefits. We report an important transition across the levels of social distancing compliance, in the range between 70% and 80% levels. This suggests that a compliance of below 70% is unlikely to succeed for any duration of social distancing, while a compliance at the 90% level is likely to control the disease within 13-14 weeks, when coupled with effective case isolation and international travel restrictions.","output":"Modelling transmission and control of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"EMR2 is an EGF-like module containing mucin-like hormone receptor-2 precursor, a G-protein coupled receptor (G-PCR).

Google Trends (GT) searches may reflect disease epidemiology. Recently, GT searches for COVID-19-associated terms have been linked to the epidemiology of COVID-19. In this study we aimed to assess COVID-19 cases per se vs COVID-19-associated GT searches and thyroid-associated GT searches. Materials-Methods: We collected data on worldwide weekly GT searches regarding COVID-19, SARS-COV-2, coronavirus, smell, taste, fatigue, cough, thyroid, thyroiditis and subacute thyroiditis for 92 weeks and worldwide weekly COVID-19 cases' statistics in the same time period. The study period was split in half and in each time period we performed cross-correlation analysis and mediation analysis. Results Significant positive CCF values were noted in both time periods;while COVID-19 cases per se were associated with thyroid searches in both time periods, significant CCFs for fatigue, COVID-19 and SARS-COV-s were mostly found in the second time period. In the latter period, the effect of COVID-19 searches on thyroid searches was significantly mediated by COVID-19 cases (p=0.048). Discussion COVID-19 cases per se were found to be associated with no lag with GT searches for COVID-19 symptoms in the first time period and in the second time period to lead searches for symptoms, COVID-19 terms as well as thyroid terms. Searches for a non-specific symptom or COVID-19 search terms mostly lead GT thyroid searches, in the second time period. This time frame/sequence particularly in the second time period (noted by the preponderance of the SARS-COV-2 delta variant), lends some credence to associations of COVID-19 cases per se with (apparent) thyroid disease (via searches for them).","output":"COVID-19 and thyroid disease: an infodemiological pilot study (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viruses are intracellular parasites that subvert the functions of their host cells to accomplish their infection cycle. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-residing chaperone proteins are central for the achievement of different steps of the viral cycle, from entry and replication to assembly and exit. The most abundant ER chaperones are GRP78 (78-kDa glucose-regulated protein), GRP94 (94-kDa glucose-regulated protein), the carbohydrate or lectin-like chaperones calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT), the protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs), and the DNAJ chaperones. This review will focus on the pleiotropic roles of ER chaperones during viral infection. We will cover their essential role in the folding and quality control of viral proteins, notably viral glycoproteins which play a major role in host cell infection. We will also describe how viruses co-opt ER chaperones at various steps of their infectious cycle but also in order to evade immune responses and avoid apoptosis. Finally, we will discuss the different molecules targeting these chaperones and the perspectives in the development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs.","output":"Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperones in Viral Infection: Therapeutic Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The negative impacts of proton pump inhibitor (PPI), including the risk of pneumonia and mortality, have been reported previously. This meta-analysis aimed to address the current interest of whether the administration of PPI could increase the susceptibility and risk of poor outcome in COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search from PubMed, Embase, EBSCOhost, and EuropePMC databases up until 3 December 2020. The main outcome was composite poor outcome which comprised of mortality and severe COVID-19. Severe COVID-19 in this study was defined as patients with COVID-19 that fulfill the criteria for severe CAP, including the need for intensive unit care or mechanical ventilation. The secondary outcome was susceptibility, based on cohort comparing COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative participants. RESULTS: There were a total of 290,455 patients from 12 studies in this meta-analysis. PPI use was associated with increased composite poor outcome (OR 1.85 [1.13, 3.03], p = 0.014; I(2) 90.26%). Meta-regression analysis indicate that the association does not vary by age (OR 0.97 [0.92, 1.02], p = 0.244), male (OR 1.05 [0.99, 1.11], p = 0.091), hypertension (OR 9.98 [0.95, 1.02], p = 0.317), diabetes (OR 0.99 [0.93, 1.05], p = 0.699), chronic kidney disease (OR 1.01 [0.93, 1.10], p = 0.756), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use (OR 1.02 [0.96, 1.09], p = 0.499), and pre-admission/in-hospital PPI use (OR 0.77 [0.26, 2.31], p = 0.644).

Because of this, it is necessary to understand the release of different sized particles in activities such as playing brass instruments in order for an analysis of risk to take place for such activities. In this investigation, the quantity and size of particles released by brass instruments while they are played was analysed for 7 different types of brass instrument. This was contrasted with the same individuals breathing as a comparison for more general activities as well as the effect of a mitigating polycotton barrier over the end of their instruments. To investigate the particles released, the particles were size sorted and counted with a six-channel laser particle counter. Multiple measurements were made by each individual in each condition investigated. The mean concentration exiting across all instruments measured was found to be 1.21x107{+/-}1.03x106 Aerosol type particles/m3 and 1.43x104{+/-}9.01x102 Droplet type particles/m3 per minute. When breathing, the mean count was 1.61x107{+/-}1.33x106 Aerosol type particle/m3 and 5.45x103{+/-}1.20x103 Droplet type particles/m3. When playing with a barrier cover, the mean number of particles emitted fell to 2.60x106{+/-}2.11x105 Aerosol type particle/m3 and 5.20x103{+/-}8.02x102 Droplet type particles/m3. This barrier represented an average 78.5% reduction for the number of respiratory Aerosol type particles and 63.8% reduction for Droplet type particles compared to playing an instrument without the barrier covering. It was investigated what effect playing for a more extended period of time had on the release of particles with comparisons made to singing, breathing and covering the instruments' bell ends with a barrier cap. This showed that the mean number of Aerosol type particles produced while playing was 5.38x107{+/-}3.15x106 Aerosol type particles/m3 produced and showed a significant drop in Aerosol type particle production when playing with a barrier used, with a mean average of 2.28x106{+/-}8.01x104 Aerosol type particles/m3. Both breathing and singing showed consistent numbers of Aerosol type particles produced with means of 6.59x107{+/-}7.94x105 Aerosol type particles/m3 and 5.28x107{+/-}5.36x105 Aerosol type particles/m3 respectively. This showed a drop in mean Aerosol type particles/m3 of 95.7% when using a barrier cap compared to playing without a barrier. It is concluded that, while playing a brass instrument, the propagation of respiratory Aerosols does occur and, to a smaller extent, so do Droplet size particles, but at a lower level than when the subject was breathing without an instrument. Finally, it was shown that the use of a barrier cap on the bell end of the instrument offers a significant reduction in the production of respiratory Aerosols into the immediate surroundings, which offers a possible mitigation method for playing in groups from the release of Aerosol type particles, especially in hard to ventilate spaces.","output":"Investigation into the Release of Respiratory Aerosols by Brass Instruments and Mitigation Measures with Respect to Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To examine levels of expenditure and needed investment in public health at the local level in the state of Ohio pre-COVID-19. DESIGN: Using detailed financial reporting from fiscal year (FY) 2018 from Ohio's local health departments (LHDs), we characterize spending by Foundational Public Health Services (FPHS). We also constructed estimates of the gap in public health spending in the state using self-reported gaps in service provision and a microsimulation approach. Data were collected between January and June 2019 and analyzed between June and September 2019. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-four of the 113 LHDs in the state of Ohio covering a population of almost 9 million Ohioans. RESULTS: In FY2018, Ohio LHDs spent an average of $37 per capita on protecting and promoting the public's health. Approximately one-third of this investment supported the Foundational Areas (communicable disease control; chronic disease and injury prevention; environmental public health; maternal, child, and family health; and access to and linkages with health care). Another third supported the Foundational Capabilities, that is, the crosscutting skills and capacities needed to support all LHD activities. The remaining third supported programs and activities that are responsive to local needs and vary from community to community. To fully meet identified LHD needs in the state pre-COVID-19, Ohio would require an additional annual investment of $20 per capita on top of the current $37 spent per capita, or approximately $240 million for the state. CONCLUSIONS: A better understanding of the cost and value of public health services can educate policy makers so that they can make informed trade-offs when balancing health care, public health, and social services investments. The current environment of COVID-19 may dramatically increase need, making understanding and growing public health investment critical.","output":"The Cost of Providing the Foundational Public Health Services in Ohio"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:D}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function V(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const P=d(O,[["render",V]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"doctor/70.md","filePath":"doctor/70.md"}'),R={name:"doctor/70.md"},E=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{z as __pageData,E as default};
