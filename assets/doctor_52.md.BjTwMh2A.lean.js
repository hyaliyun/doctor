Early, accurate and rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 can effectively stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Automatic diagnostic models based on deep learning can detect COVID-19 quickly and accurately. This paper uses a three-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN) to build a COVID-19 diagnostic prediction model for COVID-19 detection. All 192 sets of chest Computed Tomography(CT) data collected are used for this study, including 96 sets of confirmed COVID-19 patients and 96 sets of CT scans of normal human lungs. 5-fold cross-validation is used to train and validate the model. 154 data sets are used to train the model, and 38 sets are used for testing. All experimental data are segmented using a pre-trained SP-V-Net to obtain 3D lung masks fed into 3D CNN for training and validation of the prediction model. In addition, to verify the accuracy of the model predictions and provide interpretability for medical diagnosis, we visualize the experimental results using Class Activation Maps(CAM) to localize the predicted disease regions. The results from several experiments show that the accuracy of our prediction model is 0.911, the Area Under Curve (AUC) 0.976, for no-COVID-19(Precision, 0.902, Recall 0.911, F1-Score 0.900), COVID-19 (Precision, 0.932, Recall 0.911, F1-Score 0.902).

The impact of Bt crops on bacterial communities has only been assessed under short-term, and results have been contradictory. Here, we analyzed the bacterial communities in three niches, rhizosphere soil (RS), root endosphere (RE) and leaf endosphere (LE), of three Bt rice and their non-Bt parental lines for three consecutive years by high-throughput sequencing. In principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and PERMANOVA (Adonis) analysis, operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were clustered primarily by niche type and differed significantly in the RE and LE but not in the RS between each of three Bt lines compared with the non-Bt rice line, and not in each respective niche among the three Bt rice lines. The bacterial communities in the RS of different rice lines over the 3 years were clustered mainly by year rather than by lines. The differential bacterial taxa among the lines did not overlap between years, presumably because Cry proteins are rapidly degraded in the soil. A network analysis of RS bacterial communities showed that the network complexity and density for the three Bt rice lines did not decrease compared with those for the non-Bt line. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that bacterial communities differed significantly in RE and LE between Bt and non-Bt rice lines, but the differences were mild and transient, and had no adverse impact on RS over the 3 years.

METHODS: Participants from the All Our Families pregnancy longitudinal cohort whose children had reached ages 9C12 years were invited in MayCJune 2020 to complete a survey on the impact of COVID-19. The survey covered topics about the impact of the pandemic and included 2 specific questions on mothers intentions to vaccinate their child against SARS-CoV-2. Current responses were linked to previously collected data, including infant vaccine uptake. Multinomial regression models were run to estimate associations between demographic factors, past vaccination status and vaccination intention. Qualitative responses regarding factors affecting decision-making were analyzed thematically. RESULTS: The response rate was 53.8% (1321/2455). A minority of children of participants had partial or no vaccinations at age 2 (n = 200, 15.1%). A total of 60.4% of mothers (n = 798) intended to vaccinate their children with the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, 8.6% (n = 113) did not intend to vaccinate and 31.0% (n = 410) were unsure. Lower education, lower income and incomplete vaccination history were inversely associated with intention to vaccinate. Thematic analysis of qualitative responses showed 10 themes, including safety and efficacy, long-term effects and a rushed process.

In this regard, the use of compartmental models is the most prominent approach adopted in the literature to describe the dynamics of COVID-19. Along the same line, we aim during this study to generalize and ameliorate many existing works that consecrated to analyse the behaviour of this epidemic. Precisely, we propose an SQEAIHR epidemic system for Coronavirus. Our constructed model is enriched by taking into account the media intervention and vital dynamics. By the use of the next-generation matrix method, the theoretical basic reproductive number $R_0$ is obtained for COVID-19. Based on some nonstandard and generalized analytical techniques, the local and global stability of the disease-free equilibrium are proven when $R_0<1$. Moreover, in the case of $R_0>1$, the uniform persistence of COVID-19 model is also shown. In order to better adapt our epidemic model to reality, the randomness factor is taken into account by considering a proportional white noises, which leads to a well-posed stochastic model. Under appropriate conditions, interesting asymptotic properties are proved, namely: extinction and persistence in the mean. The theoretical results show that the dynamics of the perturbed COVID-19 model are determined by parameters that are closely related to the magnitude of the stochastic noise.

Most works follow the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) compartmental framework, modeling the epidemic with a system of ordinary differential equations. Alternative formulations using a partial differential equation (PDE) to incorporate both spatial and temporal resolution have also been introduced, with their numerical results showing potentially powerful descriptive and predictive capacity. In the present work, we introduce a new variation to such models by using delay differential equations (DDEs). The dynamics of many infectious diseases, including COVID-19, exhibit delays due to incubation periods and related phenomena. Accordingly, DDE models allow for a natural representation of the problem dynamics, in addition to offering advantages in terms of computational time and modeling, as they eliminate the need for additional, difficult-to-estimate, compartments (such as exposed individuals) to incorporate time delays. Here, we introduce a DDE epidemic model in both an ordinary- and partial differential equation framework. We present a series of mathematical results assessing the stability of the formulation.

In the present work we investigated the experience of families without specific elements of social or health vulnerability during the quarantine period that occurred in the spring of 2020. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between May and July 2020, 22 primary care pediatricians belonging to AUSL Romagna administered to a number of families a questionnaire to detect changes that occurred, during the lockdown, in family environment, school attendance and personal attitudes. RESULTS A total of 721 questionnaires were collected, analyzing the associations between variables relating to home environment, daily rhythms, school and warning signs in relation to the age of children. As a result of the lockdown, family habits changed in 31% of cases, with a greater presence of the reference figure in 68% of these. Three out of four families reported they had sufficient domestic spaces, and nine out of ten had access to an outdoor, private or condominium space. Daily rhythms were preserved in 56.7% of cases; mood disorders appeared in 30% of adolescent children, followed by sleep, appetite and psychosomatic disorders. One in three children has made progress in terms of evolution and behavior, and one in 5 children has seen their relationships improve. The overall resilience of families during the lockdown period was considered good in 66.3%, sufficient in 31.3% and not satisfactory in only 2.4% of cases. CONCLUSIONS Our data show that, in the interviewed families, the simultaneous presence of adults and children at home has generally intensified. Families refer, on the whole, a positive and resilient behavior in the lockdown period, even if initial emotional problems are reported in one out of three children-adolescents. The ability to maintain a family organized structure seems to be partially compromised. Forced cohabitation leads to competition for the same resources of time and space and affects the entire family unit.

Using dedicated measuring equipment and procedures, the majority of EMF emitting installations in Greece and also AOR emitting installations including arc welding, lasers and PC monitors has been assessed. RESULTS: Measurement results from occupational settings reveal that it is the non-coherent metal arc welding AOR that can pose even sub-second overexposures. Rare EMF overexposures are manageable and EMF concern is not justified. Maintenance procedures demand proper attention. Preliminary laser safety assessment reveals OHS gaps and potential eye and skin hazards. Blue light exposure from computer monitors is well below safety limits. CONCLUSIONS: This electromagnetic spectrum risk assessment conducted in Greece enables the justification of the real occupational hazards, in this sense: i) EMF exposure assessment has to be concentrated to maintenance procedures; ii) AOR measuring setups are challenging and standardized measurement procedures are missing, and iii) AOR overexposures from arc welding pose significant eye and skin hazards.","output":"Occupational electromagnetic spectrum hazards and the significance of artificial optical radiation: country report for Greece"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Remdesivir was originally developed to treat Ebola hemorrhagic fever, and its efficacy in treating coronavirus disease 2019 was detected during a preliminary analysis of a randomized controlled trial.

MANAGEMENT: The participant, a 28-year-old primipara, was found to have Coronavirus 2 infection in 2019, 2 days after delivery. She was given Remdesivir. The Remdesivir concentration in maternal serum and human milk was measured, and the milk-to-serum drug concentration ratio was found to be low (0.089), as was the relative infant dose (0.0070). The participant could not breastfeed her infant during her Coronavirus 2 infection treatment because in Japan anyone with COVID-19 was completely quarantined. However, she was able to resume breastfeeding after discharge and breastfed her infant for 6 months with supplements. CONCLUSION: Given the low amount of Remdesivir in the participant's milk, the inclusion of antibodies to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, which can be expected to protect the infant from infection, and various other benefits of human milk, suggests that breastfeeding is safe during treatment with Remdesivir.","output":"Remdesivir and Human Milk: A Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has presented unprecedented challenges to global health. Although the majority of COVID-19 patients exhibit mild-to-no symptoms, many patients develop severe disease and need immediate hospitalization, with most severe infections associated with a dysregulated immune response attributed to a cytokine storm. Epidemiological studies suggest that overall COVID-19 severity and morbidity correlate with underlying comorbidities, including diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and immunosuppressive conditions. Patients with such comorbidities exhibit elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress caused by an increased accumulation of angiotensin II and by activation of the NADPH oxidase pathway. Moreover, accumulating evidence suggests that oxidative stress coupled with the cytokine storm contribute to COVID-19 pathogenesis and immunopathogenesis by causing endotheliitis and endothelial cell dysfunction and by activating the blood clotting cascade that results in blood coagulation and microvascular thrombosis. In this review, we survey the mechanisms of how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) induces oxidative stress and the consequences of this stress on patient health. We further shed light on aspects of the host immunity that are crucial to prevent the disease during the early phase of infection. A better understanding of the disease pathophysiology as well as preventive measures aimed at lowering ROS levels may pave the way to mitigate SARS-CoV-2-induced complications and decrease mortality.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection and oxidative stress: Pathophysiological insight into thrombosis and therapeutic opportunities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The challenges in scaling up SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity include shortages in the supply chain for consumables and reagents.

However, little is known about the broader racial disparities in fears and perceptions about the pandemic and getting treated. OBJECTIVE: To examine disparities in perceived risks of COVID-19 and getting medical care. METHODS: Using the nationally representative Stanford University School of Medicine Coronavirus Attitudes and Behaviors Survey fielded in May of 2020, we examine racial and ethnic disparities in eight measures on the perceived risks of COVID-19. We use regression analysis to risk adjust perceptions controlling for 10 socioeconomic, demographic, and health variables. RESULTS: Black respondents were 15 percentage points more likely than White respondents to believe the pandemic would not end by Summer 2020 (92% vs 77%, p < .01), and were 19 percentage points more likely than any other race to feel a need to protect their family from COVID-19 (81% vs 62%, p < .01). Latinx respondents were 10 percentage points more fearful than White respondents of catching COVID-19 in public places (55% vs 45%, p < 0.01). Black respondents were 20 percentage points more likely than White respondents to think they would need medical care if infected (71% vs 51%, p < .01), and 18 percentage points more likely to think they would need to be hospitalized (59% vs 41%, p < .01).

However, studies have shown that Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) may play a significant role as an auxiliary treatment for COVID-19. Objective: This study aimed to assess the effects of TCM as an auxiliary treatment for COVID-19 through a systematic review of randomized-controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: Four English and three Chinese language databases were searched from December 1, 2019, to June 30, 2020. RCTs comparing TCM in combination with Western medicine (WM) with the same WM therapies alone for confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. The outcome measures were cure rate, lowering of body temperature, cough relief, improvement in chest computed tomography (CT) images, deterioration of condition, and adverse effects. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. A series of meta-analyses were conducted for selected outcomes using RevMan 5.3 software. The quality of evidence was appraised using the grading of recommendation, assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) recommendations. Results: Ten RCTs with a total of 1,285 patients were included. Compared with WM alone in treating COVID-19, WM with auxiliary treatment by TCM appears to have increased the cure rate (risk ratio [RR] 1.15 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.26]), relieved cough (RR 1.32 [95% CI 1.15-1.52]), improved chest CT images (RR 1.23 [95% CI 1.11-1.37]), and reduced the number of cases transitioning from a moderate to severe condition (RR 0.58 [95% CI 0.43-0.77]). The authors are uncertain whether TCM combined WM has effects on fever normalization (RR 1.10 [95% CI 0.94-1.29]) or adverse effects (RR 0.81 (95% CI 0.42-1.57]). Although they evaluated the certainty of evidence for lowering body temperature and adverse effects as very low, and low for cure rate, certainty was evaluated as moderate for improvement in chest CT images, cough relief, and deterioration of condition. Conclusion: TCM may be an effective auxiliary treatment for COVID-19 patients, which is likely to help improve the main symptoms and reduce disease progression. However, due to the limited number of studies and apparent heterogeneity among them, a more definitive conclusion on the effect of TCM on lowering body temperature and adverse effects cannot be drawn at this time.","output":"The Effects of Traditional Chinese Medicine as an Auxiliary Treatment for COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has become a global health pandemic. COVID-19 severity ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe multi-organ disease. Although the inflammatory response has been implicated in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, the exact nature of dysregulation in signaling pathways has not yet been elucidated underscoring the need for further molecular characterization of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. Here, we characterize the host response directly at the point of viral entry through analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs. Multiplexed high resolution mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of confirmed COVID-19 cases and negative controls identified 7,582 proteins and revealed significant upregulation of interferon-mediated antiviral signaling in addition to multiple other proteins that are not encoded by interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) or well-characterized during viral infections. Downregulation of several proteasomal subunits, E3 ubiquitin ligases, and components of protein synthesis machinery was significant upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Targeted proteomics to measure abundance levels of MX1, ISG15, Stat1, RIG-I and CXCL10, detected proteomic signatures of interferon-mediated anti-viral signaling that differentiated COVID-19 positive from negative cases. Phosphoproteomic analysis revealed increased phosphorylation of several proteins with known antiviral properties as well as several proteins involved in ciliary function (CEP131 and CFAP57) that have not previously been implicated in the context of coronavirus infections. Additionally, decreased phosphorylation levels of AKT and PKC, which have been shown to play varying roles in different viral infections, were observed in infected individuals relative to controls.

In the setting of anticipated resource constraints and widespread community infection with SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic, measures for balancing both infectious and oncologic risk among patients and providers must be carefully considered. Here, we present evidence-based guidelines for omitting or abbreviating breast cancer radiotherapy, where appropriate, in an effort to mitigate risk to patients and optimize resource utilization. Methods: Multidisciplinary breast cancer experts at a high-volume comprehensive cancer center convened contingency planning meetings over the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic to review the relevant literature and establish recommendations for the application of hypofractionated and abbreviated breast radiation regimens. Results: Substantial evidence exists to support omitting radiation among certain favorable risk subgroups of breast cancer patients and for abbreviating or accelerating regimens among others. For those who require either whole-breast or post-mastectomy radiation, with or without coverage of the regional lymph nodes, a growing body of literature supports various hypofractionated approaches that appear safe and effective. Conclusion: In the setting of a public health emergency with the potential to strain critical healthcare resources and place patients at infection risk, the parsimonious application of breast radiotherapy may alleviate a significant clinical burden without compromising long term oncologic outcomes. The judicious and personalized use of immature study data may be warranted in the setting of a competing mortality risk from this widespread pandemic.","output":"Breast radiotherapy under COVID-19 pandemic resource constraints -- approaches to defer or shorten treatment from a Comprehensive Cancer Center in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder displaying a typical neuroinflammation pathology that may result from an imbalance between regulatory T cells (Treg) and T helper 17 (Th17) cells. Human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (Ad-MSCs) exert immunomodulatory effects by inhibiting effector T cell responses and have been used to treat diverse immune disorders. We aimed to investigate the modulating effect of human Ad-MSCs on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with PD, focusing on differentiation into Th17 and Treg cells. Methods: We isolated human peripheral blood CD4+T cells and co-cultured them with Ad-MSCs at a ratio of 4:1 under either Th17 or Treg cell polarizing conditions for 4 days to detect the proportions of IL-17-producing CD4+T (Th17) and CD4+CD25+Foxp3+regulatory T (Treg) cells by flow cytometry. We also determined the mRNA expression levels of the retinoid-related orphan nuclear receptor (ROR?3t) transcription factor and those of interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R), interleukin-23 receptor (IL-23R), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and LIF receptor (LIFR) by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. We detected levels of cytokines in the supernatant (including LIF, IL-6, IL-23, IL-10, and TGF-?) using ELISA. Results: Our results showed that Ad-MSCs specifically inhibited the differentiation of PBMCs of patients with PD into IL-17-producing CD4+T cells by decreasing expressions of IL-6R, IL-23R, and ROR?3t (the key transcription factor for Th17 cells). Moreover, Ad-MSCs induced a functional CD4+CD25+Foxp3+T regulatory cell phenotype as evidenced by the secretion of IL-10. The levels of IL-6, IL-23, and TGF-? remained constant after co-culture under either the Th17 or the Treg cell polarizing condition. In addition, levels of LIF protein and its receptor mRNA were significantly increased under both polarizing conditions. Conclusion: The present in vitro study found that Ad-MSCs from healthy participants were able to correct the imbalance between Th17 and Treg found in PBMCs of PD patients, which were correlated with an increase in LIF secretion and a decrease in expression of IL-6R, IL-23R, and ROR?3t.

The distinction between apoptosis as a genetically controlled mechanism, and necrosis, which was viewed as an unregulated process, has blurred with the ever-increasing number of necrotic-like death subroutines underpinned by genetically defined pathways. It is therefore pertinent to ask whether any of them apply to neuronal cell death in tauopathies. Although Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent tauopathy, tauopathies comprise an array of over 30 diseases in which the cytoplasmic protein tau aggregates in neurons, and also, in some diseases, in glia. Animal models have sought to distil the contribution of tau aggregation to the cell death process but despite intensive research, no one mechanism of cell death has been unequivocally defined. The process of tau aggregation, and the fibrillar structures that form, touch on so many cellular functions that there is unlikely to be a simple linear pathway of death; as one is blocked another is likely to take the lead. It is timely to ask how far we have advanced into defining whether any of the molecular players in the new death subroutines participate in the death process. Here we briefly review the currently known cell death routines and explore what is known about their participation in tau aggregation-related cell death. We highlight the involvement of cell autonomous and the more recent non-cell autonomous pathways that may enhance tau-aggregate toxicity, and discuss recent findings that implicate microglial phagocytosis of live neurons with tau aggregates as a mechanism of death.","output":"Tau aggregation and its relation to selected forms of neuronal cell death"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the beginning of 2020, the whole world has been struggling with the pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.

Several studies suggest that some single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ACE2 might be a risk factor of COVID-19 infection. Genotypes affect ACE2 structure, its serum concentration, and levels of circulating angiotensin (1-7).

There is no direct evidence yet for ACE-I or ARBs in the treatment of COVID-19. However, for those already taking these medications, both the European Society of Cardiology and the American College of Cardiology recommend continuing the treatment, because at present, there is no clear clinical or scientific evidence to justify the discontinuation of ACE-I or ARBs.

Lung injury causes systemic inflammation, which disrupts gut barrier integrity, increasing the permeability to gut microbes and their products. This exacerbates inflammation, resulting in positive feedback. We applied a multi-omic systems biology approach to investigate the potential link between loss of gut barrier integrity and Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity. Methods: We analyzed plasma samples from age and gender-matched COVID-19 patients (n=60) with varying disease severity (mild, moderate, and severe) and 20 SARS-CoV2 negative controls. We measured markers and drivers of tight junction permeability and microbial translocation using ELISA;inflammation and immune activation markers using ELISA and multiplex cytokine arrays;untargeted metabolomic and lipidomic analyses using mass spectrometry;and plasma glycomes using capillary electrophoresis and lectin microarray. False discovery rate (FDR) was calculated to account for multiple comparisons. Results: Our data indicate, first, that severe COVID-19 is associated with a dramatic increase in the level of zonulin (FDR&lt;0.00001), the only known physiological driver of intestinal tight junction permeability. This increased permeability associated with translocation of both bacterial (LPS binding protein (LBP) levels) and fungal (-glucan levels) products into blood (FDR&lt;0.01). The degree of intestinal permeability and microbial translocation strongly correlated with increased systemic inflammation (correlations with IL-6 and other inflammatory cytokines and markers) (FDR&gt;0.05). Second, levels of metabolomic and lipidomic markers of gut and gut microbiota functionality including citrulline (a marker of healthy gut;decreased), succinic acid, and tryptophan catabolism metabolites (markers of microbial dysbiosis;increased) were disrupted during severe COVID-19 (FDR&lt;0.05). Finally, the gut microbiome is known to release enzymes that degrade plasma glycans, which regulate inflammation and complement activation. Indeed, severe COVID-19 was associated with loss of the anti-complement activation galactosylated glycans from plasma and IgG glycoproteins (FDR&lt;0.05).

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare levels of circulating extracellular vesicle tissue factor (EVTF) activity and active plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI\\\\1) in plasma from patients with COVID\\\\19 or sepsis. METHODS: We measured levels of d\\\\dimer, EVTF activity, and active PAI\\\\1 in plasma samples from patients with COVID\\\\19 (intensive care unit [ICU], N = 15; and non\\\\ICU, N = 20) and patients with sepsis (N = 35). RESULTS: Patients with COVID\\\\19 had significantly higher levels of d\\\\dimer, EVTF activity, and active PAI\\\\1 compared with healthy controls.

Consequently, there is a need for effective treatment options to improve cognitive functioning in these patients. In a healthy aging population, multidomain web-based lifestyle interventions have been found to be effective in preventing cognitive decline and improving cognitive functioning. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of the web-based lifestyle intervention Mijn Fitte Brein (My Fit Brain [MFB]) on cognitive functioning in patients with cancer returning to work. METHODS: The study consists of a feasibility study (N=10), followed by a randomized controlled trial (RCT; N=220). Patients will be recruited by their occupational physicians after their return to work following cancer treatment. Mijn Fitte Brein is organized into 4-week cycles in which patients set a lifestyle goal using the Goal Attainment Scale, receive weekly tips and support, and finally evaluate whether they succeeded in achieving this goal. Lifestyle goals are based on 6 domains: physical exercise, diet, sleep, stress, alcohol use, and smoking. In the feasibility study, data on user experience (structured interview) and usability, assessed with the Post-Study System Usability Scale, will be collected and used to optimize Mijn Fitte Brein. In the RCT, patients will be randomized 1:1 between an intervention group and a control group. Patients will be assessed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. The primary outcome measure is subjective cognitive functioning, assessed with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function (FACT-Cog). Secondary outcome measures are lifestyle, objective cognitive functioning, and work and psychosocial factors. RESULTS: Recruitment for the feasibility study has started in February 2020. As of July 2020, however, no patients have been enrolled (due to COVID-19 restrictions). The findings of the feasibility study will be used to optimize the Mijn Fitte Brein intervention. Enrollment for the RCT will continue when possible. The feasibility study will take 6 months (including making adjustments to the intervention), and the RCT will take 2 years. The final results are expected in 2024. The results of the feasibility study and the RCT will be published in peer-reviewed journals. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first time the feasibility and efficacy of a multidomain web-based lifestyle intervention will be studied in patients with cancer. If Mijn Fitte Brein is found to be effective in decreasing cognitive complaints in these patients returning to work, it will be a promising treatment option because of being both affordable and accessible.

As of 9 February 2020, cases have been reported in 25 countries, including probable human-to-human transmission in England. We adapted an existing national-scale metapopulation model to capture the spread of COVID-19 in England and Wales. We used 2011 census data to inform population sizes and movements, together with parameter estimates from the outbreak in China. We predict that the epidemic will peak 126 to 147 days (approx. 4 months) after the start of person-to-person transmission in the absence of controls. Assuming biological parameters remain unchanged and transmission persists from February, we expect the peak to occur in June. Starting location and model stochasticity have a minimal impact on peak timing. However, realistic parameter uncertainty leads to peak time estimates ranging from 78 to 241 days following sustained transmission. Seasonal changes in transmission rate can substantially impact the timing and size of the epidemic. We provide initial estimates of the epidemic potential of COVID-19. These results can be refined with more precise parameters. Seasonal changes in transmission could shift the timing of the peak into winter, with important implications for healthcare capacity planning.

Our aim is to predict the impact of the compulsory containment on COVID-19 spread. Earlier knowledge of the epidemic characteristics of COVID-19 transmission related to Morocco will be of great interest to establish an optimal plan-of-action to control the epidemic. Method: Using a Susceptible-Asymptomatic-Infectious model and the data of reported cumulative confirmed cases in Morocco from March 2nd to April 9, 2020, we determined the basic and control reproduction numbers and we estimated the model parameter values. Furthermore, simulations of different scenarios of containment are performed. Results: Epidemic characteristics are predicted according to different rates of containment. The basic reproduction number is estimated to be 2.9949, with CI(2.6729-3.1485). Furthermore, a threshold value of containment rate, below which the epidemic duration is postponed, is determined. Conclusion: Our findings show that the basic reproduction number reflects a high speed of spread of the epidemic. Furthermore, the compulsory containment can be efficient if more than 73% of population are confined. However, even with 90% of containment, the end-time is estimated to happen on July 4th which can be harmful and lead to consequent social-economic damages. Thus, containment need to be accompanied by other measures such as mass testing to reduce the size of asymptomatic population. Indeed, our sensitivity analysis investigation shows that the COVID-19 dynamics depends strongly on the asymptomatic duration as well as the contact and containment rates. Our results can help the Moroccan government to anticipate the spread of COVID-19 and avoid human loses and consequent social-economic damages as well.","output":"A first study on the impact of containment measure on COVID-19 spread in Morocco"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"New approaches to rapid, simple, in vitro diagnostic immunoassays that do not rely on centralized laboratory facilities are urgently needed for disease diagnosis and to inform treatment strategies. The recent and ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized that rapid diagnostics are needed to help guide government policies on quarantines, social distancing measures, and community lockdowns. A common approach to developing new immunoassays is to modify existing platforms (e.g., automated ELISA and lateral flow assays) for the new analyte, even though this does not address the drawbacks of existing platforms. An alternate approach is to search for robust assays that have been superseded but could in fact solve important challenges using modern technologies. Immunodiffusion is one such platform based on unique \\"precipitin ring\\" patterns formed in gels or paper following interactions between proteins and cognate antibodies in diffusion/reaction systems. Herein, we investigate the microstructure of these precipitin rings using a combination of fluorescence and electron microscopy and also perform a mass spectrometry investigation to determine the proteomic composition of the rings. We observed that the rings were composed of microparticles, which we termed \\"precipitin complexes\\", and that these complexes were composed of at least 19 key proteins, including immunoglobulins and complement factors along with a range of plasma proteins, possibly related to immune complexes and/or high-density lipoprotein particles.

The present study aims to evaluate the hydrochemical facies and the vulnerability to nitrates of 59 springs falling in the Sila Massif in Calabria (southern Italy) and to identify their vulnerability through the analysis of physicochemical parameters and the use of the Langelier-Ludwig diagram. A spatial analysis was performed by the spline method. The results identified a mean value of 4.39 mg NO3-/L and a maximum value of 24 mg NO3-/L for nitrate pollution in the study area. Statistical analysis results showed that the increase in electrical conductivity follows the increase in alkalinity values, a correlation especially evident in the bicarbonate Ca-Mg waters and linked to the possibility of higher nitrate concentrations in springs. These analyses also showed that nitrate vulnerability is dependent on the geological setting of springs. Indeed, the Sila igneous-metamorphic batholith, often strongly affected by weathering processes, contributes to not buffering the nitrate impacts on aquifers.

In all probability, the advent of COVID-19 has substantially raised these levels. The present study measured the emotional state of university students during lockdown and identified the relevant situational and psychological factors. To this end, 1,297 French university students were assessed during lockdown, which lasted from 16 March to 11 May in France. Situational factors included the belief that lockdown was compromising their future job prospects, COVID-19 symptoms, and health concerns. Psychological factors included students' implicit theory of emotion, and the coping strategies they used during lockdown. We explored the extent to which these factors were associated with levels of hassles, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Results indicated that students' belief that lockdown was compromising their future job prospects was positively related to hassles (r = .34, p < .001), while concerns about their own health and that of relatives were positively associated with anxiety (r = .37 and .34; p < .001). In addition, use of the positive reframing coping strategy mediated the effect of students' implicit theory of emotion on their depressive symptoms. Even though the national lockdown is now over, the pandemic will continue to have a major impact on university students over the coming months.

Design: prospective, bench-to-bedside Setting: A primary care-based study using filtering facepiece particles (FFP) type 2 respirators without exhalation valve (3M Aura 1862+, Maco Pharma ZZM002), FFP2 respirators with valve (3M Aura 9322+ and San Huei 2920V), and valved FFP type 3 respirators (Safe Worker 1016). Interventions: All masks were reprocessed using a medical autoclave (34-minute total cycle time of steam sterilization, with 17 minutes at 121 degrees Celsius) and subsequently tested up to 3 times whether these decontaminated respirators retained their integrity (seal check, pressure drop) and ability to filter small particles (0.3-5.0 microns) in the laboratory using a particle penetration test. Results: We tested 32 respirators, and 63 samples for filter capacity. All 27 FFP-2 respirators retained their shape, whereas half of the sterilized FFP-3 respirators (Safe Worker 1116) showed deformities and failed the seal check. The filtering capacity of the 3M Aura 1862 was best retained after 1, 2, and 3 sterilization cycles (0.3 microns: 99.3+/-0.3% (new) versus 97.0+/-1.3, 94.2+/-1.3% or 94.4+/-1.6, p<0.001). Of the other FFP-2 respirators, the San Huei 2920V had 95.5+/-0.7% at baseline versus 92.3+/-1.7% versus 90.0+/-0.7 after one- and two-time sterilization, respectively (p<0.001). The tested FFP-3 respirator (Safe Worker 1016) had a filter capacity of 96.5+/-0.7% at baseline and 60.3+/-5.7% after one-time sterilization (p<0.001). Breathing and pressure resistance tests indicated no relevant pressure changes between respirators that were used once, twice or thrice.

No therapeutics have yet been proven effective for treating severe COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell infusion may be effective and safe for the treatment of severe COVID-19. METHODS: Patients with severe COVID-19 were randomly divided into 2 groups: the standard treatment group and the standard treatment plus hUC-MSC infusion group. The incidence of progression from severe to critical illness, 28-day mortality, clinical symptom improvement, time to clinical symptom improvement, hematologic indicators including C-reactive protein, lymphocyte number, and interleukin 6, and imaging changes were observed and compared between the two groups. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The incidence of progression from severe to critical illness and the 28-day mortality rate were 0 in the hUC-MSC treatment group, while 4 patients in the control group deteriorated to critical condition and received invasive ventilation; 3 of them died, and the 28-day mortality rate was 10.34%. In the hUC-MSC treatment group, the time to clinical improvement was shorter than that in the control group. Clinical symptoms of weakness and fatigue, shortness of breath, and low oxygen saturation obviously improved beginning on the third day of stem cell infusion and reached a significant difference on day 7. CRP and IL-6 levels were significantly lower from day 3 of infusion, the time for the lymphocyte count to return to the normal range was significantly faster, and lung inflammation absorption was significantly shorter on CT imaging in the hUC-MSC group than in the control group.

Rapid balance recovery reaction with adequate range-of-motion and fast response and movement time are crucial to minimize fall risk and prevent serious injurious falls when postural disturbances occur. A Kinect-based Rapid Movement Training (RMT) program was developed to provide real-time feedback to promote faster and larger arm reaching and leg stepping distances toward targets in 22 different directions. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of the interactive RMT and Conventional Balance Training (CBT) on chronic stroke survivors overall balance and balance recovery reaction. METHODS: In this assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial, chronic stroke survivors were randomized to receive twenty training sessions (60-min each) of either RMT or CBT. Pre- and post-training assessments included clinical tests, as well as kinematic measurements and electromyography during simulated forward fall through a lean-and-release perturbation system. RESULTS: Thirty participants were recruited (RMT = 16, CBT = 14). RMT led to significant improvement in balance control (Berg Balance Scale: pre = 49.13, post = 52.75; P = .001), gait control (Timed-Up-and-Go Test: pre = 14.66 s, post = 12.62 s; P = .011), and motor functions (Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Motor Recovery: pre = 60.63, post = 65.19; P = .015), which matched the effectiveness of CBT. Both groups preferred to use their non-paretic leg to take the initial step to restore stability, and their stepping legs rectus femoris reacted significantly faster post-training (P = .036).

The findings revealed the public predominantly blames national governments for the coronavirus pandemic. In addition, the results documented the explosion of conspiracy theories among social media users regarding the virus origin. In the early stages of the pandemic, the blame tendency was most frequent to conspiracy theories and restriction of information from the government, whilst in the later months, responsibility had shifted to political leaders and the media. The findings indicate an emerging government mistrust that may result in disregard of preventive health behaviours and the amplification of conspiracy theories, and an evolving dynamic of blame.

This study examined whether Ohioans' pre-existing medical health diagnoses affected their belief about personal health risk and their compliance with social distancing during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Prior research examining physical and mental diagnoses and social distancing compliance is nearly nonexistent. We examined whether physical and mental health diagnoses influenced individuals' beliefs that their health is at risk and their adherence with social distancing guidelines. Methods: The study used longitudinal cohort data from the Toledo Adolescent Relationships Study (TARS) (n = 790), which surveyed Ohioans prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Dependent variables included belief that an individual's own health was at risk and social distancing compliance. Independent variables included physical and mental health diagnoses, pandemic-related factors (fear of COVID-19, political beliefs about the pandemic, friends social distance, family social distance, COVID-19 exposure), and sociodemographic variables (age, gender, race/ethnicity, educational level). Results: Individuals who had a pre-existing physical health diagnosis were more likely to believe that their personal health was at risk during the pandemic but were not more likely to comply with social distancing guidelines. In contrast, individuals who had a pre-existing mental health diagnosis were more compliant with social distancing guidelines but were not more likely to believe their personal health was at risk. Individuals who expressed greater fear of COVID-19 believed their health is more at risk than those who expressed lower levels of fear. Conclusion: Health considerations are important to account for in assessments of responses to the pandemic, beliefs about personal health risk, and social distancing behavior. Additional research is needed to understand the divergence in the findings regarding physical health, beliefs about personal health risk, and social distancing compliance. Further, research is needed to understand how mental health issues impact decision-making related to social distancing compliance.","output":"The Relationship Between Medical Diagnoses, Risk Perceptions, and Social Distancing Compliance: An Analysis of Data from the Toledo Adolescent Relationships Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the beginning of the 2020 global COVID-2019 pandemic, Chinese financial markets acted as the epicentre of both physical and financial contagion.

METHODS: The outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia after IHCA over a 40-day period were retrospectively evaluated. Between January 15 and February 25, 2020, data for all cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) attempts for IHCA that occurred in a tertiary teaching hospital in Wuhan, China were collected according to the Utstein style. The primary outcome was restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), and the secondary outcomes were 30-day survival, and neurological outcome. RESULTS: Data from 136 patients showed 119 (87.5%) patients had a respiratory cause for their cardiac arrest, and 113 (83.1%) were resuscitated in a general ward. The initial rhythm was asystole in 89.7%, pulseless electrical activity (PEA) in 4.4%, and shockable in 5.9%. Most patients with IHCA were monitored (93.4%) and in most resuscitation (89%) was initiated <1a?min. The average length of hospital stay was 7 days and the time from illness onset to hospital admission was 10 days. The most frequent comorbidity was hypertension (30.2%), and the most frequent symptom was shortness of breath (75%). Of the patients receiving CPR, ROSC was achieved in 18 (13.2%) patients, 4 (2.9%) patients survived for at least 30 days, and one patient achieved a favourable neurological outcome at 30 days.

The misclassification of COVID-19 cases may even lead the death of the patients, and hence the diagnosis at early stage is important to stop further spread of the infection and to safeguard the life of the patients. This paper proposes the Aquila tuned Deep neural network (Aquila-DNN) classifier for the classification of COVID-19 patients using the chest image data assessed through Wireless sensor Network (WSN). The extraction of important features from the chest image data is important in the diagnosis as it encloses the important data of the patients. The optimal tuning of the DNN parameters using the Aquila Optimizer (AO) assists in improving the classification accuracy of proposed model. In addition, the convergence is also boosted using the tuning process of the AO algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed Aquila-DNN model is validated with the analysis of the model based on the performance indices, namely accuracy, ROC curve, and F1 measure. The testing accuracy and the training accuracy of Aquila-DNN model are attained to be 99.7%, and 95.4545%, respectively. ? 2022, Ismail Saritas.

The in situ formed high density of hydrophilic PEG outside greatly improves the stability and compatibility of NCs. The porosity of Cu2 O-PEG NCs shows the admirable capacity of doxorubicin (DOX) loading (DOX@Cu2 O-PEG NCs) and delivery.

The released Cu+ exerts Fenton-like catalytic activity to generate toxic OH from intracellular overexpressed hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) for CDT via reactive oxygen species (ROS)-involved oxidative damage. Exactly, DOX can not only induce cell death for chemotherapy but also enhance CDT by self-supplying endogenous H2 O2 . After the intravenous injection, Cu2 O-PEG NCs can effectively accumulate in tumor region via passive targeting improved by external high-density PEG shell.

Therefore, there is an urgent need for an updated systematic literature review that analyzes individual children rather than aggregated data in broad age groups. METHODS: Six databases (MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, Google Scholar, medRxiv) were searched for studies indexed from January 1 to May 15, 2020, with MeSH terms: children, pediatrics, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2. 1241 records were identified, of which only unique papers in English with individual patient information and documented COVID-19 testing were included. This review of 22 eligible studies followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses of individual participant data guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 123 patients from five countries were identified. 46% were females. The median age was 5 years (IQR = 8). At presentation, 62% had a fever, 32% had a cough, 58% had a single symptom, and 21% were asymptomatic. Abnormal chest imaging was seen in 62% (65/105) of imaged and 76.9% (20/26) of asymptomatic children. A minority of children had elevated platelets, CRP, lactate dehydrogenase, and D-dimer. CONCLUSION: Data from this independent participant data systematic review revealed that the majority of children with COVID-19 presented with either no symptoms or a single, non-respiratory symptom. IMPACT: This systematic review revealed that the majority of children with COVID-19 presented with either no symptoms or a single, non-respiratory symptom. By using an independent participant data approach, this analysis underscores the challenge of diagnosing COVID-19 in pediatric patients due to the wide variety of symptoms and seemingly poor correlation of imaging findings with symptomatic disease.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: This retrospective study included 85 patients (54 male and 31 female) with PCR-confirmed COVID-19. They underwent CT to assess the severity of pulmonary involvement. Three readers were asked to assess the pulmonary abnormalities and score the severity using five different systems, including chest CT severity score (CT-SS), chest CT score, total severity score (TSS), modified total severity score (m-TSS), and 3-level chest CT severity score. Time consumption on reporting of each system was calculated. RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-five observations were reported for each system. There was a statistically significant inter-observer agreement in assessing qualitative lung involvement using the m-TSS and the other four quantitative systems. The ROC curves revealed excellent and very good diagnostic accuracy for all systems when cutoff values for detection severe cases were > 22, > 17, > 12, and > 26 for CT-SS, chest CT score, TSS, and 3-level CT severity score. The AUC was very good (0.86), excellent (0.90), very good (0.89), and very good (0.86), respectively. Chest CT score showed the highest specificity (95.2%) in discrimination of severe cases. Time consumption on reporting was significantly different (< 0.001): CT-SS > 3L-CT-SS > chest CT score > TSS. CONCLUSION: All chest CT severity scoring systems in this study demonstrated excellent inter-observer agreement and reasonable performance to assess COVID-19 in relation to the clinical severity. CT-SS and TSS had the highest specificity and least time for interpretation. KEY POINTS: ? All chest CT severity scoring systems discussed in this study revealed excellent inter-observer agreement and reasonable performance to assess COVID-19 in relation to the clinical severity. ?

SETTING: Emergency department of a tertiary level hospital located in a metropolitan city of southern India. This centre is dedicated to neurological, neurosurgical and psychiatric care. PARTICIPANTS: Daily counts of TBI patients seen between 1 December 2019 and 3 January 2021 (400 days); n=8893. To compare the profile of TBI cases seen before and during the pandemic, a subset of these cases seen between 1 December 2019 and 31 July 2020 (244 days), n=5259, are studied in detail. RESULTS: An optimal changepoint is detected on 20 March 2020 following which the mean number of TBI cases seen every day has decreased and variance has increased (mean 1=29.4, variance 1=50.1; mean 2=19.5, variance 2=59.7, loglikelihood ratio test: (2)=130, df=1, p<0.001). Two principal components of community mobility, alcohol sales and weekday explain the change in the number of TBI cases (pseudo R(2)=58.1). A significant decrease in traffic accidents, falls, mild/moderate injuries and, an increase in assault and severe injuries is seen during the pandemic period. CONCLUSIONS: Decongestion of roads and regulation of alcohol sales can decrease TBI occurrence substantially.

After applying a series of inclusion/exclusion criteria, we kept 77 studies with 151 effect sizes. Two researchers then coded for seven sets of study features and student characteristics: technology roles, publication\\\\related features (years and resources), research design, sample size, grade levels, duration of interventions, and types of the testing instruments. The coding achieved acceptable levels of inter\\\\rater reliabilities. Since effect sizes varied across studies and student populations, random\\\\effects models were used for overall effect estimates and moderator analyses.Overall, this meta\\\\analysis revealed a small, positive, and statistically significant effect of technology on students' mathematics achievement with an average Hedges' s g (?) of 0.23. The largest significant moderator effects were found when technology was used to design and support collaborative and communicative environments (? = 0.49);the next\\\\largest moderator effects were found when using technology as supports for problem\\\\solving (? = 0.39), followed by the roles of as supports for conceptual development (? = 0.31) and as adaptive mathematics practices (? = 0.28). This study also found that the effects of technology were differentiated as a function of publication resources, research design, duration of intervention, and the testing instrument.Focusing on the roles and functions of technology, this study can contribute to guide potential synthetical studies as well as the future design of educational technology. In particular, technology is used effectively when it is used (a) to create and design a collaborative and communicative learning environment where students have chances to collaborate and interact with each other and (b) as supports for mathematics problem\\\\solving and for mathematics conceptual development. On the other hand, technology is less effective when it is used for monitoring and assessing students' learning processes without follow\\\\up instructions.The findings suggested that technology intervention lasting for a shorter time is the better choice. When technology is used for longer periods of instruction, maintaining its novelty and students curiosity should be considered. This study also suggested that incorporating computer\\\\adaptive testing in technology\\\\based intervention programs is more likely to detect technology effects as adaptive testing could continuously adjust to the abilities of individual students.

Patients with systemic vasculitis have an increased risk of serious infections and so may be at risk of severe outcomes following COVID-19. It is important to establish the risk factors for severe COVID-19 outcomes in these patients, including the impact of immunosuppressive therapies. METHODS: A multi-centre cohort was developed through the participation of centres affiliated with national UK and Ireland vasculitis registries. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were described. Logistic regression was used to evaluate associations between potential risk factors and severe COVID-19 outcome, defined as a requirement for advanced oxygen therapy, invasive ventilation, or death. RESULTS: Sixty-five cases of patients with systemic vasculitis who developed COVID-19 were reported (median age 70 years, 49% female) of whom 25 (38%) experienced a severe outcome. Most cases (55/65, 85%) had ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV). Almost all patients required hospitalization (59/65, 91%), 7 patients (11%) were admitted to intensive care and 18 patients (28%) died. Background glucocorticoid therapy was associated with severe outcome (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.7 (1.1-14.9, p=0.047)) as was comorbid respiratory disease (aOR 7.5 (1.9-38.2, p=0.006)). Vasculitis disease activity and non-glucocorticoid immunosuppression were not associated with severe outcome.

Nanoparticles were characterized with the transmission electron microscope and dynamic light scattering. The cytotoxicity of icaritin nanoparticles was analyzed by CCK-8, and in vitro target-selective intracellular uptake behaviors were observed using a laser confocal microscope.

However, their rate of use in German psychiatric inpatient routine care is low. The current study aimed to investigate the attitude of mental health care professionals working in inpatient care regarding internet-delivered interventions, including presumed benefits, barriers and facilitators. In total, 176 health professionals from ten inpatient psychiatric hospitals throughout Germany were surveyed on site. The professionals attitude towards internet-delivered interventions in inpatient care was assessed by an adapted version of the Attitude toward Telemedicine in Psychiatry and Psychotherapy (ATTiP) questionnaire. To identify benefits, barriers and facilitators, we developed open-response questions that were based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and analyzed by a qualitative content analysis. Professionals reported little experience or knowledge about internet-delivered interventions. Their attitude towards internet-delivered interventions in psychiatric inpatient care was rather indifferent. The most frequently mentioned potential benefits were an optimised treatment structure and patient empowerment; the most frequently anticipated barriers were too severe symptoms of patients, the feared neglect of face-to-face contacts and insufficient technical equipment; and the most frequently mentioned facilitators were high usability of the internet-based intervention, a sufficient functional level of the patient and further education of staff. For successful implementation in the inpatient sector, internet-delivered interventions must be adapted to the special needs of severely mentally ill patients and to the hospital management systems and workflow.

METHOD: This review synthesizes the literature from several sources on best practices, lessons learned, and strategies for virtual teams. Information from each article deemed relevant was then extracted and de-identified. Over 64 best practices were independently and blindly coded for relevancy for the swift deployment of virtual teams. RESULTS: As a result of this review, tips for virtual teams undergoing rapid transition to remote work were developed. These tips are organized at the organization, team, and individual levels. They are further categorized under six overarching themes: norm setting, performance monitoring, leadership, supportive mechanisms, communication, and flexibility. CONCLUSION: There is a significant deficit in the literature for best practices for virtual teams for the purposes of rapid deployment, leaving it to organizations to subjectively determine what advice to adhere to. This manuscript synthesizes relevant practices and provides insights into effective virtual team rapid deployment.","output":"Insights From the Virtual Team Science: Rapid Deployment During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The viewpoints on the control of innate immune cells by the adaptive immune system during sepsis remain controversial. Mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) is essential to the negative control of innate immunity and suppresses the activation of macrophages by inhibiting activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). The purpose of the current study was to observe inflammatory response and macrophage activation in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) with endotoxemia and to determine the role of MKP-1 in the control of macrophage activation by the adaptive immune system. Endotoxemia was induced in wild-type and SCID mice by an intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and all of the SCID mice died. SCID mice produced more inflammatory cytokines than BALB/c mice systemically and locally. TNF- mRNA expression was higher and MKP-1 mRNA expression was lower in peritoneal macrophages (PMa) from SCID mice compared to PMa from wild-type mice after and even before LPS injection. Thioglycollate-stimulated PMa from wild-type mice were stimulated with LPS in vitro in the presence or absence of pan-T cells. The levels of TNF- and IL-6 were higher in the supernatants from PMa cultured alone compared to PMa co-cultured with pan-T cells, and PMa MKP-1 mRNA and protein expression were higher when PMa were co-cultured with pan-T cells. Therefore, pan-T cells can up-regulate MKP-1 expression in macrophages and inhibit the secretion of inflammatory cytokines secretion by macrophages. In SCID mice, lymphocyte deficiency, especially T cell deficiency, causes insufficient MKP-1 expression in macrophages, which can be responsible for the severe inflammation and bad prognosis of septic SCID mice. MKP-1 plays an important role in the control of macrophage activation by the adaptive immune system.","output":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 expression in macrophages is controlled by lymphocytes during macrophage activation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A new equine coronavirus was isolated from the feces of adult horses with pyrogenic and enteric disease. The disease outbreak was mainly observed among 2- to 4-year-old horses living in stables of a draft-horse racetrack in Japan. On comparing the isolated virus (isolate Tokachi09) with the equine coronavirus NC99 strain, no significant differences were observed in several biological properties such as hemagglutinating activity, antigenicity (in indirect immunofluorescence and neutralization tests), and one-step growth (in cell culture). The sequences of the nucleocapsid and spike genes of isolate Tokachi09 showed identical size (1341 and 4092 nucleotides, 446 and 1363 amino acids, respectively) and high similarity (98.0% and 99.0% at the nucleotides, 97.3% and 99.0% at the amino acids, respectively) to those of strain NC99. However, the isolate had a 185-nucleotide deletion from four bases after the 3-terminal end of the spike gene, resulting in the absence of the open reading frame predicted to encode a 4.7-kDa nonstructural protein in strain NC99. These results suggest that the 4.7-kDa nonstructural protein is not essential for viral replication, at least in cell culture, and that the Japanese strain probably originated from a different lineage to the North American strain. This is the first equine coronavirus to be isolated from adult horses with pyrogenic and enteric disease.","output":"Isolation of an equine coronavirus from adult horses with pyrogenic and enteric disease and its antigenic and genomic characterization in comparison with the NC99 strain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the midst of the debate about vaccines against COVID-19 and vaccine mandates, there are a surprisingly large number of concerns coming from some churches centring on the dependence of some of the vaccines on historic abortions and limitations of freedom of choice. Although the ethical significance of separation between historic abortions and the vaccines has been widely accepted by most religious authorities, the pandemic has led to renewed concern by some. The emergence of vaccine mandates, with their potential negative impact on church attendance, has led some to oppose anything that would limit freedom of choice. Within this opposition is a medley of other messages, such as lack of trust in experts and human rights violations. Some regard vaccine passports as a form of medical apartheid or therapeutic totalitarianism, coercing peoples conscience. A countervailing perspective is provided by most church organizations that take a far more communitarian view based upon Jesus teachings, identification with the poor and marginalized, and public health considerations. These Christians place far greater store on science as a gift from God, medical science as a means of transforming societies for good, and the potential of vaccines to control a rampant pandemic. Flexibility in imposing vaccine mandates is essential with onus placed on protecting the vulnerable, the community, and directed by the biblical precept of love for ones neighbour.","output":"Religious Concerns About COVID-19 Vaccines: From Abortion to Religious Freedom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main objective of this research work is to solve multiple object tracking problems in a given frame, wherein the proposed model intends to identify and track various objects. The problem has been solved in three stages viz. detecting, identifying, and tracking the object in a particular zone, i.e., but it is observed that something more could be done in this field, mostly the MOT-A score was not up to the mark;hence the proposed research work utilized Kalman filters for obtaining enhanced results and compared the obtained MOT-A metric with previous works, and the results were good. Object detection and recognition occur via the YOLO algorithm, which enables us to classify the objects into 80 classes. Then, Motion Prediction and feature generation occur in which an estimation model is created, and Kalman filters are used to model these states for capturing moving objects in the frame. Finally, tracking takes place with Kalman filters in the previous frame, and newly detected objects are placed in the current frame, after which an association is made for new detection. All this is done via the DeepSORT algorithm, which is essentially a Deep association metric with the SORT algorithm. Here, Kalman filters are used as they improved the accuracy of the proposed model and yielded better results. On the same lines, YOLO is used to perform object detection and recognition at the same time. It is also a detector, which by applying a single neural network, it can predict the bounding boxes and perform multi-class classification. This problem can have various applications, especially in traffic management. It can also prevent people from gathering during COVID times and raising an alert for all the authorities. Hence, this is a multidisciplinary approach wherein the work of object detection is being used in various fields like crowd assembling, Surveillance, Animal management in Zoo/Biodiversity parks as well as in the case of traffic systems as well. The real motivation behind this work was using the state-of-the-art technology to solve the modern-day problems. Manually human vigilance in large areas is a utopian task and especially when surveillance and security is big threat out there. Adding to it is the COVID Pandemic which has claimed millions of lives and yet vaccination is a still a dream yet to be realized. Hence, cluster identification problem is considered and also the ways to solve this challenge using the state-of-the-art technology. Once it has been achieved, it is initiated further to find more applications of this technology in various other domains and found out how it is applied in various use cases in case of crowd gathering at a single point and how this is a similar problem in case of animal gathering at a point and how forest rangers can solve the problem in a more efficient way. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Object tracking and counting in a zone using YOLOv4, DeepSORT and TensorFlow"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the major causes of acute lower respiratory tract infection worldwide The absence of a commercial vaccine and the limited success of current therapeutic strategies against RSV make further research necessary We used a multi-cohort analysis approach to investigate host transcriptomic biomarkers and shed further light on the molecular mechanism underlying RSV-host interactions We meta-analyzed seven transcriptome microarray studies from the public Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository containing a total of 922 samples, including RSV, healthy controls, coronaviruses, enteroviruses, influenzas, rhinoviruses, and coinfections, from both adult and pediatric patients We identified &gt;1500 genes differentially expressed when comparing the transcriptomes of RSV-infected patients against healthy controls Functional enrichment analysis showed several pathways significantly altered, including immunologic response mediated by RSV infection, pattern recognition receptors, cell cycle, and olfactory signaling In addition, we identified a minimal 17-transcript host signature specific for RSV infection by comparing transcriptomic profiles against other respiratory viruses These multi-genic signatures might help to investigate future drug targets against RSV infection","output":"A Meta-Analysis of Multiple Whole Blood Gene Expression Data Unveils a Diagnostic Host-Response Transcript Signature for Respiratory Syncytial Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents new high-frequency data on trade policy changes targeting medical and food products since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, documenting how countries used trade policy instruments in response to the health crisis on a week-by-week basis.

A major clinical question is whether it is safe to undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) shortly after COVID-19 infection. A total of 21 patients received HSCT following a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection at our institution between 7/30/2020 and 4/14/2021. The majority (n=13, 62%) received an allogeneic (ALLO) HSCT from an HLA-matched related (n=5), -matched unrelated (n=6), or haploidentical (n=2) donor. The remaining 8 patients received autologous (AUTO) HSCT. Among ALLO-HSCT recipients, 4 (31%), 5 (38%), 3 (23%), and 1 (8%) patients had grade 1, 2, 3, and 4, manifestations respectively, scored according to the WHO COVID-19 infection severity grading system. Among AUTO-HSCT recipients, 5 (62%), 1 (12%), and 2 (25%) patients had grade 0, 1, and 2 manifestations, respectively. All patients had resolution of COVID-19 symptoms before HSCT. In recipients of ALLO-SCT, the median time from diagnosis of the COVID infection to HSCT was 134 (range: 55-311) days. Median age of recipients was 53 (range: 17-71) years and the majority (69%) of patients were male. Only one patient was <18 years old, and 38% were >60 years. Patients received ALLO-HSCT for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (n=7, 54%), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=2, 15%), chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (n=2, 15%), and Hodgkin's (n=1, 8%) or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n=1, 15%). Most (62%) patients were not in remission at the time of HSCT. The median hematopoietic cell transplant-co-morbidity index (HCT-CI) score was 3 (range 0-6); one patient had a history of diabetes and another of hypertension before HSCT. Conditioning regimen was myeloablative in 61%, and stem cell source was peripheral blood (PB) in 92% of transplants. Median time to neutrophils engraftment was 15 (range: 10-20) days. With a median follow-up of 3.5 (range: 0.4-8) months since ALLO-HSCT, two patients died and another two experienced progression of the underlying malignancy. Three patients were diagnosed with grade 2 and none with grade 3 or 4 acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). The deaths occurred among patients with COVID-19 infection grade 2 and 3. The primary cause of death was attributed to alveolar hemorrhage/pneumonitis (no organism identified) and acute GvHD, respectively. Overall survival was 89% (95% confidence interval [CI]:43-98) and 76% (95% CI 33-93) at 3 and 6 months, respectively. In recipients of AUTO-HSCT, the median time from diagnosis of the COVID-19 infection to HSCT was 55 (range: 20-157) days. Median age of recipients was 55 (range: 34-75) years, and the majority (62%) of patients were male. One (12%) patient was >60 years. Patients received AUTO-HSCT for treatment of Hodgkin's (n=1, 15%) or non-Hodgkin's (n=4, 50%) lymphoma, or multiple myeloma (n=3, 37%). Six (75%) patients were in remission at the time of HSCT. The median HCT-CI score was 2 (range 0-6). None of the patients had a history of diabetes or hypertension before transplant. Conditioning regimen was myeloablative and stem cell source was PB for all patients. Median time to neutrophils engraftment was 10 (range: 9-13) days. With a median follow-up of 4 (range: 0.8-9) months since AUTO-HSCT, one patient with grade 1 COVID infection died as a result of a candida/cytomegalovirus infection, and none of the patients experienced progression of the underlying malignancy. Overall survival was 100% and 75% (95% CI 13-96) at 3 and 6 months respectively. After HSCT, one ALLO and two AUTO asymptomatic patients had a positive nasal swab COVID-19 PCR assay possibly due to delayed shedding of the virus. None of the 21 patients developed active COVID infections post-transplant. In conclusion, allogeneic and autologous hematopoietic transplantation can be performed in patients after COVID-19 infection. Two of 13 allogeneic and one of 8 autologous recipients experienced non-relapse mortality, none directly related to COVID-19 infection. Patients recovering from COVID-19 infection should be considered eligible for hematopoietic transplantation as clinically indicated.

The present study aimed to investigate the experiences of operating room health care professionals' regarding the COVID-19 pandemic challenges in southern Iran. METHODS: This is a descriptive qualitative study. The required data were collected using in-depth and semi-structured interviews. Accordingly, 19 operating room health care professions were included in this study through purposive sampling. The data were collected from February 2020 to August 2021 and then analyzed using the Granheim and Lundmans method. RESULTS: Three main themes and 9 sub-themes were presented in this study. They included: 1- Challenges of applying protocols and standards of care in the COVID-19 pandemic in the operating room (lack of specific guidelines regarding care protocols and standards for crisis management of Covid-19 in the operating room and impossibility of keeping social distance in the operating room). 2- Professional challenges (tedious and hard work, professional burnout, lack of adequate support by the managers and lack of personal protective equipment). 3-Psychological crises (indescribable anxiety and worry, parenting stress, and weakened resilience). CONCLUSION: Based on the findings of the present study, it was indicated that lack of a specific guideline in the COVID-19 pandemic led to a sense of indecision and confusion among operating room staff. In this regard, performing tedious tasks, feelings of tiredness and exhaustion, lack of support by the authorities, and lack of access to adequate facilities and equipment were reported as the professional challenges of the healthcare staff in the current COVID-19 pandemic, which consequently affected the quality of care and patients safety.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of brief hyperoxic exposures on regional cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (rStO2 ) and to evaluate whether any observed prolonged cerebral vasoconstriction was related to maturity. METHODS The study included 30 infants with a postmenstrual age of more than 32 weeks, who were treated with nasal continuous positive airway pressure and a fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.3. The INVOS 5100C oximeter was used to measure rStO2 before, during and after two hyperoxic exposures. If hyperoxia induced a prolonged cerebral vasoconstriction, posthyperoxic rStO2 would be expected to decrease. RESULTS rStO2 increased slightly after the first hyperoxic exposure, with a mean difference of 1.37% (95% CI 0.15, 2.6). After the second oxygen exposure, rStO2 remained unchanged with a mean difference of -0.4% (95% CI -1.6, 0.78).

These spatially resolved transcriptomics make it feasible to examine the complex multicellular systems of different microenvironments. To answer scientific questions with spatial transcriptomics and expand our understanding of how cell types and states are regulated by microenvironment, the first step is to identify cell clusters by integrating the available spatial information. Here, we introduce SC-MEB, an empirical Bayes approach for spatial clustering analysis using a hidden Markov random field. We have also derived an efficient expectation-maximization algorithm based on an iterative conditional mode for SC-MEB. In contrast to BayesSpace, a recently developed method, SC-MEB is not only computationally efficient and scalable to large sample sizes but is also capable of choosing the smoothness parameter and the number of clusters. We performed comprehensive simulation studies to demonstrate the superiority of SC-MEB over some existing methods. We applied SC-MEB to analyze the spatial transcriptome of human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissues and mouse hypothalamic preoptic region. Our analysis results showed that SC-MEB can achieve a similar or better clustering performance to BayesSpace, which uses the true number of clusters and a fixed smoothness parameter. Moreover, SC-MEB is scalable to large sample sizes. We then employed SC-MEB to analyze a colon dataset from a patient with colorectal cancer (CRC) and COVID-19, and further performed differential expression analysis to identify signature genes related to the clustering results. The heatmap of identified signature genes showed that the clusters identified using SC-MEB were more separable than those obtained with BayesSpace. Using pathway analysis, we identified three immune-related clusters, and in a further comparison, found the mean expression of COVID-19 signature genes was greater in immune than non-immune regions of colon tissue. SC-MEB provides a valuable computational tool for investigating the structural organizations of tissues from spatial transcriptomic data.","output":"SC-MEB: spatial clustering with hidden Markov random field using empirical Bayes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 are common among adults.

We identified neuropsychiatric symptoms in intervals prior to, and following, this testing using a previously-derived set of ICD-10 codes and natural language processing terms. Primary analysis examined sociodemographic features associated with presence of at least one incident (i.e., new-onset) neuropsychiatric symptom between 90 and 150 days after an initial positive test for COVID-19. Results: Among 5058 children (50% female, 2.9% Asian, 6.3% Black, and 63% White; 30% Hispanic; mean age was 12.4 (IQR 8.9-15.6), 366 (7.2%) exhibited at least one new-onset neuropsychiatric symptom between 90 and 150 days following initial SARS-CoV-2 test positivity. The most common incident symptoms at 90-150 days were headache (2.4%), mood and anxiety symptoms (2.4%), cognitive symptoms (2.3%), and fatigue (1.1%). In regression models, older children, girls, those with Hispanic ethnicity, those with public versus private insurance, and those with greater overall burden of medical comorbidity were more likely to exhibit subsequent symptoms.

METHODS: To explore the dimensional structure of the scale we tested a one-factor model. The evaluation employed explanatory and confirmatory factor analyses and tested reliability and stability. To determine the convergent validity of the WEMWBS we analysed correlations among wellbeing and life satisfaction and risk depression. To examine sensitivity of the WEMWBS scale to detect a population with different levels of health-related behaviours we used Students t test. RESULTS: The results presented confirm that the psychometric properties of the Polish adaptation of WEMWBS are very good. Using EFA and CFA it was shown that a one-factor solution is optimal. Reliability, measured using the Cronbachs alpha coefficient and McDonald's omega proved to be very high. The estimation of the stability of the Polish version of the WEMWBS proved to be high. Our validation studies also provided data demonstrating sensitivity of the WEMWBS to detect a population with different levels of health-related behaviours, indicating that group with high level of pro-health behaviours achieved higher WEMWBS wellbeing results than group with low level of pro-health behaviours. CONCLUSIONS: WEMWBS was confirmed as a short, reliable and valid measure with good psychometric properties. Due to the high indicators for its psychometric properties, the scale may therefore prove to be a particularly useful tool not only in empirical research, but also in mental wellbeing monitoring, and could serve as support in educational and preventive.","output":"Factor structure and psychometric properties of a Polish adaptation of the WarwickCEdinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectif: Evaluer la qualit des supports de communication de crise, au cours de la pandmie de la COVID-19, dans trois pays du Grand Maghreb (Tunisie, Algrie, Maroc).

Objective: To objectively assess the quality of crisis communication media, during the COVID-19 pandemic, in the three Greater Maghreb countries (Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco). Methods: A compliance audit for press releases and epidemiological bulletins was analyzed against a quality benchmark, which had been specifically designed by the authors. This framework, made up of five dimensions and 50 items, graded (0/1), was applied by two researchers in preventive medicine. Multiplying the scores by a coefficient of two resulted in a partial score of 20 points for each dimension and a total score of 100 points for the checklist taken as a whole. The quality of the communication media was considered to be good when exceeding the thresholds of 15/20 for the different dimensions and 75/100 for the entire grid. Results: A total of 141 information media were included in this audit (Tunisia: 60; Algeria: 60; Morocco: 21). The overall median quality score for these media was only 56/100 (IIQ: [46-58]), without major variability between countries. The most appreciated dimension was maintaining the confidence of the population, with an overall median score of 14/20 (12/20 for epidemiological bulletins and 16/20 for press releases).

Consistent with theories about the psychology of conspiracy beliefs, these calls predict that a lack of transparency may reduce trust in health authorities and may facilitate the spread of conspiracy theories, which may limit the long-term capabilities of health authorities during and after the pandemic. On the basis of preregistered experiments conducted on large, representative samples of Americans and Danes (N > 13,000), the current study contrasts the effects of vague vaccine communication with transparent communication, which discloses either positive or negative vaccine features. The evidence demonstrates that transparent negative communication may indeed harm vaccine acceptance here and now but that it increases trust in health authorities. Furthermore, the alternative of vague, reassuring communication does not increase vaccine acceptance either and leads to both lower trust and higher endorsement of conspiracy theories.","output":"Transparent communication about negative features of COVID-19 vaccines decreases acceptance but increases trust"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Racial and ethnic disparities remain a public health problem and are largely due to social determinants of health (SDOH).

Participants described increases in knowledge, self-efficacy, and activities related to leadership and advocacy at all levels of the social ecological model. We also found a significant increase in communicating with Louisiana state senators or representatives (p < .0339). Our findings show that an adapted CHW training curriculum focused on SDOH, leadership, and advocacy can be used to train lay community residents in how to make changes in the community conditions that affect health and prompt new engagement to address SDOH at all levels of the social ecological model. Future efforts to increase lay community participation in addressing SDOH may benefit from providing ongoing support to participants such as organizing meetings with residents interested in similar topics, offering opportunities to \\"shadow\\" experienced CHWs, or hosting additional skills building workshops.","output":"Action to Improve Social Determinants of Health: Outcomes of Leadership and Advocacy Training for Community Residents."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent infodemic increased concerns about Twitters role in advancing antivaccination messages, even before a vaccine became available to the public. New computational methods allow for analysis of cross-platform use by tracking links to websites shared over Twitter, which, in turn, can uncover some of the content and dynamics of information sources and agenda-setting processes. Such understanding can advance theory and efforts to reduce misinformation. OBJECTIVE: Informed by agenda-setting theory, this study aimed to identify the content and temporal patterns of websites shared in vaccine-related tweets posted to COVID-19 conversations on Twitter between February and June 2020. METHODS: We used triangulation of data analysis methods. Data mining consisted of the screening of around 5 million tweets posted to COVID-19 conversations to identify tweets that related to vaccination and including links to websites shared within these tweets. We further analyzed the content the 20 most-shared external websites using a mixed methods approach. RESULTS: Of 841,896 vaccination-related tweets identified, 185,994 (22.1%) contained links to specific websites. A wide range of websites were shared, with the 20 most-tweeted websites constituting 14.5% (27,060/185,994) of the shared websites and typically being shared for only 2 to 3 days. Traditional media constituted the majority of these 20 websites, along with other social media and governmental sources. We identified markers of inauthentic propagation for some of these links. CONCLUSIONS: The topic of vaccination was prevalent in tweets about COVID-19 early in the pandemic. Sharing websites was a common communication strategy, and its bursty pattern and inauthentic propagation strategies pose challenges for health promotion efforts. Future studies should consider cross-platform use in dissemination of health information and in counteracting misinformation.","output":"Content and Dynamics of Websites Shared Over Vaccine-Related Tweets in COVID-19 Conversations: Computational Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a cytokine both vital to lung homeostasis and important in regulating inflammation and autoimmunity1,2,3 that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of respiratory failure and death in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and systemic hyperinflammation. 4-6 Mavrilimumab is a human anti GM-CSF receptor  monoclonal antibody capable of blocking GM-CSF signaling and downregulating the inflammatory process. Objectives: To evaluate the effect of mavrilimumab on clinical outcomes in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and systemic hyperinflammation. Methods: This on-going, global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled seamless transition Phase 2/3 trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mavrilimumab in adults hospitalized with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and hyperinflammation. The Phase 2 portion comprised two groups: Cohort 1 patients requiring supplemental oxygen therapy without mechanical ventilation (to maintain SpO2 92%) and Cohort 2 patients requiring mechanical ventilation, initiated 48 hours before randomization. Here, we report results for Phase 2, Cohort 1: 116 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and hyperinflammation from USA, Brazil, Chile, Peru, and South Africa;randomized 1:1:1 to receive a single intravenous administration of mavrilimumab (10 or 6 mg/kg) or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was proportion of patients alive and free of mechanical ventilation at Day 29. Secondary endpoints included [1] time to 2-point clinical improvement (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases COVID-19 ordinal scale), [2] time to return to room air, and [3] mortality, all measured through Day 29. The prespecified evidentiary standard was a 2-sided  of 0.2 (not adjusted for multiplicity). Results: Baseline demographics were balanced among the intervention groups;patients were racially diverse (43% non-white), had a mean age of 57 years, and 49% were obese (BMI  30). All patients received the local standard of care: 96% received corticosteroids (including dexamethasone) and 29% received remdesivir. No differences in outcomes were observed between the 10 mg/kg and 6 mg/ kg mavrilimumab arms. Results for these groups are presented together. Mavrilimumab recipients had a reduced requirement for mechanical ventilation and improved survival: at day 29, the proportion of patients alive and free of mechanical ventilation was 12.3 percentage points higher with mavrilimumab (86.7% of patients) than placebo (74.4% of patients) (Primary endpoint;p=0.1224). Mavrilimumab recipients experienced a 65% reduction in the risk of mechanical ventilation or death through Day 29 (Hazard Ratio (HR) = 0.35;p=0.0175). Day 29 mortality was 12.5 percentage points lower in mavrilimumab recipients (8%) compared to placebo (20.5%) (p=0.0718). Mavrilimumab recipients had a 61% reduction in the risk of death through Day 29 (HR= 0.39;p=0.0726). Adverse events occurred less frequently in mavrilimumab recipients compared to placebo, including secondary infections and thrombotic events (known complications of COVID-19). Thrombotic events occurred only in the placebo arm (5/40 [12.5%]). Conclusion: In a global, diverse population of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and hyperinflammation receiving supplemental oxygen therapy, corticosteroids, and remdesivir, a single infusion of mavrilimumab reduced progression to mechanical ventilation and improved survival. Results indicate mavrilimumab, a potent inhibitor of GM-CSF signaling, may have added clinical benefit on top of the current standard therapy for COVID-19.

Stimulation of a proper immune response that leads to protection is highly dependent on presentation of epitopes to circulating T-cells via the HLA complex. SARS-CoV-2 is a large RNA virus and testing of all overlapping peptides in vitro to deconvolute an immune response is not feasible. Therefore HLA-binding prediction tools are often used to narrow down the number of peptides to test. We tested 15 epitope-HLA-binding prediction tools, and using an in vitro peptide MHC stability assay, we assessed 777 peptides that were predicted to be good binders across 11 MHC allotypes. In this investigation of potential SARS-CoV-2 epitopes we found that current prediction tools vary in performance when assessing binding stability, and they are highly dependent on the MHC allotype in question. Designing a COVID-19 vaccine where only a few epitope targets are included is therefore a very challenging task. Here, we present 174 SARS-CoV-2 epitopes with high prediction binding scores, validated to bind stably to 11 HLA allotypes.

To facilitate vaccine acceptance via effective health communication, it is key to understand levels of vaccine scepticism and the demographic, psychological and political predictors. To this end, we examine the levels and predictors of acceptance of an approved COVID-19 vaccine. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We examine the levels and predictors of acceptance of an approved COVID-19 vaccine in large online surveys from eight Western democracies that differ in terms of the severity of the pandemic and their response: Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Sweden, Italy, UK and USA (total N=18 231). Survey respondents were quota sampled to match the population margins on age, gender and geographical location for each country. The study was conducted from September 2020 to February 2021, allowing us to assess changes in acceptance and predictors as COVID-19 vaccine programmes were rolled out. OUTCOME MEASURE: The outcome of the study is self-reported acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine approved and recommended by health authorities. RESULTS: The data reveal large variations in vaccine acceptance that ranges from 83% in Denmark to 47% in France and Hungary. Lack of vaccine acceptance is associated with lack of trust in authorities and scientists, conspiratorial thinking and a lack of concern about COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Most national levels of vaccine acceptance fall below estimates of the required threshold for herd immunity. The results emphasise the long-term importance of building trust in preparations for health emergencies such as the current pandemic. For health communication, the results emphasise the importance of focusing on personal consequences of infections and debunking of myths to guide communication strategies.","output":"Public acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines: cross-national evidence on levels and individual-level predictors using observational data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is a critical need for safe and effective drugs for COVID-19. Only remdesivir has received authorization for COVID-19 and has been shown to improve outcomes but not decrease mortality. However, the dose of remdesivir is limited by hepatic and kidney toxicity.

Here, we investigated additive effect of combination therapy using remdesivir with recombinant soluble ACE2 (high/low dose) on Vero E6 and kidney organoids, targeting two different modalities of SARS-CoV-2 life cycle: cell entry via its receptor ACE2 and intracellular viral RNA replication. This combination treatment markedly improved their therapeutic windows against SARS-CoV-2 in both models. By using single amino-acid resolution screening in haploid ES cells, we report a singular critical pathway required for remdesivir toxicity, namely Adenylate Kinase 2.

Hospitals throughout the world made life-altering resource allocation decisions and prioritised the care of COVID-19 patients. Without effective models to evaluate resource allocation strategies encompassing COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 care, hospitals face the risk of making sub-optimal local resource allocation decisions. A discrete-event-simulation model is proposed in this paper to describe COVID-19, elective surgery, and emergency surgery patient flows. COVID-19-specific patient flows and a surgical patient flow network were constructed based on data of 475 COVID-19 patients and 28,831 non-COVID-19 patients in Addenbrooke's hospital in the UK. The model enabled the evaluation of three resource allocation strategies, for two COVID-19 wave scenarios: proactive cancellation of elective surgery, reactive cancellation of elective surgery, and ring-fencing operating theatre capacity. The results suggest that a ring-fencing strategy outperforms the other strategies, regardless of the COVID-19 scenario, in terms of total direct deaths and the number of surgeries performed. However, this does come at the cost of 50% more critical care rejections. In terms of aggregate hospital performance, a reactive cancellation strategy prioritising COVID-19 is no longer favourable if more than 7.3% of elective surgeries can be considered life-saving. Additionally, the model demonstrates the impact of timely hospital preparation and staff availability, on the ability to treat patients during a pandemic. The model can aid hospitals worldwide during pandemics and disasters, to evaluate their resource allocation strategies and identify the effect of redefining the prioritisation of patients.","output":"Balancing scarce hospital resources during the COVID-19 pandemic using discrete-event simulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rotenone is a broad-spectrum pesticide employed in various agricultural practices all over the world.

Therefore, the industrial internet of things (IIoT) may provide needed hybrid cloud and fog computing to analyze huge amounts of sensitive data from sensors and actuators to monitor oil rigs and wells closely, thereby better controlling global oil production. Improved quality of service (QoS) is possible with the fog computing, since it can alleviate challenges that a standard isolated cloud can't handle, an extended cloud located near underlying nodes is being developed. The paradigm of cloud computing is not sufficient to meet the needs of the already extensively utilized IIoT (i.e., edge) applications (e.g., low latency and jitter, context awareness, and mobility support) for a variety of reasons (e.g., health care and sensor networks). Couple of paradigms just like mobile edge computing, fog computing, and mobile cloud computing, have arisen in recently to meet these criteria. Fog computing helps to optimize services and create better user experiences, such as faster responses for critical, time-sensitive needs. At the same time, it also invites problems, such as overload, underload, and disparity in resource usage, including latency, time responses, throughput, etc. The comprehensive review presented in this work shows that fog devices have highly constrained environments and limited hardware capabilities. The existing cloud computing infrastructure is not capable of processing all data in a centralized manner because of the network bandwidth costs and response latency requirements. Therefore, fog computing demonstrated, instead of edge computing, and referred to as \\"the enabling technologies allowing computation to be performed at the edge of the network, on downstream data on behalf of cloud services and upstream data on behalf of IIoT services\\" (Shi et al., 2016) is more effective for data processing when data sources are close together. A review of fog and cloud computing literature suggests that fog is better than cloud computing because fog computing performs time-dependent computations better than cloud computing. The cloud is inefficient for latency-sensitive multimedia services and other time-sensitive applications since it is accessible over the internet, like the real-time monitoring, automation, and optimization of petroleum industry operations. As a result, a growing number of IIoT projects are dispersing fog computing capacity throughout the edge network as well as through data centers and the public cloud. A comprehensive review of fog computing features is presented here, with the potential of using it in the petroleum industry. Fog computing can provide a rapid response for applications through preprocess and filter data. Data that has been trimmed can then be transmitted to the cloud for additional analysis and better service delivery. ? 2021, Society of Petroleum Engineers","output":"The role of hybrid IoT with cloud computing and fog computing to help the oil and gas industry recover from Covid-19 and face future challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ECMO machine is similar to the heart-lung by-pass machine used in open-heart surgery It pumps and oxygenates a patient's blood outside the body, allowing the heart and lungs to rest When the patient is connected to an ECMO, blood flows through tubing to an artificial lung in the machine where saturation of oxygen and removal of carbon dioxide takes place, then the blood is warmed to body temperature and pumped back into the body This technology provides prolonged cardiac and respiratory support when all other forms of heart and lung support have failed to provide an adequate amount of gas exchange or perfusion to sustain life Now, the treatment is being used to support in patients with Covid-19 pneumonia for whom ventilation is insufficient to sustain blood oxygen levels","output":"ECMO therapy for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Japan is a disaster-prone country.

However, oral vitamin D supplementation is limited by the potential risk for hypercalcemia. In this study, we investigated if local delivery of vitamin D to the lungs improves vitamin D-mediated anti-inflammatory action in response to acute inflammation without inducing hypercalcemia. METHODS: We studied vitamin D sufficient (VDS) or deficient (VDD) mice in whom 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) (0.2 g/kg) or a vehicle followed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS 25 g) were delivered to the lung as a micro-spray. RESULTS: Local 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) reduced LPS-induced inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in VDS (absolute number of cells: ? 57% and neutrophils ? 51% p < 0.01) and tended to diminish LPS-increased CXCL5 BAL levels in VDS (? 40%, p = 0.05) while it had no effect on CXCL1 and CXCL2 in BAL and mRNA in lung of VDS and VDD. It also significantly attenuated the increased IL-13 in BAL and lung, especially in VDD mice (? 41 and ? 75%, respectively). mRNA expression of Claudin-18 in lung was significantly lower in VDS mice with local 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) while Claudin-3, -5 and -8 mRNA levels remained unchanged. Finally, in VDD mice only, LPS reduced lung mRNA expression of adhesion junction Zona-occludens-1, in addition to increasing uric acid and total protein in BAL, which both were prevented by local 1,25(OH)(2)D(3). CONCLUSION: Under normal levels of vitamin D, local 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) nebulization into the lung efficiently reduced LPS induction of inflammatory cells in BAL and slightly attenuated LPS-increase in CXCL5. In case of severe vitamin D deficiency, although local 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) nebulization failed to significantly minimize cellular inflammation in BAL at this dose, it prevented epithelial barrier leakage and damage in lung. Additional research is needed to determine the potential long-term beneficial effects of local 1,25(OH)2D3 nebulization on lung inflammation.

Recent approaches have adopted iterative procedures to gradually refine the bounding box and locate the target in the image. In such approaches, the deep model takes as input the image patch corresponding to the currently estimated target bounding box, and provides as output the probability associated with each of the possible bounding box refinements, generally defined as a discrete set of linear transformations of the bounding box center and size. At each iteration, only one transformation is applied, and supervised training of the model may introduce an inherent ambiguity by giving importance priority to some transformations over the others. This paper proposes a novel formulation of the problem of selecting the bounding box refinement. It introduces the concept of non-conflicting transformations and allows applying multiple refinements to the target bounding box at each iteration without introducing ambiguities during learning of the model parameters. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach improves the iterative single refinement in terms of accuracy and precision of the tracking results.","output":"Iterative Multiple Bounding-Box Refinements for Visual Tracking"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background:Since the onset of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the world, healthcare workers have been exposed to this virus due to their important roles and responsibilities in the care and treatment of patients with COVID-19.

Herein we employ a two-dimensional approach for identification of peptides isomers that also includes pinpointing of the modified residue. Collision-induced dissociation is used to fragment ions in the first dimension, followed by separation of the fragments with travelling-wave ion mobility. By comparing data obtained from both isomers, differences in either fragment-ion intensities or arrival-time distributions can be used to identify isomeric forms and the specific site of modification within the peptides. Synthetic peptide standards with sequences derived from long-lived proteins in the eye lens and isomerization at serine, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid were examined. Although both dimensions are capable of isomer identification, ion mobility is much better at determining the site of modification. In general, separation of isomeric forms by ion mobility is possible but does not follow predictable trends dictated by sequence or fragment-ion length.

Blood samples were collected before and after boosting and tested for the geometric mean titers (GMT) and seroconversion of live virus neutralizing antibody, pseudovirus neutralizing antibody and receptor-binding-domain (RBD) IgG antibody. Adverse events (AE) were collected and assessed within 28 days after boosting. Results: The ages of subjects in group 0-14 d 5 g, 0-14 d 10 g, 0-28 d 5 g and 0-28 d 10 g were (43.989.58), (43.469.34), (42.569.08) and (43.9411.05) years old, respectively (P=0.877).

In this work, we propose an attention-based supervised deep learning model, ASPER, which extracts syntactic patterns between entities exhibiting a given semantic relation in the sentential context. We validate the performance of ASPER on three distinct semantic relations -- hyponym-hypernym, cause-effect, and meronym-holonym on six datasets. Experimental results show that for all these semantic relations, ASPER can automatically identify a collection of syntactic patterns reflecting the existence of such a relation between a pair of entities in a sentence.

Due to its high mortality rate and medical cost, sepsis remains one of the worlds most intractable diseases. In the early stage of sepsis, the over-activated immune system and a cascade of inflammation are usually accompanied by immunosuppression. The core pathogenesis of sepsis is the maladjustment of the hosts innate and adaptive immune response. Many immune cells are involved in this process, including neutrophils, mononuclear/macrophages and lymphocytes. The immune cells recognize pathogens, devour pathogens and release cytokines to recruit or activate other cells in direct or indirect manner. Pyroptosis, immune cell-extracellular traps formation and autophagy are several novel forms of cell death that are different from apoptosis, which play essential roles in the progress of sepsis. Immune cells can initiate self-sacrifice through the above three forms of cell death to protect or kill pathogens. However, the exact roles and mechanisms of the self-sacrifice in the immune cells in sepsis are not fully elucidated. This paper mainly analyzes the self-sacrifice of several representative immune cells in the forms of pyroptosis, immune cell-extracellular traps formation and autophagy to reveal the specific roles they play in the occurrence and progression of sepsis, also to provide inspiration and references for further investigation of the roles and mechanisms of self-sacrifice of immune cells in the sepsis in the future, meanwhile, through this work, we hope to bring inspiration to clinical work.","output":"The Self-Sacrifice of ImmuneCells in Sepsis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a city famous for tourism, the public healthcare system of Macau SAR has been under great pressure during the outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

In this study we introduce the concept of a universal geospatial risk phenotype of individual US counties facilitating flu-like transmission mechanisms. We call this the Universal Influenza-like Transmission (UnIT) score, which is computed as an information-theoretic divergence of the local incidence time series from an high-risk process of epidemic initiation, inferred from almost a decade of flu season incidence data gleaned from the diagnostic history of nearly a third of the US population. Despite being computed from the past seasonal flu incidence records, the UnIT score emerges as the dominant factor explaining incidence trends for the COVID-19 pandemic over putative demographic and socio-economic factors. The predictive ability of the UnIT score is further demonstrated via county-specific weekly case count forecasts which consistently outperform the state of the art models throughout the time-line of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In particular, a clean airport environment significantly improved passengers perceived safety. Moreover, facility functionality, layout accessibility, cleanliness, and perceived safety all had an effect on travel intention through the mediating role of satisfaction. Overall, these findings offer suggestions for airport authorities aiming to revive demand for air travel. Discussions about airport physical environment improvements along with limitations and suggestions for future research are provided.","output":"The Impact of Airport Physical Environment on Perceived Safety and Domestic Travel Intention of Chinese Passengers during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Mediating Role of Passenger Satisfaction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article unpacks the experience of using an Appreciative Inquiry approach to gain an understanding of priorities and challenges related to youth economic empowerment in the 'new normal' impacted by coronavirus, and to establish a diverse network willing to work together to create change.

The app was designed to recognize the users hand touching the images with the rear camera and provide voice guidance with the information on the images that the index finger is touching as a trigger. When performing gestures with either the index finger or thumb, the app was able to detect and output the fingertip point without delay, and it was effective as a trigger for reading. Thumb gestures are assumed to have reduced detection variances of 68% in the lateral direction because they rarely move the other four fingers compared to index finger gestures. By performing multiple detections in the application and outputting the median, the variances of detection can be reduced to 73% in the lateral direction and 70% in the longitudinal direction, which shows the effectiveness of multiple detections. These techniques are effective in reducing the variance of fingertip detection. We also confirmed that if the tilt of the device is between ?3.4 mm and 4 mm, the current app could identify a 12 mm difference with an accuracy of 85.5% as an average in both of the lateral and longitudinal directions.

METHODS Fourteen young men were tested for 1-repetition maximum (1RM) in the barbell biceps curl and lying triceps extension exercises. On separate visits, subjects performed exercise trials (4 sets to failure at 70% 1RM with 90 s between sets) in six separate randomized conditions, i.e., in normoxia or hypoxia (fraction of inspired oxygen = 20.9% and 12.9%, respectively) combined with three different levels of BFR (0%, 45%, or 60% of resting arterial occlusion pressure). Muscle activation and oxygenation were monitored via surface electromyography and near-infrared spectroscopy, respectively. Arterial oxygen saturation, heart rate, and perceptual responses were assessed following each set. RESULTS Compared to set 1, the number of repetitions before failure decreased in sets 2, 3, and 4 for both exercises (all P < 0.001), independently of the condition (P > 0.065). Arterial oxygen saturation was lower with systemic hypoxia (P < 0.001), but not BFR, while heart rate did not differ between conditions (P > 0.341). Muscle oxygenation and activation during exercise trials remained unaffected by the different conditions (all P  0.206). A significant main effect of time, but not condition, was observed for overall perceived discomfort, difficulty breathing, and limb discomfort (all P < 0.001).

METHODS In June 2020, we conducted an online survey of parents and guardians of public school children in Illinois, Michigan, and Ohio. In a child-level analysis, we used linear regression to assess which demographic factors, health-related concerns, and parent/guardian views were associated with plans for in-person school attendance. In a respondent-level analysis, we used linear regression to assess factors associated with the number of risk mitigation measures supported. RESULTS Among 2,202 children in the child-level analysis, in-person school attendance was planned for 71.0%. Such plans were less likely among children of Black respondents (-14.1 percentage points, 95% CI: -25.7, -2.6) and Asian respondents (-16.8, 95% CI: -31.3, -2.2), and among children with perceived high-risk health conditions (-9.7, 95% CI: -15.8, -3.6). Among 1,126 respondents in the respondent-level analysis, the mean number of measures supported was 8.0 (SD 4.4). Several factors were associated with support, but the magnitude of associations was generally modest. CONCLUSIONS During the COVID-19 pandemic, families of children with health conditions or who are of Black or Asian race/ethnicity may be less likely to opt for in-person learning. For these families, addressing barriers to remote education is critical. As schools plan for the 2020-2021 school year and beyond, they should respond to the desire among parents and guardians to implement substantial numbers of risk mitigation measures.","output":"Factors Associated with School Attendance Plans and Support for COVID-19 Risk Mitigation Measures Among Parents and Guardians."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the first half of 2019, many economists and international organizations emphasize the deterioration of macroeconomic indicators that could soon lead to a new economic crisis, much more serious than in 2008-2009 1 However, the reasons behind the national and global economic downturn in the first six months of 2020 were not those anticipated, but a virus that disrupted the daily life with the most unexpected effects on economic and social activities It is true that the world economy had already deteriorated over the past year, with GDP rising by only 2 9% in 2019 2, the lowest rate in the last decade, amid endless trade disputes and policy uncertainties, high poverty rate and inequalities, increasingly climate risks, ubiquitous intra- and interstates disparities To all this, in the first half of 2020 were added anti-pandemic measures that led to significant declines in almost all economic sectors, stock market crash, labor market collapse, negative oil prices, disruption of trade flows, etc It seems that this global health problem and the associated economic and social crisis will lead to the deterioration of most macroeconomic indicators in the coming years, which will call into question the architecture of the economic and financial system and medium and long term development prospects","output":"The Economic Impact of Covid-19 Pandemic at the Beginning of 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV\\\\NL63) is one of four common human respiratory coronaviruses.

The prevalence of non-SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients evaluated for MIS-C has not been described. Patients evaluated for MIS-C, and therapies administered. [Image: see text] METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of patients < 21 years of age admitted to a freestanding childrens hospital in Boston, MA from May 14-June 6, 2020 who were evaluated for MIS-C. We identified patients undergoing Rheumatology consultation and echocardiogram (per the hospitals protocol for evaluating children with suspicion for MIS-C). We tabulated patients evaluated for MIS-C found to have non-SARS-CoV-2 infection detected on standard microbiologic testing. RESULTS: 39 patients met inclusion criteria. Median age was 5 years (IQR 2C12 years). Of evaluated patients, 19/39 (49%) were diagnosed with MIS-C according to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health case definition; 10/39 (26%) required ICU admission. Non-SARS-CoV-2 infections were identified in 7/39 (18%), of whom 5/7 (71%) had bacterial infections, 1/7 (14%) had viral infection, and 1/7 (14%) had viral and bacterial co-infections; no fungal or parasitic infections were identified. Of patients diagnosed with MIS-C, 2/19 (11%) were found to have non-SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, 5/19 (26%) had a positive polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2 at time of MIS-C diagnosis, of whom 4/5 (80%) received remdesivir. Of patients evaluated for MIS-C, 17/39 (44%) received intravenous immune globulin, 14/39 (36%) aspirin, 4/39 (10%) anakinra, and 14/39 (36%) methylprednisolone.

Therefore, the aim of the study was to understand the care experiences of people with learning disabilities, and explore the potential patient safety issues they, their carers and families raised. METHODS: Two data sources exploring the lived experience of care for people with learning disabilities were synthesised using an integrative approach, and explored using reflexive thematic analysis. This comprised two focus groups with a total of 13 people with learning disabilities and supportive staff, and 377 narratives posted publicly via the feedback platform Care Opinion. RESULTS: The qualitative exploration highlighted three key themes. Firstly, health and social care systems operated with varying levels of rigidity. This contributed to an inability to effectively cater to; complex and individualised care needs, written and verbal communication needs and needs for adequate time and space. Secondly, there were various gaps and traps within systems for this population. This highlighted the importance of care continuity, interoperability and attending to the variation in support provision from professionals. Finally, essential dependency work was reliant upon social capital and fulfilled by paid and unpaid caring roles to divergent extents, however, advocacy provided an additional supportive safety net.

T cells are important mediators in cancer immunity. Aging affects T cells, leading to various dysfunctions which can impede antitumor immunity. While some hallmarks of T cell aging have been observed in colorectal cancer patients, the functional role of such cells is not clear. Therefore, understanding how aged T cells influence overall patient outcome could potentially help in the pursue to develop new therapies for the elderly. ABSTRACT: Colorectal cancer (CRC) continues to be one of the most frequently diagnosed types of cancers in the world. CRC is considered to affect mostly elderly patients, and the number of diagnosed cases increases with age. Even though general screening improves outcomes, the overall survival and recurrence-free CRC rates in aged individuals are highly dependent on their history of comorbidities. Furthermore, aging is also known to alter the immune system, and especially the adaptive immune T cells. Many studies have emphasized the importance of T cell responses to CRC. Therefore, understanding how age-related changes affect the outcome in CRC patients is crucial. This review focuses on what is so far known about age-related T cell dysfunction in elderly patients with colorectal cancer and how aged T cells can mediate its development. Last, this study describes the advances in basic animal models that have potential to be used to elucidate the role of aged T cells in CRC.","output":"T Cell Aging in Patients with Colorectal CancerWhat Do We Know So Far?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The assessment of human spatial short-term memory has mainly been performed using visual stimuli and less frequently using auditory stimuli. This paper presents a framework for the development of SLAM-based Augmented Reality applications for the assessment of spatial memory. An AR mobile application was developed for this type of assessment involving visual and tactile stimuli by using our framework. The task to be carried out with the AR application is divided into two phases: 1) a learning phase, in which participants physically walk around a room and have to remember the location of simple geometrical shapes; and 2) an evaluation phase, in which the participants are asked to recall the location of the shapes. A study for comparing the performance outcomes using visual and tactile stimuli was carried out. Fifty-three participants performed the task using the two conditions (Tactile vs Visual), but with more than two months of difference (within-subject design). The number of shapes placed correctly was similar for both conditions. However, the group that used the tactile stimulus spent significantly more time completing the task and required significantly more attempts. The performance outcomes were independent of gender. Some significant correlations among variables related to the performance outcomes and other tests were found. The following significant correlations among variables related to the performance outcomes using visual stimuli and the participants' subjective variables were also found: 1) the greater the number of correctly placed shapes, the greater the perceived competence; 2) the more attempts required, the less the perceived competence. We also found that perceived enjoyment was higher when a higher sense of presence was induced. Our results suggest that tactile stimuli are valid stimuli to exploit for the assessment of the ability to memorize spatial-tactile associations, but that the ability to memorize spatial-visual associations is dominant.

In 166 SAH patients (derivation and validation cohorts, 110 and 56, respectively), plasma OPN levels were serially measured at days1-3, 4-6, 7-9, and 10-12 after aneurysmal obliteration. The OPN levels and clinical factors were compared between patients with and without subsequent development of chronic SDHC. Plasma OPN levels in the SDHC patients increased from days 1-3 to days 4-6 and remained high thereafter, while those in the non-SDHC patients peaked at days 4-6 and then decreased over time. Plasma OPN levels had no correlation with serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a systemic inflammatory marker. Univariate analyses showed that age, modified Fisher grade, acute hydrocephalus, cerebrospinal fluid drainage, and OPN and CRP levels at days 10-12 were significantly different between patients with and without SDHC. Multivariate analyses revealed that higher plasma OPN levels at days 10-12 were an independent factor associated with the development of SDHC, in addition to a more frequent use of cerebrospinal fluid drainage and higher modified Fisher grade at admission. Plasma OPN levels at days 10-12 maintained similar discrimination power in the validation cohort and had good calibration on the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test.

Thus, we conducted a prospective analysis of breast cancer risk in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers from age 60 until age 80. METHODS Subjects had no history of cancer and both breasts intact at age 60 (n = 699). Women were followed until a breast cancer diagnosis, prophylactic bilateral mastectomy or death. We calculated the annual cancer rate and cumulative incidence of breast cancer (invasive and in situ) from age 60 to age 80. We assessed the associations between hormone replacement therapy, family history of breast cancer and bilateral oophorectomy and breast cancer risk. RESULTS Over a mean follow-up of 7.9 years, 61 invasive and 20 in situ breast cancers were diagnosed in the cohort. The mean annual rate of invasive breast cancer was 1.8% for BRCA1 mutation carriers and 1.7% for BRCA2 mutation carriers. The cumulative risk of invasive breast cancer from age 60 to 80 was 20.1% for women with a BRCA1 mutation and was 17.3% for women with a BRCA2 mutation. Hormone replacement therapy, family history and oophorectomy were not associated with breast cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS Findings from this large prospective study indicate that the risk of developing breast cancer remains high after age 60 in both BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. These findings warrant further evaluation of the role of breast cancer screening in older mutation carriers.","output":"Breast cancer risk after age 60 among BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 infection poses a serious risk to patients and - due to its contagious nature - to those healthcare workers (HCWs) treating them If the mouth and nose of HCWs are irrigated with antimicrobial solutions, this may help reduce the risk of active infection being passed from infected patients to HCWs through droplet transmission or direct contact However, the use of such antimicrobial solutions may be associated with harms related to the toxicity of the solutions themselves, or alterations in the natural microbial flora of the mouth or nose Understanding these possible side effects is particularly important when the HCWs are otherwise fit and well Objectives: To assess the benefits and harms of antimicrobial mouthwashes and nasal sprays used by healthcare workers (HCWs) to protect themselves when treating patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection Search methods: Information Specialists from Cochrane ENT and Cochrane Oral Health searched the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2020, Issue 6);Ovid MEDLINE;Ovid Embase and additional sources for published and unpublished trials The date of the search was 1 June 2020 Selection criteria: This is a question that urgently requires evidence, however at the present time we did not anticipate finding many completed randomised controlled trials (RCTs) We therefore planned to include the following types of studies: RCTs;quasi-RCTs;non-randomised controlled trials;prospective cohort studies;retrospective cohort studies;cross-sectional studies;controlled before-and-after studies We set no minimum duration for the studies We sought studies comparing any antimicrobial mouthwash and/or nasal spray (alone or in combination) at any concentration, delivered to HCWs, with or without the same intervention being given to the patients with COVID-19 Data collection and analysis: We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures Our primary outcomes were: (1) incidence of symptomatic or test-positive COVID-19 infection in HCWs;(2) significant adverse event: anosmia (or disturbance in sense of smell) Our secondary outcomes were: (3) viral content of aerosol, when present (if intervention administered to patients);(4) other adverse events: changes in microbiome in oral cavity, nasal cavity, oro- or nasopharynx;(5) other adverse events: allergy, irritation/burning of nasal, oral or oropharyngeal mucosa (e g erosions, ulcers, bleeding), long-term staining of mucous membranes or teeth, accidental ingestion We planned to use GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome","output":"Use of antimicrobial mouthwashes (gargling) and nasal sprays by healthcare workers to protect them when treating patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Brush border membrane vesicles (BBMVs) were prepared from the 2(nd) instar larvae of Helicoverpa armigera.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained testicular torsion database was performed. Patients  18 years of age evaluated in our emergency room between 3/11/2020 to 10/1/2020 (during-COVID-19) and the same period in 2018 and 2019 (pre-COVID-19) with US diagnosed and OR confirmed testicular torsion were included. Basic demographics, timing of presentation, referral rate, time to OR and orchiectomy rate were extracted and compared. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS A total of 82 torsions were included in the study; 55 pre-COVID-19 and 27 during-COVID-19. The incidence of testicular torsion remained the same; 3.93 cases/month pre-COVID-19 versus 3.86 cases/month during-COVID-19 (p = 0.791). However, there were significantly fewer delayed (> 24 hours) presentations (11.1% versus 45.5% , p = 0.003), shorter time from onset of symptoms to presentation (median 15.5 hours versus 8 hours, p = 0.001), and a lower but not statistically significant overall orchiectomy rate (33.3% versus 50.9% p = 0.1608) during-COVID-19. Among those presenting acutely with torsion (< 24 hours from onset), no statistical differences were found in the median time from US diagnosis to OR, from ED to OR, referral rate, or orchiectomy rate between the two groups. Lastly, SARS-CoV2 testing did not delay median time from ED to OR. CONCLUSIONS There was a notably less delayed presentation of testicular torsion and shorter ischemia time on presentation during-COVID, however, no significant change of time to OR or orchiectomy rate in those with acute testicular torsion were observed.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the presentation, management and outcome of testicular torsion in the pediatric population - an analysis of a large pediatric center."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE Chest wall reconstruction in children is typically accomplished with either primary tissue repair or synthetic mesh prostheses. Primary tissue repair has been associated with high rates of scoliosis, whereas synthetic prostheses necessitate the placement of a permanent foreign body in growing children. This report describes the use of biologic mesh (Permacol; Covidien, Mansfield, MA) as an alternative to both tissue repair and synthetic prostheses in pediatric chest wall reconstruction. METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed identifying patients undergoing chest wall reconstruction with biologic mesh at our tertiary referral children's hospital between 2007 and 2011. Data collection included patient demographics, indication for chest wall resection, number of ribs resected, the administration of postoperative radiation, length of follow-up, postoperative complications, and the degree of spinal angulation (preoperatively and at most recent follow-up). RESULTS Five patients (age, 9.0-21.7 years; mean, 15.4 years) underwent resection for primary chest wall malignancy followed by reconstruction with biologic mesh (Permacol) during the study period. There were no postoperative mesh-related complications, and none of the patients developed clinically significant scoliosis (follow-up, 1.1-2.6 years; mean 1.9 years).

Evidence-based prevention and treatment strategies targeting early-life stress are emerging. Nevertheless, faculty physicians' preparation to incorporate this science into practice has not been well studied. The purpose of this study was to explore medical faculty knowledge and beliefs, timing and route of knowledge acquisition, perceived relevance and application of topics, and any associated faculty characteristics. Method The research team developed and administered a 39-question survey to faculty from six departments at the University of Illinois College of Medicine and Rush Medical College in Chicago. The team employed quantitative and qualitative methods to analyze responses. Results Eighty-one (8.8%) eligible faculty completed the survey. Of respondents, 53 (65.4%) achieved a high score on knowledge questions, 34 (42.0%) on beliefs questions, and 42 (59.1%) described high concept exposure, but only six (7.4%) through a formal route. Although 78 (96.8%) respondents indicated that survey concepts are relevant, only 18 (22.2%) reported fully incorporating them in their work. Respondents reporting full incorporation of concepts were significantly more likely to attain high concept exposure scores than those not fully incorporating concepts (17 respondents, 94.4%, vs. 25 respondents, 39.7 %, P < .001), whether reporting formal or informal exposure. Both quantitative and qualitative analysis highlighted limited awareness among respondents of trauma prevalence among healthcare workers, lack of familiarity with interventions, and challenges in addressing childhood experiences given time and resource constraints. Conclusions Most respondents had some familiarity with the impact of childhood experiences on health and perceived the relevance of this science. Nonetheless, many identified the need for additional coaching. Because results suggest that exposure supports full application of concepts, intentional faculty development and establishment of medical education competencies is pivotal to prepare faculty to include these crucial topics in patient care and teaching.","output":"Is academic medicine prepared to teach about the intersection of childhood experiences and health across the life course?

The motivation driving BioASQ is the continuous advancement of approaches and tools to meet the need for efficient and precise access to the ever-increasing biomedical knowledge. In this direction, a series of annual challenges are organized, in the fields of large-scale biomedical semantic indexing and question answering, formulating specific shared-tasks in alignment with the real needs of the biomedical experts. These shared-tasks and their accompanying benchmark datasets provide an unique common testbed for investigating and comparing new approaches developed by distinct teams around the world for identifying and accessing biomedical information. In particular, the BioASQ Challenge consists of shared-tasks in two complementary directions: (a) the automated indexing of large volumes of unlabelled biomedical documents, primarily scientific publications, with biomedical concepts, (b) the automated retrieval of relevant material for biomedical questions and the generation of comprehensible answers. In the first direction on semantic indexing, two shared-tasks are organized for English and Spanish content respectively, the latter considering human-interpretable evidence extraction (NER and concept linking) as well. In the second direction, two shared-tasks are organized as well, one for biomedical question answering and one particularly focusing on the developing issue of COVID-19. As BioASQ rewards the approaches that manage to outperform the state of the art in these shared-tasks, the research frontier is pushed towards ensuring that the valuable biomedical knowledge will be identifiable and accessible by the biomedical experts.","output":"BioASQ at CLEF2022: The Tenth Edition of the Large-scale Biomedical Semantic Indexing and Question Answering Challenge"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Homeostasis is indispensable to counteract the destabilizing effects of Hebbian plasticity.

Strikingly, our data reveal that pairwise functional correlations and their structure are subject to homeostatic regulation. Using a computational model, we demonstrate that the interplay of different plasticity and homeostatic mechanisms can capture the initial drop and delayed recovery of firing rates and correlations observed experimentally. Moreover, our model indicates that synaptic scaling is crucial for the recovery of correlations and network structure, while intrinsic plasticity is essential for the rebound of firing rates, suggesting that synaptic scaling and intrinsic plasticity can serve distinct functions in homeostatically regulating network dynamics.","output":"Homeostatic mechanisms regulate distinct aspects of cortical circuit dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is an illustrated case about CT ventilation and perfusion in Covid patient.","output":"Pulmonary embolism in COVID-19: ventilation and perfusion computer tomography"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Growth monitoring and promotion are one of the health priorities in assessing the growth rate of a child. Appropriate growth monitoring and promotion services enable health professionals to control growth faltering and child mortality. However, there is limited information on the growth monitoring practice of health professionals and their associated factors at public health facilities of Bahir Dar health centers. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the growth monitoring practice of health professionals and associated factors at public health facilities of Bahir Dar health centers, northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: Institutional-based cross-sectional study for quantitative and phenomenology for qualitative was conducted from April 15 to May 15, 2021, among 314 health professionals, in Bahir Dar town, northwest Ethiopia. Census was used. A self-administered questionnaire was employed for quantitative data. Data were cleaned and entered into Epi-info version 7.1 and exported to SPSS version 20 for further analysis, and the binary logistic regression was employed. In the bi-variable analysis, those variables with a p-value less than 0.2 were fitted to multivariable analysis. Qualitative data were analyzed by using thematic analysis. RESULTS: The overall growth monitoring practice of health professionals at Bahir Dar public health centers was 30.3%, with a response rate of 98.1. The number of participants who had at least a degree was [AOR = 3.57; 95% CI: 1.54, 8.26], health professionals who had greater than 11 years of work experience [AOR = 2.98; CI: 1.36, 6.53], those who took training [AOR = 5.11; CI: 2.20, 11.90], availability of growth monitoring equipment [AOR = 4.44; CI: 1.97, 9.98], those who had lesser workload (saw less than 25 childrens per day) [AOR = 3.02; CI: 1.16, 7.86], those who had good knowledge [AOR = 4.60; CI: 2.06, 10.31] and favorable attitude [AOR = 2.58; CI: 1.14, 5.83] were significantly associated with growth monitoring practice. CONCLUSION: The overall growth monitoring practice among health professionals of Bahir Dar public health centers was low. Work experience, age, educational status, knowledge, attitude, workload, training, and availability of growth monitoring equipment were key predictors of growth monitoring practice among health professionals in Bahir Dar public health centers.

Limited data exist to guide the intensity of antithrombotic prophylaxis. Objective To evaluate the effects of intermediate-dose vs standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation among patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Design, Setting, and Participants Multicenter randomized trial with a 2  2 factorial design performed in 10 academic centers in Iran comparing intermediate-dose vs standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation (first hypothesis) and statin therapy vs matching placebo (second hypothesis; not reported in this article) among adult patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19. Patients were recruited between July 29, 2020, and November 19, 2020. The final follow-up date for the 30-day primary outcome was December 19, 2020. Interventions Intermediate-dose (enoxaparin, 1 mg/kg daily) (n = 276) vs standard prophylactic anticoagulation (enoxaparin, 40 mg daily) (n = 286), with modification according to body weight and creatinine clearance. The assigned treatments were planned to be continued until completion of 30-day follow-up. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of venous or arterial thrombosis, treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or mortality within 30 days, assessed in randomized patients who met the eligibility criteria and received at least 1 dose of the assigned treatment. Prespecified safety outcomes included major bleeding according to the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (type 3 or 5 definition), powered for noninferiority (a noninferiority margin of 1.8 based on odds ratio), and severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count <20 103/L). All outcomes were blindly adjudicated. Results Among 600 randomized patients, 562 (93.7%) were included in the primary analysis (median [interquartile range] age, 62 [50-71] years; 237 [42.2%] women). The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 126 patients (45.7%) in the intermediate-dose group and 126 patients (44.1%) in the standard-dose prophylaxis group (absolute risk difference, 1.5% [95% CI, -6.6% to 9.8%]; odds ratio, 1.06 [95% CI, 0.76-1.48]; P = .70). Major bleeding occurred in 7 patients (2.5%) in the intermediate-dose group and 4 patients (1.4%) in the standard-dose prophylaxis group (risk difference, 1.1% [1-sided 97.5% CI, - to 3.4%]; odds ratio, 1.83 [1-sided 97.5% CI, 0.00-5.93]), not meeting the noninferiority criteria (P for noninferiority >.99). Severe thrombocytopenia occurred only in patients assigned to the intermediate-dose group (6 vs 0 patients; risk difference, 2.2% [95% CI, 0.4%-3.8%]; P = .01). Conclusions and Relevance Among patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19, intermediate-dose prophylactic anticoagulation, compared with standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation, did not result in a significant difference in the primary outcome of a composite of adjudicated venous or arterial thrombosis, treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or mortality within 30 days.

The aim of the study is to explore the efficacy and security of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in the treatment of neonatal sepsis-related AKI. METHOD: Totally12 sepsis-related AKI neonates treated with CRRT were hospitalized in the NICU of Shanghai Childrens Hospital between November 2012 and November 2019, and the clinical data of these 12 cases were retrospectively analyzed. Renal function, acid-base balance, electrolytes, blood pressure and hemodynamics indexes were recorded before CRRT initiation, 12/24/48 h after CRRT initiation and at the end of CRRT respectively. The efficacy of CRRT was evaluated and the clinical outcome was observed in these 12 sepsis-related AKI neonates. Repeated measurement analysis of variance was used for statistical analysis of the data. RESULT: (1) Continuous veno-venous hemodialysis filtration (CVVHDF) was used in 12 cases of sepsis-related AKI neonates. There were 6 cases with oliguria, 3 cases with fluid overload (FO), 3 cases with septic shock. The duration of CRRT was 49 ~ 110 h, average (76.2  23.5) h. (2) The blood pressure (BP) of 12 sepsis -related AKI neonates could reach the normal level (40C60 mmHg) 12 h after CRRT initiation, and the normal BP level could be maintained during the CRRT treatment. After 12 h CRRT, the blood pH value increased to the normal range (7.35 ~ 7.45). After 12 h CRRT treatment, the oxygenation index of 12sepsis-related AKI neonates could reach 200 mmHg. After 24 h CRRT treatment, it could rise to more than 300 mmHg. Serum potassium, serum urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels decreased significantly 12 h after CRRT initiation, and reached the normal range 24 h after CRRT initiation. The urine volume significantly increased 24 h after CRRT initiation. (3) Venous catheterization was performed successfully in all sepsis-related AKI neonates. We observed 2 cases of thrombocytopenia, 1 case of obstruction and 1 case of hypotension in the course of CRRT. There were no complications such as hypothermia, hemorrhage, thrombosis and infection.11 neonates were cured and discharged. One neonate was treated with CRRT and passed through the oliguria stage of AKI, but died after the parents gave up the treatment.

Self-imposed barriers have prevented adoption of more radical pedagogical approaches, so recent predictions of the 'inevitability' of medical education transitioning to online delivery seemed unlikely. Then in March 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic forced medical schools to overcome established barriers overnight and make the most rapid curricular shift in medical education's history. We share the collated reports of nine medical schools and postulate how recent responses may influence future medical education. Evidence: While extraneous pandemic-related factors make it impossible to scientifically distinguish the impact of the curricular changes, some themes emerged. The rapid transition to online delivery was made possible by all schools having learning management systems and key electronic resources already blended into their curricula; we were closer to online delivery than anticipated. Student engagement with online delivery varied with different pedagogies used and the importance of social learning and interaction along with autonomy in learning were apparent. These are factors known to enhance online learning, and the student-centered modalities (e.g. problem-based learning) that included them appeared to be more engaging. Assumptions that the new online environment would be easily adopted and embraced by 'technophilic' students did not always hold true. Achieving true distance medical education will take longer than this 'overnight' response, but adhering to best practices for online education may open a new realm of possibilities. Implications: While this experience did not confirm that online medical education is really 'inevitable,' it revealed that it is possible. Thoughtfully blending more online components into a medical curriculum will allow us to take advantage of this environment's strengths such as efficiency and the ability to support asynchronous and autonomous learning that engage and foster intrinsic learning in our students. While maintaining aspects of social interaction, online learning could enhance pre-clinical medical education by allowing integration and collaboration among classes of medical students, other health professionals, and even between medical schools. What remains to be seen is whether COVID-19 provided the experience, vision and courage for medical education to change, or whether the old barriers will rise again when the pandemic is over.","output":"Changing Medical Education, Overnight: The Curricular Response to COVID-19 of Nine Medical Schools"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: Adherence to lifestyle recommendations, medical regimens and cardiac rehabilitation is poor among patients with acute coronary syndrome.

About 82.5% (n = 165) of specimens were positive for pathogens. Of 165 infected cases, 3% (n = 6) had only single bacterial pathogens, whereas 43.5% (n = 87) cases had only single viral pathogens. The remaining 36% (n = 72) cases had coinfections. In symptomatic cases, human rhinovirus was detected as the predominant virus (31.5%), followed by RSV (31%), HMPV (13%), HBoV (11%), HPIV-3 (10.5%), and adenovirus (7%). Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most frequently isolated bacterial pathogen (9%), whereas Klebsiella pneumaniae, Streptococcus spp., Enterobacter agglomerans, and Haemophilus influenzae were 5.5%, 5%, 2%, and 1.5%, respectively. Of 15 multidrug-resistant bacteria, a Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate and an Enterobacter agglomerans isolate exhibited resistance against more than 10 different antibiotics. Both ARI incidence and predominant pathogen detection rates were higher during post-monsoon and winter, peaking in September. Pathogen detection rates and coinfection incidence in less than 1-year group were significantly higher (P = 0.0034 and 0.049, respectively) than in 1C5 years age group. Pathogen detection rate (43%) in asymptomatic cases was significantly lower compared to symptomatic group (P<0.0001). Human rhinovirus, HPIV-3, adenovirus, Streptococcus pneumonia, and Klebsiella pneumaniae had significant involvement in coinfections with P values of 0.0001, 0.009 and 0.0001, 0.0001 and 0.001 respectively.

We first explored the stable conformation of the Nsp15 monomer as the global free energy minimum conformation in the free energy landscape using a combination of parallel cascade selection molecular dynamics (PaCS-MD) and the Markov state model (MSM), and found that the Nsp15 monomer forms a more open conformation with larger druggable pockets on the surface. Targeting the pockets with high druggability scores, we conducted ligand docking and identified compounds that tightly bind to the Nsp15 monomer. The top poses with Nsp15 were subjected to binding free energy calculations by dissociation PaCS-MD and MSM (dPaCS-MD/MSM), indicating the stability of the complexes. One of the identified pockets, which is distinctively bound by inosine analogues, may be an alternative binding site to stabilize viral RNA binding and/or an alternative catalytic site. We constructed a stable RNA structure model bound to both UTP and alternative binding sites, providing a reasonable proposed model of the Nsp15/RNA complex.","output":"Inhibition of the Hexamerization of SARS-CoV-2 Endoribonuclease and Modeling of RNA Structures Bound to the Hexamer (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: On Dec 14, 2020, the United States initiated a nationwide COVID-19 vaccination campaign. Vaccination has not occurred uniformly in the United States. Only limited information describing the community-level impact of national vaccination campaigns is available. Methods: Using a negative binomial regression model we evaluated the association between county-level COVID-19 vaccine uptake and rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the United States from April 1, 2021 through July 31, 2021 controlling for a broad set of county-level environmental, sociodemographic, economic, and health-status-related characteristics. Findings: After adjustment for county-level characteristics, US counties with 70% of their adult population fully vaccinated against COVID-19 had 32% (95% CI: 19-43;P =<.001) and 39% (95% CI: 23-51;P =<.001) lower rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths, respectively, compared to counties that did not achieve 40% uptake. Similarly, US counties with 60-69% uptake had 14% (95% CI: 2-25;P =.023) and 19% (95% CI: 4-32;P =.017) lower rates versus those with <40% adult coverage. No impact was observed for counties with 40-49% or 50-59% uptake. Interpretations: Our results suggest that communities should continue to prioritize improving COVID-19 vaccination rates. US counties with 70% of their adult population fully vaccinated had rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths that were approximately one-third lower than counties with <40% coverage in a period that included the introduction and widespread dissemination of the Delta variant.

This article reports the results of the first in experiences with the p48MW (p48 Movable Wire) in humans, a device specifically designed to target vessels 1.75-3 mm in diameter. METHODS This monocentric study retrospectively reviewed the prospectively maintained database to identify all patients treated with the p48MW device between January 2017 and January 2019 at this institution. Patient demographics, aneurysm characteristics, angiographic and clinical follow-up were recorded as well as complications. RESULTS A total of 25 patients (20 female) with an average age of 55  12.9 years (range 34-84) with 25 aneurysms were identified. The majority of the aneurysms was located in the anterior circulation (19/25, 76%). The average aneurysm dome width was 3.98  3.6 mm (range 1.2-13 mm). Complete occlusion was seen in 18/24 (75%) aneurysms with neck remnants in 1/24 (4.2%) and continued aneurysm filling seen in the remaining cases (5/24, 20.8%). Adequate occlusion was seen in 79.2% of aneurysms (Raymond Roy Classification [RRC] grade I or II) during the follow-up period. There was a single technical complication with inappropriate deployment of the first p48MW. There was a single clinical complication (4%); however, the patient made a complete recovery (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] 0) and one patient died secondary to uncontrollable status epilepticus following acute subarachnoid hemorrhage unrelated to the treatment.

Twitter's retweet functionality allows users to share the existing content with other users without altering the original content. Analysis of social media platforms can help in detecting emergencies during pandemics that lead to taking preventive measures. One such type of analysis is predicting the number of retweets for a given COVID-19 related tweet. Recently, CIKM organized a retweet prediction challenge for COVID-19 tweets focusing on using numeric features only. However, our hypothesis is, tweet text may play a vital role in an accurate retweet prediction. In this paper, we combine numeric and text features for COVID-19 related retweet predictions. For this purpose, we propose two CNN and RNN based models and evaluate the performance of these models on a publicly available TweetsCOV19 dataset using seven different evaluation metrics.

Rate Ratios (RR) were estimated with higher educational level as reference. The Relative Index of Inequality (RII) was estimated. Joinpoint regressions were applied to identify inflexion points in mortality trends, and Percent Annual Change (APC) between inflexion points. RESULTS 124,198 deaths caused by DM among adults (25+ years) were analysed, 57% among women (71,093); 74% of deaths occurred among those older than 45 years, especially senior adults (65+).

The big question is whether these vaccines can easily be accepted by their end-users. Our study aimed at determining sociodemographic factors associated with acceptance of vaccines and clinical trials of COVID-19 in western Uganda. METHOD: A simplified snowball sampling technique was used to select 1067 respondents of 18-70 years in western Uganda using an online questionnaire from July to September 2020. Vaccine acceptability and risk perception were assessed using odds ratio at 95% confidence interval in R software version 3.6.3. RESULTS: There were 1067 participants in the study. The majority were males (73.2%) and age group 31-40 years (32.6%). The acceptance rate for COVID-19 vaccination was (53.6%; 572/1067) with those aged 18-20 years, males, elites at tertiary level of education (degree or diploma), students, Muslims, married, non-salary earners and rural dwellers having better odds and likeliness to accept vaccination. Only 44.6% (476/1067) showed interest in clinical trials among which; males, primary school leavers, students, Christians, un-married, respondents who didn't earn any salary and rural dwellers had better odds and likelihood to participate in clinical trials. CONCLUSION: There was a low level of vaccine acceptance and clinical trial interest in western Uganda. Minority groups in the study i.e., Muslims, students, primary school leavers, un-married rural dwellers among others showed more interest in vaccination and clinical trials.

A cross-sectional study was conducted in a neonatal tertiary referral center in northern Italy during Italy's lockdown. We enrolled mothers with a negative nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), adequate oral and written comprehension of the Italian language, and absence of underlying maternal or neonatal clinical conditions. Maternal anxiety levels were assessed through the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Form Y (STAI-Y). Maternal perception of staff's support was evaluated by the Nurse Parent Support Tool (NPST). A STATE-A (concurrent emotional state after a specific situation) score &#8805; 40 was considered indicative of clinically significant symptoms of anxiety. A total of 109 mothers completed the study. Mean STATE-A score was &#8805;40 in 42% of mothers, and median NPST score was 4.23. Mothers separated from their partner had a mean STATE-A score &#8805; 40 in a higher percentage of cases than those who were not (51% vs. 30%, p = 0.03) and a lower perception of caregiver support.

Results Older adults exhibited lower antibody responses after one and two vaccine doses for all measures. In multivariable analyses correcting for sociodemographic, chronic health and vaccine-related variables, age remained independently associated with all response outcomes. The number of chronic health conditions was additionally associated with lower binding antibody responses after two doses, and male sex with lower ACE2 competition activity after one dose. Responses waned universally at three months after the second dose, but binding antibodies, ACE2 competition and neutralizing activities remained significantly lower with age.

While the origin of this emerging pathogen remains uncertain, an increase in the reported incidence of respiratory diseases was noted during March 2009 at the town of La Gloria, in the southeastern state of Veracruz, Mexico. So far, this is the first community in which a case of novel influenza A H1N1 virus has been identified. Further cases were rapidly detected in other areas of Mexico and elsewhere. Initially, the atypical respiratory disease outbreak caused great uncertainty posing a challenge to the Mexican health system. Control measures such as social distancing, timely medical care, and personal hygiene have so far proven effective in containing the outbreak, resulting in a decline of the number of new cases. To the best of our knowledge, it appears that the virus might not be as virulent or contagious as previously thought. Here we provide a description of the influenza epidemic spread in Mexico. As the virus disseminates worldwide, there is concern about the possibility of a new reassortment resulting in a more pathogenic strain that will pose a threat for every country. The influenza epidemic provided lessons that underscore the importance of epidemiologic surveillance and preparedness.

METHODS: Mouse myocardial I/R injury model was created by 30-min coronary artery occlusion followed by 24-h reperfusion, the mice were then divided into the sham group (n=7), the I/R group (n=13), the tirofiban group (TIR, positive drug treatment, n=9), and the SXJ group (n=11). Infarct size (IS), risk region (RR), and left ventricle (LV) were analyzed with double staining methods. In addition, H9C2 rat cardiomyocytes were cultured with Na(2)S(2)O(4) to simulate I/R in vitro. The phosphorylation of extracellular regulated protein kinases1/2 (ERK1/2), protein kinase B (AKT), glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3), and protein expression of GATA4 in nucleus were detected with Western blot assay. RESULTS: The ratio of IS/RR in SXJ and TIR groups were lower than that in I/R group (SXJ, 22.4% 6.6%; TIR, 20.8%3.3%; vs. I/R, 35.4%3.7%, P<0.05, respectively).

While saliva (SA) specimens provide an alternative, few studies have comprehensively characterized the performance of SA specimens in longitudinal studies. METHODS: We compared SARS-CoV-2 detections between paired self-collected ANS and SA specimens from a household transmission study. Participants recorded symptoms and paired ANS and SA specimens daily for 14 days. Specimens were tested using RT-PCR. We calculated the proportion of detections identified by each specimen type among the detections from both types combined. We computed percent agreement and Kappa statistics to assess concordance in detections. We also computed estimates stratified by presence of symptoms, and examined the influence of traditional and inactivating transport media on the performance of ANS. RESULTS: We examined 2535 self-collected paired specimens from 216 participants. Among 1,238(49%) paired specimens with detections by either specimen type, ANS identified 77.1%[954](95%CI: 74.6C79.3%) and SA 81.9%[1014](79.7C84.0%), with a difference of 4.9%(1.4C8.5%). Overall agreement was 80.0% and Kappa was 0.6(0.5-0.6).

METHODS: From September 2019 to May 2021, data from medical records were collected and analysed from six public hospitals in Madrid, including seven adult, high-risk patient groups: patients in haemodialysis or pre-dialysis programmes, co-infected with HIV, with advanced liver disease (ALD), with hereditary haematological diseases, with transplants and people who inject drugs (PWID). RESULTS: Here we present an analysis of 3994 patients (68.8% male), 91.2% were tested for anti-HCV and 28.9% were positive. Of the total, 34.5% were tested for HCVCRNA and 62.4% of these were positive. Of those HCVCRNA positive, 98.0% were treatment-eligible: in 7.4%, treatment is ongoing and in 89.3% completed.

In this study, we performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) on a collection of 124 PRRSV-1 positive serum samples that were collected over a 5-year period (2015C2019) in Belgium. Our results show that (nearly) complete PRRSV genomes can be obtained directly from serum samples with a high success rate. Analysis of the coding regions confirmed the exceptionally high genetic diversity, even among Belgian PRRSV-1 strains. To gain more insight into the added value of WGS, we performed phylogenetic cluster analyses on separate ORF datasets as well as on a single, concatenated dataset (CDS) containing all ORFs. A comparison between the CDS and ORF clustering schemes revealed numerous discrepancies. To explain these differences, we performed a large-scale recombination analysis, which allowed us to identify a large number of potential recombination events that were scattered across the genome. As PRRSV does not contain typical recombination hot-spots, typing PRRSV strains based on a single ORF is not recommended. Although the typing accuracy can be improved by including multiple regions, our results show that the full genetic diversity among PRRSV strains can only be captured by analysing (nearly) complete genomes.

Based on national survey data, children from some racial and ethnic minority groups have a higher prevalence of obesity, asthma, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension; were diagnosed more frequently with COVID-19; and had more severe outcomes compared with their non-Hispanic White (NHW) counterparts. Furthermore, a higher proportion of children from some racial and ethnic minority groups lived in families with incomes less than 200% of the federal poverty level or in households lacking secure employment compared with NHW children. Children from some racial and ethnic minority groups were also more likely to attend school via online learning compared with NHW counterparts.

METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of 67 patients admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 pneumonia. The diagnosis was confirmed using polymerase chain reaction testing of nasopharyngeal specimens. The deep veins were examined using compression duplex ultrasonography with the transducer on B-mode.

Blood samples for humoral and cell-mediated immune response evaluation were obtained before vaccination (T0), before the second administration (T1) and 21 days after the second dose (T2). The primary end-point was the evaluation of the percentage of participants showing a significant increase in SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells, measured by an ELISPOT assay, after the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine. The proportion of patients who reached the primary endpoint is computed together with its exact binomial 95% confidence interval (95%CI).

AIMS: The aims of this study are: (1) to determine the impact of the B-EPIC intervention on maternal tobacco use and stage of change; (2) to determine the impact of B-EPIC on tobacco-related maternal and infant health outcomes including gestational age at birth, birthweight, NAS diagnosis and severity, and number of ear and respiratory infections during the first six months; (3) to compare healthcare utilization and costs incurred by pregnant patients that receive the B-EPIC intervention versus TAU. METHODS: We plan to enroll 100 pregnant women on MOUD for this randomized controlled trial (B-EPIC intervention n = 50 and treatment as usual n = 50).

However, strokes have also been increasingly observed in mild COVID, post COVID, or without obvious COVID illness. Objective: To share our experience with a specific stroke type noted during the COVID pandemic period. Materials and Methods: A single-center observational study was conducted in Western India from January to December 2020, and data regarding stroke patients admitted under Neurology services were noted. Clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of strokes and subtypes were documented. Results: A total of 238 stroke patients were admitted in 2020, 76.5% during the COVID pandemic period. Among 153 ischemic strokes, 16.3% and 56.2% had large vessel occlusion (LVO) in pre-COVID and COVID pandemic period, respectively. Of all ischemic strokes, 20.9% (18 patients) and 12% (3 patients) had free floating thrombus (FFT) in the COVID versus pre-COVID period, respectively. Only 44.4% of all FFT patients could be proven SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive while 50% were COVID suspect with surrogate markers of heightened inflammation at time of stroke. All patients were given anticoagulation and average mRS at discharge was 3.1 (range: 1-6) and 1.84 (range: 0-4) at 3-month follow-up in survivors. Conclusions: This study highlights the presence of FFT causing LVO as a new stroke subtype during the COVID-19 pandemic. With renewed and steeper spike in COVID-19 cases, especially new variants, the resurgence of this stroke subtype needs to be actively explored early in the course of illness to reduce morbidity and mortality.","output":"Large Vessel Occlusions By Free Floating Thrombi in Strokes During the COVID-19 pandemic- A Single Center Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe a minimum, rapidly scalable ventilator designed for COVID-19 patients with ARDS.

Melanin is synthesized from l-tyrosin in the melanosomes, where tyrosinase and other melanogenic factors are recruited via the vesicle transport system. Genetic and biochemical approaches have revealed a correlation between impairments in the vesicle transport system and albinism. However, the specificity of the individual transport systems for the corresponding melanogenic factors has not been well elucidated yet. Here, we report that the thioxothiazolidin derivative, 4-OST (4-[(5E)-5-[(4-fluorophenyl)methylidene]-4-oxo-2-sulfanylidene-1,3-thiazolidin-3-yl]-4-azatricyclo [5.2.1.02 ,6]dec-8-ene-3,5-dione: CAS RN. 477766-87-3) strongly inhibited melanogenesis in mouse melanoma B16F10 cells. 4-OST reduces tyrosinase protein levels without affecting its messenger RNA levels or enzymatic activity. Although a reduction in tyrosinase protein level was observed in the presence of a protein synthesis inhibitor, the reduction may be coupled with protein synthesis. Similarly, GIF-2202 (a derivative of 4-OST) lowers tyrosinase protein levels without affecting the levels of another melanogenic enzyme, tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1) level. The reduction in tyrosinase protein level is associated with an increase in the levels of the lysosomal proteinase cathepsin S. Chloroquine, a lysosome inhibitor, restored the tyrosinase protein level downregulated by GIF-2202, although no effects of other inhibitors (against proteasome, autophagy, or exocytosis) were observed. In addition, GIF-2202 segregated the immunofluorescence signals of tyrosinase from those of TYRP1. Chloroquine treatment resulted in co-localization of tyrosinase and cathepsin S signals near the perinuclear region, suggesting that 4-OST and GIF-2202 may alter the destination of the tyrosinase vesicle from the melanosome to the lysosome. 4-OST and GIF-2202 can be new tools for studying the tyrosinase-specific vesicle transport system.","output":"Thioxothiazolidin derivative, 4-OST, inhibits melanogenesis by enhancing the specific recruitment of tyrosinase-containing vesicles to lysosome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Persisting limitations in respiratory function and gas exchange, cognitive impairment, and mental health deterioration have been observed weeks and months after acute SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).

The aim of our study was to assess the post-vaccination IgG response against the spike protein (S-RBD IgG) in relation to age, gender and body mass index (BMI). Material and Methods: The study involved 766 Healthcare Workers who received two doses of BioNTech/Pfizer vaccination (December 2020-March 2021) and were tested for S-RBD IgG (CMIA) 20-40 days after the second vaccine dose. These subjects were always negative to SARS CoV-2 nasopharyngeal periodical swabs and were negative to Ab anti SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG (CLIA) measured before the first dose of vaccine. Results: The 766 workers (70.8% female and 29.2% male) were all positive for the antibody levels determined after the second dose of vaccine (S-RDB IgG range: 190.8-63093 AU/mL). Multivariable data analysis showed that the increase in the S-RBD IgG was more pronounced in younger subjects (p<0.001) and in women (p<0.05). Data analysis also showed an increase in the levels of S-RDB IgG in subjects with greater BMI (p<0.05). Conclusion: At a first check (20-40 days after the vaccination), the SARS-Co-V-2 antibody levels in the studied sample were influenced by age and gender, as expected. Contrary to data reported by others, subjects with greater BMI showed an increased antibody response, but this finding, as well as the temporal trend of antibody levels, need to be further investigated.","output":"Body Mass Index (BMI) and serum levels of SARS-Co-V-2 specific antibodies in a group of Healthcare Workers after COVID-19 vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we present ArCOV-19, an Arabic COVID-19 Twitter dataset that spans one year, covering the period from 27th of January 2020 till 31st of January 2021.

OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to examine the feasibility of a virtual reality (VR) active video gaming system (ie, bundle of consumer-available equipment) to meet US physical activity guidelines in two youth with SB. METHODS: Two youth with SB-a 12-year-old female and a 13-year-old male; both full-time wheelchair users-participated in a brief, 4-week exercise program using a popular VR head-mounted display: Oculus Quest (Facebook Technologies). The system included a Polar H10 (Polar Canada) Bluetooth heart rate monitor, a no-cost mobile phone app (VR Health Exercise Tracker [Virtual Reality Institute of Health and Exercise]), and 13 games. The intervention protocol was conducted entirely in the homes of the participants due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The VR system was shipped to participants and they were instructed to do their best to complete 60 minutes of moderate-intensity VR exercise per day. Exercise duration, intensity, and calories expended were objectively monitored and recorded during exercise using the heart rate monitor and a mobile app. Fatigue and depression were measured via self-report questionnaires at pre- and postintervention. Participants underwent a semistructured interview with research staff at postintervention. RESULTS: Across the intervention period, the total average minutes of all exercise performed each week for participants 1 and 2 were 281 (SD 93) and 262 (SD 55) minutes, respectively. The total average minutes of moderate-intensity exercise performed per week for participants 1 and 2 were 184 (SD 103) (184/281, 65.4%) and 215 (SD 90) (215/262, 82.1%) minutes, respectively. One participant had a reduction in their depression score, using the Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders (Neuro-QoL) test, from baseline to postintervention, but no other changes were observed for fatigue and depression scores. Participants reported that the amount of exercise they completed was far higher than what was objectively recorded, due to usability issues with the chest-worn heart rate monitor. Participants noted that they were motivated to exercise due to the enjoyment of the games and VR headset as well as support from a caregiver.

RESULTS: Sixty-one records from 59 studies were included in the analysis: 25, 20, 11 and 5 from Europe, North America, Asia and Oceania, respectively. There was variation in study methodology and outcomes. Heterogeneity of incidence rates was greatest among studies conducted in Asia. Meta-analysis showed that incidence increased with age, was lower in males compared to females, tended to be lower in Europe and North America compared to Asia and Oceania and increased with year of study data. The data-driven meta-regression model included continent, year of study data, gender, age and an age  gender interaction term. The difference in incidence between males and females was greater in younger ages (e.g., 50C59) compared to older age groups (e.g., 80+).

The study makes two main contributions: a) it allows the relationship between indebtedness and firms investment to be non-linear;and b) it contrasts whether the impact of indebtedness and the degree of financial restriction differ depending on the size of the company (SME vs large). Results show that while in SMEs indebtedness has a negative impact on investment, there is a threshold beyond which this effect is even larger (based on a debt/assets ratio of 59%). However, in large companies the impact of indebtedness is positive although there is also a threshold (36.5%) from which the effect becomes negative and investment decreases. In the case of financial restrictions, investment decreases as the degree of financial restriction increases, but in SMEs the penalty is higher. From an economic impact perspective, the degree of financial constraints is much higher than that of indebtedness. These results highlight the importance of designing specific measures to improve conditions of access to financing for SMEs.

METHODS A total of 7072 adolescents who participated in the 1-year follow-up of Shandong Adolescent Behavior & Health Cohort (SABHC) were included for the analysis. A self-administered questionnaire was used to assess authoritarian parenting, depressive symptoms, non-suicidal self-injury, and family demographics in November-December in 2015. One year later, a follow-up survey was carried out to assess participants' depressive symptoms and NSSI. RESULTS Of the sample, mean age was 14.58 (SD = 1.46) and 3536 (50%) were females at baseline. 19.4% adolescents reported having ever NSSI over the past 12 months at baseline, and 8.8% reported having ever NSSI at 1-year follow-up. The association of maternal authoritarian parenting with subsequent NSSI was at least partially mediated by depressive symptoms. Mediation analyses showed that effect size was 0.194 in the entire sample, 0.192 in females and 0.193 in males, respectively. LIMITATION All variables were measured based on self-report.

Universal vaccine development aims to overcome these deficits by redirecting antibody responses to functionally conserved sites of viral vulnerability to enable broad coverage. However, this is challenging as such antibodies are largely immunologically silent, both following vaccination and infection. Defining and then overcoming the immunological basis for such subdominant or immuno-recessive antibody targeting has thus become an important aspect of universal vaccine development.

However, successful mitigation strategies have rarely been reported. In particular, environmental disinfection or replacement of contaminated equipment usually failed to eradicate environmental sources of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. METHODS: We report the investigation and termination of an outbreak of P. aeruginosa producing VIM carbapenemase (PA-VIM) in the adult intensive care unit (ICU) of a Swiss tertiary care hospital with active case finding, environmental sampling and whole genome sequencing (WGS) of patient and environmental strains. We also describe the implemented control strategies and their effectiveness on eradication of the environmental reservoir. RESULTS: Between April 2018 and September 2020, 21 patients became either infected or colonized with a PA-VIM strain. For 16 of them, an acquisition in the ICU was suspected. Among 131 environmental samples collected in the ICU, 13 grew PA-VIM in sink traps and drains. WGS confirmed the epidemiological link between clinical and environmental strains and the monoclonal pattern of the outbreak. After removing sinks from patient rooms and implementation of waterless patient care, no new acquisition was detected in the ICU within 8 months after the intervention. DISCUSSION: Implementation of waterless patient care with removal of the sinks in patient rooms was successful for termination of a PA-VIM ICU outbreak linked to multiple environmental water sources.

Aim To investigate the experiences and attitudes of midwives who have provided pregnancy and childbirth care to women with a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection. Methods A qualitative phenomenological study was carried out in two Spanish tertiary hospitals. Fourteen midwives were recruited by purposive sampling technique. Data were collected through individual in-depth interviews and analysed using Giorgis descriptive method. Findings Three themes emerged: challenges and differences when working in a pandemic, emotional and mental health and wellbeing and womens emotional impact perceived by midwives. Midwives pointed to several factors tied to a safe, supportive and empowering work place: support from staff and managers, access to adequate personal protective equipment, and reliable guidelines. They also dealt with professional and personal challenges during the pandemic, showing feelings of fear, anxiety, uncertainty, discomfort, lack of support, and knowledge. Finally, midwives expressed their concerns about the feelings of pregnant women with COVID-19, such as fear, anxiety, and loneliness.

Aim: We evaluated the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 in blood donors in Nuevo Leon, Mexico as a strategy for asymptomatic case detection of COVID-19 and epidemic progression. Methods/Materials: We tested 1968 blood donors that attended two regional donation centers in Northeast Mexico from January 1st to August 30, 2020, to identify anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG by chemiluminescent immunoassay. Additionally, routine tests for donors including Brucella, Chagas, HCV, VDRL, HIV-1, and HBsAg identification were performed. Results: We found 77 donors reactive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG (seroprevalence 3.99%) and none of them had reported recent COVID-19 symptoms. Donors aged 18 to 49 years (89.5%) were more likely to be seropositive compared to those aged 50 years or older (10.5%) (P<0.001). Prevalence of antibodies increased each epidemiological (EPI) week, parallel to the report of confirmed cases by RT-PCR, identifying the highest prevalence between EPI week 33 and 35 (10.2% to 19%). The metropolitan area of Monterrey recorded the highest number of cases. Routine tests showed that the prevalence of anti-Brucella was 0.13%, anti-HCV 0.5%, anti-HIV-1-2 0.14%, HBsAg 0.16%, Chagas 0.48% and syphilis 1.06%. Conclusions: There is a growing trend of seroprevalence over time, parallel to the constantly increasing epidemic curve in our region and it was higher under 49 years of age associated with asymptomatic infection in donors from the Nuevo Leon area.

Cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection quickly grew by several thousand per day. Less than 100 days later, the World Health Organization declared that the rapidly spreading viral outbreak had become a global pandemic. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is typically associated with fever and respiratory symptoms. It often progresses to severe respiratory distress and multi-organ failure which carry a high mortality rate. Older patients or those with medical comorbidities are at greater risk for severe disease. Inflammation, pulmonary edema and an over-reactive immune response can lead to hypoxia, respiratory distress and lung damage. Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) possess potent and broad-ranging immunomodulatory activities. Multiple in vivo studies in animal models and ex vivo human lung models have demonstrated the MSC's impressive capacity to inhibit lung damage, reduce inflammation, dampen immune responses and aid with alveolar fluid clearance. Additionally, MSCs produce molecules that are antimicrobial and reduce pain. Upon administration by the intravenous route, the cells travel directly to the lungs where the majority are sequestered, a great benefit for the treatment of pulmonary disease. The in vivo safety of local and intravenous administration of MSCs has been demonstrated in multiple human clinical trials, including studies of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Recently, the application of MSCs in the context of ongoing COVID-19 disease and other viral respiratory illnesses has demonstrated reduced patient mortality and, in some cases, improved long-term pulmonary function. Adipose-derived stem cells (ASC), an abundant type of MSC, are proposed as a therapeutic option for the treatment of COVID-19 in order to reduce morbidity and mortality. Additionally, when proven to be safe and effective, ASC treatments may reduce the demand on critical hospital resources. The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in significant healthcare and socioeconomic burdens across the globe. There is a desperate need for safe and effective treatments.

ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), and TMPRSS2 (transmembrane protease serine 2) mediate viral infection of host cells. We reasoned that differences in ACE2 or TMPRSS2 gene expression in sputum cells among patients with asthma may identify subgroups at risk for COVID-19 morbidity. Objectives: To determine the relationship between demographic features and sputum ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression in asthma. Methods: We analyzed gene expression for ACE2 and TMPRSS2, and for ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1) (rhinovirus receptor as a comparator) in sputum cells from 330 participants in SARP-3 (Severe Asthma Research Program-3) and 79 healthy control subjects. Measurements and Main Results: Gene expression of ACE2 was lower than TMPRSS2, and expression levels of both genes were similar in asthma and health. Among patients with asthma, male sex, African American race, and history of diabetes mellitus were associated with higher expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) was associated with lower expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, but treatment with triamcinolone acetonide did not decrease expression of either gene. These findings differed from those for ICAM-1, where gene expression was increased in asthma and less consistent differences were observed related to sex, race, and use of ICS. Conclusions: Higher expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in males, African Americans, and patients with diabetes mellitus provides rationale for monitoring these asthma subgroups for poor COVID-19 outcomes. The lower expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 with ICS use warrants prospective study of ICS use as a predictor of decreased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and decreased COVID-19 morbidity.","output":"COVID-19Crelated Genes in Sputum Cells in Asthma.

Virus with the C.1.2 variant spike, which is heavily mutated, was more neutralization-resistant than that of any of variants of concern. The resistance of the C.1.2 spike was caused by a combination of the RBD mutations N501Y, Y449H and E484K and the NTD mutations. Although Mu and C.1.2 were partially resistant to neutralizing antibody, neutralizing titers elicited by mRNA vaccination remained above what is found in convalescent sera and thus are likely to remain protective against severe disease. The neutralizing titers of sera from infection-experienced BNT162b2-vaccinated individuals, those with a history of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, were as much as 15-fold higher than those of vaccinated individuals without previous infection and effectively neutralized all of the variants. The findings demonstrate that individuals can raise a broadly neutralizing humoral response by generating a polyclonal response to multiple spike protein epitopes that should protect against current and future variants.","output":"Neutralization of Mu and C.1.2 SARS-CoV-2 Variants by Vaccine-elicited Antibodies in Individuals With and Without Previous History of Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Minimal access techniques have transformed the way pediatric surgery is practiced. Due to various constraints, surgical residency programs have not been able to tutor adequate training skills in the routine setting. The advent of new technology and methods in minimally invasive surgery (MIS), has similarly contributed to the need for systematic skills' training in a safe, simulated environment. To enable the training of the proper technique among pediatric surgery trainees, we have advanced a porcine non-survival model for endoscopic surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS The technical advancements over the past 3 years and a subjective validation of the porcine model from 114 participating trainees using a standard questionnaire and a 5-point Likert scale have been described here. Mean attitude scores and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used for statistical analysis of the data. RESULTS Almost all trainees agreed or strongly agreed that the animal-based model was appropriate (98.35%) and also acknowledged that such workshops provided adequate practical experience before attempting on human subjects (96.6%). Mean attitude score for respondents was 19.08 (SD 3.4, range 4-20). Attitude scores showed no statistical association with years of experience or the level of seniority, indicating a positive attitude among all groups of respondents.

We propose an airway management approach that is especially relevant in the current COVID-19 pandemic and provides instructions for: (1) Elective intubation for respiratory failure; and (2) Emergency intubation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. To minimise risk, intubation methods must be kept as straightforward as possible and should include the provision of appropriate personal protection and equipment to healthcare workers. We identify two key considerations: that bag-mask ventilation should be avoided if possible and that bacterial and viral filters should be placed in the respiratory circuit.

The final goal is a simplerand more effective use of products for everyone involved.Methods: Research was conducted in three stages. Inthe first stage, the existing condition in packaging designwas analysed: information hierarchy/arrangement on 8 significant manufacturers' products considering 1-the typeof information and 2-different user groups. Second stageconsisted of conducting surveys with 2 focus groups representing two main user groups who use the packaging differently-medicine consumers and healthcare professionals.(1)Consumer focus group consisted of 81 participants, recruitedrandomly from various age groups (age 10 to 89). They wereasked closed-ended questions. Healthcare professionalsfocus group consisted of 5 pharmacists with extensive experience. They were asked open-ended questions. The collected data from both research stages was statistically andqualitatively analysed in order to define the main problemswith medicine packaging design and use. Identified problemswere then addressed through the design process. The thirdstage included development of a standardised design systemin accordance with information design theory and cognitivepsychology findings.(2) These helped establish the systembuilding blocks/rules: information hierarchy and organization, use of colour, shape and typography.Results: Analysis of existing conditions clearly exposedthe heterogeneity and unsuitability of the majority of medicine packaging design. These caused similar problems toboth user groups: trouble finding information (73 %), lack/redundancy of information (47 %/17 %), illegible, unreadable typography (39 %), distracting visual elements (26 %),unclear distinction between medicines (17 %). These leadto various consequences: incorrect route of administration(39 %), consuming/prescribing expired (30 %) or incorrectproduct (8 %), time loss (8 %).

As a result, targeting the fibrinolytic system has been of great interest in the field of cancer biology. Even though there is a plethora of encouraging preclinical evidence on the potential therapeutic benefits of targeting the key oncogenic components of the fibrinolytic system, none of them made it from bench to bedside due to a limited number of clinical trials on them. This review summarizes our existing understanding of the various diagnostic and therapeutic strategies targeting the fibrinolytic system during cancer.","output":"Fibrinolytic System and Cancer: Diagnostic and Therapeutic Applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Numerous models, of variable quality, exist to impart the complex skills required to perform vascular anastomosis. These models differ with regard to the kinds of materials used, as well as their sizes, the time needed for their preparation, their availability, and the associated costs. The present study describes a bench model that uses formalin-fixed porcine aorta, and its evaluation by young surgical residents during a recent skills course. FINDINGS The aortic segments used were a by-product of slaughtering. They were fixed and stored after harvesting for eventual use. Ten young surgical residents participated, and each performed one end-to-side vascular anastomosis. The evaluation was a questionnaire maintaining anonymity of the participant containing questions addressing particular aspects of the model and the experiences of the trainee, along with their ratings concerning the need for a training course to learn vascular anastomosis techniques. The scoring on the survey was done using a global 6-point rating scale (Likert Scale). In addition, we ranked the present model by reviewing the current literature for models that address vascular anastomosis skills.The trainees who participated were within their first two years of training (1.25 +/- 0.46). A strong agreement in terms of the necessity of training for vascular anastomosis techniques was evident among the participating trainees (5.90 +/- 0.32), who had only few prior manual experiences (total number 1.50 +/- 0.53). The query revealed a strong agreement that porcine aorta is a suitable model that fits the needs for training vascular anastomosis skills (5.70 +/- 0.48). Only a few bench models designed to teach surgical residents vascular anastomosis techniques were available in the literature. CONCLUSIONS The preparatory and financial resources needed to perform anastomosis skills training using porcine aorta are few. The presented bench model appears to be appropriate for learning vascular anastomosis skills, as rated by the surgical trainees themselves.","output":"Description and evaluation of a bench porcine model for teaching surgical residents vascular anastomosis skills."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The government's physical distancing policy to prevent transmission of the covid19 virus caused changes in learning patterns from face-to-face learning to distance education The application of distance education at Universitas Negeri Yogyakarta is one of them through elearning Measurement of the level of e-learning user satisfaction is an assessment of the success of e-learning itself The method used to measure students' level of satisfaction using e-learning is End-User Computing Satisfaction (EUCS) EUCS has five indicators, namely, Content, Accuracy, Format, Ease of Use, and Timelines The research sample was taken using a random sampling technique The data collection technique was carried out using a questionnaire Data analysis uses descriptive statistical analysis and inferential statistical analysis Based on the analysis results, the content evaluation value is 4 0300, the accuracy evaluation value is 4 0200, the evaluation value is 4 2550, the evaluation value for easy use is 4 0288, and the evaluation value for timeliness is 4 0900 The overall analysis results showed that the students were satisfied with the e-learning course in vocational learning media ? 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing All rights reserved","output":"Analysis of student satisfaction of e-learning using the end-user computing satisfaction method during the Covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains unacceptably high at approximately 39%. One of the only treatments is supportive: mechanical ventilation. However, improperly set mechanical ventilation can further increase the risk of death in patients with ARDS. Recent studies suggest that ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI) is caused by exaggerated regional lung strain, particularly in areas of alveolar instability subject to tidal recruitment/derecruitment and stress-multiplication. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that if a ventilation strategy can maintain stable lung inflation and homogeneity, regional dynamic strain would be reduced and VILI attenuated. A time-controlled adaptive ventilation (TCAV) method was developed to minimize dynamic alveolar strain by adjusting the delivered breath according to the mechanical characteristics of the lung. The goal of this review is to describe how the TCAV method impacts pathophysiology and protects lungs with, or at high risk of, acute lung injury. We present work from our group and others that identifies novel mechanisms of VILI in the alveolar microenvironment and demonstrates that the TCAV method can reduce VILI in translational animal ARDS models and mortality in surgical/trauma patients. Our TCAV method utilizes the airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) mode and is based on opening and collapsing time constants, which reflect the viscoelastic properties of the terminal airspaces. Time-controlled adaptive ventilation uses inspiratory and expiratory time to (1) gradually nudge alveoli and alveolar ducts open with an extended inspiratory duration and (2) prevent alveolar collapse using a brief (sub-second) expiratory duration that does not allow time for alveolar collapse. The new paradigm in TCAV is configuring each breath guided by the previous one, which achieves real-time titration of ventilator settings and minimizes instability induced tissue damage. This novel methodology changes the current approach to mechanical ventilation, from arbitrary to personalized and adaptive. The outcome of this approach is an open and stable lung with reduced regional strain and greater lung protection.","output":"Prevention and treatment of acute lung injury with time-controlled adaptive ventilation: physiologically informed modification of airway pressure release ventilation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS Concerns have been raised that dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) may increase the risk of pneumonia. We analysed observational data and clinical trials to explore whether use of DPP-4i modifies the risk of pneumonia. METHODS We identified patients with diabetes in the Veneto Region administrative database and performed a propensity score matching (PSM) between new users of DPP-4 inhibitors and new users of other oral glucose lowering medications (OGLM). We compared the rate of hospitalization for pneumonia between matched cohorts using the Cox proportional hazard model. The same analysis was repeated using the database of a local diabetes outpatient clinic. We retrieved similar observational studies from the literature to perform a meta-analysis. Results from trials reporting pneumonia rates among patients randomized to DPP-4 inhibitors versus placebo/active comparator were also meta-analysed. RESULTS In the Regional database, after matching 6495 patients/group, new users of DPP-4 inhibitors had a lower rate of hospitalization for pneumonia than new users of other OGLM (HR 0.76; 95% C.I. 0.61-0.95). In the outpatient database, after matching 867 patients/group, new users of DPP-4 inhibitors showed a non-significantly lower rate of hospitalization for pneumonia (HR 0.65; 95% C.I. 0.41-1.04). The meta-analysis of observational studies yielded an overall non-significant lower risk of hospitalization for pneumonia among DPP-4i users (RR 0.81; 95% C.I. 0.65-1.01). The meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials showed no overall effect of DPP-4i on pneumonia risk (RR 1.06; 95% C.I. 0.93-1.20).

This study aims to document and evaluate a transnational Master of Health Administration (MHA) course launched in 2000 for the benefit of Chinese health managers. METHODS: A case study of the MHA program jointly run by an Australian university and a Chinese Medical University was conducted. We reviewed the development of the MHA course through a document analysis (key events recorded in achieves, minutes, and audits) followed by reflection (by two course coordinators), extracting key themes related to adaptative strategies. We then conducted a questionnaire survey of 139 graduates seeking their views on relevance, satisfaction and challenges associated with each subject within the course, the relevance of key management skills (as determined by the Australasian College of Health Service Management competency framework), and the impact of the course on their personal career trajectories. Chi-square tests identified differences in the responses by age, gender, pre-training position, and current workplace. RESULTS: The curriculum pedagogy followed the principles of practice-based reflective learning. Research findings and student feedback shaped the curriculum design and subject content, to enhance management practices of the students. Survey participants expressed high levels of satisfaction and confirmed the relevance of all study subjects. Two subjects, health economics and data management, were perceived as being the most challenging. Of the ten management skills we assessed, relatively low self-rated confidence was found in strategic thinking and planning. Younger and less experienced graduates were more likely to report learning challenges (p < 0.05). Frontline managers were least likely to obtain promotion by changing employers ((2) = 6.02, p < 0.05) or being seconded to another position ((2) = 9.41, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This case study illustrates the suitability of cross-country partnerships in health management training, which offers opportunities for managers to systematically explore and acquire a comprehensive set of management skills applicable to their career needs. Opportunities for developing training aligned to career development opportunities are critical for attracting and developing a competent and well-prepared health service management workforce in China.

This process occurs when a large number of innate and adaptive immune cells activate and start producing pro-inflammatory cytokines, establishing an exacerbated feedback loop of inflammation. It is one of the factors contributing to the mortality observed with coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) for a subgroup of patients. CRS is not unique to the SARS-CoV-2 infection; it was prevalent in most of the major human coronavirus and influenza A subtype outbreaks of the past two decades (H5N1, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and H7N9). With a comprehensive literature search, we collected changing the cytokine levels from patients upon infection with the viral pathogens mentioned above. We analyzed published patient data to highlight the conserved and unique cytokine responses caused by these viruses. Our curation indicates that the cytokine response induced by SARS-CoV-2 is different compared to other CRS-causing respiratory viruses, as SARS-CoV-2 does not always induce specific cytokines like other coronaviruses or influenza do, such as IL-2, IL-10, IL-4, or IL-5. Comparing the collated cytokine responses caused by the analyzed viruses highlights a SARS-CoV-2-specific dysregulation of the type-I interferon (IFN) response and its downstream cytokine signatures.

The initial PCE dropped to 10.20 % after two days because of severe migration of O and Ag at the MoOX/Ag interface. We solved this by the insertion of a CrOX layer between the MoOX layer and the Ag electrode.

GBM cells and microenvironment secrete angiogenic factors and also express chemoattractant G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to their advantage. We investigated the role of the vasoactive peptide urotensin II (UII) and its receptor UT on GBM angiogenesis and tested potential ligand/therapeutic options based on this system. On glioma patient samples, the expression of UII and UT increased with the grade with marked expression in the vascular and peri-necrotic mesenchymal hypoxic areas being correlated with vascular density. In vitro human UII stimulated human endothelial HUV-EC-C and hCMEC/D3 cell motility and tubulogenesis. In mouse-transplanted Matrigel sponges, mouse (mUII) and human UII markedly stimulated invasion by macrophages, endothelial, and smooth muscle cells. In U87 GBM xenografts expressing UII and UT in the glial and vascular compartments, UII accelerated tumor development, favored hypoxia and necrosis associated with increased proliferation (Ki67), and induced metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 expression in Nude mice. UII also promoted a \\"tortuous\\" vascular collagen-IV expressing network and integrin expression mainly in the vascular compartment. GBM angiogenesis and integrin v3 were confirmed by in vivo 99mTc-RGD tracer imaging and tumoral capture in the non-necrotic area of U87 xenografts in Nude mice. Peptide analogs of UII and UT antagonist were also tested as potential tumor repressor. Urotensin II-related peptide URP inhibited angiogenesis in vitro and failed to attract vascular and inflammatory components in Matrigel in vivo. Interestingly, the UT antagonist/biased ligand urantide and the non-peptide UT antagonist palosuran prevented UII-induced tubulogenesis in vitro and significantly delayed tumor growth in vivo. Urantide drastically prevented endogenous and UII-induced GBM angiogenesis, MMP, and integrin activations, associated with GBM tumoral growth. These findings show that UII induces GBM aggressiveness with necrosis and angiogenesis through integrin activation, a mesenchymal behavior that can be targeted by UT biased ligands/antagonists.","output":"Targeting the Urotensin II/UT G Protein-Coupled Receptor to Counteract Angiogenesis and Mesenchymal Hypoxia/Necrosis in Glioblastoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Suicide has become a serious social health issue in modern society. Suicidal ideation is peoples thoughts about committing or planning suicide. Many factors, such as long-term exposure to negative feelings or life events, can lead to suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Among these approaches to suicide prevention, early detection of suicidal ideation is one of the most effective ways. Using social networking services provides a platform for people to express their sufferings and feelings in the real world, which provides a source for a deeper investigation into models and approaches for the detection of suicidal intent to enable prevention. This paper addresses the early detection of suicide ideation through the associative classification approach applied to Twitter social media. However, since the number of suicide intention tweets is tiny compared to the number of all the tweets, this leads us to an imbalanced classification problem, in which, the minority class (suicide intention) is more important than the majority class (no suicide intention). In such a situation, classical classifiers usually yield very inaccurate results regarding minor classes, since they can easily discover rules predicting the majority class and overlook those related to the minor. This paper aims to contribute to this line of research by introducing a new interestingness measure to enhance the classification process. This measure highlights the two classes regardless of their imbalanced distribution. Carried out experiments proved that the adapted CBA outweighs in terms of prediction accuracy the original one, and other pioneering baseline classification approaches.","output":"A novel imbalanced data classification approach for suicidal ideation detection on social media"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses first garnered widespread attention in 2002 when the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged from bats in China and rapidly spread in human populations.

Thus, a basic understanding of entry and replication mechanisms of coronaviruses is necessary to rationally evaluate potential antivirals. Here, we show that polyamines, small metabolites synthesized in human cells, facilitate coronavirus replication and the depletion of polyamines with FDA-approved molecules significantly reduces coronavirus replication. We find that diverse coronaviruses, including endemic and epidemic coronaviruses, exhibit reduced attachment and entry into polyamine-depleted cells. We further demonstrate that several molecules targeting the polyamine biosynthetic pathway are antiviral in vitro.

Antibody and T-cell immunity to conserved influenza virus antigens can protect animals against infection with diverse influenza strains. Although immunity against conserved antigens occurs in humans, whether such responses provide cross-protection in humans and could be harnessed as the basis for universal influenza vaccines is controversial. The 2009 pandemic provided an opportunity to investigate whether pre-existing cross-reactive immunity affected susceptibility to infection. METHODS. In 2009, we banked sera and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from blood donors, then monitored them for pandemic influenza infection (pH1N1) by polymerase chain reaction or seroconversion. Antibodies to hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), nucleoprotein (NP), matrix 2 (M2), and HA-pseudotypes were measured in sera. T-cell inteferon- enzyme-linked immunospot responses were measured in PBMC. RESULTS. There were 13 infections in 117 evaluable donors. Pre-existing T-cell reactivity to pH1N1 was substantial (of 153 donors tested, 146 had >100 spot-forming cells/10(6) cells). Antibodies reactive with pH1N1 were common: anti-NP (all donors) and anti-M2 (44% of donors). Pseudotype-neutralizing antibodies to H1 were detected, but not to highly conserved HA epitopes. Unexpectedly, donors with symptomatic pH1N1 infection had sharp rises in HA pseudotype-neutralizing antibodies, not only pH1N1 but also against multiple seasonal H1s. In addition, an exploratory study of a T-cell marker (response to NP(418-426)) identified probable infection missed by standard criteria. CONCLUSIONS. Although the number of infections was inadequate for conclusions about mechanisms of protection, this study documents the wide variety of pre-existing, cross-reactive, humoral and cellular immune responses to pandemic influenza virus antigens in humans. These responses can be compared with results of other studies and explored in universal influenza vaccine studies.","output":"Surveillance Study of Influenza Occurrence and Immunity in a Wisconsin Cohort During the 2009 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Salmonella enteric serovar Typhimurium is the most common enteric pathogen in humans and animals.

The classical neurosurgical operation is bimanual, i.e. the microsurgical instruments are operated with both hands. Often, operations have to be carried out in narrow corridors at the depth of several centimeters. With the current technology, the operator must manually adjust the field of view during surgery which poses a disruption in the operating flow. Until now, technical adjuncts existed in the form of a mouthpiece to move the stereo camera unit or voice commands and foot pedals to control other interaction tasks like optical configuration. However, these have not been widely adopted due to usability issues. This study tests two novel hands free interaction concepts based on head positioning and gaze tracking as an attempt to reduce the disruption during microneurosurgery and increase the efficiency of the user. METHODS: Technical equipment included the Pentero 900 microscope, HTC Vive Pro, and an inbuilt 3D-printed target probe. 11 neurosurgeons including 7 residents and 4 consultants participated in the study. The tasks created for this study were with the intention to mimic real microneurosurgical tasks to maintain applicative accuracy while testing the interaction concepts. The tasks involved visualization system adjustment to the specific target and touching the target. The first trial was conducted in a Virtual Reality setting applying the novel hands free interaction concepts, and the second one was conducted performing the same tasks on a 3D-printed target probe using manual field of view adjustment. The subjects completed both trials with the same predetermined tasks, in order to validate the feasibility of the novel technology. The data collected for this study was obtained with the help of review protocols, detailed post-trial interviews, video and audio recordings, along with time measurements while performing the tasks. RESULTS: The user study conducted at the Charit Hospital in Berlin, found that the gaze tracking and head positioning based microscope adjustment were 18% and 29% faster respectively than the classical bimanual adjustment of the microscope. Focused user interviews showed the user's proclivity for the new interaction concepts, as they offered minimal disruption between the simultaneous target selection and camera position adjustment.

However, on March 26, 2020, six leading medical organizations released a joint statement warning clinicians that attempting this technique could lead to poor outcomes and high mortality. Nevertheless, hospitals around the United States and abroad are considering this technique out of desperation (eg, New York), but there is little data to guide their approach. The overall objective of this study is to utilize a computational model of mechanically ventilated lungs to assess how patient-specific lung mechanics and ventilator settings impact lung tidal volume (VT). METHODS: We developed a lumped-parameter computational model of multiple patients connected to a shared ventilator and validated it against a similar experimental study. We used this model to evaluate how patient-specific lung compliance and resistance would impact VT under 4 ventilator settings of pressure control level, PEEP, breathing frequency, and inspiratory:expiratory ratio. RESULTS: Our computational model predicts VT within 10% of experimental measurements. Using this model to perform a parametric study, we provide proof-of-concept for an algorithm to better match patients in different hypothetical scenarios of a single ventilator shared by > 1 patient.

Monocyte/macrophage accumulation and inflammation are crucial elements in the pathogenesis of hypertension-induced cardiac remodeling. The C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is a critical regulator of the macrophage-mediated immune response. Nevertheless, the contribution of CXCR4 to macrophage phenotype and function during the progression of HFpEF remains unclear. Herein, we aimed to determine the role of macrophagic CXCR4 in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Methods: As a HFpEF model, wild type mice and myeloid-specific CXCR4 deficiency mice were subjected to pressure overload for 30 days to assess the function of macrophagic CXCR4 on cardiac function. Medium from macrophages was used to treat cardiac fibroblasts to study macrophage-to-fibroblast signaling. Results: We found circulatory CXCR4+ immune cells, mainly monocytes, markedly increased in HFpEF patients with hypertension. In the experimental HFpEF mice model, macrophages but not neutrophils represent the main infiltrating inflammatory cells in the heart, abundantly expressing CXCR4. Myeloid-specific CXCR4 deficient impeded macrophage infiltration and inflammatory response in the heart of HFpEF mice, thus ameliorating cardiac fibrosis and improving cardiac diastolic function. Furthermore, transcriptomic profiling data revealed that CXCR4 loss in macrophages exhibited a decreased transcriptional signature associated with the regulation of inflammatory response. Notably, CXCR4 significantly augmented chemokine (C-X-C) motif ligand (CXCL3) expression, which at least partly contributed to fibrosis by promoting myofibroblast differentiation. Mechanistically, the increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in CXCR4 expressed macrophages could be attributed to the suppression of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ?3 (PPAR?3) activity. Conclusions: Collectively, our data supported that the infiltration of CXCR4+ macrophages in the heart exacerbates hypertension-induced diastolic function by promoting pro-inflammatory cytokines production and thus may serve as a potential therapeutic target for hypertension-induced HFpEF.","output":"CXCR4-dependent macrophage-to-fibroblast signaling contributes to cardiac diastolic dysfunction in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: On 2 March 2020, Tunisia has reported the first confirmed case of COVID-19.

In this study we demonstrate that the Q939S940 peptide bond, located between the polymerase and Zn-finger regions of pp1ab (the POLZn site), is processed by the 3CLpro, albeit inefficiently. Mutagenesis of the POLZn site, as well as the previously identified HD13C site in the 1a region of pp1a and pp1ab, demonstrated that the amino acid residues at the P2 and P1 positions of the cleavage site, occupied by L and Q, respectively, were important determinants of 3CLpro substrate specificity. Finally, a direct comparison of the 3CLpro-mediated cleavages at the HD13C and POLZn sites was made by determining the rate constants using synthetic peptides. The results show that while a larger polypeptide substrate carrying the HD13C site was processed more efficiently than a polypeptide substrate carrying the POLZn site, cleavage of the synthetic peptide substrates containing these two cleavage sites occurred at similar efficiencies. This indicates that the overall conformation of a large polyprotein substrate is important in the accessibility of the cleavage site to the proteinase.","output":"Further Requirements for Cleavage by the Murine Coronavirus 3C-like Proteinase: Identification of a Cleavage Site within ORF1b"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is an exploratory proof of concept analysis of individuals and families experiencing the public health crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic in 16 countries around the globe The objective is to explore how individuals and families are coping with their regular and new roles during the COVID-19 pandemic in general and, in particular, under the \\"Stay-at-Home Directive\\" (SAHD) SAHD is one of the crucial public health directives to contain the pandemic The study examines the concepts role strain, role compartmentalization and two of the three types of health-related behaviour (preventive health behaviour and sick-role behaviour) The secondary data examined through qualitative content analysis are 75 personal interviews with individuals published in the news media The interviews were identified using a systematic search of published news media articles around the world in FACTIVA during the period 1 January to 30 March 2020, the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic The findings confirm the positive influence of role compartmentalization in decreasing role strain in the context of a public health crisis as families re-arrange their lives under SAHD This influence appears stronger among healthy families (not yet infected by the virus) and among individuals who are parents ? 2020 Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina All rights reserved","output":"Wrestling with role strain in a pandemic: Family, 'stay-at-home' directive, and the covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a result of the critical health situation caused by COVID-19, governments and researchers have acknowledged the significance of epidemic models for understanding a transmissible disease and assessing public policies, in order to determine which ones are truly effective in mitigating its propagation.

The modality of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) combined with Western medicine (WM) approaches is being used to treat COVID-19 patients in China. Several systematic reviews (SRs) are available highlighting the efficacy and safety of TCM combined with WM approaches in COVID-19 patients. However, their evidence quality is not completely validated. Purpose: We aimed to assess the methodological quality and the risk of bias of the included SRs, assess the evidence quality of outcomes, and present their trends and gaps using the evidence mapping method. Methods: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, CNKI, CBM, and Wanfang Data were searched from inception until March 2021 to identify SRs pertaining to the field of TCM combined with WM approaches for COVID-19. The methodological quality of the SRs was assessed using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR 2), the risk of bias of the included SRs was assessed with the Risk of Bias in Systematic Review (ROBIS) tool, and the evidence quality of outcomes was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Results: In total, 23 SRs were found eligible. Twenty-one were rated of moderate confidence by AMSTAR 2, while 12 were rated at low risk using the ROBIS tool. In addition, most outcomes were graded as having moderate quality using the GRADE system. We found that the combined use of TCM and WM approaches could improve the CT recovery rate, effective rate, viral nucleic acid negative conversion rate, and the disappearance rate of fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Also, these approaches could decrease the conversion rate from mild to critical, white blood cell counts, and lymphocyte counts and shorten the time to viral assay conversion and the length of hospital stay. Conclusion: TCM combined with WM approaches had advantages in efficacy, laboratory, and clinical symptom outcomes of COVID-19, but the methodological deficiencies of SRs should be taken into consideration. Therefore, to better guide clinical practice in the future, the methodological quality of SRs should still be improved, and high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies should also be carried out.","output":"Evidence Mapping of 23 Systematic Reviews of Traditional Chinese Medicine Combined With Western Medicine Approaches for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of smartphones technologies has determined the abundant and prevalent computation.

Sequence analysis of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Nsp12) sequences from 30,366 different isolates were analysed for possible mutations. FDA-approved and investigational drugs were screened for interaction with both mutant and wild-type Nsp12-Nsp8 interfaces. Sequence analysis revealed that 70.42% of Nsp12 sequences showed conserved P323L mutation, located in the Nsp8 binding cleft. Compounds were screened for interface interaction, any with XP GScores lower than -7.0 kcal/mol were considered as possible interface inhibitors. RX-3117 (fluorocyclopentenyl cytosine) and Nebivolol had the highest binding affinities in both mutant and wild-type enzymes, therefore they were selected and resultant protein-ligand complexes were simulated for analysis of stability over 100 ns. Although the selected ligands had partial mobility in the binding cavity, they were not removed from the binding pocket after 100 ns. The ligand RX-3117 remained in the same position in the binding pocket of the mutant and wild-type enzyme after 100 ns MD simulation. However, the ligand Nebivolol folded and embedded in the binding pocket of mutant Nsp12 protein.

The main outcomes were ED revisit and the need for deferred hospital admission (protocol failure). Outcome predictors were analyzed by simple logistic regression model (OR; 95% CI). Potential savings of this medical care model were estimated. Of the 377 patients attended in the ED, 109 were identified as having mild pneumonia and were included in the ED/HH medical care model. Median age was 50.0 years, 52.3% were males and 57.8% had Charlson index  1. The median HH stay was 8 (IQR 3.7C11) days. COVID-19-related ED revisit was 19.2% (n = 21) within 6 days (IQR 3C12.5) after discharge from ED. Overall protocol failure (deferred hospital admission) was 6.4% (n = 7), without ICU admission. The ED/HH model provided potential cost savings of 77% compared to traditional stay, due to the costs of home care entails 23% of the expenses generated by a conventional hospital stay. 789 days of hospital stay were avoided by HH, rather than hospital admission.

Understanding support needs and access to support among people bereaved at this time is crucial to ensuring appropriate bereavement support infrastructure. Aim: To investigate grief experiences, support needs and use of formal and informal bereavement support among people bereaved during the pandemic. Design: Baseline results from a longitudinal survey. Support needs and experiences of accessing support are reported using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis of free-text data. Setting/Participants: 711 adults bereaved in the UK between March-December 2020, recruited via media, social media, national associations and community/charitable organisations. Results: High-level needs for emotional support were identified. Most participants had not sought support from bereavement services (59%, n=422) or their GP (60%, n=428). Of participants who had sought such support, over half experienced difficulties accessing bereavement services (56%, n=149)/GP support (52%, n=135). 51% reported high/severe vulnerability in grief; among these, 74% were not accessing bereavement or mental-health services. Barriers included limited availability, lack of appropriate support, discomfort asking for help, and not knowing how to access services. 39% (n=279) experienced difficulties getting support from family/friends, including relational challenges, little face-to-face contact, and disrupted collective mourning. The perceived uniqueness of pandemic bereavement and wider societal strains exacerbated their isolation.

Furthermore, the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic demanded a global attention towards monitoring viruses and other infectious pathogens in hospital wastewater and their removal. Apart from that, the presence of various recalcitrant organics, pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs), etc. imparts a complex pollution load to water resources and ecosystem. In this review, an insight into the occurrence, persistence and removal of drug-resistant microorganisms and infectious viruses as well as other micro-pollutants have been documented. The performance of various pilot/full-scale studies have been evaluated in terms of removal of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solids (TSS), PhACs, pathogens, etc. It was found that many biological processes, such as membrane bioreactor, activated sludge process, constructed wetlands, etc. provided more than 80% removal of BOD, COD, TSS, etc. However, the removal of several recalcitrant organic pollutants are less responsive to those processes and demands the application of tertiary treatments, such as adsorption, ozone treatment, UV treatment, etc. Antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, viruses were found to be persistent even after the treatment of hospital wastewater, and high dose of chlorination or UV treatment was required to inactivate them.

BACKGROUND: An objective understanding of aerosol generation and the effectiveness of mitigation strategies can inform interventions to reduce aerosol risk from mastoidectomy and other open surgeries involving drilling. METHODS: Cadaveric and fluorescent three-dimensional printed temporal bone models were drilled under variable conditions and mitigation methods. Aerosol production was measured with a cascade impactor set to detect particle sizes under 14.1am. Field contamination was determined with examination under UV light. RESULTS: Drilling of cadaveric bones and three-dimensional models resulted in strongly positive aerosol production, measuring positive in all eight impactor stages for the cadaver trials. This occurred regardless of using coarse or cutting burs, irrigation, a handheld suction, or an additional parked suction. The only mitigation factor that led to a completely negative aerosol result in all eight stages was placing an additional microscope drape to surround the field. Bone dust was scattered in all directions from the drill, including on the microscope, the surgeon, and visually suspended in the air for all but the drape trial. CONCLUSIONS: Aerosols are generated with drilling the mastoid.

Herein we assessed the protective efficacy of an intranasal booster composed of beta variant-spike protein S1 with IL-15 and TLR agonists in previously immunized macaques. The macaques were first vaccinated with Wuhan strain S1 with the same adjuvant. One year later, negligibly detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody remained. Nevertheless, the booster induced vigorous humoral immunity including serum- and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)-IgG, secretory nasal- and BAL-IgA, and neutralizing antibody against the original strain and/or beta variant. Beta-variant S1-specifc CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were also elicited in PBMC and BAL. Following SARS-CoV-2 beta variant challenge, the vaccinated group demonstrated significant protection against viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, with almost full protection in the nasal cavity.

For NDP from both countries, the response pattern severely violated the normality assumption in six items of the OHIP-14, indicating that the instrument does not fit for these samples. For DP, the model with the best fit was unifactorial, which deals with the estimation of the general impact of oral health on an individuals life, without addressing specific dimensions. Configural invariance was refuted between samples. DIF indicated that the characteristic of the sample (NDP and DP) in both countries interfered in the response given to the items, with the response level being more adequate for the latent PD trait.

Because the public isnt very concerned about the plight of animalsor is concerned, but has a high tolerance for cognitive dissonanceanimal activists regularly engage in indirect activism. Indirect activism involves arguing that some cause thats indirectly related to the activists primary agenda provides reasons to act in ways that are congruent with that agenda. In this paper, we consider the two indirect arguments that animal activists advanced in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic: first, some used COVID-19 to criticize intensive animal agriculturemany of these had US-based audiences as their target; second, and more modestly, some activists used COVID-19 to condemn wet markets specifically. We contend that both arguments had the risk of backfiring: they risked promoting the very systems that are worst for animals. We then assess the moral significance of this risk, concluding that while it may have been permissible to advance these arguments, there were some serious moral considerations against doing soones that werent addressed by flagging animal activists concern for animals or any other stakeholder in the discussion. In both cases, we think there are plausible precautionary arguments against the strategies that these activists pursued. Additionally, in the case of arguments against wet markets specifically, we contend that the precautionary argument can be supplemented with a side constraint condition that, arguably, activists violated insofar as they were acting in ways that maintain a racist and xenophobic system.","output":"Animal Agriculture, Wet Markets, and COVID-19: a Case Study in Indirect Activism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: Our aim in this study was to investigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on acute appendicitis (AA) cases.

The detection limit of the heminested PCR assay was 1.2 copies of a recombinant DNA plasmid, and no cross-reaction with other respiratory viruses or bacteria was observed. By using the integrated strategy, a total of 202 secretions of the lower respiratory tract of children with acute respiratory diseases were collected and tested. The samples were treated and lysed in boiling lysis buffer rather than extracting viral DNA from secretions, then these sample lysates could be templates and tested by heminested PCR assay, and the amplification of HBoV DNA was detected by using agarose gel electrophoresis. The results showed that, only 7 samples were found to be positive by conventional single-round PCR; importantly, the other new 41 samples were positive by heminested PCR assay. Additionally, the genomic viral DNA was extracted from all positive and some negative specimens, amplified, and sequenced. The results were perfectly consistent with those of the integrated strategy. Taken together, these results suggest that the novel integrated strategy (heminested PCR assay combined with boiling lysis method of samples) is a convenient, sensitive, cost-effective and reliable detective method for HBoV detection and will have broad application prospects in clinical diagnosis.","output":"A novel integrated strategy for detection of human bocavirus based on a heminested PCR assay combined with boiling lysis method of samples in human specimens."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Herein, we report that nosocomial infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may be mitigated by using surgical masks and closed looped ventilation for both non-critical and critical patients.

Governments and healthcare organizations have adapted to this pronounced scarcity by applying allocation guidelines to facilitate life-or-death decision-making, reduce bias, and save as many lives as possible. However, we argue that in societies beset by longstanding inequities, these approaches fall short as mortality patterns for historically discriminated against communities have been disturbingly higher than in the general population. METHODS: We review attack and fatality rates; survey allocation protocols designed to deal with the extreme scarcity characteristic of the earliest phases of the pandemic; and highlight the larger ethical perspectives (Utilitarianism, non-Utilitarian Rawlsian justice) that might justify such allocation practices. RESULTS: The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically amplified the dire effects of disparities with respect to the social determinants of health. Patients in historically marginalized groups not only have significantly poorer health prospects but also lower prospects of accessing high quality medical care and benefitting from it even when available. Thus, mortality among minority groups has ranged from 1.9 to 2.4 times greater than the rest of the population. Standard allocation schemas, that prioritize those most likely to benefit, perpetuate and may even exacerbate preexisting systemic injustices. CONCLUSIONS: To be better prepared for the inevitable next pandemic, we must urgently begin the monumental project of addressing and reforming the structural inequities in US society that account for the strikingly disparate mortality rates we have witnessed over the course of the current pandemic.

Early diagnosis of COVID-19 is a crucial point in preventing global prevalence. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic competency and efficiency with the Allplex? 2019-nCoV Assay kit and the Dr. PCR 20 K COVID-19 Detection kit, designed based on the qRT-PCR and dPCR technologies, respectively. METHODS: A total of 30 negative and 20 COVID-19 positive specimens were assigned to the diagnostic test by using different COVID-19 diagnosis kits. Diagnostic accuracy was measured by statistical testing with sensitivity, specificity, and co-efficiency calculations. RESULTS: Comparing both diagnostic kits, we confirmed that the diagnostic results of 30 negative and 20 positive cases were the same pre-diagnostic results. The diagnostic statistics test results were perfectly matched with value (1). Cohens Kappa coefficient was demonstrated that the given kits in two different ways were almost perfect with value (1). In evaluating the detection capability, the dilutional linearity experiments substantiate that the Dr. PCR 20 K COVID-19 Detection kit could detect SARS-CoV-2 viral load at a concentration ten times lower than that of the Allplex? 2019-nCoV Assay kit. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we propose that the dPCR diagnosis using LOAA dPCR could be a powerful method for COVID-19 point-of-care tests requiring immediate diagnosis in a limited time and space through the advantages of relatively low sample concentration and small equipment size compared to conventional qRT-PCR.

Platelet thrombus acts as a reactive matrix that recruits leukocytes to the injury site where their massive accumulation, activation and migration promote thrombotic events while triggering inflammatory responses. As a life-threatening condition with the associations between inflammation and thrombosis, COVID-19 presents diffuse alveolar damage due to exaggerated macrophage activity and cytokine storms. These events, together with direct intracellular virus invasion lead to pulmonary vascular endothelialitis, cell membranes disruption, severe endothelial injury, and thrombosis. The developing pre-alveolar thrombus provides a hyper-reactive milieu that recruits circulating leukocytes to the injury site where their activation contributes to thrombus stabilization and thrombosis propagation, primarily through the formation of Neutrophil extracellular trap (NET). NET fragments can also circulate and deposit in further distance where they may disseminate intravascular thrombosis in severe cases of disease. Thrombi may also facilitate leukocytes migration into alveoli where their accumulation and activation exacerbate cytokine storms and tissue damage, further complicating the disease. Based on these mechanisms, whether an effective anti-inflammatory protocol can prevent thrombotic events, or on the other hand; efficient antiplatelet or anticoagulant regimens may be associated with reduced cytokine storms and tissue damage, is now of interests for several ongoing researches. Thus shedding more light on platelet-leukocyte crosstalk, the review presented here discusses the detailed mechanisms by which platelets may contribute to the pathogenesis of COVID-19, especially in severe cases where their interaction with leukocytes can intensify both inflammatory state and thrombosis in a reciprocal manner.","output":"Platelet-leukocyte crosstalk in COVID-19: How might the reciprocal links between thrombotic events and inflammatory state affect treatment strategies and disease prognosis?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microbiological diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is mainly performed through nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) and antigen test.

Antigen tests require fewer resources but have low sensitivity. Nevertheless, low-sensitivity tests may be useful depending on the situation. In contrast, in some clinical phases of COVID-19, high-sensitivity tests may provide false-negative results. Therefore, the right testing strategy is needed for an accurate diagnosis. In this review, the characteristics and clinical applications of microbiological tests available in Japan (NAAT, antigen test, and antibody test) are discussed.

However, simulation studies have suggested an increased risk of COVID-19 related morbidity for older individuals inoculated by house-bound children. This study examines whether the March 2020 lockdown in New York City (NYC) was associated with higher COVID-19 hospitalization rates in neighborhoods with larger proportions of multigenerational households. MethodsWe obtained daily age-segmented COVID-19 hospitalization counts in each of 166 ZIP code tabulation areas (ZCTAs) in NYC. Using Bayesian Poisson regression models that account for spatiotemporal dependencies between ZCTAs, as well as socioeconomic risk factors, we conducted a difference-in-differences study amongst ZCTA-level hospitalization rates from February 23 to May 2, 2020. We compared ZCTAs in the lowest quartile of multigenerational housing to other quartiles before and after the lockdown. FindingsAmong individuals over 55 years, the lockdown was associated with higher COVID-19 hospitalization rates in ZCTAs with more multigenerational households. The greatest difference occurred three weeks after lockdown: Q2 vs. Q1: 54% increase (95% Bayesian credible intervals: 22 - 96%); Q3 vs. Q1: 48%, (17 - 89%); Q4 vs. Q1: 66%, (30 - 211%). After accounting for pandemic-related population shifts, a significant difference was observed only in Q4 ZCTAs: 37% (7 -76%).

Indonesia, a developing country, routinely conducts case-based surveillance for pertussis. We reviewed the data on pertussis cases and close contacts based on clinical sample documents examined in the National Reference Laboratory for pertussis, Indonesia (2016C2020). Our objective was to analyze the laboratory and epidemiological aspects of pertussis cases and close contacts, particularly to evaluate the implementation of a 5-year case-based surveillance of pertussis in Indonesia. Data were collected from sample documents and annual laboratory reports between January 2016 and December 2020. We analyzed the proportion of pertussis cases and close contacts by geographic region, year, age, and sex. We used the (2) test to correlate the laboratory and epidemiological data. In total, 274 clinical cases of pertussis and 491 close contacts were recorded in 15 provinces. The peak number of cases occurred in 2019, with a positivity rate (percentage of laboratory-confirmed cases) of 41.23% (47/114). Clinical cases were dominated by infants aged <1 year (55.5%), and 52.9% of them were aged <6 months. Similarly, 72.3% (68/94) of the laboratory-confirmed cases were infants. Both clinical cases and positivity rates tended to be higher in females (155 cases, 38.1%) than in males (119 cases, 29.4%). No confirmed cases were found in children aged 10 years, although positive results still occurred in close contact. Age-group and laboratory-confirmed cases were correlated (p = 0.00). Clinical and confirmed cases of pertussis occurred mostly in the early age group and may be lower in those aged 10 years, especially in confirmed cases. New policies are needed for pertussis prevention at an early age, as well as the application of serology tests to increase laboratory-confirmed cases in children aged 10 years.","output":"Laboratory and epidemiology data of pertussis cases and close contacts: A 5-year case-based surveillance of pertussis in Indonesia, 2016C2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current corona crisis affects older patients as well as the geriatric infrastructure in all sectors.

The serious limitations of using crude rates for comparisons are sometimes overlooked. In this paper we examined to what extent the age distribution of the cases is responsible for the differences in CFRs between countries. Methods Data on COVID-19 were extracted from the reports of individual countries. Overall and age-specific CFRs were available for six countries. The CFRs by country were adjusted for age using the direct method, using the combined age-specific number of cases of all six countries as the standard population. Findings The age distribution of the cases varied widely between countries. The crude CFRs varied between 1.6% and 11%. The differences in the age-specific CFRs were much smaller and the age-adjusted rates were much closer than the crude rates. The ratio of the crude CFR for the country with the highest to that with the lowest, was reduced substantially from 7.4 to 2.3 for the age-adjusted rates. Conclusions The age structure of the cases dramatically impacts on the differences in the crude CFRs between countries. Adjusting for age substantially reduces this variation. Other factors such as the differences in the definition of the denominators, the definition of a case and the standard of healthcare are likely to account for much of the residual variation.

The early clinical symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal HCoV infections are similar, so rapid and accurate identification of the subtypes of HCoVs is crucial for early diagnosis, early treatment, prevention and control of these infections. However, current multiplex molecular diagnostic techniques for HCoV subtypes including SARS-CoV-2 are limited. METHODS: We designed primers and probes specific for the S and N genes of SARS-CoV-2, the N gene of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and the ORF1ab gene of four seasonal HCoVs, as well as the human B2M gene product. We developed and optimized a quadruple quantitative real-time PCR assay (qq-PCR) for simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and four seasonal HCoVs. This assay was further tested for specificity and sensitivity, and validated using 184 clinical samples. RESULTS: The limit of detection of the qq-PCR assay was in the range 2.5  10(1) to 6.5  10(1) copies/L for each gene and no cross-reactivity with other common respiratory viruses was observed. The intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation were 0.5C2%. The qq-PCR assay had a 91.9% sensitivity and 100.0% specificity for SARS-CoV-2 and a 95.7% sensitivity and 100% specificity for seasonal HCoVs, using the approved commercial kits as the reference. Compared to the commercial kits, total detection consistency was 98.4% (181/184) for SARS-CoV-2 and 98.6% (142/144) for seasonal HCoVs. CONCLUSION: With the advantages of sensitivity, specificity, rapid detection, cost-effectiveness, and convenience, this qq-PCR assay has potential for clinical use for rapid discrimination between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and seasonal HCoVs.

The rate of recurrence of PIs was 15.4% (4/26) in the mean follow-up of 54 months. Regarding postoperative complications, four cases of partial dehiscence of the suture occurred. CONCLUSION: This perioperative protocol of maintaining a prone position seems to be safe for the patient, and it can be used to prevent or reduce the recurrence of deep PIs on the pelvic region after reconstructive surgery.","output":"The role of the perioperative prone position in the low recurrence of pressure injuries in the pelvic region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: This article articulates the complexity of modeling in First Nations, Metis, and Inuit contexts by providing the results of a modeling exercise completed at the request of the First Nations Health and Social Secretariat of Manitoba Methods: We developed a model using the impact of a previous pandemic (the 2009 H1N1) to generate estimates Results: The lack of readily available data has resulted in a model that assumes homogeneity of communities in terms of health status, behaviour, and infrastructure limitations While homogeneity may be a reasonable assumption for province-wide planning, First Nation communities and Tribal Councils require more precise information in order to plan effectively Metis and urban Inuit communities, in contrast, have access to much less information, making the role of Indigenous organizations mandated to serve the needs of these populations that much more difficult Conclusion: For many years, Indigenous organizations have advocated for the need to have access to current and precise data to meet their needs The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates the importance of timely and accurate community-based data to support pandemic responses","output":"Modeling the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on First Nations, Metis, and Inuit Communities: Some Considerations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"High quality daily testing for the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 in workplace settings has become part of the standard and mandatory protection measures implemented widely in response to the current pandemic.

Accordingly, new-born screening (NBS) for SMA should be implemented to ensure early diagnosis of affected individuals. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility and usefulness of NBS for SMA in Latvia. Between February and November of 2021, 10,411 parents consented to participation in the study. DNA testing for the SMN1 exon 7 homozygous deletion was conducted using qPCR with fluorescent locked nucleic acid primers. In the first month of testing, reporting of results took up to a maximum of 17 days after samples arrived in the laboratory. However, following familiarisation with the procedure, the median report time was reduced to 11 days after birth. Forty cases required samples to be taken again due to poor quality of the isolated DNA transpiring from either the quality of the blood punch or manual mistakes during DNA isolation. The SMN1 exon 7 homozygous deletion was identified in two individuals, which was subsequently confirmed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. When a NBS sample is taken 48 to 72 h after birth and transported to the laboratory within two working days after collection according to legal requirements, DNA test results can be reported to healthcare professionals before the 12th day of life. Expansion of our SMA 5q NBS procedure to the whole of Latvia is feasible and would facilitate early diagnosis and result in more effective treatment.

This may be related to social determinants that lead to chronic inflammatory states. The aims of the study were to determine if there are racial/ethnic differences between the inflammatory markers of survivors and non-survivors and if there was a dose dependent association of methylprednisolone to in hospital survival. METHODS This was a secondary analysis of a retrospective cohort. Patients were older than 18 years of age and admitted for severe COVID-19 Pneumonia Between March to June 2020 in 13 Hospitals in New Jersey, United States. Comparison of inflammatory markers used Kruskal-Wallis followed by pairwise comparison using two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test. A Youden Index Method was used to determine the cut-off between low dose and high dose methylprednisolone. For each racial/ethnic group, cox regression was used to determine the association to survival between no methylprednisolone and methylprednisolone (high dose versus low dose). RESULTS Propensity matched sample (n=759) between no methylprednisolone (n=380) and methylprednisolone (n=379) had 338 Whites, 102 Blacks, 61 Asian/Indians, and 251 Non-Black Non-White Hispanics. Interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and d-dimer values were higher in non-survivors compared to survivors except in Asian/Indian survivors who had higher ferritin values compared to non-survivors (median: 1,265 vs 418 ug/L, P=0.0211). Black and Hispanic survivors had persistently elevated C-reactive protein, (10.2 mg/mL) and (13.70 mg/mL) respectively. Low dose methylprednisolone was associated with prolonged 60 days in hospital survival over no methylprednisolone in Whites (P<0.0001), Asian/Indians (P=0.0180), and Hispanics (P=0.0004). Regardless of dose, methylprednisolone was not associated with prolonged survival in Blacks. High dose methylprednisolone was associated with worse survival in Hispanics. (P=0.0181). CONCLUSION Racial/Ethnic disparities with inflammatory markers in survivors and non-survivors preclude the use of one marker as predictor of survival. Low dose methylprednisolone is associated with prolonged survival in Asian/Indians, Hispanics, and Whites.

We aimed to create a multifaceted standardized transfer process for patients moving from the neurointensive care unit (neuro-ICU) to a lower level of care. We hypothesized that this process would lead to improvement in provider-rated safety and a decreased rate of bouncebacks to the neuro-ICU after transfer. METHODS: The study took place at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania from October 2018 to October 2020. A standardized five-step transfer process was created and implemented for transferring patients from the neuro-ICU to a lower level of care. Patient care providers completed a survey before and after implementation of the protocol to assess a variety of components related to safety concerns when transferring patients. The rate of bouncebacks pre and post intervention was calculated by using a two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and disposition at discharge was calculated by using Fishers exact test. RESULTS: Of the 1176 total patient transfers out of the neuro-ICU, 29 patients bounced back within 48 h. The average age of patients who bounced back was 63.3 years old, with a similar distribution among men and women. The most common reason for bounceback was respiratory distress, followed by cardiac arrhythmia, stroke, and sepsis. Implementation of the standardized process led to a decrease in provider-rated concern of overall safety (5 to 3, p = 0.008). There was improvement in transfer delays due to bed availability (3 to 4.5, p = 0.020), identification of high-risk patients (5 to 6, p = 0.021), patient assignment to the appropriate level of care (5 to 6, p = 0.019), and use of the electronic medical record handoff indicator (5 to 6, p = 0.003). There was no statistically significant difference in terms of patient bounceback rate after implementation of the process (2.4% vs. 2.5%, p = 1.00) or patient disposition at discharge (p = 0.553). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who bounceback to the neuro-ICU within 48 h had an increased length of hospital stay, had an increased length of ICU stay, and were more likely to be intubated for more than 96 h. Implementation of a standardized five-step transfer process from the neuro-ICU to a lower level of care resulted in improvement in multiple provider-rated safety outcomes and identification of high-risk patients but led to no difference in the patient bounceback rate or patient disposition at discharge.

However, these symptoms can rarely be associated with internal carotid artery and vertebral artery dissections. We aimed to review five cases of postpartum cervical artery dissection and to review the clinical course of previously reported cases. METHODS Patients with postpartum dissections diagnosed at our institution since 2005 were identified through a database maintained by the senior author, and their clinical data were reviewed. Additionally, a literature search for previously reported cases was performed, and the clinical data in those reports were reviewed. RESULTS Five patients presented with cervical artery dissections within 6 weeks postpartum. Four patients had delivered vaginally and one delivered by emergent cesarean. Headache and neck pain were the primary presenting symptoms of all five patients. Four patients demonstrated neurologic symptoms, and one had development of stroke. Two patients had single internal carotid artery dissections, one patient had bilateral dissections of the vertebral artery, and two patients had dissections in the internal carotid artery and vertebral artery. All patients were treated with either anticoagulation therapy or antiplatelet therapy. Two patients required endovascular stenting. Four of five patients returned to neurologic baseline after treatment. A literature search yielded 27 previously reported cases, with similar clinical characteristics of older reproductive age, presentation days to weeks from delivery, and recovery to neurologic baseline in the majority of patients. CONCLUSION Postpartum cervical dissections are rare occurrences that require prompt diagnosis to prevent long-term neurologic deficits.

Unfortunately, reserving VMs exposes users to \\\\emph{demand risk} that can increase cost if their expected future demand does not materialize. Since accurately forecasting demand over long periods is challenging, users often limit their use of reserved VMs. To mitigate demand risk, Amazon operates a Reserved Instance Marketplace (RIM) where users may publicly list the remaining time on their VM reservations for sale at a price they set.

In past decades, lower population densities, infectious disease outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics were rare and driven almost exclusively by natural disasters, predatory animals, and war. In the early 1900s, Sir William Osler first advanced the knowledge of zoonotic diseases that are spread from reservoir animals to human animals. Once rare, they now make up 71% or more of new diseases. Globally, zoonotic spread occurs for many reasons. Because the human population has grown in numbers and density, the spread of these diseases accelerated though rapid unsustainable urbanization, biodiversity loss, and climate change. Furthermore, they are exacerbated by an increasing number of vulnerable populations suffering from chronic deficiencies in food, water, and energy. The World Health Organization (WHO) and its International Health Regulation (IHR) Treaty, organized to manage population-based diseases such as Influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H1N1, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), HIV, and Ebola, have failed to meet population-based expectations. In part, this is due to influence from powerful political donors, which has become most evident in the current COVID-19 pandemic. The global community can no longer tolerate an ineffectual and passive international response system, nor tolerate the self-serving political interference that authoritarian regimes and others have exercised over the WHO. In a highly integrated globalized world, both the WHO with its IHR Treaty have the potential to become one of the most effective mechanisms for crisis response and risk reduction world-wide. Practitioners and health decision-makers must break their silence and advocate for a stronger treaty, a return of the WHOs singular global authority, and support highly coordinated population-based management.

Herein, we report a 10 min nano-capture system that is used in conjunction with a modified reverse transcriptase-LAMP (RT-LAMP) assay for the accurate detection of SARS CoV-2 virus. The nano-capture system employs in-house-designed probe-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles Co(2)FeAl (cobalt-based Heusler alloy) for efficient capture of contaminating amplicons from the reaction mixture preceding RT-LAMP. The nano-cleaned RT-LAMP assay along with engineered primers successfully detected the presence of 10 copies of SARS CoV-2 virus while completely eliminating the incidence of false positives. The presented contaminant-capture method has been compared with other approaches for elimination of contaminants and was found to be more effective. The insight brought in this work is the design of a rapid nano-capture system that hybridizes with contaminating amplicons (carry-over) with high specificity to enable easy removal from the assay for elimination of false positives. The method has been proven to be successful for RT-LAMP assays in the rapid and highly specific detection of SARS CoV-2, which is currently a major challenge for global health.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of the study was to alter neurons' physiological states without apparent damage of cellular integrity using stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). METHODS: We treated a 7.5 mm-diameter target on the visual cortex of G?ttingen minipigs with doses of 40, 60, 80, and 100 Gy. Six months post-irradiation, the pigs were implanted with a 9 mm-wide, eight-shank multi-electrode probe, which spanned the radiation focus as well as the low-exposure neighboring areas. RESULTS: Doses of 40 Gy led to an increase of spontaneous firing rate, six months post-irradiation, while doses of 60 Gy and greater were associated with a decrease. Subjecting the animals to visual stimuli resulted in typical visual evoked potentials (VEP). At 40 Gy, a significant reduction of the P1 peak time, indicative of higher network excitability was observed. At 80 Gy, P1 peak time was not affected, while a minor reduction at 60 Gy was seen. No distance-dependent effects on spontaneous firing rate, or on VEP were observed. Post-mortem histology revealed no evidence of necrosis at doses below 60 Gy. In an in vitro assay comprising of iPS-derived human neuron-astrocyte co-cultures, we found a higher vulnerability of inhibitory neurons than excitatory neurons with respect to radiation, which might provide the cellular mechanism of the disinhibitory effect observed in vivo.

The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate numbers of admissions in incident and prevalent atrial fibrillation and flutter (AF) and to analyse care pathways in comparison to 2019. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of claims data of 74 German Helios hospitals was performed to identify consecutive patients hospitalized with a main discharge diagnosis of AF. A study period including the start of the German national protection phase (13 March 2020 to 16 July 2020) was compared to a previous year control cohort (15 March 2019 to 18 July 2019), with further sub-division into early and late phase. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated. Numbers of admission per day (A/day) for incident and prevalent AF and care pathways including readmissions, numbers of transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), electrical cardioversion (CV), and catheter ablation (CA) were analysed. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a significant decrease in total AF admissions both in the early (44.4 vs. 77.5 A/day, IRR 0.57 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54-0.61], P < 0.01) and late (59.1 vs. 63.5 A/day, IRR 0.93 [95% CI 0.90-0.96], P < 0.01) phases, length of stay was significantly shorter (3.3  3.1 nights vs. 3.5  3.6 nights, P < 0.01), admissions were more frequently in high-volume centres (77.0% vs. 75.4%, P = 0.02), and frequency of readmissions was reduced (21.7% vs. 23.6%, P < 0.01) compared to the previous year. Incident AF admission rates were significantly lower both in the early (21.9 admission per day vs. 41.1 A/day, IRR 0.53 [95% CI 0.48-0.58]) and late (35.5 vs. 39.3 A/day, IRR 0.90 [95% CI 0.86-0.95]) phases, whereas prevalent admissions were only lower in the early phase (22.5 vs. 36.4 A/day IRR 0.62 [95% CI 0.56-0.68]), but not in the late phase (23.6 vs. 24.2 A/day IRR 0.97 [95% CI 0.92-1.03]). Analysis of care pathways showed reduced numbers of TEE during the early phase [34.7% vs. 41.4%, odds ratio (OR) 0.74 [95% CI 0.64-0.86], P < 0.01], but not during the late phase (39.9% vs. 40.2%, OR 0.96 [95% CI 0.88-1.03], P = 0.26). Numbers of CV were comparable during early (40.6% vs. 39.7%, OR 1.08 [95% CI 0.94-1.25], P = 0.27) and late (38.6% vs. 37.5%, OR 1.06 [95% CI 0.98-1.14], P = 0.17) phases, compared to the previous year, respectively. Numbers of CA were comparable during the early phase (21.6% vs. 21.1%, OR 0.98 [95% CI 0.82-1.17], P = 0.82) with a distinct increase during the late phase (22.9% vs. 21.5%, OR 1.05 [95% CI 0.96-1.16], P = 0.28). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, AF admission rates declined significantly, with a more pronounced reduction in incident than in prevalent AF. Overall AF care was maintained during early and late pandemic phases with only minor changes, namely less frequent use of TEE. Confirmation of these findings in other study populations and identification of underlying causes are required to ensure optimal therapy in patients with AF during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Admission rates and care pathways in patients with atrial fibrillation during the COVID-19 pandemic-insights from the German-wide Helios hospital network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Central (aortic) systolic blood pressure (cSBP) is the pressure seen by the heart, the brain, and the kidneys.

METHODS: The study utilized a three-arm randomized controlled trial design, with a 10-week pre-treatment control condition, 30 weeks of intervention, and 3 years of post-intervention follow-up. Mothers of children with ASD were randomly assigned to the MB, PBS, and MBPBS conditions and provided 3 days of training specific to each condition. The effects of these programs were assessed on the mothers (i.e., training attendance, meditation time, perceived psychological stress) and spillover effects were assessed on their children with ASD (i.e., aggression, disruptive behavior, compliance with mothers requests). RESULTS: Mothers in the MBPBS condition reported greater reductions in perceived psychological stress, followed by those in the MB condition, and with no significant changes reported by those in the PBS condition. Reduction in the childrens aggression and disruptive behavior followed a similar pattern, with most to least significant reductions being in MBPBS, MB, and PBS condition, respectively. Significant increases in compliance (i.e., responsiveness to mothers requests) were largest in the MBPBS condition, followed by MB, and then PBS.

By affecting molecular pathways of senescence, polyphenols are able to prevent or delay the senescence formation and, consequently, avoid or ameliorate aging and age-associated pathologies of the skin. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge in skin aging and cellular senescence, and to summarize the recent in vitro studies related to the anti-senescent mechanisms of natural polyphenols carried out on keratinocytes, melanocytes and fibroblasts. Aged skin in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic will be also discussed.","output":"Skin Aging, Cellular Senescence and Natural Polyphenols"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is best known for its pulmonary sequelae.

Concern regarding vaccine safety and efficacy, lack of awareness regarding their eligibility for vaccination and lack of trust in government agencies predicted COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among medical students. On the other hand, the presence of risk perception regarding themselves being affected with COVID-19 reduced vaccine hesitancy as well as hesitancy in participating in COVID-19 vaccine trials. Vaccine-hesitant students were more likely to derive information from social media and less likely from teachers at their medical colleges. Choosing between the two available vaccines (Covishield and Covaxin) was considered important by medical students both for themselves and for their future patients. Covishield was preferred to Covaxin by students. Majority of those willing to take the COVID-19 vaccine felt that it was important for them to resume their clinical posting, face-to-face classes and get their personal life back on track. Around three-fourths medical students viewed that COVID-19 vaccine should be made mandatory for both health care workers and international travellers.

Effective January 1, 2121By George W. Conk, Senior Fellow, Stein Center for Law & Ethics, Fordham University School of Law, with Wenjie Lyu, LLM, Rongrong Zahang, LLM, and Haoshi Jiang, MSL Contemporary Chinese law began afresh in 1978 with the policy of reform and opening announced by Deng Xiao Ping, who from 1977 to 1992 was the most prominent of the Chinese leadership. After a half century of war, invasion, and revolution Deng was the architect of a policy of modernization. Universities returned to normal, and China began its rapid economic rise. Important to Dengs program was the normalization of the legal system which had nearly collapsed.In 1986 the legislature C the National Peoples Congress adopted the General Principles of Civil Law. embraced a broad swath basic principles of civil law, including liability in tort. Over the next fifteen years law schools were built and progress in the professionalization of the courts was marked as the country adopted laws that brought it into conformity with the international trade systemBut Chinese legal academic leaders traced their emerging law to Germany via Japan and Russia (then the USSR). So their aspiration was to adopt a comprehensive civil code. In 2002 a discussion draft was circulated and moved toward legislative consideration. One Section of that draft civil code dealt with tort liability. But controversy C particularly regarding the law of property C stalled consideration of the tort section of the civil code. I commented on the development of the law of tort and translated the draft code. It was published as A New Tort Code emerges in China An introduction to the discussion and a Translation of Chapter 8 - Tort Law of the Official Discussion Draft of the Proposed Revised Civil Code, 30 FORDHAM INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL 935 (2007) http://ssrn.com/abstract=1015041In 2009 the National Peoples Congress passed the Tort Law as a stand-alone law. That law has been the basic framework of Chinas tort law since then. But it should be recognized that causes of action are typically grounded in specific laws such as the Traffic Safety Law, the Environmental Protection Law, etc.But the basic model that Chinas legal authorities have in mind is the Continental civil law best exemplified by the German Civil Code. Development of the comprehensive code progressed slowly. It was intended not to transform the civil law but to provide a foundation for the law as it was in fact being developed by the steadily advancing array of statutory law. In 2017 the first section of the Code was passed as Basic Principles. In May 2020 the National Peoples Congress met during the twin crises of instability in Hong Kong and the covid19 pandemic. It passed the comprehensive civil code.o Although it made few substantive changes, the Civil Code formally abolished and replaced the elements which had previously been passed as stand-alone items.

In line with the job demands-resources model, optimism was expected to positively relate with job resources, leading to higher work engagement. However, the underlying mechanism between optimism, autonomy and work engagement has not been explored. AIMS: To examine whether optimism has a positive impact on work engagement via autonomy among physicians fighting COVID-19 in China. METHODS: This study was conducted among physicians in March 2020. A convenience sample was used to recruit physicians from the Wuhan Leishenshan Hospital and Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital. One hundred and four Chinese physicians working in the COVID-19 epidemic completed a survey measuring levels of autonomy, optimism and work engagement. The PROCESS macro (model 4) was used to test hypotheses about mediation. RESULTS: This current study found that optimism was related to increased autonomy, and autonomy was related to increased work engagement. The results of the bias-corrected bootstrap method suggested the indirect effect of optimism on work engagement via autonomy (Effect = 0.16, SE = 0.08, lower level confidence interval = 0.04, upper level confidence interval = 0.37), indicating a mediated relationship, in which autonomy is one mechanism to explain the link between optimism and increased work engagement. CONCLUSIONS: This study follows an observational design, with in-depth analysis of the relationship between optimism, autonomy and work engagement. When management implements strategies to improve work engagement among physicians working in the COVID-19 epidemic, the mediating impact of autonomy on the association between optimism and work engagement should be considered.","output":"Engagement among physicians fighting COVID-19: the mediating role of autonomy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Few reports described the outcome of kidney transplanted patients (KTs) affected by COVID-19 treated with interleukin-6 receptor inhibitor tocilizumab (TCZ).

Three peptides from S protein and three from N protein were used as antigens in a conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against serum samples from COVID-19-positive patients, or from healthy donors, collected before the pandemic. Three peptides were effective as antigens in conventional peptide-based ELISA, achieving 100% sensitivity and specificity, with high accuracy.

However, their impacts on the do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation (DNACPR) of the patients are not known. METHODS: A retrospective single-center cohort study was conducted for all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from March 1, 2020, to September 30, 2021. Their code status was retrieved, and its association with the waves and other parameters, such as in-hospital mortality, was investigated. The relationship between DNACPR status and each wave was examined, as well as the effect on in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 1153 patients were hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19 during the study period. On admission, 117 patients (10.1%) had DNACPR orders, 373 patients (32.4%) were on full code, 45 patients (3.9%) stated that they cannot decide code status. DNACPR rate appeared to increase at the summit of each wave. Subsequently, 160 patients (13.9%) became DNACPR status, 385 patients (33.4%) became full code, and 12 patients (1.0%) stated that they remained unable to decide code status. There was no association between DNACPR status and each wave, and DNACPR status was not associated with higher mortality (P = 0.87), both by logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSION: DNACPR status among hospitalized COVID-19 patients appeared to have changed over multiple waves in Japan, but it is more likely due to the change of the patients demographics, particularly their age.

Immunohistochemical staining for SARS-CoV in the tissue sections of SARS patients is helpful in investigations of the biologic behavior of this virus in human tissue, and to determine the target cells of this virus in different organs. METHODS We studied the pathologic specimens from 6 SARS patients by immunohistochemical staining using a specific antibody against SARS-CoV. RESULTS Positive viral staining was only found in the lung tissue taken from the patients who died in the early stage of the disease, usually less than 10 days after symptom onset. No positive staining was found in the lung tissue specimens collected in the mid-to-late stage of the disease. The SARS-CoV-infected cells had a patchy distribution and tended to be present in the periphery of the lung. Immunohistochemically, these viral-infected cells were located mainly along the alveolar space, had a cuboidal appearance, and were reactive to cytokeratin and surfactant protein C. This suggested that type II pneumocytes are the main target cell of SARS-CoV in the lung. Occasional intra-alveolar macrophages were also weakly reactive to SARS-CoV antibody. In addition to the lung, positive viral staining was also found in the mucosal epithelium of the large intestine in another patient who had the clinical symptom of diarrhea. No evidence of viral staining was found in other organs including kidney, liver, lymph node and spleen. The skeletal muscle specimens of 2 patients who had rhabdomyolysis were also negative for SARS-CoV. CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV is mainly present in the cytoplasm of type II pneumocytes and can only be detected in the lung tissue during the early stage of the disease. In the patient who had symptoms of diarrhea, SARS-CoV staining was also identified in the mucosal epithelium of the colon.","output":"Immunohistochemical study of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus in tissue sections of patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To review the probable vertical transmission and neonatal outcomes in confirmed COVID-19 pregnant women.","output":"Neonatal outcomes and vertical transmission in COVID-19 infected pregnant women;a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy (DN), the major cause of ESKD, requires kidney biopsy. d-Serine, present only in trace amounts in humans, is a biomarker for kidney diseases and shows potential to distinguish the origin of kidney diseases, whose diagnoses usually require kidney biopsy. We extended this concept and examined the potential of d-serine in the diagnosis of DN. Methods We enrolled patients with biopsy sample-proven DN and primary GN (minimal change disease and IgA nephropathy) and participants without kidney disease. A total of 388 participants were included in this study, and d-serine levels in blood and urine were measured using two-dimensional high-performance liquid chromatography, and urinary fractional excretion (FE) of d-serine was calculated. Using data from 259 participants, we developed prediction models for detecting DN by logistic regression analyses, and the models were validated in 129 participants. Results A d-serine blood level of >2.34 M demonstrated a high specificity of 83% (95% CI, 70% to 93%) for excluding participants without kidney diseases. In participants with a d-serine blood level >2.34 M, the threshold of 47% in FE of d-serine provided an optimal threshold for the detection of DN (AUC, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.76 to 0.95]; sensitivity, 79% [95% CI, 61% to 91%]; specificity, 83% [95% CI, 67% to 94%]). This plasma-high and FE-high profile of d-serine in combination with clinical factors (age, sex, eGFR, and albuminuria) correctly predicted DN with a sensitivity of 91% (95% CI, 72% to 99%) and a specificity of 79% (95% CI, 63% to 80%), and outperformed the model based on clinical factors alone in the validation dataset (P<0.02). Conclusions Analysis of d-serine in blood and urinary excretion is useful in identifying DN in patients undergoing kidney biopsy.

The inner-city saw a younger population; 47/109 (43%) were aged between 20 and 29 years, compared with 28/104 (27%) of suburban presenters (P value 0.0134). A higher number of presenters were aged over 60 in the suburban centre n = 13/104 (12.5%) versus the inner-city centre 3/109 (2.8%) (P value 0.0084). In the inner-city, the proportion of homeless presenters was significantly higher at 30/109 (28%) versus 5/104 (4.8%) in the suburban setting (P < 0.0001). Presentations related to substances were highest, a total of 73 (34.3%) across both centres, with no significant difference in clinical presentations across the two centres. The majority were seen in the on-call period, 74/109 (67.9%) in the inner-city centre and 66/104 (63.5%) in the suburban centre. The psychiatric admission rate was significantly different between the two centres, with 33/109 (30.3%) patients admitted in the inner-city centre and 13/104 (12.5%) patients admitted in the suburban centre (P value 0.002). CONCLUSIONS A large proportion of ED referrals to psychiatry constitute patients with unmet social and addiction needs, who are seen out of hours. This prompts consideration of expanding both ED and community services to comprise a more multidisciplinary-resourced, 24/7 care model.","output":"The suburban-city divide: an evaluation of emergency department mental health presentations across two centres."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID 19 pandemic has created a global health emergency requiring an effective public health response including citizens' roles in preventing the spread and controlling the pandemic. Little is known about public knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors in relation to the pandemic in Nepal. This study aims to assess knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) towards COVID 19 among the general public and to identify associated factors. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between May to June 2020 with a sample of 645, recruited from 26 hospitals across Nepal. We conducted telephone interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire related to KAP regarding COVID 19. T-test and one-way ANOVA was conducted to determine group differences for socio-demographic variables. Linear regression and correlational analysis were performed to identify associated factors and measure the strength and direction of relationships. Results: Overall mean scores for knowledge, attitude and practice were 11.6 (SD 4.5), 2.7 (SD 1.8), and 9.9 (SD 1.93) respectively but differed by socio-demographic characteristics. Positive but weak linear correlations were observed between knowledge-practice (r=0.19, p<0.01) and attitude-practice (r=0.08, p<0.05). The relationship between knowledge and education was fairly strong (r = 0.34, p< 0.01). Province, place of residence, ecological area, age, gender, and caste/ethnicity were also significantly associated with the KAP score of participants. Conclusion: The study found varying degrees of correlation between Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice that may increase as the pandemic evolves in Nepal. Knowledge and level of education had positive associations with attitude and adherence to precautionary measures. The findings suggest a need for targeted community awareness interventions for the most vulnerable populations, men, those with no school education, the elderly, and people living in rural areas.

Potential implications, as well as practitioner suggestions, are outlined to identify how practitioners can create more supportive employee experiences as well as apply these to workplace health management scenarios. Design/methodology/approach: This overview is based on a selective and practically oriented review of articles that hitherto considered the health implications of remote workers being monitored electronically over the last two years. This overview is subsequently complemented by a discussion of more recent findings that outline the potential implications of monitoring for remote employees, employees' work experience and workplace health management. Findings: Several practitioner-oriented suggestions are outlined that can pave the way to a more supportive employee experience for remote workers, who are monitored electronically by their employers. These include the various health and social interventions, greater managerial awareness about factors that influence well-being and more collaboration with health professionals to design interventions and new workplace policies. Organizations would also benefit from using audits and data analytics from monitoring tools to inform their interventions, while a rethink about work design, as well as organizational reviews of performance and working conditions further represent useful options to identify and set up the right conditions that foster both performance as well as employee well-being.

To determine the impacts of adjuvant corticosteroid administrated to patients with non-severe COVID-19 pneumonia. METHOD A retrospective cohort study based on propensity score analysis was designed to explore the effects of corticosteroid on several clinical outcomes. RESULTS 132 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria and 35 pairs were generated according to propensity score matching. Compared to non-corticosteroid group, the CT score on day 7 was significantly higher in corticosteroid group (8.6 (IQR, 2.8-11.5) versus 12.0 (IQR, 5.0-19.3), P = 0.046). In corticosteroid group, more patients progressed to severe cases (11.4% versus 2.9%, P = 0.353), hospital stay (23.5 days (IQR, 19-29 d) versus 20.2 days (IQR, 14-25.3 d), P = 0.079) and duration of viral shedding (20.3 days (IQR, 15.2-24.8 d) versus 19.4 days (IQR, 11.5-28.3 d), P = 0.669) were prolonged, while fever time (9.5 days (IQR, 6.5-12.2 d) versus 10.2 days (IQR, 6.8-14 d), P = 0.28) was shortened, however all these data revealed no statistically significant differences.

One key requirement for service sustainability is confirming economic viability. To achieve this, we conducted a systematic review to examine the cost-effectiveness of telehealth in primary care. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted to identify articles that conducted economic evaluations of telehealth services in primary care settings. Searches of PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus and CINAHL databases were undertaken using keywords relating to telehealth, primary care, and economic or cost. Title, abstract and full-text reviews were conducted and data extraction of study characteristics, economic analysis, and description of service models was performed. The Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist was used to evaluate study reporting quality. Results: Twenty articles were selected for final inclusion. Four studies employed six analysis types through a cost-consequence analysis, cost-utility analysis, and cost-effectiveness analysis. Five studies used a cost-minimisation analysis and eleven used a simple cost analysis. Telehealth service models included triage services, substitution services, other services, and new services. There was a widespread of reporting quality when studies were assessed again the CHEERS checklist. Most studies reported telehealth as cost-effective, although the quality of this evidence is dependent on study context, analysis type and service model delivered. Conclusions: In various circumstances, telehealth services in primary care are cost-effective. Services appear to be cost-effective when used in appropriate clinical scenarios, when clinician time efficiency is improved, and when overall health service utilisation is reduced. However, telehealth implementation should be motivated by potential overall benefits rather than cost reduction alone.

However, the impact of DCT on pandemic mitigation still remains to be demonstrated. Objective: To estimate key populations and performance indicators along the DCT app notification cascade in a clearly defined regional (Canton of Zurich, using all of Switzerland as a comparison) and temporal context (September/October 2020). Design: Publicly available administrative and research data, including key DCT performance indicators, SARS-CoV-2 testing statistics, infoline call statistics, and observational study data, were compiled. A model of the DCT notification cascade was developed and key performance indicators for DCT processes were defined. Subpopulation sizes at each cascade step were estimated using data triangulation. Resulting estimates were systematically checked for internal consistency and consistency with other up- or downstream estimates in the cascade. Stochastic simulations were performed to explore robustness of results. Results: For the Canton of Zurich, we estimate that 537 app users received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test in September 2020, of whom 324 received and entered a CovidCode. This triggered an app notification for an estimated 1374 proximity contacts and led to 722 infoline calls. In total, 170 callers received a quarantine recommendation, and 30 app users tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after an app notification, reflecting a performance above the national level. Based on this quantification, key performance indicators were evaluated. For September 2020, these analyses suggest that SwissCovid triggered quarantine recommendations in the equivalent of 5% of all exposed contacts placed in quarantine by manual contact tracing. Per 11 CovidCodes entered in the app, we estimate that almost 1 contact tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 upon app notification. However, longitudinal indicator analyses demonstrate bottlenecks in the notification cascade, as capacity limits were reached due to large increases in SARS-CoV-2 incidence in October 2020. Conclusion: Although requiring confirmation, our estimations on the number of notified proximity contacts receiving quarantine recommendations or testing positive after notification suggest relevant contributions to mitigating the pandemic. Increasing SwissCovid app uptake and improving notification cascade performance may further enhance its impact.","output":"The role of the SwissCovid digital contact tracing app during the pandemic response: results for the Canton of Zurich"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, cases of pneumonia of unknown cause first started to appear in Wuhan in China; subsequently, a new coronavirus was soon identified as the cause of the illness, now known as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since then, infections have been confirmed worldwide in numerous countries, with the number of cases steadily rising. The aim of the present review is to provide an overview of the new severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and, in particular, to deduce from it potential risks and complications for pregnant patients.

Based on the literature available at the moment, it can be assumed that the clinical course of COVID-19 disease may be complicated by pregnancy which could be associated with a higher mortality rate. It may also be assumed at the moment that transmission from mother to child in utero is unlikely.

A key limitation of 3D CNNs on voxelised data is that the memory consumption grows cubically with the training data resolution. Occupancy networks (O-Nets) are an alternative for which the data is represented continuously in a function space and 3D shapes are learned as a continuous decision boundary. While O-Nets are significantly more memory efficient than 3D CNNs, they are limited to simple shapes, are relatively slow at inference, and have not yet been adapted for 3D semantic segmentation of medical data. Here, we propose Occupancy Networks for Semantic Segmentation (OSS-Nets) to accurately and memory-efficiently segment 3D medical data. We build upon the original O-Net with modifications for increased expressiveness leading to improved segmentation performance comparable to 3D CNNs, as well as modifications for faster inference. We leverage local observations to represent complex shapes and prior encoder predictions to expedite inference. We showcase OSS-Net's performance on 3D brain tumour and liver segmentation against a function space baseline (O-Net), a performance baseline (3D residual U-Net), and an efficiency baseline (2D residual U-Net). OSS-Net yields segmentation results similar to the performance baseline and superior to the function space and efficiency baselines. In terms of memory efficiency, OSS-Net consumes comparable amounts of memory as the function space baseline, somewhat more memory than the efficiency baseline and significantly less than the performance baseline. As such, OSS-Net enables memory-efficient and accurate 3D semantic segmentation that can scale to high resolutions.","output":"OSS-Net: Memory Efficient High Resolution Semantic Segmentation of 3D Medical Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In January 2020, a new coronavirus was identified as responsible for a pandemic acute respiratory syndrome. The virus demonstrated a high infectious capability and not-neglectable mortality in humans. However, similarly to previous SARS and MERS, the new disease COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 seemed to relatively spare children and younger adults. Some hypotheses have been proposed to explain the phenomenon, including lower ACE2 expression in children, cross-immunization from measles/rubella/mumps and BCG-vaccination, as well as the integrity of respiratory mucosa. Herein, we hypothesize that an additional mechanism might contribute to children's relative protection from SARS-CoV-2, the cross-immunization conferred by previous exposures to other common respiratory coronaviruses. To support our hypothesis, we show a statistically significant similarity in genomic and protein sequences, including epitopes for B- and T-cell immunity, of SARS-CoV-2 and the other beta coronaviruses. Since these coronaviruses are highly diffused across pediatric populations, cross-reactive immunity might reasonably induce an at least partial protection from SARS-CoV-2 in children.","output":"Cross-Immunization Against Respiratory Coronaviruses May Protect Children From SARS-CoV2: More Than a Simple Hypothesis?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the value of chemotactic function of neutrophils in patients with severe infections. METHODS: A computer vision\\\\based cellular chemotaxis analysis platform was established for the dynamic assessment of neutrophil chemotaxis. Fifty\\\\three patients in the intensive care unit were eligible for the study. In parallel, 142 healthy volunteers were recruited to detect and establish the normal values for chemotactic function. Four chemotactic function indicators were determinedCchemotaxis distance (CD), chemotaxis cell ratio (CCR), chemotaxis index (CI) and maximum speed of chemotaxis (V(max)). The chemotaxis function scores (CFS) were calculated for further correlation analysis with clinical data. RESULTS: The normal ranges of indicators were established as CD  1755.85 m, CCR  3.34%, CI  39.63, V(max)  14.63 m min(?1) and CFS  15. We found that the chemotactic function of neutrophils in patients suffering from infections was significantly impaired.

Mitigating the spread of such an influenza pandemic would require not only the timely administration of antiviral drugs to those infected, but also the implementation of suitable intervention policies for stunting the spread of the virus. Towards this end, mathematical modelling and simulation studies are crucial as they allow us to evaluate the predicted effectiveness of the various intervention policies before enforcing them. Diagnosis plays a vital role in the overall pandemic management framework by detecting and distinguishing the pathogenic strain from the less threatening seasonal strains and other influenza-like illnesses. This allows treatment and intervention to be deployed effectively, given limited antiviral supplies and other resources. However, the time required to design a fast and accurate testkit for novel strains may limit the role of diagnosis. Herein, we aim to investigate the cost and effectiveness of different diagnostic methods using a stochastic agent-based city-scale model, and then address the issue of whether conventional testing approaches, when used with appropriate intervention policies, can be as effective as fast testkits in containing a pandemic outbreak. We found that for mitigation purposes, fast and accurate testkits are not necessary as long as sufficient medication is given, and are generally recommended only when used with extensive contact tracing and prophylaxis. Additionally, in the event of insufficient medication and fast testkits, the use of slower, conventional testkits together with proper isolation policies while waiting for the diagnostic results can be an equally effective substitute.","output":"How necessary is a fast testkit for mitigation of pandemic flu?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory viral infections have been a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.

Patients with pre-existing conditions including diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk of complications. Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is an ultra-rare and debilitating genetic disorder that is characterized by a pro-inflammatory state, which leads to progressive heterotopic ossification and complications after trauma, including intramuscular vaccinations. To better understand the impact of COVID-19 on patients with FOP, we first examined the social impact of the pandemic using data from the FOP Registry managed by the International FOP Association. We also identified patients with FOP who were exposed to or contracted the SARS-CoV-2 virus, or who received a COVID-19 vaccine, to investigate if patients with FOP were at increased risks of complications from SARS-CoV2 exposure or vaccination. RESULTS: Data from 326 individuals in 69 countries in the International FOP Association FOP Connection Registry were examined using patient-reported outcomes measurement information system (PROMIS) global health scale scores. Twenty-six (28.9%) participants aged  15 years old rated their satisfaction with their social activities and relationships as poor in 2020, which was an increase from 18 (18.9%) in 2019, prior to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Similar trends were noted for physical and mental health in the pediatric population. Frequency of physician visits was not changed, but a larger portion of patients reported missing dental visits in 2020 compared with 2019 (31.5% vs. 41.7%). A second cohort with 32 subjects was tracked after SARS-CoV-2 exposure or vaccination. Ten subjects were positively diagnosed with COVID-19, 15 received a COVID-19 vaccine, and seven had high-risk SARS-CoV-2 exposure but either did not have a confirmed clinical diagnosis or tested negative. Subjects who tested positive for the virus showed no major complications or increased FOP disease activity, though our sample size is very limited. Among the 15 subjects who received a COVID-19 vaccine, using the International Clinical Council on FOP guidelines for prophylaxis with ibuprofen or acetaminophen, only one person experienced flare-like activity at the injection site. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with FOP showed a significant decrease in social activities that was reflective of the isolation and mobility changes in this debilitated population. In our limited cohort, the majority of the patients with FOP who tested positive for COVID-19 showed no major complications. Also, although limited in sample size, the majority of patients who received a COVID-19 vaccination and followed guidelines from the FOP International Clinical Council tolerated vaccination well.

A multitude of research efforts focuses on the improvement of established and the discovery of new vaccines such as the HPV (human papilloma virus) vaccine in 2006. However, radical changes in the density, age distribution and traveling habits of the population worldwide as well as the changing climate favor the emergence of old and new pathogens that bear the risk of becoming pandemic threats.

In the United Kingdom, gratitude was a hotly debated topic in public discourse, catalysing compelling displays of civic togetherness but also attracting criticism for being an unhelpful distraction that authorized unrealistic expectations of healthcare workers. Expressions of thanks tend to be neglected as drivers of transformation, and yet, they are important indicators of qualities to which people attach significance. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to use discursive analysis to explore how the National Health Service (NHS) was constructed in attention\\\\attracting tweets that expressed and/or discussed gratitude to the NHS. METHODS: Having determined that Twitter was the most active site for traffic relating to gratitude and the NHS, we established a corpus of 834 most\\\\liked tweets, purposively sampled from Twitter searches on a day\\\\by\\\\day basis over the period of the first lockdown in the United Kingdom (22 MarchC28 May 2020). We developed a typology for tweets engaging with gratitude as well as analysing what the NHS was thanked for. RESULTS: Our analysis, informed by a discursive psychology approach, found that the meanings attributed to gratitude were highly mobile and there were distinct patterns of activity. The NHS was predominantlyand sometimes idealisticallythanked for working, effort, saving and caring. Displays of gratitude were seen as incommensurable with failures of responsibility. The clap\\\\for\\\\carers campaign was a potent driver of affect, especially in the early parts of the lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: The social value of gratitude is implicated in the re\\\\evaluation of the risks and rewards of healthcare and social care work in the wake of the pandemic. We caution against cynicism about gratitude overshadowing the well\\\\being effects that expressing and receiving gratitude can engender, particularly given concerns over the detrimental effects of the pandemic on mental health.

OBJECTIVE To investigating the ability of the RER to predict postoperative complications. DESIGN An observational, prospective study. SETTING Two French university hospitals between March 2017 and September 2018. PATIENTS A total of 110 patients undergoing noncardiac high-risk surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The RER was calculated as (FeCO2 - FiCO2)/(FiO2 - FeO2) at five time points during the operation. The primary endpoint was at the end of the surgery. The secondary endpoints were systemic oxygenation indices (pCO2 gap, pCO2 gap/arteriovenous difference in O2 ratio, central venous oxygen saturation) and the arterial lactate level at the end of the surgery. Complications were classified according to the European Peri-operative Clinical Outcome definitions. RESULTS Postoperative complications occurred in 35 patients (34%). The median [interquartile range] RER at the end of surgery was significantly greater in the subgroup with complications, 1.06 [0.84 to 1.35] than in the subgroup without complications, 0.81 [0.75 to 0.91], and correlated significantly with the arterial lactate (r = 0.31, P < 0.001) and VO2 (r = -0.23, P = 0.001). Analysis of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the predictive value of RER for postoperative complications revealed a value of 0.77 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 0.88, P = 0.001]. The best cut-off for the RER was 0.94, with a sensitivity of 71% (95% CI 54 to 85) and a specificity of 79% (95% CI 68 to 88). CONCLUSION As a putative noninvasive marker of tissue hypoperfusion and anaerobic metabolism, the RER can be used to predict complications following high-risk surgery.

We examine downstream effects on mental health, how effects vary by race and ethnicity, and the role of existing state-level social policies in softening the pandemic's impact. METHODS We analyze an online, multi-wave Census Bureau survey fielded to nearly a million respondents between late April and July 2020. The survey includes questions measuring psychological distress as well as indirect measures of experience with the pandemic. We combine these data with state-level measures of COVID cases, lock-down orders, unemployment filings, and safety net policy. FINDINGS We find significant mental stress among all respondents and a sizeable gap between non-white and white respondents. Adjusting for pandemic experiences eliminates this gap. The effect of losing work due to the pandemic is slightly offset by state policies such as unemployment benefit size and Medicaid expansion. The magnitude of these offsetting effects is similar across racial/ethnic groups.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to analyse the patterns of radiological findings on chest radiograph (CXR) for suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients on initial presentation to the emergency medical services (EMS) on admission and to assess the progression and resolution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, patients who presented to EMS of a multispeciality hospital as suspected or confirmed Covid-19 on consecutive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). CXR was examined for findings of haziness, patterns and distribution of opacities. Progression and regression of findings in serial CXR were studied and evaluated with the clinical and laboratory parameters. High resolution CT (HRCT) chest was performed initially for some patients. RESULTS: 756 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in our study who had initial CXR. 510 (67.46%) of our patients with positive initial RT-PCR showed abnormal baseline CXR. The abnormal findings were described as haziness akin to ground glass opacities (GGO) on CT, peripheral opacities, patchy parenchymal opacities and consolidation. Peripheral opacities and lower zone distribution were the commonest pattern of CXR abnormalities with bilateral involvement. The severity of findings on serial CXR and radiographic regression was studied along with follow-up to assess response to treatment. Forty-six patients showed features of acute lung injury (ALI). Complications and new CXR findings were reported for patients who were given ventilator support. CONCLUSION: CXR is a valuable baseline radiological investigation on hospital admission in symptomatic patients with suspected or confirmed Covid-19 presenting to the EMS as it helps to monitor the progress and regression of the disease in conjunction with clinical findings.","output":"Role of chest radiography in the management of COVID-19 pneumonia: An overview and correlation with pathophysiologic changes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding the causes of the diverse outcome of COVID-19 pandemic in different geographical locations is important for the worldwide vaccine implementation and pandemic control responses.

This is particularly true for prize-based contingency management (PB-CM), a particular type of incentive that uses a fishbowl prize-draw design. Given that PB-CM interventions are gaining momentum to address the dual public health crises of opiate and stimulant use in North America and beyond, it is imperative that we better understand and critically analyze their implications. PURPOSE: The purpose of this scoping review paper is to identify the characteristics of PB-CM interventions for people who use substances and explore ethical implications documented in the literature as well as emerging ethical implications that merit further consideration. METHODS: The PRISMA-ScR checklist was used in conjunction with Arksey and OMalleys methodological framework to guide this scoping review. We completed a two-pronged analysis of 52 research articles retrieved through a comprehensive search across three key scholarly databases. After extracting descriptive data from each article, we used 9 key domains to identify characteristics of the interventions followed by an analysis of ethical implications. RESULTS: We analyzed the characteristics of PB-CM interventions which were predominantly quantitative studies aimed at studying the efficacy of PB-CM interventions. All of the interventions used a prize-draw format with a classic magnitude of 50%. Most of the interventions combined both negative and positive direction to reward processes, behaviors, and/or outcomes. One ethical implication was identified in the literature: the risk of gambling relapse. We also found three emerging ethical implications by further analyzing participant characteristics, intervention designs, and potential impact on the patientCprovider relationship. These implications include the potential deceptive nature of PB-CM, the emphasis placed on the individual behaviors to the detriment of social and structural determinants of health, and failures to address vulnerability and power dynamics. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review offers important insights into the ethics on PB-CM and its implications for research ethics, clinical ethics, and public health ethics. Additionally, it raises important questions that can inform future research and dialogues to further tease out the ethical issues associated with PB-CM.","output":"What are the ethical implications of using prize-based contingency management in substance use?

This surveillance may enable early detection of an increasing presence of COVID-19 in the community. But the same technology may simultaneously or soon be turned to other uses, including for drug interdiction, community wellness, or environmental monitoring. All of these uses raise urgent legal and ethical questions. But the legal literature, to date, has almost uniformly failed to even consider the ramifications of wastewater-based epidemiology. Indeed, we are aware of only two articles discussing wastewater surveillance in the legal literatureone of which is our own prior work. In prior work, we have raised questions about the legal and ethical dimensions of wastewater surveillance in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. But that work arrived in the earliest days of the pandemic, when research efforts were not yet well established or as broadly implemented, and when legal and ethical consideration was focused almost exclusively on the drastic public health emergency at issue. This Article thus expands the extant literature by considering the legal and ethical dimensions of wastewater surveillance more thoroughly and more broadly. It arrives at an auspicious time, as the United States moves into a vaccine-mediated phase in which COVID-19 is less likely to give rise to broad stay-at-home orders and more likely to trigger narrower, more targeted interventions. It seeks to offer guidance for the legal and ethical use of wastewater surveillance along two dimensions. The first considers the circumstances under which wastewater monitoring should be deployed for detecting and responding to COVID-19 specifically. The second zooms out, to consider whether and how this surveillance infrastructure, largely created in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, might be deployed for other uses, and examines the legal and ethical difficulties that may attend these broader uses. This Article proceeds in three parts. Part I reviews the state of the science for wastewater-based epidemiology, focusing specifically on how this technique has been deployed to monitor for or detect the virus that causes COVID-19. One of the authors is a research scientist currently working to establish and oversee wastewater-based epidemiological efforts related to COVID-19 monitoring in the City of Detroit, Michigan, and Part I draws on that expertise. Part II then moves from what is possible to what is legal and ethical. If wastewater-based epidemiology is to be deployed now and in the future for detecting and responding to COVID-19, what parameters should guide the collection of wastewater signals, and how should that data be used by policymakers and others to enact further public health protections? Finally, Part III broadens its scope beyond COVID-19. Wastewater surveillance for COVID-19 sentinel surveillance can be well justified, provided guidelines are established ex ante for public health response to monitoring results. Other uses of wastewater surveillance infrastructure, however, may raise substantial privacy concerns, particularly if this infrastructure becomes denser and correspondingly more granular in the data it discloses. Such uses may, in turn, undermine both the legal soundness of and public trust in wastewater monitoring writ large.

A significant increase in the number of new cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection demonstrates the urgency of finding drugs effective against this pathogen.The aim of this work was to evaluate the in vitro antiviral efficacy of human recombinant alpha-2b interferon (IFN-&#945;2b) against SARS-CoV-2 virus. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The experiments had been carried out on Vero Cl008, the continuous line of African green monkey (Chlorocebus sabaeus) kidney cells. The effectiveness of the drugs was assessed by the suppression of viral reproduction in vitro. The biological activity was determined using titration of a virus-containing suspension in a Vero Cl008 cell culture by the formation of negative colonies. RESULTS: The antiviral efficacy of the IFN-&#945;2b-based medications, which have a high safety profile and proven efficacy in the prevention and treatment of influenza and acute respiratory viral infections (ARVI), has been studied against the new pandemic SARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro experiments in Vero C1008 cell culture. IFN-&#945;2b effectively inhibits the reproduction of the virus when applied both 24 hrs before and 2 hrs after infection. In the IFN-&#945;2b concentration range 102-106 IU/ml a complete suppression of the reproduction of the SARS-CoV-2 virus had been demonstrated. DISCUSSION: IFN-&#945;2b demonstrated in vitro high antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the substance has a high chemotherapeutic index (&gt;1000).

The drastic changes and uncertainty in the environment had forced various industries to evolve effectively to cope with the unexpected change and subsequently bounce back to regain business success. For instance, private higher learning institutions face steep challenges due to the shortfall of organisational capabilities. The study aims to examine the role of leadership capabilities and organisational resilience in regaining organisational success among higher private learning institutions in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach According to the dynamic capabilities theory, organisational resilience and leadership capabilities are among the highest order of indicators for organisational success. Subsequently, this study examines the mediating role of leadership capabilities on the relationship between organisational resilience on organisational performance. The dynamic capabilities-based framework was tested using the structural equation modelling technique with the use of partial least squares approach. Data were analysed using 120 responses. Findings Based on the 120-questionnaire survey received, this study found that organisational resilience and leadership capabilities contribute significantly to the performance of private higher learning institutions. In addition, this study found strong support for the mediating role of leadership capabilities to promote performance. The findings have both theoretical and practical implications for post-disaster organisation resilience development. Research limitations/implications The work focuses on values that would have an impact towards organisational performance, which is an important factor of survival in an unpredictable environment. The findings are limited by the indicated constraints used in this study. Practical implications Organisational survival techniques would provide managers, owners and leaders effective techniques that can be implemented to extend and improve the organisation's life cycle. The focus on organisational resilience and leadership factors would greatly improve the overall sustainability and performance of the organisation. Originality/value The study contributed by showing the importance, use and interaction needed from organisational resilience and leadership capabilities for them to survive when there is a sudden change in the environment. The timing and uniqueness of the data during the pandemic illustrates how organisations can survive with high levels of weightage towards resilience and leadership.

UK national audit data (Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project [MINAP]) demonstrates minor improvements in door-to-balloon times (DTB) of <90 min but increasing call-to-balloon times (CTB). We evaluate the effect of a regional Cardiologist delivered paramedic education programme (PEP) on DTB times and appropriate use of the PPCI pathway. METHODS: This was a prospective single-centre study of patients with STEMI brought directly to hospital via ambulance services. Data sources included ambulance charts, in-patient notes, British Cardiovascular Interventional Society (BCIS) database and local MINAP data. All DTB breaches were investigated. A local PEP was implemented with focus on ECG interpretation, STEMI diagnosis and appropriate use of the PPCI pathway. Non-parametric Wilcoxon rank test was used for comparisons of DTB and CTB times between direct versus ED-associated cath lab transfer. RESULTS: A total of 728 patients with STEMI were admitted directly to our centre via ambulance, 66% (n=484) directly to the Catheterisation Laboratory (Cath Lab) and 34% (n=244) via the Emergency Department (ED). There was a significant increase in median DTB, 83 vs 37 min (p<0.001) and median CTB 144 vs 97.5 min (p<0.001) when transfer to the Cath Lab occurred via the ED versus direct transfer. The PEP increased direct cath lab transfers (52%C85%) and generated annual reductions in median DTB times, with sustained improvement seen throughout the 7-year study period.

INTRODUCTION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a large number of publications examined the frequency of symptoms and the mode of transmission in childhood but only a few community-based studies have been published. In our paper, 545 pediatric COVID-19 patients' data were collected by 12 primary care pediatricians in the second (n = 293) and third (n = 252) waves of the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To compare the frequency of symptoms and household transmission in different age groups and between the two waves. METHOD: Patients' data and disease characteristics were recorded retrospectively in the same manner by all participating pediatricians. RESULTS: In patients of <10 years of age, fever, rhinorrhea and cough were registered the most frequently (30-50%), in contrast to patients of >10 years, where high frequency of general symptoms was found (30-40% headache, weakness, anosmia). In the third wave, the ratio of the age group 11-18 years declined from 68% to 47%, the frequency of respiratory symptoms increased significantly, while the ratio of general symptoms decreased. Household exposition was more frequent in the third wave (36% vs. 58%), while the transmission rate from children to family members was 24% and 16%, respectively, and it varied with age. DISCUSSION: Clinical manifestation showed relation to age and virus variant: the older age associated with higher frequency of general symptoms and the spread of the alpha variant led to the predominance of respiratory symptoms over general complaints. Prolonged school closures affected the age distribution and increased the frequency of household exposition. Secondary household transmission remained low. CONCLUSION: Clinical and epidemiological characteristics of pediatric COVID-19 disease were highly influenced by age, dominant virus variant and mitigation measures.

The aim of this study was to examine the associations between self-reported age at first drink and age at first alcohol intoxication with the risk of death by age 30. METHODS: The sample (n = 6564; 49.1% males) included all participants of the Northern Finland Birth Cohort Study 1986 (NFBC1986) for whom the two measures of adolescent drinking were available. Self-reported age at onset of first drink and first alcohol intoxication were analyzed along with background variables and data regarding subsequent psychiatric diagnoses. Adolescents were dichotomized into those reporting age at first drink and age at first intoxication before or after age 14. Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for death by age 30. RESULTS: By the age of 30, 0.7% (n = 47) of all 6564 participants were deceased. In the multivariable models, male gender and a history of illicit substance use in adolescence were associated with both all-cause mortality and mortality due to accidents or suicide. After controlling for confounding variables, age at first alcohol intoxication was associated with all-cause mortality (HR 2.33; 95% CI 1.04-5.20) as well as death due to accidents or suicide (HR 2.99; 95% CI 1.11-8.05). CONCLUSIONS: Earlier age at first intoxication carries long-term repercussions with respect to premature loss of life.

Case PresentationWe narrate our perspectives on managing a 32-year-old, critically ill obstetric patient at 32-week gestation, diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia. Upon confirmation of COVID-19, as per the local protocol antivirals, antimalarial, and antibiotics were commenced. Due to rapidly exacerbating maternal respiratory functions, and potential chances of fetal hypoxemia emergency caesarian was performed. Following delivery, the maternal respiratory functions further deteriorated as she required prolonged mechanical ventilation and initiation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation until she was clinically stable on day 23. The patient also received convalescent plasma and tocilizumab as a part of the treatment protocol. The newborn was shifted to neonatal intensive care for intubation for respiratory distress and was found negative for SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 immunoglobulin (Ig). At day 25, the patient was clinically stable and was transferred to step down unit and discharged thereafter.

The agri-food sector has an important and prominent role in the Northern Ireland economy. The Going for Growth strategy illustrates how particular interests within the sector are supported by government, as demonstrated through the Renewable Heat Initiative and a scheme promoting anaerobic digestors. Using policy post-exceptionalism to scrutinize the strategy, our research shows what can go wrong when a transition to post-exceptionalism occurs. While Going for Growth purported to represent the wider interests that one might expect to find in a post-exceptionalist approach to agri-food governance, in fact the concentration of power with corporate actors left little space for the inclusion of wider interests. We conclude that this strategy represented a move towards tense post-exceptionalism, creating at least one political scandal, raising questions of legitimacy and transparency and fundamentally undermining political viability of wider government.

However, the search for the most effective protocol continues. This study aimed to compare the effect of reducing cough reflex after injection of fentanyl in a fusion protocol by combining the injections of lidocaine and Huffing maneuver and comparing with a placebo control group, before anesthesia induction. METHODS: This prospective randomized controlled trial study was performed on 400 patients who were divided into four groups of combined protocol (group 1), lidocaine group (group 2), Huffing maneuver group (group 3), and the control receiving normal saline (group 4). Then patients were injected with 2. 5 g /kg fentanyl and monitored for 2 min regarding their cough reflex, as well as the severity. RESULTS: In group one, 9 patients (9%), in group two, 45 patients (45%), 22 patients (22%) in group three, and in group four, 75 patients (75%), developed cough reflex following fentanyl injection. Also, 13 patients (13%) developed moderate and 4 (4%) developed severe coughs in the control group reported, while no reports of severe or moderate cough were among the intervention groups. There was a significant difference between the intervention group and the control group both in terms of the rate and severity of the fentanyl-induced cough. CONCLUSION: By using a combination of lidocaine injection along and Huffing maneuver, better results can be obtained in reducing the frequency, and also the severity of cough followed by fentanyl injection.

Although the predominant clinical presentation is with respiratory disease, neurological manifestations are being recognised increasingly. On the basis of knowledge of other coronaviruses, especially those that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome epidemics, cases of CNS and peripheral nervous system disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 might be expected to be rare. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS: A growing number of case reports and series describe a wide array of neurological manifestations in 901 patients, but many have insufficient detail, reflecting the challenge of studying such patients. Encephalopathy has been reported for 93 patients in total, including 16 (7%) of 214 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, and 40 (69%) of 58 patients in intensive care with COVID-19 in France. Encephalitis has been described in eight patients to date, and Guillain-Barr syndrome in 19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the CSF of some patients. Anosmia and ageusia are common, and can occur in the absence of other clinical features. Unexpectedly, acute cerebrovascular disease is also emerging as an important complication, with cohort studies reporting stroke in 2C6% of patients hospitalised with COVID-19. So far, 96 patients with stroke have been described, who frequently had vascular events in the context of a pro-inflammatory hypercoagulable state with elevated C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and ferritin. WHERE NEXT? Careful clinical, diagnostic, and epidemiological studies are needed to help define the manifestations and burden of neurological disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Precise case definitions must be used to distinguish non-specific complications of severe disease (eg, hypoxic encephalopathy and critical care neuropathy) from those caused directly or indirectly by the virus, including infectious, para-infectious, and post-infectious encephalitis, hypercoagulable states leading to stroke, and acute neuropathies such as Guillain-Barr syndrome. Recognition of neurological disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 in patients whose respiratory infection is mild or asymptomatic might prove challenging, especially if the primary COVID-19 illness occurred weeks earlier. The proportion of infections leading to neurological disease will probably remain small. However, these patients might be left with severe neurological sequelae. With so many people infected, the overall number of neurological patients, and their associated health burden and social and economic costs might be large. Health-care planners and policy makers must prepare for this eventuality, while the many ongoing studies investigating neurological associations increase our knowledge base.","output":"Neurological associations of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A coarse-grained force field for molecular dynamics simulations of native structures of proteins in a dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) framework is developed. The parameters for bonded interactions are derived by mapping the bonds and angles for 20 amino acids onto target distributions obtained from fully atomistic simulations in explicit solvent. A dual-basin potential is introduced for stabilizing backbone angles, to cover a wide spectrum of protein secondary structures. The backbone dihedral potential enables folding of the protein from an unfolded initial state to the folded native structure. The proposed force field is validated by evaluating structural properties of several model peptides and proteins including the SARS-CoV-2 fusion peptide, consisting of -helices, -sheets, loops and turns. Detailed comparisons with fully atomistic simulations are carried out to assess the ability of the proposed force field to stabilize the different secondary structures present in proteins. The compact conformations of the native states were evident from the radius of gyration as well as the high intensity peaks of the root mean square deviation histograms, which were found to lie below 0.4 nm. The Ramachandran-like energy landscape on the phase space of backbone angles () and dihedrals (?) effectively captured the conformational phase space of -helices at (? = 50,  = 90) and -strands at (? = 180,  = 90 ? 120).

The applicability of the model to multidomain complexes is assessed using lysozyme as well as a large  helical bacterial pore-forming toxin, cytolysin A.

For picking up relevant VOCs in MCC-IMS spectra, software based on cluster analysis followed by multivariate statistical analysis was applied. With only four VOCs canonical discriminant analysis was able to distinguish Influenza-A-infected patients from those not infected with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. This present proof-of-concept-study yields encouraging results showing a rapid diagnosis of viral infections in nasal breath within 5 min by MCC-IMS. The next step is to validate the results with a greater number of patients with Influenza-A-infection as well as other viral diseases, especially COVID-19.

MATERIALS AND METHODS We examined the effect of adjusting the endotracheal tube cuff pressure during thyroidectomy on the incidence of airway complications. Ninety patients scheduled for elective thyroidectomy were randomized into two groups: control (group A, n = 45) and experimental (group B, n = 45). All patients underwent total intravenous anesthesia with propofol and remifentanil. In group A, the cuff pressure was set to 25 cm H2O initially and then monitored continuously without adjustment during thyroidectomy. In group B, the cuff pressure was maintained at approximately 25 cm H2O throughout the operation. The incidences and the severity of POST, hoarseness, dysphagia, and cough were recorded at 2 and 24 h postoperatively. RESULTS Cuff pressures in group A changed significantly over time (P < 0.05) and were higher than those of group B during thyroidectomy (P < 0.05). The incidences of POST were lower in group B than in group A at 2 and 24 h postoperatively (P < 0.05), and there was a significant difference in the severity of POST at 2 h postoperatively between the two groups. There were no differences in the incidences of hoarseness, dysphagia, and cough between the two study groups (P > 0.05). Adjusting the endotracheal cuff pressure during thyroidectomy decreased the incidence and degree of POST.

Currently, several quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays recommended by the World Health Organization are being used by clinical and public health laboratories and typically target regions of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N) coding region. However, it is currently unclear if results from different tests are comparable. This study aimed to clarify the clinical performances of the primer/probe sets designed by US CDC and Charit/Berlin to help clinical laboratories in assay selection for SARS-CoV-2 routine detection. METHODS: We compared the clinical performances of the recommended primer/probe sets using one hundred nasopharyngeal swab specimens from patients who were clinically diagnosed with COVID-19. An additional 30 \\"pre-intervention screening\\" samples from patients who were not suspected of COVID-19 were also included in this study. We also performed sequence alignment between 31064 European SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern genomes and the recommended primer/probe sets. RESULTS: The present study demonstrates substantial differences in SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection sensitivity among the primer/probe sets recommended by the World Health Organization especially for low-level viral loads. The alignment of thousands of SARS-CoV-2 sequences reveals that the genetic diversity remains relatively low at the primer/probe binding sites. However, multiple nucleotide mismatches might contribute to false negatives.

METHODS After approval from the ethics committee of our hospital, and informed consents of the parturients were taken, 68 patients were included in the study. The regional cerebral oxygen saturations (RcSO2) of newborns were measured by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measurements at 1st, 5th min after birth. In group I (n=32), general anesthesia was performed for the cesarean operation and in group II (n=36), combined spinal epidural anesthesia (CSEA) was the anesthetic management. The age of the mother, gestation, the problems related to the pregnancy, heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of the mother had been recorded. The measurements of the newborn were; SpO2 of right hand, RcSO2 measured by NIRS, the delivery time (from incision to the cessation of circulation in the placental cord), Apgar score. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, California) and presented as mean +/- SD. Results obtained in different groups were compared using upaired t-test. Differences were statistically significant at p < 0.05. RESULTS There were no significant differences between the groups related to the mother's age, gestation week and baseline blood pressure. Both the systolic and diastolic blood pressures measured at 1st and 5th min after induction or start of the spinal block were significantly lower in the mothers who had undergone combined spinal epidural anesthesia. The heart rates of the mothers who had been under CSEA were significantly higher than the general anesthesia group. The Apgar at the 1st min were observed significantly higher in Group II. Oxygen saturation of the newborns were significantly higher in Group II. Regional cerebral oxygenation measured by NIRS were significantly higher in CSEA group.

Three consecutive cultivations in biotin free medium were necessary to prevent growth of the auxotroph mutant, and 40 ng/ml biotin were sufficient to promote cell growth. Nevertheless, 200 ng/ml biotin were necessary to ensure growth comparable to that of the wildtype which is similar to the demand of biotin auxotroph mutants among other prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes. A phenotypic complementation of the R. eutropha &#916;bioF mutant was only achieved by homologous expression of bioF of R. eutropha or heterologous expression of bioF of Bacillus subtilis but not by bioF of Escherichia coli Together with the results from bioinformatic analysis of BioFs, this leads to the assumption that the intermediate of biotin synthesis in R. eutropha is pimeloyl-CoA instead of pimeloyl-ACP like in the Gram-positive B. subtilis Internal biotin content was enhanced by homologous expression of accB whereas homologous expression of accB and accC2 in combination led to decreased biotin concentrations in the cells.

METHODS: Children (aged <18 years) who diagnosed with MIS-C and severe/critical pediatric cases with COVID-19 and were admitted to hospital between March 26 and November 3, 2020 were enrolled in the study. RESULTS: A total of 52 patients, 22 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 with severe/critical disease course and 30 patients diagnosed with MIS-C, were included in the study. Although severe COVID-19 cases and cases with MIS-C share many clinical and laboratory features, MIS-C cases had longer fever duration and higher rate of the existence of rash, conjunctival injection, peripheral edema, abdominal pain, altered mental status, and myalgia than in severe cases (p<0.001 for each). Of all, 53.3% of MIS-C cases had the evidence of myocardial involvement as compared to severe cases (27.2%). Additionally, C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell (WBC) are the independent predictors for the diagnosis of MIS-C, particularly in the existence of conjunctival injection and rash. Corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and biologic immunomodulatory treatments were mainly used in MIS-C cases rather than cases with severe disease course. There were only three deaths among 52 patients, one of whom had Burkitt lymphoma and the two cases with severe COVID-19 of late referral. CONCLUSION: Differences between clinical presentations, acute phase responses, organ involvements, and management strategies indicate that MIS-C might be a distinct immunopathogenic disease as compared to pediatric COVID-19.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of pre-pandemic mental health, physical health, and shielding with vaccine hesitancy after the announcement of the successful testing of the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We used individual-level data from a pandemic-focused investigation (COVID Survey), a prospective cohort study nested within the UK Understanding Society (Main Survey) project. In the week immediately following the announcement of successful testing of the first efficacious inoculation (November/December 2020), data on vaccine intentionality were collected in 12,035 individuals aged 16C95 years. Pre-pandemic, study members had responded to enquiries about diagnoses of mental and physical health, completed the 12-item General Health Questionnaire for symptoms of psychological distress (anxiety and depression), and indicated whether they or someone in their household was shielding. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported intention to take up a vaccination for COVID-19. To summarise our results, we computed odds ratios with accompanying 95% confidence intervals for indices of health and shielding adjusted for selected covariates. RESULTS: In an analytical sample of 11,955 people (6741 women), 15.4% indicated that they were vaccine hesitant. Relative to their disease-free counterparts, shielding was associated with a 24% lower risk of being hesitant (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval: 0.76; 0.59, 0.96), after adjustment for a range of covariates which included age, education, and ethnicity. Corresponding results for cardiometabolic disease were 22% (0.78; 0.64, 0.95), and for respiratory disease were 26% (0.74; 0.59, 0.93). Having a pre-pandemic diagnosis of anxiety or depression, or a high score on the distress symptom scale, were all unrelated to the willingness to take up a vaccine.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective survey was sent via email to 331 second- and third-year internal medicine residents from 3 academic medical centers in California and North Carolina. First-year residents were excluded owing to their limited interactions with patients at the time of participant recruitment. Data were collected from August 21 to November 25, 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Descriptive statistics were used to report the frequency of experience of various types of biased patient behavior, residents responses, the factors impeding residents responses, and residents experiences and beliefs regarding training and policies. RESULTS: Overall, 232 of 331 residents (70%) participated; 116 (50%) were women; 116 of 247 (47%) were White (participants had the option of selecting >1 race/ethnicity); and 23 (10%) identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer. The frequency of resident-reported experience of types of biased patient behaviors varied. The most common behaviorsbelittling comments and assumption of nonphysician statuswere reported to be experienced 1 or more times per week by 14% of residents (32 of 231) and 17% of residents (38 of 230), respectively. Women, Black or Latinx, and Asian residents reported experiencing biased behavior more frequently. Forty-five percent of Black or Latinx residents (17 of 38) encountered instances of explicit epithets or rejection of care. All 70 Asian residents reported experiencing inquiries into their ethnic origins. Most women residents (110 of 115 [96%]) experienced role questioning behaviors, and 87% (100 of 115) experienced sexual harassment. The need to prioritize clinical care and a sense of futility in responding were the most common factors (cited by 34% of residents [76 of 227] and 25% of residents [56 of 227], respectively) significantly impeding responses to biased behaviors. Eighty-five percent of residents (191 of 226) never reported incidents to their institution. Eighty-nine percent of residents (206 of 232) identified training and policies as necessary or very necessary. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This survey study suggests that biased patient behavior is experienced frequently by internal medicine residents.

Although alloimmune events remain the leading cause of long-term allograft loss, many patients develop innate and adaptive immune responses leading to graft tolerance. The focus of this review is to provide an overview of selected aspects of the effects of inflammation on this delicate balance following solid organ transplantation. Initially, we discuss the inflammatory mediators detectable in an ESD patient. Then, the specific inflammatory mediators found post-Tx are elucidated. We examine the reciprocal relationship between donor-derived passenger leukocytes (PLs) and those of the recipient, with additional emphasis on extracellular vesicles, specifically exosomes, and we examine their role in determining the balance between tolerance and rejection. The concept of recipient antigen-presenting cell cross-dressing by donor exosomes is detailed. Immunological consequences of the changes undergone by cell surface antigens, including HLA molecules in donor and host immune cells activated by proinflammatory cytokines, are examined. Inflammation-mediated donor endothelial cell (EC) activation is discussed along with the effect of donor-recipient EC chimerism. Finally, as an example of a specific inflammatory mediator, a detailed analysis is provided on the dynamic role of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and its receptor post-Tx, especially given the potential for therapeutic interdiction of this axis with monoclonal antibodies.

CDC examined the changing age distribution of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States during May-August by assessing three indicators: COVID-19-like illness-related emergency department (ED) visits, positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and confirmed COVID-19 cases. Nationwide, the median age of COVID-19 cases declined from 46 years in May to 37 years in July and 38 in August. Similar patterns were seen for COVID-19-like illness-related ED visits and positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results in all U.S. Census regions.

This study aimed to assess the long-term trends of mortality from unintentional falls in China and to examine the age-, period-, and cohort-specific effects behind them. Methods: This population-based multiyear cross-sectional study of Chinese people aged 0-84 years was a secondary analysis of the mortality data of fall injuries from 1990 to 2019, derived from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. Age-standardized mortality rates of unintentional falls by year, sex, and age group were used as the main outcomes and were analyzed within the age-period-cohort framework. Results: Although the crude mortality rates of unintentional falls for men and women showed a significant upward trend, the age-standardized mortality rates for both sexes only increased slightly. The net drift of unintentional fall mortality was 0.13% (95% CI, -0.04 to 0.3%) per year for men and -0.71% (95% CI, -0.96 to -0.46%) per year for women. The local drift values for both sexes increased with age group. Significant age, cohort, and period effects were found behind the mortality trends of the unintentional falls for both sexes in China.

METHODS: Two samples were recruited for an online survey: one sample was a representative sample of Canadians living with overweight and obesity (n = 1,089), and the second was a convenience sample of individuals recruited from obesity clinical services or patient organizations (n = 980). Respondents completed ratings of their comfort receiving a COVID\\\\19 vaccination along with the Vaccine Hesitancy Scale and the Fear of COVID\\\\19 Scale. RESULTS: Approximately one\\\\third of respondents, regardless of sample or weight category, were not comfortable receiving a vaccination, and one\\\\half expressed moderate or greater perceived risks of vaccination. Confidence in vaccinations was extremely low, especially for those in the clinical sample. Fear of COVID\\\\19 was substantial and predicted attitudes toward vaccination.

To date, the sequencing of its whole genome is unavailable as a non-model organism. Transcriptomic information is also scarce for this species. In this study, we performed de novo transcriptome sequencing to produce the first comprehensive expressed sequence tag (EST) dataset for L. aurea using high-throughput sequencing technology. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Total RNA was isolated from leaves with sodium nitroprusside (SNP), salicylic acid (SA), or methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment, stems, and flowers at the bud, blooming, and wilting stages. Equal quantities of RNA from each tissue and stage were pooled to construct a cDNA library. Using 454 pyrosequencing technology, a total of 937,990 high quality reads (308.63 Mb) with an average read length of 329 bp were generated. Clustering and assembly of these reads produced a non-redundant set of 141,111 unique sequences, comprising 24,604 contigs and 116,507 singletons. All of the unique sequences were involved in the biological process, cellular component and molecular function categories by GO analysis. Potential genes and their functions were predicted by KEGG pathway mapping and COG analysis. Based on our sequence analysis and published literatures, many putative genes involved in Amaryllidaceae alkaloids synthesis, including PAL, TYDC OMT, NMT, P450, and other potentially important candidate genes, were identified for the first time in this Lycoris. Furthermore, 6,386 SSRs and 18,107 high-confidence SNPs were identified in this EST dataset. CONCLUSIONS: The transcriptome provides an invaluable new data for a functional genomics resource and future biological research in L. aurea. The molecular markers identified in this study will provide a material basis for future genetic linkage and quantitative trait loci analyses, and will provide useful information for functional genomic research in future.","output":"De novo Sequence Assembly and Characterization of Lycoris aurea Transcriptome Using GS FLX Titanium Platform of 454 Pyrosequencing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Global deployment of an effective and safe vaccine is necessary to curtail the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

This study aims to provide further insight into the epidemiology of COVID-19 in Malawi by estimating the SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection in a hospital-based setting. Methods We conducted a hospital-based, convenience sampling, cross-sectional survey for SARS-CoV-2 in Lilongwe, Malawi. Participants answered a questionnaire and were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection using ELISA and RT-PCR. To estimate immunity, a surrogate virus neutralization test was performed in all seropositive samples. Poisson regression was performed to assess the association of SARS-CoV-2 point prevalence and demographic and behavioral variables. Findings A total of 930 participants were included in the study. We found a combined point prevalence of 10.1% (95% CI 8.4-12.3). Separately analyzed, the RT-PCR positivity was 2.0 % (95% CI 1.2-3.4), and the seropositivity was 9.3% (CI 95% 7.6-11.4). Of the tested seropositive samples, 90.1% (95% CI 81.2%-95.1%) were also tested positive in the surrogate virus neutralization assay. We found a high rate of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (45.7%). SARS-CoV-2 point prevalence was significantly associated with being health care worker (PR 1.7; 95% CI 1.1-2.5). Interpretation Our study suggests that official data underestimate the true magnitude of COVID-19 transmission. Performance of sVNT to estimate immunity in Malawi is feasible and revealed a considerable rate of post-infection immunity in our cohort.

Inference about the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 can provide important insights into the speed of disease spread and the effects of mitigation policies. We develop a novel Bayesian approach to such inference based on a probabilistic compartmental model using data of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases. In particular, we consider a probabilistic extension of the classical susceptible-infectious-recovered model, which takes into account undocumented infections and allows the epidemiological parameters to vary over time. We estimate the disease transmission rate via a Gaussian process prior, which captures nonlinear changes over time without the need of specific parametric assumptions. We utilize a parallel-tempering Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to efficiently sample from the highly correlated posterior space. Predictions for future observations are done by sampling from their posterior predictive distributions. Performance of the proposed approach is assessed using simulated datasets. Finally, our approach is applied to COVID-19 data from four states of the United States: Washington, New York, California, and Illinois.

The use of medical devices (sphygmomanometer, glucometer, balance, etc.), connected by wireless to the clinician's portal, might also allow a wider diffusion of incremental dialysis, an integrated therapy that combines conservative management of ESKD patients with a soft dialysis based on the residual kidney function and symptomatology, with potential prognosis and economic benefits.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in college students nationwide from December 27, 2020 to January 18, 2021. Attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines and acceptance of future vaccination programs were assessed. Results: Totally, 2,881 college students participated in this survey; of them, 76.3% (95% CI: 74.8% - 77.9%) were willing to accept a COVID-19 vaccine in the future.

Literature on the experience of living with multimorbidity is accumulating but has not yet been synthesised in a manner conducive to informing the design of self-management interventions for this population. This study aimed to systematically review and synthesise findings from published, in-depth qualitative studies about the experience of multimorbidity, with a view to identifying the components and motivation for successful self-management in this population. METHODS Systematic review of and meta-synthesis of qualitative studies that evaluated patient experience of living with and/or self-managing mental and/or physical multimorbidity. MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and ASSIA along with reference lists of existing reviews and content pages of non-indexed specialists comorbidity journals were searched. RESULTS Nineteen studies from 23 papers were included. A line of argument synthesis was articulated around three third-order constructs: 1) Encounters with complexity; 2) Marshalling medicines, emotions, and resources; and 3) Self-preservation and prevention. Our interpretation revealed how mental and physical multimorbidity is experienced as moments of complexity rather than mere counts of illnesses. Successful self-management of physical symptoms was contingent upon the tactical use of medicines, whilst emotional health was more commonly managed by engaging in behavioural strategies, commonly with a social or spiritual component. Motivations for self-management were underpinned by a sense of moral purpose to take responsibility for their health, but also by a desire to live a purposeful life beyond an immediate context of multimorbidity. CONCLUSIONS Understanding how people experience the complexities of mental and physical multimorbidity may be crucial to designing and delivering interventions to support successful self-management in this population. Future self-management interventions should aim to support patients to exert responsibility and autonomy for medical self-management and promote agency and self-determination to lead purposeful lives via improved access to appropriate social and psychological support.","output":"Living with complexity; marshalling resources: a systematic review and qualitative meta-synthesis of lived experience of mental and physical multimorbidity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the last few decades, there has been a shift in the classroom from lecture-based to active learning settings with the argument that students retain more information when they are involved in the learning process.

METHODS: We conducted a nationwide cohort study of all Swedish adults with chronic liver disease (CLD) confirmed by liver biopsy between 1966 and 2017 (n = 42,320), who were alive on February 1, 2020. CLD cases were matched to  5 population comparators by age, sex, calendar year and county (n = 182,147). Using Cox regression, we estimated multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for COVID-19 hospitalization and severe COVID-19 (intensive care admission or death due to COVID-19). RESULTS: Between February 1 and July 31, 2020, 161 (0.38%) CLD patients and 435 (0.24%) general population controls were hospitalized with COVID-19 (aHR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.11C1.66), while 65 (0.15%) CLD patients and 191 (0.10%) controls developed severe COVID-19 (aHR = 1.08, 95% CI = 0.79C1.48). Results were similar in patients with CLD due to alcohol use, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, and other etiologies.

However, as with any representation of complex disciplinary information, learning to correctly interpret phylogenies can be challenging, requiring that a diversity of educational strategies be deployed. Representational competence is the ability to develop and effectively use abstract representations. Accurately interpreting a phylogenetic tree as a presentation of evolutionary relationships requires that students develop general representational competence as well as knowledge of specific technical aspects of tree interpretation, such as knowing the graphical components of trees and what they represent. Here we report on the development of a basic diagnostic tool of students' representational competence and technical skills with phylogenies, the Basic Evolutionary Tree-Thinking Skills Instrument (BETTSI). This short, multiple choice instrument was designed to provide instructors with a quick diagnostic of students' ability to read and interpret phylogenies. It has been checked for reliability and validity and provides a convenient formative and summative assessment of students' understanding of evolutionary trees. This article is protected by copyright.

To investigate the impact of the pandemic on nutrients and food intake of children and adolescents in Germany, we analyzed repeated 3-day weighed dietary records from 108 participants (3C18 years; females: n = 45, males: n = 63) of the Dortmund Nutritional and Anthropometric Longitudinally Designed (DONALD) study. Polynomial mixed-effects regression models were used to identify prospective changes in dietary intake (total energy (TEI), carbohydrates, fat, protein, free sugar, ultra-processed foods, fruits and vegetables, sugar sweetened beverages and juices) before and during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. For the current analysis, we have chosen the first months of the pandemic (March 2020CAugust 2020), as this was the period with the most restrictions in Germany so far (kindergarten, school and restaurant closures; contact and outdoor activity restrictions). No significant changes in either the selected nutrients or food groups were observed. However, children and adolescents recorded a significantly lower TEI during the pandemic ( = ?109.65, p = 0.0062). Results remained significant after the exclusion of participants with under-reported records ( = ?95.77, p = 0.0063). While macronutrient intake did not change, descriptive data indicate a non-significant decrease in sugar sweetened beverages and ultra-processed foods intake.

Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory qualitative research approach and an interpretative phenomenological analysis design were used. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with senior female audit managers who had resigned from Johannesburg Stock Exchange-accredited audit firms. Findings: The female former audit managers reported their unique experiences in terms of a lack of transparent career progression discussions, audit firms being run by old boys clubs and unfair treatment linked to bias, job overload and indistinct ambitions to become audit partners. Research limitations/implications: The homogeneous sample included a small number of female participants from a limited number of audit firms. Originality/value: The findings could inform audit firms how to address the factors contributing to female audit managers resignations and to challenge stereotypes to retain more women for promotion to audit partner-level, thereby capitalising on the benefits of a diversified management structure that could lead to higher quality audits and address gender inequality. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"The experiences leading to resignation of female audit managers: an interpretative phenomenological analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The progressive SARS-CoV2 outbreaks worldwide have evoked global investigation. Despite the numerousin-silico approaches, the virus-host relationship remains a serious concern. MicroRNAs are the small non-coding RNAs that help in regulating gene profiling. The current study utilized miRNA prediction tools along with the PANTHER classification system to demonstrate association and sequence similarities shared between miRNAs of SARS-CoV2 and human host. METHOD: An in-silico approach was carried out using Vmir analyzer to predict miRNAs from SARS-CoV2 viral genomes. Predicted miRNAs from SARS-CoV2 viral genomes were used for effective hybridization sequence identification along the nucleotide similarities with human miRNAs from miRbase database. Further, it was proceeded to analyze the gene ontology using miRDB with PANTHER classification. RESULT: Based on the prediction and analysis, we have identified 22 potential miRNAs from five genomes of SARS-CoV2 linked with 12 human miRNAs. Analysis of human miRNAs hsa-mir-1267, hsa-mir-1-3p, hsa-mir-5683 were found shared between all the five viral SARS-CoV2 miRNAs. Further, PANTHER classification analyzed the gene-ontology being carried by these associations showed that 44 genes were involved in biological functions that includes genes specific for signaling pathway, immune complex generation, enzyme binding with effective role in the virus-host relationship. CONCLUSION: Our analysis concludes that the genes identified in this study can be effective in analyzing the virus-host interaction.

However, distinguishing the most epidemiologically relevant information encoded in these vast amounts of data requires substantial effort across the research and public health communities. Studies of SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been critical in tracking the spread of variants and understanding its epidemic dynamics, and may prove crucial for controlling future epidemics and alleviating significant public health burdens. Together, genomic data and bioinformatics methods enable broad-scale investigations of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 at the local, national, and global scales and allow researchers the ability to efficiently track the emergence of novel variants, reconstruct epidemic dynamics, and provide important insights into drug and vaccine development and disease control.

Due to a very populated multiparameter magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) image, manual segmentation task can be very time-consuming, meticulous, and prone to subjective errors. Here, we propose a novel deep learning (DL) framework based on mutual enhancing networks (MENs) to automatically segment brain tumor subregions. Proposed framework is suitable for segmentation of brain tumor subregions owing to contribution of retina U-Net followed by implementation of mutual enhancing strategy between classification module and segmentation module. Retina U-Net is trained to accurately identify view-of-interest (VOIs) and feature maps of whole tumor (WT), which are then transferred to classification module and segmentation module. Subsequently, classification localization map (CLM) generated by classification module is integrated with segmentation module to bring forth mutual enhancing strategy. In this way, our proposed framework first focuses on WT through retina U-Net, and since WT consists subregions, mutual enhancing strategy then further aims to classify and segment subregions embedded within WT. We implemented and evaluated our proposed framework on brain tumor segmentation challenge (BraTS) 2020 dataset consisting of 369 cases. We performed 5-fold cross validation on 200 datasets and hold-out test on remaining 169 cases. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our network design, we compared our method against the networks without retina U-Net, mutual enhancing strategy, and a recently published Cascaded U-Net architecture. Results of all four methods were compared to the ground truth for segmentation and localization accuracies. Our method yielded significantly (P < 0.01) better values of dice-similarity-coefficient, center-of-mass-distance, and volume difference compared to all three competing methods across all tumor labels on both validation and hold-out dataset.

For this reason, during the COVID-19 outbreak, surgical tracheostomy was preferred to the percutaneous one, despite the technique related complications increased risk. METHODS: We describe a new sequence for percutaneous dilation tracheostomy procedure that could be considered safe both for patients and healthcare personnel. A fiberscope was connected to a video unit to allow bronchoscopy. Guidewire positioning was performed as usual. While the established standard procedure continues with the creation of the stoma without any change in mechanical ventilation, we retracted the bronchoscope until immediately after the access valve in the mount tube, allowing normal ventilation. After 3 minutes of ventilation with 100% oxygen, mechanical ventilation was stopped without disconnecting the circuit. During apnea, the stoma was created by dilating the trachea and the tracheostomy cannula was inserted. Ventilation was then resumed. We evaluated the safeness of the procedure by recording any severe desaturation and by performing serological tests to all personnel. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients (38%) of 96 underwent tracheostomy; 22 (23%) percutaneous dilation tracheostomies with the new approach were performed without any desaturation. All personnel (150 operators) were evaluated for serological testing: 9 (6%) had positive serology but none of them had participated in tracheostomy procedures. CONCLUSION: This newly described percutaneous dilation tracheostomy technique was not related to severe desaturation events and we did not observe any positive serological test in health workers who performed the tracheostomies.","output":"Percutaneous tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients: a new apneic approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ultrathin fibrous materials based on natural bacterial polymer polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) were prepared by the electrospinning method.

METHODS: 113 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 were enrolled in this retrospective study, and divided into three categories as mild, moderate and severe cases. The concentrations of serum KL-6 and Fn at hospital admission were tested using the method of latex agglutination assay and immunoturbidimetic assay, respectively. RESULTS: Compared with that in the non-severe COVID-19 cases and normal control subjects, serum KL-6 concentration on admission was significantly higher in the severe group, which was positively correlated with C-reactive protein, and negatively correlated with lymphocytes count. Whereas, no obvious elevation in serum Fn concentration was investigated in COVID-19 patients with the different phenotypes. The severe cases displayed the higher incident rate of pulmonary fibrosis at hospital discharge. Compared with non-PF patients, the COVID-19 cases with PF had the higher serum KL-6 values.

CONCLUSIONS: Non-negligible frequency of super-spreading events, short serial intervals, and a higher risk of being infected outside of households for male people of working age indicate a significant barrier to the identification and management of COVID-19 cases, which requires enhanced non-pharmaceutical interventions to mitigate this pandemic.","output":"Reconstruction of Transmission Pairs for novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in mainland China: Estimation of Super-spreading Events, Serial Interval, and Hazard of Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Many organizations are confronted with the challenge of improving supply chain transparency not only to meet regulatory requirements, but also to optimize operations, guarantee the quality of outputs, and ensure the sustainability of processes As this topic has garnered significant interest across a wide range of academic disciplines, there is a need to synthesize and categorize these diverse contributions to inspire future investigations of emerging or under-researched substantive areas This article addresses this need by reviewing existing research on supply chain transparency and offers an integrated understanding of this growing literature By analyzing a sample of over 300 peer-reviewed articles through bibliometric and automated text mining methods, we identify six distinct clusters that represent substantive literature subdomains: transparency technologies, knowledge integration, governance, sustainability, traceability, and resilience Building on these structured analyses, we develop a literature framework to comprehensively organize insights from these clusters and illustrate the conceptual relationships between transparency management systems, transparency vehicles, and transparency outcomes By providing a holistic examination of how supply chain transparency is enabled, our framework aids researchers future studies and guides practitioners strategies to identify, diagnose, and address modern challenges that face supply chains (e g , COVID-19 pandemic, workplace exploitation, increased third-party scrutiny)","output":"Supply chain transparency: A bibliometric review and research agenda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In January 2020, a previously unknown coronavirus strain was identified as the cause of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2). The first viral whole-genome was sequenced using high-throughput sequencing from a sample collected in Wuhan, China. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is imperative in investigating disease outbreak transmission dynamics and guiding decision-making in public health. Methods: We retrieved archived SARS-CoV-2 samples at the Integrated Biorepository of H3Africa Uganda, Makerere University (IBRH3AU). These samples were collected previously from individuals diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). 30 samples with cycle thresholds (Cts) values <25 were selected for WGS using SARS-CoV-2 ARTIC protocol at Makerere University Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory. Results: 28 out of 30 (93.3%) samples generated analyzable genomic sequence reads. We detected SARS-CoV-2 and lineages A (22/28) and B (6/28) from the samples. We further show phylogenetic relatedness of these isolates alongside other 328 Uganda (lineage A = 222, lineage B = 106) SARS-CoV-2 genomes available in GISAID by April 22, 2021 and submitted by the Uganda Virus Research Institute.

Several lines of evidence suggest that surveillance of sewage and waste can provide an early warning sign for COVID-19 recurrence in a community. In support, SARS-CoV-2 traces were found in sewage in several countries. With this in mind, it is notable that pests, such as cockroaches, are exposed to pathogenic microbes routinely, yet thrive in polluted environments. Such species have likely developed mechanisms to protect themselves against pathogens. In support, recent studies showed that cockroaches possess potent antibacterial molecules to shield themselves from pathogenic bacteria. Among hundreds of molecules, some contained thiazine groups, imidazoles, chromene derivatives, isoquinoline group, sulfonamides, pyrrole-containing analogs, flavanones, and furanones. Here, we propose that cockroaches are a potential source of antiviral molecules to thwart infections. Because this is an unexploited resource for potential antivirals, we believe that cockroaches offer a unique source for novel bioactive molecule(s) to counter COVID-19 with huge clinical impact worldwide.","output":"Targeting SARS-CoV-2: Novel Source of Antiviral Compound(s) against COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Traditional anatomy education (TAE) is based on teaching by seeing and touching cadavers/plastic materials that enable three-dimensional thinking, but there was no opportunity like this in distance anatomy education (DAE).

METHODS: The questionnaire used in the study was applied to the first grade students in the Faculty of Medicine, at the Eskisehir Osmangazi University, in 2019C2020. 239 students completed the survey. The questionnaire consisted of the demographic information, that was obtained with voluntary consent, and sections containing suggestions on DAE, and its comparison with distance education of other basic medical science courses. The survey was prepared as a Likert scale (with 1 = totally disagree to 5 = totally agree), on Google forms and sent to the students online. RESULTS: 82.4% of the students marked totally disagree or disagree for the statement of DAE is more efficient than TAE. The total percentage of students who marked totally disagree or disagree for the statement of I was satisfied with the theoretical education in DAE was 58.6%, but when it came to practical education the percentage raised to 79.9%.

The disease surveillance and quality control are essential to guarantee the results of animal experiments performed on rabbits. Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus, rabbit rotavirus and Sendai virus are the important pathogens that needed to be eliminated. Rapid and sensitive method focus on these three viruses should be established for routine monitoring. The Luminex x-TAG assay based on multiplex PCR and fluorescent microsphere is a fast developing technology applied in high throughput detection. Specific primers modified with oligonucleotide sequence/biotin were used to amplify target fragments. The conjugation between oligonucleotide sequence of the PCR products and the MagPlex-TAG microspheres was specific without any cross-reaction, and the hybridization products could be analyzed using the Luminex 200 analyzer instrument. Recombinant plasmids were constructed to estimate the detection limit of the viruses. Furthermore, 40 clinical samples were used to evaluate the efficiency of this multiplex PCR based Luminex x-TAG assay. RESULTS: According to the results, this new method showed high specificity and good stability. Assessed by the recombinant plasmids, the detection limit of three viruses was 100copies/l. Among 40 clinical specimens, 18 specimens were found positive, which was completely concordant with the conventional PCR method.

This compulsory transition has often been marked by disregard of the technological infrastructure of educational institutions, digital literacy skills of teachers and students, and their access to technology. A growing body of research discusses challenges faced in ERT;however, further studies are needed to arrive at validated conclusions to inform formal language teaching and learning. Against this backdrop, this qualitative study aimed at adding context-dependent knowledge to the literature by reporting on the case of university students majoring in language teaching. For this reason, the perceptions of a group of 67 pre-service English language teachers on ERT practices at a Turkish state university were explored. Data were collected through an interview form developed by the researchers and a focus group interview. The data were analysed inductively using content analysis. Half of the participants reported that specific skills were conducive to doing tasks in an ERT environment. They not only reported a variety of challenges related to the perceived ineffectiveness of learning, technical insufficiency, and inappropriateness of the learning environment, but also acknowledged contributions to their personal and academic development. That is, they found ERT flexible, time-saving, and favourable for learners who felt more confident in virtual classrooms, and some considered ERT as an opportunity for self-actualisation. Nonetheless, the majority favoured face-to-face education over ERT appreciating the enhanced effectiveness of in-class education. In sum, the study emphasises the need to support learners and teachers by providing instructions and strategies on how to organise learning and teaching. Moreover, schools, policy makers, and governmental authorities may need to provide ERT-tailored programmes and an infrastructure in terms of technical equipment to meet the requirements of education delivered in ERT and to realise effective language learning in virtual environments.

The aim of this study was to investigate the temporal variability of OHCA occurrence during the long-time period and analyze the circadian pattern within particular timeframes. METHODS The retrospective analysis of 5058 OHCA cases was made covering the period from January 1st, 2006 to December 31st, 2018. Circadian, weekly, monthly and seasonal variabilities were investigated. The circadian variability of OHCA occurrence was assessed within particular years, seasons of the years, and days of the week. RESULTS The highest OHCA incidence was observed between 08:00 and 08:59 and the lowest between 01:00 and 01:59 (7.1% vs. 1.6%, p < 0.001). After division into 6-h intervals, a significantly lower number of OHCA cases occurred between 00:00 and 05:59 (12.3%) in comparison to the highest number observed in between 06:00 and 11:59 (12.3 vs. 33.5%, p < 0.001).

METHOD: We used the free version of Zoom for small groups of five students, a trainer and a simulated patient. All students participated in a situation that we recorded. The viewing of the recordings was followed by group discussion. Then, the students evaluated the course using an online questionnaire. We used descriptive statistics and content analysis. RESULTS: 74.4% of the students (n = 64) completed the questionnaire. 78.1-100% of them gave a good (4) or excellent (5) evaluation for the questions. The highest average score (4.95  0.21) was given to the professionalism of the trainers, the lowest was given to the choice of topic of the theoretical part (4.06  1.02). The majority of the students were satisfied with the course, they would be happy to attend it again; however, in-person learning still seems to be the preferred option. CONCLUSION: The online practice was a success. In many ways, it proved to be an adequate replacement for the traditional form. The students evaluated the training similarly to those of previous years. The lack of personal contact is a limiting factor, thus, online practice should not be seen as an alternative to personal communication trainings; however, as an independent form of training, it can make a significant contribution to effective, modern education.

The electrocardiographic (ECG) changes which may occur during hospitalization for COVID-19 have not yet been comprehensively assessed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: . We examined 50 patients admitted to hospital with proven COVID-19 pneumonia. At entry, all patients underwent a detailed clinical examination, 12-lead ECG, laboratory tests and arterial blood gas test. ECG was also recorded at discharge and in case of worsening clinical conditions. RESULTS: . Mean age of patients was 64 years and 72% were men. At baseline, 30% of patients had ST-T abnormalities, and 33% had left ventricular hypertrophy. During hospitalization, 26% of patients developed new ECG abnormalities which included atrial fibrillation, ST-T changes, tachy-brady syndrome, and changes consistent with acute pericarditis. One patient was transferred to intensive care unit for massive pulmonary embolism with right bundle branch block, and another for non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction. Patients free of ECG changes during hospitalization were more likely to be treated with antiretrovirals (68% vs 15%, p = 0.001) and hydroxychloroquine (89% vs 62%, p = 0.026) versus those who developed ECG abnormalities after admission. Most measurable ECG features at discharge did not show significant changes from baseline (all p>0.05) except for a slightly decrease in Cornell voltages (136 vs 115 mm; p = 0.0001) and a modest increase in the PR interval. The majority (54%) of patients with ECG abnormalities had 2 prior consecutive negative nasopharyngeal swabs.

Emphasis is placed on understanding of the differences in pathogenic mechanisms, host-microbial interactions, potential defects in innate antimicrobial immunity, and the role of biofilm formation in pediatric versus adult CRS and how these translate to different approaches toward both medical and surgical management. Pediatric CRS can be viewed as evolving from acute bacterial rhinosinusitis into an uncomplicated \\"early\\" stage of CRS, later evolving into a persistent stage and, in some cases, evolving into a late \\"maladaptive-eosinophilic\\" stage disease. Given this potential evolution toward more irreversible disease, a plea can be made for improved recognition of and more aggressive early intervention for pediatric CRS, it is hoped, to prevent these long-term consequences. For the primary care physician, this may necessitate enlisting the support of a sinus specialist before the symptoms of CRS have persisted for months or years. It may also necessitate, in some cases, the use of sinus computed tomography imaging to demonstrate that sinus abnormalities have resolved. Other arguments can be made for prompt and comprehensive management of pediatric CRS, including the need to reduce the burden of illness, reduce health care costs, avoid unnecessary antibiotic use and its attendant effects toward promoting antibiotic resistant infections and, potentially, to reduce the development of important comorbidities, e.g., asthma.","output":"Pediatric chronic rhinosinusitis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The cane toad, Bufo (Chaunus) marinus, is one of the most notorious vertebrate pests introduced into Australia over the last 200 years and, so far, efforts to identify a naturally occurring B. marinus-specific pathogen for use as a biological control agent have been unsuccessful. We explored an alternative approach that entailed genetically modifying a pathogen with broad host specificity so that it no longer caused disease, but carried a gene to disrupt the cane toad life cycle in a species specific manner. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The adult beta globin gene was selected as the model gene for proof of concept of autoimmunity as a biocontrol method for cane toads. A previous report showed injection of bullfrog tadpoles with adult beta globin resulted in an alteration in the form of beta globin expressed in metamorphs as well as reduced survival. In B. marinus we established for the first time that the switch from tadpole to adult globin exists. The effect of injecting B. marinus tadpoles with purified recombinant adult globin protein was then assessed using behavioural (swim speed in tadpoles and jump length in metamorphs), developmental (time to metamorphosis, weight and length at various developmental stages, protein profile of adult globin) and genetic (adult globin mRNA levels) measures. However, we were unable to detect any differences between treated and control animals.

Several individuals have been using social media platforms such as Twitter as an outlet to express their feelings, concerns, and opinions about COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination programs. This study examined COVID-19 vaccineCrelated tweets from January 1, 2020, to April 30, 2021, to uncover the topics, themes, and variations in sentiments of public Twitter users. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine key themes and topics from COVID-19 vaccineCrelated English tweets posted by individuals, and to explore the trends and variations in public opinions and sentiments. METHODS: We gathered and assessed a corpus of 2.94 million COVID-19 vaccineCrelated tweets made by 1.2 million individuals. We used CoreX topic modeling to explore the themes and topics underlying the tweets, and used VADER sentiment analysis to compute sentiment scores and examine weekly trends. We also performed qualitative content analysis of the top three topics pertaining to COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: Topic modeling yielded 16 topics that were grouped into 6 broader themes underlying the COVID-19 vaccination tweets. The most tweeted topic about COVID-19 vaccination was related to vaccination policy, specifically whether vaccines needed to be mandated or optional (13.94%), followed by vaccine hesitancy (12.63%) and postvaccination symptoms and effects (10.44%) Average compound sentiment scores were negative throughout the 16 weeks for the topics postvaccination symptoms and side effects and hoax/conspiracy. However, consistent positive sentiment scores were observed for the topics vaccination disclosure, vaccine efficacy, clinical trials and approvals, affordability, regulation, distribution and shortage, travel, appointment and scheduling, vaccination sites, advocacy, opinion leaders and endorsement, and gratitude toward health care workers. Reversal in sentiment scores in a few weeks was observed for the topics vaccination eligibility and hesitancy.

This study utilized New York State primary care practices' websites to locate immunization policies for pediatric patients and collect practice-level data. METHODS: For this cross-sectional study, we extracted website data in February/March of 2019. We first conducted a qualitative content analysis using the policy text and developed definitions of practice policy types (i.e., formal, informal, or no policy). Two authors independently reviewed and coded the text, and employed consensus meetings and feedback from the third author to finalize the content analysis. We then examined associations between practice-level characteristics and immunization policy presence through categorical data analysis. RESULTS: Of the 254 practice websites identified, 36 referred to formal immunization policies that may include consequences (e.g., dismissal) for refusing to vaccinate or not fully vaccinating, and 64 referred to informal policy statements supporting immunization. Most (89%) policies included appeals to scientific and/or professional authority. Almost all (92%) contained language tailored to potential reasons for parents' vaccine hesitancy. Our categorical analyses indicate that majority-pediatrician practices are associated with the presence of either formal or informal immunization policies (p < 0.001). Our results also suggest regional variation in the presence of such policies across New York state, although statistical significance is not achieved. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccine hesitancy in the pediatric population has become a global concern due to infectious disease outbreaks, most recently the COVID-19 pandemic.

The optimal needle device and technique for EUS-LB is still evolving. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of two second-generation 19G fine-needle biopsy (FNB) (Franseen- and Fork-tip) devices for EUS-LB. METHODS This is a repeated-measure crossover study with a prospectively maintained cohort of patients. We performed EUS-LB with a one-pass and single-actuation method using two 19G FNB needles in 22 consecutive patients between 10/2018 and 9/2019. Patients were randomized to left vs right liver lobes to be biopsied as well as the needle sequence. The specimens obtained were evaluated for adequacy for histologic diagnosis. The primary outcome was number of complete portal tracts (CPTs), post-fix aggregate, and longest specimen length. Secondary outcomes were prefix aggregate specimen length and the specimen adequacy judged by two expert pathologists. RESULTS A total of 44 liver biopsies were performed in 22 patients. The CPTs were higher in the Franseen-tip needle group compared to the Fork-tip needle group (14.4 vs 9.5, p = 0.043). Post-fix aggregate specimen length (44.9 mm vs 34.6 mm, p = 0.097), the post-fix longest specimen length (19.9 mm vs 13.7 mm, p = 0.175), and prefix aggregate specimen length (51.7 mm vs 45 mm, p = 0.265) were not significantly different. Both needles showed similarly high histologic adequacy (100% vs 95.5%, p = 0.312). Interestingly, the right of the liver showed higher yield of CPTs with both needles (Franseen, 16.2 vs. 12.8, p = 0.003, the Fork-tip, 12.8 vs. 7.0, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION EUS-guided liver biopsy using the 19G Franseen-tip needle may provide more CPTs than 19G Fork-tip needle on a single-pass, single-actuation comparison.","output":"Comparison of Two Specialized Histology Needles for Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS)-Guided Liver Biopsy: A Pilot Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patient self-inflicted lung injury may be associated with worse clinical outcomes and higher mortality. Patient-ventilator asynchrony is associated with increased ventilator days and mortality, and it has been hypothesised as one of the important mechanisms leading to patient self-inflicted lung injury. However, given the observational nature of the key studies in the field so far, the hypothesis that patient-ventilator asynchrony causes patient self-inflicted lung injury has not been supported by evidence yet. Wittenstein and colleagues present a novel approach that enables controlling patient-ventilator asynchrony in a pig model of acute lung injury, to investigate the patient-ventilator asynchrony and patient self-inflicted lung injury causality. Their results suggest that increased patient-ventilator asynchrony associated with poor clinical outcomes reported in observational trials could be a marker, rather than a cause of patient self-inflicted lung injury. These findings on their own are not sufficient to justify a greater tolerance of patient-ventilator asynchrony amongst clinicians, a change for which further experimental work and clinical evidence is needed.","output":"Experimental asynchrony to study self-inflicted lung injury."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Functional connections (FCs) methodology based on functional MRI data is an effective lever to investigate macroscopic neural activity patterns underlying critical aspects of cognition and behavior in schizophrenia (SZs).

Methods and Results: Suspensions of vaccinia poxvirus and endospores of Bacillus subtilis were used at defined concentrations as a model for poxviruses and spores of anthrax (Bacillus anthracis), both of which are pathogens that could be used for bioterrorist attacks. Negative staining electron microscopy was performed directly or after sedimentation of these suspensions on to the sample supports using airfuge ultracentrifugation. For both virus and spores, the detection limit using direct adsorption of a 10\\\\l sample volume onto the sample support was 10(6) particles per ml. Using airfuge ultracentrifugation with a sample volume of 80 l, the detection limit could be reduced to 10(5) particles per ml for spores and to 5  10(4) particles per ml for poxviruses. The influence on particle detection of incubation time, washing and adsorption procedures was investigated. Conclusions: The reproducibility and sensitivity of the method were acceptable, particularly considering the small sample volume and low particle number applied onto the sample support.

OBJECTIVE To review and summarize the current available literature on the predictive role of various biomarkers in COVID-19 patients. DATA SOURCES A literature search was performed using databases including PubMed, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. A total of 72 papers were reviewed including 54 peer reviewed papers and 18 non-peer reviewed preprints. CONCLUSIONS While non-specific, acute phase reactants including CRP, ferritin, SAA, and procalcitonin were reported as sensitive markers of acute COVID-19 disease. Significantly elevated WBC count, marked lymphopenia, decreased CD3, CD4 or CD8 T-lymphocyte counts, high neutrophil count, thrombocytopenia, and markedly elevated inflammatory biomarkers were associated with severe disease and the risk of developing sepsis with rapid progression. Trends observed by serial laboratory measurements during hospitalization including progressive decrease of lymphocyte count, thrombocytopenia, elevated CRP, procalcitonin, increased liver enzymes, decreased renal function, and coagulation derangements were more common in critically ill patient groups and associated with a high incidence of clinical complications. Elevated IL-6 level and markedly increased SAA were most often reported in severely and critically ill patients. Indicators of systemic inflammation such as neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), systemic immune-inflammation (SII) index or COVID-19 Severity Score may be utilized to predict disease severity, outcome, and mortality.

Our interdisciplinary team of applied Human Factors (HF), ethnography, and IPC experts assisted one Unit, normally serving general surgical and orthopedic patients, as it rapidly converted to deliver COVID-19-specific care. This paper describes the conversion experience of the Unit, and outlines broader lessons for other acute care teams faced with similar issues. METHODS: We deployed walkthroughs, simulations, and ethnography to identify important safety gaps in care delivery processes on the Unit. These interventions were undertaken using interdisciplinary theories of implementation that combined systems-level HF perspectives, ethnographic approaches, and individual-level IPC perspectives. Timely recommendations were developed and delivered to Unit staff for feedback and implementation. RESULTS: We describe three interventions on the Unit: 1) the de-cluttering and re-organization of personal protective equipment (PPE); 2) the reconfiguring of designated 'dirty' tray tables and supplies; and 3) the redesign of handling pathways for 'dirty' linens and laundry. Each of these interventions was implemented to varying degrees, but all contributed to discussions of safety and IPC implementation that extended beyond the Unit and into the operations of the broader hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Leveraging our team's interdisciplinary expertise and blended approaches to implementation, the interventions assisted in the Unit's rapid conversion towards providing COVID-19-specific care.

The International Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG) formed a panel of experts to develop consensus recommendations on the implications of the pandemic on several aspects of cancer care in this age group including geriatric assessment (GA), surgery, radiotherapy, systemic treatment, palliative care and research. Age and cancer diagnosis are significant predictors of adverse outcomes of the COVID-19 infection. In this setting, GA is particularly valuable to drive decision-making. GA may aid estimating physiologic reserve and adaptive capability, assessing risk-benefits of either providing or temporarily withholding treatments, and determining patient preferences to help inform treatment decisions. In a resource-constrained setting, geriatric screening tools may be administered remotely to identify patients requiring comprehensive GA. Tele-health is also crucial to ensure adequate continuity of care and minimize the risk of infection exposure. In general, therapeutic decisions should favor the most effective and least invasive approach with the lowest risk of adverse outcomes. In selected cases, this might require deferring or omitting surgery, radiotherapy or systemic treatments especially where benefits are marginal and alternative safe therapeutic options are available.

Recent studies have shown that PA has various pharmacological activities, including anti-bacterial and anti-viral effects. METHODS: In this study, the anti-influenza virus (IAV) activities and mechanisms were investigated both in vitro and in vivo. The inhibitory effects of PA against IAV in vitro were evaluated by plaque assay and immunofluorescence assay. The neuraminidase inhibition assay, hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay, and western blot assay were used to explore the anti-viral mechanisms. The anti-IAV activities in vivo were determined by mice pneumonia model and HE staining. RESULTS: The results showed that PA significantly inhibited different IAV strains multiplication in vitro, and may block IAV infection through inactivating virus particles directly and interfering with some early stages after virus adsorption. Cellular PI3K/Akt and ERK/MAPK signaling pathways may be involved in the anti-IAV actions of PA. Intranasal administration of PA markedly improved mice survival and attenuated pneumonia symptoms in IAV infected mice, comparable to the effects of Oseltamivir.

Sedentary behaviour is prevalent among adults in Australia and has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Estimating the potential health benefits and healthcare cost saving associated with reductions in population sitting time could be useful for the development of public health initiatives. METHODS: A sedentary behaviour model was developed and incorporated into an existing proportional, multi-state, life table Markov model (ACE-Obesity Policy model). This model simulates the 2019 Australian population (age 18 years and above) and estimates the incidence, prevalence and mortality of five diseases associated with sedentary behaviour (type 2 diabetes, stroke, endometrial, breast and colorectal cancer). Key model inputs included population sitting time estimates from the Australian National Health Survey 2014C2015, healthcare cost data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (2015) and relative risk estimates assessed by conducting literature reviews and meta-analyses. Scenario analyses estimated the potential change in disease incidence as a result of changes in population sitting time. This, in turn, resulted in estimated improvements in long term health outcomes (Health-adjusted life years (HALYs)) and healthcare cost-savings. RESULTS: According to the model, if all Australian adults sat no more than 4 h per day, the total HALYs gained would be approximately 17,211 with health care cost savings of approximately A$185 million over one year. Under a more feasible scenario, where sitting time was reduced in adults who sit 4 or more hours per day by approximately 36 min per person per day (based on the results of the Stand Up Victoria randomised controlled trial), potential HALYs gained were estimated to be 3,670 and healthcare cost saving could reach A$39 million over one year. CONCLUSIONS: Excessive sedentary time results in considerable population health burden in Australia. This paper describes the development of the first Australian sedentary behaviour model that can be used to predict the long term consequences of interventions targeted at reducing sedentary behaviour through reductions in sitting time. These estimates may be used by decision makers when prioritising healthcare resources and investing in preventative public health initiatives.

OBJECTIVES: This pilot trial explored the effect of a neck exercise programme on (1) neck strength and (2) head impact magnitude during heading in male and female adolescent football players. METHODS: Boys and girls (aged 12C17 years) were randomised by team to the intervention (5 weeks of supervised neuromuscular neck exercises integrated into part 2 of the FIFA 11 + , completed three times per week) or the control group (usual part 2 of the FIFA 11 + , no neck exercises). Outcomes included isometric neck strength and head impact magnitude (peak linear acceleration and peak angular velocity) during standardised heading from a throw-in (at baseline and 6 weeks) plus completion of an evaluation survey by intervention players and coaches. RESULTS: In total, 52 players (n = 31 intervention; n = 21 control) completed the study.

This system contains two regulatory pathways: a pathological pro-inflammatory pathway containing the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE)/Angiotensin II (AngII)/Angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AGTR1) axis and a protective anti-inflammatory pathway involving the Angiotensin II receptor type 2 (AGTR2)/ACE2/Ang1-7/MasReceptor axis. Numerous studies reported the positive effects of pathologic tRAS pathway inhibition and protective tRAS pathway stimulation on the treatment of cardiovascular, inflammatory, and autoimmune disease and the progression of neuropathic pain. Cell senescence and aging are known to be related to RAS pathways. Further, this system directly interacts with SARS-CoV 2 and seems to be an important target of interest in the COVID-19 pandemic.

Robots and drones transformed initial approaches to tackle COVID-19 and have proven to be effective in curbing the risk of COVID-19 in developed countries. Despite the significant impact of robots and drones in reducing the burden of frontline healthcare professionals, there is still limited literature on their utilization to fight the pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, this rapid review provides significant capabilities of robots and drones while introspecting at the challenges and barriers that may hinder their implementation in developing countries. The study revealed that robots and drones have been used for disinfection, delivery of medical supplies, surveillance, consultation and screening and diagnosis. The study revealed that adopting robots and drones face challenges such as infrastructural, financial, technological barriers, security and privacy issues, lack of policies and frameworks regulating the use of robots and drones in healthcare. We, therefore, propose a collaborative approach to mobile resources and invest in infrastructure and bridge the digital divide among the various nations on the continent coordinated efforts to craft policies and frameworks for effectively integrating robots and drones in healthcare.

This living systematic review examines published approaches for data extraction from reports of clinical studies. Methods: We systematically and continually search MEDLINE, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), arXiv, and the dblp computer science bibliography databases. Full text screening and data extraction are conducted within an open-source living systematic review application created for the purpose of this review. This iteration of the living review includes publications up to a cut-off date of 22 April 2020. Results: In total, 53 publications are included in this version of our review. Of these, 41 (77%) of the publications addressed extraction of data from abstracts, while 14 (26%) used full texts. A total of 48 (90%) publications developed and evaluated classifiers that used randomised controlled trials as the main target texts. Over 30 entities were extracted, with PICOs (population, intervention, comparator, outcome) being the most frequently extracted. A description of their datasets was provided by 49 publications (94%), but only seven (13%) made the data publicly available. Code was made available by 10 (19%) publications, and five (9%) implemented publicly available tools. Conclusions: This living systematic review presents an overview of (semi)automated data-extraction literature of interest to different types of systematic review. We identified a broad evidence base of publications describing data extraction for interventional reviews and a small number of publications extracting epidemiological or diagnostic accuracy data. The lack of publicly available gold-standard data for evaluation, and lack of application thereof, makes it difficult to draw conclusions on which is the best-performing system for each data extraction target.

OBJECTIVES This study sought to describe VT ablation results and identify factors associated with arrhythmia recurrences in a cohort of patients with myocarditis. METHODS The authors enrolled 125 consecutive patients with myocarditis, undergoing VT ablation. Before ablation, disease stage was evaluated, to identify active (AM) versus previous myocarditis (PM). The primary study endpoint was assessment of VT recurrences by 12-month follow-up. Predictors of VT recurrences were retrospectively identified. RESULTS All patients (age 51  14 years, 91% men, left ventricular ejection fraction 52%  9%) had history of myocarditis diagnosed by endomyocardial biopsy (59%) and/or cardiac magnetic resonance (90%). Furthermore, all had multiple episodes of drug-refractory VTs. Multimodal pre-procedural staging identified 47 patients with AM (38%) and 78 patients with PM (62%). All patients showed low-voltage areas (LVA) at electroanatomical map (97% epicardial or endoepicardial); of them, 25 (20%) had wide borderzone (WBZ, constituting >50% of the whole LVA). VT recurrences were documented in 25 patients (20%) by 12 months, and in 43 (34%) by last follow-up (median 63 months; interquartile range: 39 to 87). At multivariable analysis, AM stage was the only predictor of VT recurrences by 12 months (hazard ratio: 9.5; 95% confidence interval: 2.6 to 35.3; p < 0.001), whereas both AM stage and WBZ were associated with arrhythmia recurrences anytime during follow-up. No VT episodes were found after redo ablation was performed in 23 patients during PM stage. CONCLUSION Our findings suggest that VT ablation should be avoided during AM, but is often of benefit for recurrent VT after the acute phase of myocarditis.","output":"Inflammation as a Predictor of Recurrent Ventricular Tachycardia After Ablation in Patients With Myocarditis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As we approach the end of the second year of the pandemic, there is hope that 2022 will mark a return to normal life.

The incidence ranges from 3.5 to 5.6 depending on body area. Burns that cover a larger percentage of the total body surface area (TBSA), require skin graft surgeries, or necessitate pulmonary intensive care are well-researched risk factors for HO. Since burns initiate such complex pathophysiological processes with a variety of molecular signal changes, it is essential to focus on HO in the specific context of burn injury to define best practices for its treatment. There are numerous key players in the pathways of burn-induced HO, including neutrophils, monocytes, transforming growth factor-1-expressing macrophages and the adaptive immune system. The increased inflammation associated with burn injuries is also associated with pathway activation. Neurological and calcium-related contributions are also known. Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and vascularization are known to play key roles in burn-induced HO, with hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as potential initiators. Currently, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and radiotherapy are effective prophylaxes for HO. Limited joint motion, ankylosis and intolerable pain caused by burn-induced HO can be effectively tackled via surgery. Effective biomarkers for monitoring burn-induced HO occurrence and bio-prophylactic and bio-therapeutic strategies should be actively developed in the future.","output":"Burn-induced heterotopic ossification from incidence to therapy: key signaling pathways underlying ectopic bone formation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Health disparities have become apparent since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. When observing racial discrimination in healthcare, self-reported incidences, and perceptions among minority groups in the United States suggest that, the most socioeconomically underrepresented groups will suffer disproportionately in COVID-19 due to synergistic mechanisms. This study reports racially-stratified data regarding the experiences and impacts of different groups availing the healthcare system to identify disparities in outcomes of minority and majority groups in the United States. METHODS: Studies were identified utilizing PubMed, Embase, CINAHL Plus, and PsycINFO search engines without date and language restrictions. The following keywords were used: Healthcare, raci*, ethnic*, discriminant, hosti*, harass*, insur*, education, income, psychiat*, COVID-19, incidence, mortality, mechanical ventilation. Statistical analysis was conducted in Review Manager (RevMan V.5.4). Unadjusted Odds Ratios, P-values, and 95% confidence intervals were presented. RESULTS: Discrimination in the United States is evident among racial groups regarding medical care portraying mental risk behaviors as having serious outcomes in the health of minority groups. The perceived health inequity had a low association to the majority group as compared to the minority group (OR = 0.41; 95% CI = 0.22 to 0.78; P = .007), and the association of mental health problems to the Caucasian-American majority group was low (OR = 0.51; 95% CI = 0.45 to 0.58; P < .001). CONCLUSION: As the pandemic continues into its next stage, efforts should be taken to address the gaps in clinical training and education, and medical practice to avoid the recurring patterns of racial health disparities that become especially prominent in community health emergencies. A standardized tool to assess racial discrimination and inequity will potentially improve pandemic healthcare delivery.","output":"Understanding and Promoting Racial Diversity in Healthcare Settings to Address Disparities in Pandemic Crisis Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction The aim of the study was to characterize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on predoctoral and postdoctoral orthodontic education.

Hospital systems and medical practices have evolved to protect patients, physicians, and staff and conserve personal protective equipment and resources. Orthopaedic practices have been specifically affected by social distancing and stay at home guidelines, limiting in-office practice and elective surgery restrictions. This, in turn, has had an effect on resident education. Previous literature has been published regarding how academic programs have adjusted to these changes. However, the effects on smaller orthopaedic residencies with nonacademic faculty has not been discussed. The orthopaedic residency at Baylor University Medical Center of Dallas is a fifteen-resident program with a combination of hospital employed and private practice faculty. We adjusted our resident education in mid-March 2020 to keep residents safe while trying to maximize surgical and clinical education and outside research. GOALS: Our goals were to come up with a plan allowed for continuing high-level patient care and resident education while protecting residents and limiting burnout. MODEL: We devised a four-team system with five-day call periods. Interactions between teams were strictly minimized. We also moved to a web-based academic curriculum and devised a system for safe resident participation in surgical cases. The model has been adjusted based on attending and resident feedback. CONCLUSION: Until we develop effective treatments or vaccination for COVID-19, there is a possibility that it will be an ongoing threat. Resident education must also adapt to the changing environment while continuing to provide residents safe opportunities for patient care, didactic education, and research.

The extracted data included number of patients, age, type of hematological complication, duration of follow-up, response to treatment and prognosis. EXPERT OPINION Sixty five articles reported post-COVID hematologic complications. The most frequent hematologic complication in COVID-19 patients is thromboembolic events, which often occur in two forms: deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary emboli (PE). In a group of patients after the diagnosis of COVID-19, a significant decrease in platelets was observed, which was attributed to the ITP induced by COVID-19. Hemolytic anemia and aplastic anemia have also been reported rarely in patients. Finally, post-COVID hematologic complications appear to go beyond thromboembolic events.

Additionally, we explain our strategic plan aimed at minimizing the impact on clinical trial research activities, which included SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and IgG serological tests to all participants and personnel. The outcomes of the plan are described in terms of observed safety events and drop-outs during the study period. RESULTS: A total of 130 patients were participating in 16 active clinical trials in Fundaci ACE when the lockdown was established. During the confinement, we performed 1018 calls to the participants, which led to identify adverse events in 26 and COVID-19 symptoms in 6. A total of 83 patients (64%) could restart on-site visits as early as May 11, 2020. All SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR diagnostic tests performed before on-site visits were negative and only three IgG serological tests were positive. Throughout the study period, we only observed one drop-out, due to an adverse event unrelated to COVID-19.

Furthermore, we have scant information about how and to what degree contact with nature might protect mental health or mitigate worsening of mental health during the pandemic. We filled these gaps using a subset of a longitudinal study of n = 86 individuals in low-income, predominantly African American, neighborhoods in Detroit, MI, USA. The study addressed the following research questions: (1) did self-reported use and perceived value of nature change during, vs. prior to, the pandemic;(2) did perceived access to outdoor spaces buffer people against mental health issues such as stress, anxiety and depression symptoms;or (3) did objectively measured quality of nature views from home buffer people against mental health issues, taking into account relevant covariates and pandemic experiences (e.g., loss of employment, death of a friend/relative)? While attitudes to nature improved slightly from pre- to during the pandemic, we also observed significant decreases in most types of outdoor physical activity and passive enjoyment of nature (e.g., smelling plants/rain). We found a positive association between visibility of greenspace and perceived stress and anxiety, which not only contradicts previous research findings, but was especially surprising given that overall there was a decrease in perceived stress from 2019-2020. We did not detect associations between perceived access/use of nature and mental health. However, higher depressive symptoms were associated with exposure to more COVID-19-related stressors (lost employment, death of friends from COVID-19, etc.). Taken together, our results indicate that COVID-19 may serve to prolong or exacerbate mental health issues, rather than create them, in this population and that low quality greenspace may perhaps limit the ability for nature view to buffer mental health during the pandemic.","output":"Contact With Nature as a Mental Health Buffer for Lower Income Communities During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Influenza virus infection is associated with a high disease burden.

Furthermore, affective empathy's change rate was negatively correlated with sitting time in inactive group subjects, implying that staying at home with a few amounts of physical activity would contribute to treating empathy in young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Small Amounts of Physical Activity During the COVID-19 Pandemic May Contribute to Improve Empathy in Young Adults: An Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infects humans and dromedary camels and is responsible for an ongoing outbreak of severe respiratory illness in humans in the Middle East. Although some mutations found in camel-derived MERS-CoV strains have been characterized, most natural variation found across MERS-CoV isolates remains unstudied. We report on the environmental stability, replication kinetics, and pathogenicity of several diverse isolates of MERS-CoV, as well as isolates of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, to serve as a basis of comparison with other stability studies. Although most MERS-CoV isolates had similar stability and pathogenicity in our experiments, the camel-derived isolate C/KSA/13 had reduced surface stability, and another camel isolate, C/BF/15, had reduced pathogenicity in a small animal model. These results suggest that although betacoronaviruses might have similar environmental stability profiles, individual variation can influence this phenotype, underscoring the need for continual global viral surveillance.","output":"Surface?Aerosol Stability and Pathogenicity of Diverse Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Strains, 2012?2018"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To compare the safety and efficacy of percutaneous ultrasound guided gastrostomy (PUG) tube placement with traditional fluoroscopic guided percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement (PRG). METHODS: A prospective, observational, non-randomized cohort trial was performed comparing 25 consecutive patients who underwent PUG placement between April 2020 and August 2020 with 25 consecutive patients who underwent PRG placement between February 2020 and March 2020. Procedure time, sedation, analgesia requirements, and complications were compared between the two groups in non-inferiority analysis. RESULTS: Technical success rates were 96% in both groups (24/25) of procedures. Ninety-two percent of patients in the PUG cohort were admitted to the ICU at the time of G-tube request. Aside from significantly more COVID-19 patients in the PUG group (P < .001), there was no other statistically significant difference in patient demographics. Intra-procedure pain medication requirements were the same for both groups, 50 micrograms of IV fentanyl (P = 1.0). Intra-procedure sedation with IV midazolam was insignificantly higher in the PUG group 1.12 mg vs 0.8 mg (P = .355). Procedure time trended toward statistical significance (P = .076), with PRG being shorter than PUG (30.5  14.1 minutes vs 39.7  17.9 minutes). There were 2 non-device related major complications in the PUG group and 1 major and 1 minor complication in the PRG group. CONCLUSION: PUG is similar in terms of complications to PRG gastrostomy tube placement and a safe method for gastrostomy tube placement in the critically ill with the added benefits of bedside placement, elimination of radiation exposure, and expanded and improved access to care.","output":"Percutaneous Ultrasound Guided Gastrostomy Tube Placement: A Prospective Cohort Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has left severe impact on livelihood, security and health of informal sector workers, especially domestic workers, majority of whom are women. Being least organised and lacking institutional support, domestic workers are extremely vulnerable to exploitation and human rights violations, and the pandemic has aggravated the situation. Telephonic interviews were conducted with 260 domestic workers from three cities, namely Delhi, Mumbai and Kochi with focus on working conditions, livelihood and household dynamics, health scenario and state support during the pandemic. The data was substantiated with qualitative inputs from in-depth interviews conducted with 12 domestic workers across the cities. In the results, widespread job loss is reported among domestic workers during March?June 2020 along with drastically reduced income and increased workload. About 57% domestic workers reported stigma and discrimination at workplace, and 40% worked without any safety measures. Incidence of domestic violence at home, increased work burden at home, issues in access to health care, etc., were reported.

Most trials of COVID-19 vaccines excluded patients with active malignancies, and thus data on the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the vaccines in patients with cancer are currently limited. Given the risk posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, decisions regarding the use of vaccines against COVID-19 in patients participating in trials of investigational anticancer therapies need to be addressed promptly. Patients should not have to choose between enrolling on oncology clinical trials and receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. Clinical trial sponsors, investigators and treating physicians need operational guidance on COVID-19 vaccination for patients with cancer who are currently enrolled or might seek to enrol in clinical trials. Considering the high morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 in patients with cancer, the benefits of vaccination are likely to far outweigh the risks of vaccine-related adverse events. Herein, we provide operational COVID-19 vaccine guidance for patients participating in oncology clinical trials.

However, they are failing to offer balanced nutrition due to deficiencies of some essential compounds, macronutrients, and micronutrients, i.e., cereals are deficient in iron, zinc, some essential amino acids, and quality proteins. Meanwhile, the pulses are rich in anti-nutrient compounds that restrict the bioavailability of micronutrients. As a result, the population is suffering from malnutrition and resultantly different diseases, i.e., anemia, beriberi, pellagra, night blindness, rickets, and scurvy are common in the society. These facts highlight the need for the biofortification of cereals and pulses for the provision of balanced diets to masses and reduction of malnutrition. Biofortification of crops may be achieved through conventional approaches or new breeding techniques (NBTs). Conventional approaches for biofortification cover mineral fertilization through foliar or soil application, microbe-mediated enhanced uptake of nutrients, and conventional crossing of plants to obtain the desired combination of genes for balanced nutrient uptake and bioavailability. Whereas, NBTs rely on gene silencing, gene editing, overexpression, and gene transfer from other species for the acquisition of balanced nutritional profiles in mutant plants. Thus, we have highlighted the significance of conventional and NBTs for the biofortification of cereals and pulses. Current and future perspectives and opportunities are also discussed. Further, the regulatory aspects of newly developed biofortified transgenic and/or non-transgenic crop varieties via NBTs are also presented.","output":"Biofortification of Cereals and Pulses Using New Breeding Techniques: Current and Future Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This Tracker presents data on daily COVID-19 cases at the sub-national level for 26 European countries from January 2020 till present.

The aim of this study was to identify changes in suicide counts after their deaths. METHODS Suicide data were obtained from the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's public-use mortality file. A time-series analysis was performed, examining monthly suicide data by age group (?19, 20-44, 45-64 and ?65 years), for both men and women, for all suicide methods and for hanging versus non-hanging methods, from January 1999 to December 2018. Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving-average models were fitted to the pre-June 2018 period, estimating suicides in subsequent months and identifying deviations from expected values. The volume of Twitter posts about Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain was used as a proxy of societal attention. RESULTS Tweets about the celebrities were mainly concentrated in June 2018 and faded quickly in July. Total suicides exceeded the 95% confidence interval for June and approximated the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval in July. Over this 2-month span, there were 418 (95% confidence interval = [184, 652]) more suicides than expected, including 275 (95% confidence interval = [79, 471]) excess suicides in men and 182 (95% confidence interval = [93, 271]) in women. These equate to 4.8%, 4.1% and 9.1% increases above expected counts. There were 392 (95% confidence interval = [271, 514]) excess suicides by hanging, a 14.5% increase, with no significant increase in all other methods combined. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE These findings demonstrate that mortality following celebrity suicides can occur at a similar magnitude to that observed for other public health emergencies. They underscore the urgency for interventions to mitigate imitation effects after celebrity suicide reporting.","output":"Suicide mortality in the United States following the suicides of Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We develop a universal econometric formulation of the empirical power laws possibly driven by parameter heterogeneity.

The main assumption is that in the intermediate tail the empirical distribution approaches some heavy-tailed distribution with a positive extreme value index. In this setup the Hill estimator consistently estimates this extreme value index and, on a log-scale, extreme quantiles are consistently estimated. We discuss several model examples that satisfy our conditions and demonstrate in simulations how heterogeneity may generate the dynamics of empirical power laws.

The aim of our analysis was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical literature in terms of proportion of COVID-19-related published papers and temporal patterns of publications within a sample of general/internal medicine and cardiology journals. METHODS: We searched through PubMed scientific papers published from 1 January 2020 to 31 January 2021 about COVID-19 in ten major medical journals, of which five were in general/internal medicine and five in the cardiology field. We analyzed the proportion of COVID-19-related papers, and we examined temporal trends in the number of published papers. RESULTS: Overall, the proportion of COVID-19-related papers was 18.5% (1986/10a756). This proportion was higher among the five selected general/internal medicine journals, compared with cardiology journals (23.8% vs 9.5%). The vast majority of papers were not original articles; in particular, in cardiology journals, there were 28% 'original articles', 17% 'review articles' and 55.1% 'miscellaneous', compared with 20.2%, 5.1% and 74.7% in general/internal medicine journals, respectively.

The treatment through the combination of ribavirin and pegylated interferon is expensive, only mildly effective, and is associated with severe side effects. In 2011, two direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs, boceprevir and telaprevir, were licensed that have shown enhanced sustained virologic response (SVR) in phase III clinical trial, however, these interferon-free treatments are more sensitive to HCV genotype 1 infection. The variable nature of HCV, and the limited number of inhibitors developed thus aim in expanding the repertoire of available drug targets, resulting in targeting the virus assembly therapeutically. AIM: We conducted this study to predict the 3D structure of the p7 protein from the HCV genotypes 3 and 4. Approximately 63 amino acid residues encoded in HCV render this channel sensitive to inhibitors, making p7 a promising target for novel therapies. HCV p7 protein forms a small membrane known as viroporin, and is essential for effective self-assembly of large channels that conduct cation assembly and discharge infectious virion particles. METHOD: In this study, we screened drugs and flavonoids known to disrupt translation and production of HCV proteins, targeted against the active site of p7 residues of HCV genotype 3 (GT3) (isolatek3a) and HCV genotype 4a (GT4) (isolateED43). Furthermore, we conducted a quantitative structureCactivity relationship and docking interaction study. RESULTS: The drug NB-DNJ formed the highest number of hydrogen bond interactions with both modeled p7 proteins with high interaction energy, followed by BIT225. A flavonoid screen demonstrated that Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), nobiletin, and quercetin, have more binding modes in GT3 than in GT4. Thus, the predicted p7 protein molecule of HCV from GT3 and GT4 provides a general avenue to target structure-based antiviral compounds. CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that the inhibitors of viral p7 identified in this screen may be a new class of potent agents, but further confirmation in vitro and in vivo is essential. This structure-guided drug design for both GT3 and GT4 can lead to the identification of drug-like natural compounds, confirming p7 as a new target in the rapidly increasing era of HCV.","output":"Computational Docking Study of p7 Ion Channel from HCV Genotype 3 and Genotype 4 and Its Interaction with Natural Compounds"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Narkoseger?te dienen der Zufuhr von Atemgasen und Inhalationsan?sthetika.

Children and adolescents are especially vulnerable to suffering psychological effects as result of such measures. In Spain, children were enforced to a strict home lockdown for 42 days during the first wave. Here, we studied the effects of lockdown in children and adolescents through an online questionnaire. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Spain using an open online survey from July (after the lockdown resulting from the first pandemic wave) to November 2020 (second wave). We included families with children under 16 years-old living in Spain. Parents answered a survey regarding the lockdown effects on their children and were instructed to invite their children from 7 to 16 years-old (mandatory scholar age in Spain) to respond a specific set of questions. Answers were collected through an application programming interface system, and data analysis was performed using R. Results: We included 1,957 families who completed the questionnaires, covering a total of 3,347 children. The specific children's questionnaire was completed by 167 kids (7C11 years-old), and 100 adolescents (12C16 years-old). Children, in general, showed high resilience and capability to adapt to new situations. Sleeping problems were reported in more than half of the children (54%) and adolescents (59%), and these were strongly associated with less time doing sports and spending more than 5 h per day using electronic devices. Parents perceived their children to gain weight (41%), be more irritable and anxious (63%) and sadder (46%). Parents and children differed significantly when evaluating children's sleeping disturbances. Conclusions: Enforced lockdown measures and isolation can have a negative impact on children and adolescent's mental health and well-being. In future waves of the current pandemic, or in the light of potential epidemics of new emerging infections, lockdown measures targeting children, and adolescents should be reconsidered taking into account their infectiousness potential and their age-specific needs, especially to facilitate physical activity and to limit time spent on electronic devices.","output":"How Did the COVID-19 Lockdown Affect Children and Adolescent's Well-Being: Spanish Parents, Children, and Adolescents Respond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Asymptomatic transmission of the coronavirus disease 2019 is an important topic.

Cholesterol depletion impairs virus assembly and infectivity. This study examined the effects of exogenous cholesterol addition (delivered as a complex with methyl beta cyclodextrin) on the production of Molony murine leukemia virus retroviral vector and HIV-1-based lentiviral vector pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G). Cholesterol supplementation before and during vector production enhanced the infectivity of retroviral and lentiviral vectors up to 4-fold and 6-fold, respectively. In contrast, the amount of retroviral vector produced was unchanged, and that of lentiviral vector was increased less than two-fold. Both free cholesterol and cholesterol ester content in 293-gag-pol producer cells increased with cholesterol addition. In contrast, the phospholipids headgroup composition was essentially unchanged by cholesterol supplementation in 293-gag-pol packaging cells. Based on these results, it is proposed that cholesterol supplementation increases the infectivity of VSV-G-pseudotyped retroviral and lentiviral vectors, possibly by altering the composition of the producer cell membrane where the viral vectors are assembled and bud, and/or by changing the lipid composition of the viral vectors.","output":"Cholesterol Supplementation During Production Increases the Infectivity of Retroviral and Lentiviral Vectors Pseudotyped with the Vesicular Stomatitis Virus Glycoprotein (VSV-G)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid spread of COVID-19 has demonstrated the need for accurate information to contain its spread. Technological solutions are a complement that can help citizens to be informed about the risk in their environment. Although measures such as contact traceability have been successful in some countries, their use raises some societal concerns. The current challenge is how to track people infected by coronaviruses that can spread the disease. How can this be done while maintaining privacy? This paper proposes a variation of the consensus processes in networks to collaboratively build a risk map by sharing information with trusted contacts. These contacts are the people we would notify of being infected: close relatives, colleagues at work, or friends. The information spreads in an aggregate way through the network. When the process converges, each participant has the risk value calculated for the different zones. The structure of the connections among close contacts generates a network that allows the process to work correctly with barely 20% of the population involved, instead of the values estimated for the tracking apps, which need 60% participation. ? 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"Consensus for Collaborative Creation of Risk Maps for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research proposes a differential evolution-based regression framework for forecasting one day ahead price of Bitcoin.

The sum of these projections constitutes the final forecast. For accurate predictions, the PRI coefficients and tuning of the hyperparameters of SVR must be precisely estimated. Differential evolution, a metaheuristic optimization technique, helps to achieve these goals.

SARS-CoV-2 targets the respiratory system, resulting in symptoms such as fever, headache, dry cough, dyspnea, and dizziness. These symptoms vary from person to person, ranging from mild to hypoxia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sometimes death. Although not confirmed, phylogenetic analysis suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may have originated from bats; the intermediary facilitating its transfer from bats to humans is unknown. Owing to the rapid spread of infection and high number of deaths caused by SARS-CoV-2, most countries have enacted strict curfews and the practice of social distancing while awaiting the availability of effective U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications and/or vaccines. This review offers an overview of the various types of coronaviruses (CoVs), their targeted hosts and cellular receptors, a timeline of their emergence, and the roles of key elements of the immune system in fighting pathogen attacks, while focusing on SARS-CoV-2 and its genomic structure and pathogenesis. Furthermore, we review drugs targeting COVID-19 that are under investigation and in clinical trials, in addition to progress using mesenchymal stem cells to treat COVID-19. We conclude by reviewing the latest updates on COVID-19 vaccine development.

However, data regarding the diagnosis, clinical course, treatment, and outcomes of these patients is sparse. In particular, the ability to successfully detect SARS-CoV-2 in patients with HM remains unknown. We have previously reported 2 cases of allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) diagnosed with COVID-19 using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) technique, following multiple negative nasopharyngeal RT-PCR testing (Niu et al. Bone Marrow Transplantation - Nature). Here we examine 29 patients with a variety of HM with high suspicion for COVID-19 based on clinical presentation, lab results, and imaging, whom were tested with CRISPR and/or RT-PCR based techniques. From 3/31/20 to 7/17/20, 29 patients (age 24 to 82) with a variety of HM (20 lymphoid, 9 myeloid; Table 1), 24 of which presented with an undiagnosed respiratory illness and 5 presented while asymptomatic for testing prior to chemotherapy, were evaluated for COVID-19. While 16 patients tested positive for COVID-19 with guideline-directed nasopharyngeal RT-PCR testing (including the 5 asymptomatic patients), 13 patients tested negative with the same technique. However, based on their clinical history, imaging, and disease course, concern for COVID-19 infection remained in these 13 patients. We then used CRISPR technology available at our institution (Huang et al. Biosensors and Bioelectronics) to test 8 patients who initially tested negative by RT-PCR. Surprisingly, 7 of the 8 patients tested positive for COVID-19 with either a blood sample and/or nasal swab for the SARS-CoV-2 specific N gene and ORF1ab gene. Excluding the patients who were negative by RT-PCR and not tested by CRISPR, the rate of false negativity with RT-PCR testing is significantly elevated at 29% (7/24) in our cohort of HM, which compares unfavorably with the expected false negative rates of RT-PCR techniques. A very high fatality rate was observed with 9 out of the 29 patients (31%) ultimately dying. Fifteen patients were undergoing active chemotherapy, 4 had received an autologous SCT, 6 had received an allogeneic SCT, and 4 were on surveillance. Of the 23 COVID-19 positive patients (by RT-PCR or CRISPR), 8 patients received COVID-19-directed therapy with either hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin, remdesivir, and/or Covid-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) depending on their clinical status, and 4 patients expired. Of the 8 treated patients, 7 improved while 1 patient expired. For the 5 patients who were negative for RT-PCR with no CRISPR completed, 1 patient received hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin proactively due to symptoms and imaging and recovered, while 3 patients expired at outside facilities due to unknown causes. Breakdown of testing and treatment is shown in Fig. 1. The majority of our patients had undergone SCT or were actively on chemotherapy, notably lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Associated with the fact that COVID-19 is known to worsen lymphopenia, our patient's symptoms and immune response to COVID-19 is likely to differ from immunocompetent hosts. This translated into an overall worse outcome as seen by the high mortality with our patients. In our limited dataset, patients presented with a variety of symptoms ranging from asymptomatic to acute respiratory failure. Intriguingly, the 5 asymptomatic patients had lymphoid malignancies and were on chemotherapy. It is thus imperative to establish the diagnosis of COVID-19 quickly, as faster initiation of treatment has been associated with better outcomes. The 8 patients who were diagnosed and treated improved substantially. However, as seen by our dataset, a strikingly high false negative rate was observed. Thus, a high clinical suspicion must guide further workup and therapy in patients with HM who present with an undiagnosed respiratory illness consistent with COVID-19. Patients with HM can have a wide variety of presentations when infected with COVID-19. For this select patient population we must establish an algorithm to diagnose COVID-19 efficiently as we reported a high number of initial false negative COVID-19 tests before the more sensitive CRISPR revealed a positive test. In addition, treatment pathways need to be instituted to not only treat COVID-19 infection, but also provide the best treatment for these patient's underlying HM.

At this adult CF service, much of the CF multidisciplinary team (MDT) were re-deployed and the CF ward, ambulatory care and outpatients were closed. However, a small team remained, including the nurse specialists (CF-CNS). The CF-CNSs quickly adapted their role and as well as providing support and advice by phone and email, they implemented an emergency service in an area previously not used for this to ensure patients did not feel abandoned, provide treatment for exacerbation and prevent disease decline. Methods: All patient contacts and reasons for contact were recorded. QI methodology was used (Plan, Do, Study, Act) alongside process mapping to design the emergency service. Success was measured by the reduction in number of contacts and the number of patients reviewed with or without intervention in the emergency service. Results: In the first two weeks of the emergency service the CF-CNSs had assessed (by phone), reviewed (face-to-face) and consequently started two patients on home intravenous antibiotics. Twelve weeks later, 36 patients had been taken through the same process, medically reviewed  intervention. There were 1,187 patient contacts in March (mostly related to COVID-19, unwell, medication), 904 in April and 870 in May (related to blood test results, unwell, medication).

The currently available vaccine (inactivated bacterin in oil base) is not effective in preventing pathogen shedding and is rarely used to control Johnes disease in dairy herds. To develop a better vaccine that can prevent the spread of Johnes disease, we utilized polyanhydride nanoparticles (PAN) to encapsulate mycobacterial antigens composed of whole cell lysate (PAN-Lysate) and culture filtrate (PAN-Cf) of M. paratuberculosis. These nanoparticle-based vaccines (i.e., nanovaccines) were well tolerated in mice causing no inflammatory lesions at the site of injection. Immunological assays demonstrated a substantial increase in the levels of antigen-specific T cell responses post-vaccination in the PAN-Cf vaccinated group as indicated by high percentages of triple cytokine (IFN-, IL-2, TNF-) producing CD8(+) T cells. Following challenge, animals vaccinated with PAN-Cf continued to produce significant levels of double (IFN-, TNF-) and single cytokine (IFN-) secreting CD8(+) T cells compared with animals vaccinated with an inactivated vaccine. A significant reduction in bacterial load was observed in multiple organs of animals vaccinated with PAN-Cf, which is a clear indication of protection.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Thirteen predefined basic information items to communicate to a user, including who should be tested, when and how testing should be done, test accuracy, and interpretation of results. RESULTS: Many websites did not provide the name or manufacturer of the test (32/41; 78%), when to use the test (10/41; 24%), test accuracy (12/41; 29%), and how to interpret results (21/41; 51%). Sensitivity and specificity were the most commonly reported test accuracy measures (either reported for 27/41 [66%] tests): we could only link these figures to manufacturers documents or publications for four (10%) tests. Predictive values, most relevant to users, were rarely reported (five [12%] tests reported positive predictive values).

The virus infection causes fever, brain encephalitis among the young children below 14 yrs of age. In recent past, several outbreaks and deaths among children were reported from in India. There are no targeted drugs or vaccines available against CHPV and symptomatic treatments are the only option. In this background, we aimed to investigate the inhibitory effects of some priviously known viral RNA polymerase inhibitor drugs on CHPV replication. First, we examined remdesivir, which is known to inhibit HCV, Ebola and SARS-CoV-2 replication and close structural similarity along with conserved residues in the finger region of RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain is the basis of replication inhibition. Our results showed that remdesivir inhibits CHPV replication in vero E6 cells to a significant level. In this study we have also included non-nucleoside anti-retroviral inhibitor (NNRTI) drug nevirapine, and nucleoside inhibitor (NRTI) drug AZT (Zidovudine) to determine if these are also able to inhibit CHPV replication. Interestingly, we observed inhibition of CHPV replication by both nevirapine and AZT (in the order nevirapine>AZT), albeit to a lesser extent compared to remdesivir. We next performed molecular docking and modeling study to get an insight about the interactions of these drugs with CHPV polymerase protein. Modeling study predicts that remdesivir has most favourable CHPV polymerase binding energy among these three drugs. Both remdesivor and AZT binds near the polymerase active site through interctions with residues in finger and palm regions of RdRp. In contrast, nevirapine binds to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the RdRp. In summary, we found remdesivir as a potent inhibitor of CHPV. A combination therapy including remdesivir, nevirapine and AZT may be a better drug cocktail to treat CHPV disease.

Most participants indicated that in the future, they would prefer to combine classic classroom and e-learning (N = 1403; 55.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Most health sciences students were satisfied with the exclusive e-learning, as well as their personal and institutional adjustment to it. Students feedback can help institutions to improve the exclusive e-learning experience for students in the time of the pandemic.

Some work, with animals infected with foot-and-mouth disease virus, has suggested that the technique might be used to identify animals in the early stages of disease. In this study, images of 19 healthy cattle have been taken over an extended period to determine hoof and especially coronary band temperatures (a common site for the development of FMD lesions) and eye temperatures (as a surrogate for core body temperature) and to examine how these vary with time and ambient conditions. RESULTS: The results showed that under UK conditions an animal's hoof temperature varied from 10C to 36C and was primarily influenced by the ambient temperature and the animal's activity immediately prior to measurement. Eye temperatures were not affected by ambient temperature and are a useful indicator of core body temperature. CONCLUSIONS: Given the variation in temperature of the hooves of normal animals under various environmental conditions the use of a single threshold hoof temperature will be at best a modest predictive indicator of early FMD, even if ambient temperature is factored into the evaluation.","output":"Normal variation in thermal radiated temperature in cattle: implications for foot-and-mouth disease detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this chapter, we will review monophasic and recurrent demyelinating disorders in children.

Suboptimal infection control practices have been identified as important risk factors. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a questionnaire to holistically assess the preventive practices of health care workers related to COVID-19 and identify the reasons for shortcomings therein. METHODS: The development of the questionnaire involved item generation through literature review, focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with health care workers and experts, followed by validation through expert opinion, pilot testing and survey. A cross-sectional survey on 147 healthcare workers was done using an online platform and/or interviews in August 2020 in New Delhi, India. Exploratory factor analysis using principal component extraction with varimax rotation was performed to establish construct validity. Internal consistency of the tool was tested using Cronbach's alpha coefficient. RESULTS: The developed questionnaire consists of two sections: Section A contains 29 items rated on a five-point Likert scale to assess preventive practices and Section B contains 27 semi-structured items to assess reasons for suboptimal practices. The first section has good validity (CVRa?=a?0.87, S-CVI/Ava?=a?0.978) and internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha coefficienta?=a?0.85) CONCLUSIONS: This questionnaire is a valid and reliable tool for holistic assessment of preventive practices and barriers to it among health care workers. It will be useful to identify vulnerable practices and sections in health care settings which would assist policymakers in designing appropriate interventions for infection prevention and control.

These COVID-19 mitigation techniques had a large impact on policing, as they created a new crime category for police to enforce, COVID-19 public health violations. The current study aims to address some of the uninvestigated questions about policing a pandemic using a unique dataset that combines three sources of official data from San Antonio, Texas. Specifically, we examine the associations between enforcement of COVID-19 public health violations, police calls for service, and COVID-19 case numbers. We also test for interactions between COVID-19 case numbers and police calls for service with respect to a change in the enforcement of COVID-19 public health violations. Results indicate that both police calls for service and COVID-19 case numbers are significantly associated with enforcement activities for COVID-19 public health violations. Additionally, enforcement is conditioned by the amount and type of police calls for service. Policymakers should consider the work and responsibilities the agencies they expect to enforce these COVID-19 policies already have. Haphazardly assigning an agency, such as the police, this new role without carefully considering whether they can feasibly take on more could lead to less enforcement of the COVID-19 restrictions.

BACKGROUND: Relieving the pressure of hospital staff through exposure to hospital outdoor rest space is essential, but there is a scarcity of research on the impact of hospital outdoor rest space on the eye movement measures and self-rating restoration of staff, especially for large Chinese hospitals. METHODS: Cross-analysis was conducted based on the eye movement measures of 76 staff members obtained by eye movement tracking equipment in combination with the self-rating restoration scale and hospital outdoor rest space picture attributes (element proportion and position, brightness and saturation). RESULTS: The differences in eye movement measures of different staff attributes (occupation, age, and gender) were identified, and the effects of hospital outdoor rest space picture attributes on the eye movement measures and self-rating restoration scale of staff were summarized. A number of proposals were also formulated: hospital outdoor rest space should be set up close to the working area of the group of medical staff; attention should be paid to the actual needs of senior staff members and the work pressure of junior nurses; the exposure to natural environment should be increased and the proportion of hard artificial elements should be reduced; the natural environment should be placed in the visual center; the saturation and brightness of hospital outdoor rest space should be increased; and staff members should have access to the sky environment in a variety of ways. CONCLUSION: The present study is an empirical study of evidence-based design on hospital outdoor rest space in China, and the results reveal the effects of hospital outdoor rest space on the eye movement measures and self-rating restoration of staff.","output":"Influence of Hospital Outdoor Rest Space on the Eye Movement Measures and Self-Rating Restoration of Staff"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In a recent paper, the authors Jamal et al reviewed various guidelines published by dental societies of the world for the prevention of transmission of COVID-19 virus in the dental care setting during the current pandemic(Jamal et al., 2020).

It exhibits wide range of biological properties applicable in medicine, the food industry, and cosmetics. Chemically, propolis is a complex and variable mixture with more than 300 identified biologically active components. Propolis's many health-promoting effects are attributed to different biochemical mechanisms, mediated by often-concerted actions of some of its many constituents. Propolis is considered safe and biocompatible. Yet due to its intrinsic complexity, standardization of propolis preparations for medical use as well as prediction of e.g. pathogen-specific interactions becomes a non-trivial task. In this work we demonstrate a new physical mechanism of propolis action, largely independent of specific nuances of propolis chemistry, which may underlie some of its biological actions. We show that propolis-bearing surfaces generate an extensive exclusion zone (EZ) water layer. EZ is an interfacial region of water capable of excluding solutes ranging from ions to microorganisms. Propolis-generated EZ may constitute an effective barrier, physically disabling the approach of various pathogens to the propolis-functionalized surfaces.

Recent animal studies were unable to reflect this clinical pathophysiological process, largely hampering the development of new efficacious therapies. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM-2) is a novel immune regulator with multiple activities. However, very little is known about the regulatory role of TREM-2 in sepsis upon aging. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from septic patients within 24ahours after Intensive Care Unit admission. The patients were preselected into two groups based on the age (age with &#8805; 60 years old and age with < 60 years old). Sepsis in aged mice was induced by cecal ligation and puncture. The expression of TREM-2 was evaluated in septic patients and aged septic mice. Aged macrophages overexpressing TREM-2 and green fluorescent protein (GFP) were administered to aged septic mice after cecal ligation and puncture. Survival rate was monitored, and bacterial load and inflammatory mediators levels were evaluated. In vivo IL-23 function was blocked using appropriate monoclonal antibodies. RESULTS: The expression levels of TREM-2 were downregulated in both aged septic patients and aged septic mice. The administration of TREM-2-overexpressing macrophages significantly prolonged survival and alleviated organ injury in the aged septic mice. The protective effect did not affect host bacterial burden, but markedly inhibited the host IL-17A response, as determined by a multiplex cytokine assay. Screening the expression of IL-17A-related activating factors revealed that the IL-23 level in TREM-2-overexpressing macrophages was significantly lower than that in GFP-expressing macrophages. Blocking IL-23 after the administration of GFP-expressing macrophages protected aged mice against sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: TREM-2 prolonged survival of aged mice from sepsis by finely modulating the IL-23/IL-17A immune pathway. These results provide previously unidentified mechanistic insight into immune regulation by TREM-2 and new therapeutic targets in sepsis upon aging.","output":"Triggering Receptor Expressed On Myeloid Cells-2 Protects Aged Mice Against Sepsis By Mitigating The Il-23/Il-17A Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To study short-term (<90 days) morbidity and mortality following radical cystectomy (RC) for bladder cancer and identify modifiable risk factors associated with these.

PubMed and EMBASE were searched for relevant papers on 11 June 2019 and rerun on 27 May 2020. Studies reporting complications, reoperations, length of stay and mortality within 90 days were included. Studies were reviewed according to criteria from the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine and the quality of evidence was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RESULTS The search retrieved 1957 articles. Sixty-six articles were included. The quality of evidence was poor to good. Most studies were retrospective, and no randomised clinical trials were identified. Of included studies a median of 6 Martin criteria for reporting complications after surgery were fulfilled. The Clavien-Dindo classification for grading complications was most frequently used. The weighted overall complication rate after RC was 34.9% (range 28.8-68.8) for in-house complications, 39.0% (range 27.3-80.0) for 30-day complications and 58.5% (range 36.1-80.5) for 90-day complications. The most common types of complications reported were gastrointestinal (29.0%) and infectious (26.4%). The weighted mortality rate was 2.4% (range 0.9-4.7) for in-house mortality, 2.1% (0.0-3.7) for 30-day mortality and 4.7% (range 0.0-7.0) for 90-day mortality. Age and comorbidity were identified as the best predictors for complications following RC. CONCLUSION Short-term morbidity and mortality are high following RC. Reporting of complications is heterogeneous and the quality of evidence is generally low.

Leaves of affected plants showed interveinal leaf chlorosis, net yellow, chlorotic sectors, mottling, blisters, vein enation, necrotic intervention, and narrowing symptoms. The Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV) was suspected of to be involved in this disease. Forty plant samples from symptomatic eggplants and 10 leaf samples with no symptoms were collected. The samples were tested by double antibody sandwich ELISA (DAS-ELISA) using AMV-IgG. Six of the 40 symptomatic leaf samples tested positive for AMV, while, DAS-ELISA found no AMV in the 10 leaf samples without symptoms. The AMV Egyptian isolate (AMV-Eggplant-EG) was biologically isolated from the six positive samples tested by DAS-ELISA and from the similar local lesions induced on Chenopodium amaranticolor and then re-inoculated in healthy Solanum melongena as a source of AMV-Eggplant-EG and confirmed by DAS-ELISA. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay with a pair of primers specific for coat protein (CP) encoding RNA 3 of AMV yielded an amplicon of 666 bp from infected plants of Solanum melongena with AMV-Eggplant-EG. The amplified PCR product was cloned and sequenced. Analysis of the AMV-Eggplant-EG sequence revealed 666 nucleotides (nt) of the complete CP gene (translating 221 amino acid (aa) residues). Analysis of phylogeny for nt and deduced aa sequences of the CP gene using the maximum parsimony method clustered AMV-Eggplant-EG in the lineage of Egyptian isolates (shark-EG, mans-EG, CP2-EG, and FRE-EG) with a high bootstrap value of 88% and 92%, respectively. In addition to molecular studies, melatonin (MTL) and salicylic acid (SA) (100 M) were used to increase the resistance of eggplant to AMV- infection. Foliar spray with MLT and SA caused a significant increase in the morphological criteria (shoot, root length, number of leaves, leaf area, and leaf biomass), chlorophyll and carotenoid content, antioxidant enzymes, and gene expression of some enzymes compared to the infected plants. On the other hand, treatment with MLT and SA reduced the oxidative damage caused by AMV through the reduction of hydrogen peroxide, superoxide anions, hydroxyl radicals, and malondialdehyde.

This study aims to determine the risk for depressive symptoms in pregnant and non-pregnant women during COVID-19, and to identify its bio-psycho-social contributors. A total of 1114 pregnant and 256 non-pregnant women were recruited via social media in May 2020 to complete an online survey that included depression and anxiety questionnaires, as well as demographic, obstetric and COVID-19-related questionnaires. Pregnant women also completed the Pandemic-Related Pregnancy Stress Scale (PREPS). Pregnant women reported fewer depressive symptoms and were less concerned that they had COVID-19 than non-pregnant women. Among pregnant women, risk factors for depression included lower income, fewer children, unemployment, thinking that one has COVID-19, high-risk pregnancy, earlier gestational age, and increased pregnancy-related stress. Protective factors included increased partner support, healthy behaviors, and positive appraisal of the pregnancy. Thus, being pregnant is associated with reduced risk for depressive symptoms during the pandemic. Increased social support, engaging in health behaviors and positive appraisal may enhance resilience.

Nine Hungarian medical societies have developed a consensus recommendation on the preferred normal range of vitamin D, the dose of vitamin D supplementation and the method of administration. They summarized the clinical conditions and diseases the development of which may be associated with vitamin D deficiency (VDD). VDD is extremely common in Hungary, especially in late winter. The lower limit of the recommended normal range is 75 nmol/l, although the clinical significance of deficiency is evident mainly at values below 50 nmol/l, but since vitamin D supplementation at the recommended dose is safe, it is worthwhile for everyone to reduce the health risk associated with VDD. The aim of vitamin D supplementation is to prevent deficiency. The recommended normal range is 75-125 nmol/l, above which there is no clear benefit of vitamin D supplementation. To maintain the normal range, a daily intake of 2000 IU in adults is recommended during the UV-B radiation-free period. Vitamin D supplementation is also recommended for children during the same periods and conditions as for adults, but the dose varies with age. In adults, vitamin D3 supplementation at daily, weekly and monthly intervals is equally effective and safe. In severe deficiency, a loading dose is recommended, followed by maintenance supplementation. In addition to the well-known skeletal, immunological and oncological effects of VDD, more and more data support unfavorable gynecological and obstetric effects. The process of building the consensus has met the requirements of the latest Delphi criteria.

DESIGN: An umbrella review of systematic reviews was undertaken using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methods. DATA SOURCES: The Cochrane database of systematic reviews, JBI Evidence Synthesis, MEDLINE, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Embase and CINAHL were searched in March 2021 for reviews published in English. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Systematic reviews reporting the prevalence of anxiety and depression among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Two researchers screened each abstract and independently reviewed full text articles. Study quality was assessed using the JBI critical appraisal tool for systematic reviews, and the degree of overlap in primary studies was calculated. RESULTS: Ten systematic reviews (100 unique studies), including 169 157 HCWs from 35 countries were included. The prevalence of anxiety among all HCWs ranged from 22.2% (95% CI 21.3% to 23.1%) to 33.0% (95% CI 31.9% to 34.1%). The prevalence of anxiety among physicians (n=5820) was reported to be between 17% and 19.8% and for nurses (n=14 938) between 22.8% and 27%. The prevalence of depression among all HCWs ranged from 17.9% (95% CI 17.1% to 18.8%) to 36% (95% CI 34.9% to 37.1%). The prevalence of depression among physicians (n=643) and nurses (n=8063) was reported to be 40.4% and 28%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: There is wide variation evident in the presence of anxiety and depression among HCWs. In particular, the prevalence of depression among physicians was high.

A major challenge of RNAi therapeutics is the endosomal entrapment of the delivered siRNA. In this study, we developed a family of delivery vehicles called Janus base nanopieces (NPs). They are rod-shaped nanoparticles formed by bundles of Janus base nanotubes (JBNTs) with RNA cargoes incorporated inside via charge interactions. JBNTs are formed by noncovalent interactions of small molecules consisting of a base component mimicking DNA bases and an amino acid side chain. NPs presented many advantages over conventional delivery materials. NPs efficiently entered cells via macropinocytosis similar to lipid nanoparticles while presenting much better endosomal escape ability than lipid nanoparticles; NPs escaped from endosomes via a \\"proton sponge\\" effect similar to cationic polymers while presenting significant lower cytotoxicity compared to polymers and lipids due to their noncovalent structures and DNA-mimicking chemistry. In a proof-of-concept experiment, we have shown that NPs are promising candidates for antiviral delivery applications, which may be used for conditions such as COVID-19 in the future.","output":"DNA-inspired nanomaterials for enhanced endosomal escape"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Obesity is a major risk factor for becoming seriously ill with the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19). One difficulty faced by clinicians and by patients is the unknown time frame of hospitalization until discharge of symptomatic patients. METHODS: We followed 34 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection who recovered fromthe infection. All diagnoses were given using semi-quantitative RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. Envelope protein gene (E), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene (RdRP), and nucleocapsid gene (N) were measured by RT-PCR. Weight was measured and height was self-reported. RESULTS: Mean  SD age was 51.8  16.7 years. Mean  SD body mass index (BMI) was 27.4  4.7 kg/m2. 26% (9/34) had obesity, with BMI above 30 kg/m2. Fifteen patients had BMI between 25 and 29.9 kg/m2. The mean length of hospital stay was longer for those with a BMI >25 kg/m2 (n = 24) than for those with a normal BMI (19.2 vs. 16.0 days, p = 0.08). Comparing people with obesity (BMI >30 kg/m2 or above) to those without obesity, the difference was larger (20.6 vs. 16.0 days, p = 0.06).

The objective of this study is to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological and emotional well-being of healthcare workers (HCWs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted an online, cross-sectional, multinational survey, assessing anxiety [using Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) Scale: GAD-2 and GAD-7], depression (using Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale), and insomnia (using Insomnia Severity Index Scale), among HCWs across India, the Middle East, and North America. We used univariate and bivariate logistic regression to identify risk factors for psychological distress. RESULTS: The prevalence of clinically significant anxiety, depression, and insomnia was 41.4%, 48.0%, and 31.3%, respectively. On bivariate logistic regression, lack of social or emotional support to HCWs was independently associated with anxiety [odds ratio (OR), 3.81 (2.84C3.90)], depression [OR, 6.29 (4.50C8.79)], and insomnia [OR, 3.79 (2.81C5.110]. Female gender and self-COVID-19 were independent risk factors for anxiety [OR, 3.71 (1.53C9.03) and 1.71 (1.23C2.38)] and depression [OR, 1.72 (1.27C2.31) and 1.62 (1.14C2.30)], respectively. Frontliners were independently associated with insomnia [OR, 1.68 (1.23C2.29)]. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic has a high prevalence of anxiety, depression, and insomnia among HCWs. Female gender, frontliners, self-COVID-19, and absence of social or emotional support are the independent risk factors for psychological distress.

The Pituitary Society surveyed its membership to understand planned approaches to glucocorticoid management in patients with adrenal insufficiency who will receive a COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: Members were asked to complete up to 3 questions regarding their planned approach for use of glucocorticoid replacement in patients with proven adrenal insufficiency. RESULTS: Surveys were sent to 273 members and 103 responded. Thirty-six percent plan to recommend that patients automatically increase glucocorticoid dosage with administration of the first vaccine injection. Of these, 84% plan to increase glucocorticoid dose on the day of vaccination, and 49% plan to increase glucocorticoid dose prior to vaccination. Of the 64% who do not plan to recommend automatic glucocorticoid dose increase with vaccine administration, 88% plan to increase the dose if the patient develops a fever, and 47% plan to increase the dose if myalgias and arthralgias occur. CONCLUSIONS: Most clinicians plan to maintain the current glucocorticoid dose with vaccine administration. The vast majority plan and to increase glucocorticoid dose in case of fever, and just under half in case of arthralgias and myalgias.

In multivariable analyses, black adults and those with lower health literacy were more likely to report less perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 (black adults: relative risk (RR) 1.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-2.44, p = 0.02; marginal health literacy: RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.26-3.07, p < 0.01). Individuals with low health literacy remained more likely to feel unprepared for the outbreak (RR 1.80, 95% CI 1.11-2.92, p = 0.02) and to express confidence in the federal government response (RR 2.11, 95% CI 1.49-3.00, p < 0.001) CONCLUSIONS: Adults at higher risk for COVID-19 continue to lack critical knowledge about prevention. While participants reported greater changes to daily routines and plans, disparities continued to exist in perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 and in preparedness. Public health messaging to date may not be effectively reaching vulnerable communities.","output":"Changes in COVID-19 Knowledge, Beliefs, Behaviors, and Preparedness Among High-Risk Adults from the Onset to the Acceleration Phase of the US Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Minimally invasive techniques to occlude flow within blood vessels, initially pioneered in the 1970s with autologous materials and subsequently advanced with increasingly sophisticated engineered biomaterials, are routinely performed for a variety of medical conditions.

The covid-19 pandemic is said to be originated from Wuhan of Hubei province in china. This statement has raised many questions and doubts about origin and spread of disease and the controversy is still going on. The geographical location of Wuhan in relation to sea is of significant value in relation to covid-19 pandemic as observed in this research. The city of Wuhan is located on both banks of the Changjiang (the Great River, a.k.a the Yangtze River) about six hundred miles upstream from Shanghai and the Pacific Ocean. It is about four hundred miles upstream from Nanjing. Its location is supremely strategic, being where the Hanshui (Han River) joins the Changjiang. The Wuhan Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market was in news and highlighted by several media and news agency as probable source of origin of covid-19. The Huanan Seafood Market located in Wuhan is a live animal and seafood market in Jianghan District, Wuhan City, and the capital of Hubei Province in Central China. Objective: This continuous observational research analysis aimed to assess the impact of geographical locations particularly coastal influence on the total/average/maximum/minimum confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in 36 states and union territories of India, during COVID-19 pandemic from the beginning of pandemic cases in January 2020 in India with special focus on coastal states and union territories of India. The coast is also known popularly as the coastline or seashore is the area where land meets the sea or ocean, or as a line that forms the boundary between the land and the ocean. The term coastal state and union territories is used to refer to a state where interactions of sea and land of states occur. The study also aims to find safest geographical location in covid-19 pandemic. Methods: : This is a novel cross-sectional mixed (quantitative and Qualitative) continuous observational research study. The information on the number of cases and deaths due to COVID-19 pandemic in 36 states and union territories of India is obtained from Health Department, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), Government of India, and data were matched and analyzed from online websites as well. The impact of geographical locations on the total/average/maximum/minimum confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in 36 states and union territories of India was analyzed with Microsoft office and with more data collection stata 15.1 for windows (64bit) will be used when required with Microsoft office in next version-3 of article (for bigger analysis) for epidemiological comparison by calculating incidence, prevalence, mortality rate and other indicators. The study for global correlation of this research is also under process by the author. For the purpose of research India is divided into four geographical areas, 1 Coastal states and union territories (total ten in numbers), 2 Island groups (three in numbers), 3 north eastern states and east area i.e. Laddakh 4 other states and union territories having plain areas (14 in numbers). Results: : The findings showed that total numbers of death from covid-19 is highest in coastal states and union territories with a count of 323674 since beginning of the pandemic whereas the islands group reported the lowest total 184 numbers of deaths from covid-19 as on 05 Jan 2022, 08:00 IST (GMT+5:30) . The average death from covid-19 is highest in coastal states and union territories group with a count of 32367.4 followed by other states and union territories group with a count of 10431.21429. The islands group reported the lowest average numbers of death from covid-19 with a count of 61.33. A similar trend was found for numbers of confirmed cases with coastal states on top having largest number of covid-19 cases. In this version 2 the prevalence rates are also calculated per 100000. Conclusions: : The research observation found that coastal states and u ion territories of India have larger number of daily cases of COVID-19 and mortality 867 per 100000 as compared to other geographical locations of the country. The observation also found that islands have least number of cases and deaths 115 per 100000 due to covid-19 pandemic. This study also gives rise to hypothesis that coastal locations are at greater risk of covid-19 infection and mortality whereas islands are safest places in covid-19 pandemics.","output":"What impacts have variation in geographical locations on the cases and deaths from COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in 36 states and union territories of India:-observational analysis in India between December 2019 and 05 January 2022 C V2 (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: We sought to identify clinical factors that predict extubation failure (reintubation) and its prognostic implications in critically ill COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective, multi-center cohort study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Multivariate competing risk models were employed to explore the rate of reintubation and its determining factors. RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-one extubated patients were included (mean age, 61.0 years [13.9]; 54.8% male). Reintubation occurred in 93 (33.1%). In multivariate analysis accounting for death, reintubation risk increased with age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.04 per 1-year increase, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02 -1.06), vasopressors (HR 1.84, 95% CI 1.04-3.60), renal replacement (HR 2.01, 95% CI 1.22-3.29), maximum PEEP (HR 1.07 per 1-unit increase, 95% CI 1.02 -1.12), paralytics (HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.08-2.25) and requiring more than nasal cannula immediately post-extubation (HR 2.19, 95% CI 1.37-3.50). Reintubation was associated with higher mortality (36.6% vs 2.1%; P < 0.0001) and risk of inpatient death after adjusting for multiple factors (HR 23.2, 95% CI 6.45-83.33). Prone ventilation, corticosteroids, anticoagulation, remdesivir and tocilizumab did not impact the risk of reintubation or death. CONCLUSIONS: Up to 1 in 3 critically ill COVID-19 patients required reintubation.

DATA SOURCES: Systematic searches in five databases performed between 1 January 2000 and 24 April 2020 for studies reporting on educational interventions in response to major viral epidemics. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: All studies on educational interventions developed, implemented and evaluated in response to major global viral outbreaks from 2000 to 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Healthcare workers. INTERVENTIONS: Educational or training interventions. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Descriptive information were extracted and synthesised according to content, competency category, educational methodology, educational effects and level of educational outcome. Quality appraisal was performed using a criterion-based checklist. RESULTS: A total of 15 676 records were identified and 46 studies were included. Most studies were motivated by the Ebola virus outbreak with doctors and nurses as primary learners. Traditional didactic methods were commonly used to teach theoretical knowledge. Simulation-based training was used mainly for training of technical skills, such as donning and doffing of personal protective equipment. Evaluation of the interventions consisted mostly of surveys on learner satisfaction and confidence or tests of knowledge and skills. Only three studies investigated transfer to the clinical setting or effect on patient outcomes.

In this study, we systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed longitudinal studies that examined mental health of the general population prior to and during the pandemic. Furthermore, we explored the long-term psychiatric implications of the pandemic with data from South Korea.

It has been reported that an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), losartan, decreases SUA level, whereas other ARBs, such as candesartan, have no lowering effect. Because the renal uric acid transporter (URAT1) is an important factor controlling the SUA level, we examined the involvement of URAT1 in those differential effects of various ARBs on SUA level at clinically relevant concentrations. This study was done by using URAT1-expressing Xenopus oocytes. Losartan, pratosartan, and telmisartan exhibited cis-inhibitory effects on the uptake of uric acid by URAT1, whereas at higher concentrations, only telmisartan did, and these ARBs reduced the uptake in competitive inhibition kinetics. On the other hand, candesartan, EXP3174 [2-n-butyl-4-chloro-1-[(2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yI)methyl]imidazole-5-carboxylic acid] (a major metabolite of losartan), olmesartan, and valsartan were not inhibitory. Preloading of those ARBs in the oocytes enhanced the URAT1-mediated uric acid uptake, showing a trans-stimulatory effect. The present study is a first demonstration of the differential effects of ARBs on URAT1 that some ARBs are both cis-inhibitory and trans-stimulatory, depending on concentration, whereas others exhibit either a trans-stimulatory or cis-inhibitory effect alone, which could explain the clinically observed differential effects of ARBs on SUA level. Furthermore, it was found that such differential effects of ARBs on URAT1 could be predicted from the partial chemical structures of ARBs, which will be useful information for the appropriate use and development of ARBs without an increase of SUA.","output":"Concentration-dependent mode of interaction of angiotensin II receptor blockers with uric acid transporter."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening emergency in children and adolescents with manifestation of type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1) and often associated with delayed diagnosis or previous diagnostic errors.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the DKA risk in children and adolescents with DM1 manifestation during the COVID-19 lockdown and associated risk factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The frequency of DKA at DM1 onset in patients <18 years between 13 March and 13 May 2020 in pediatric diabetes centers was analyzed. The centers also documented their assessment, if the presentation was delayed or the diagnosis was not made on the first medical consultation. In order to analyze the influence of the risk factors on the frequency of DKA, the data from 2020 were compared with the same periods in 2018 and 2019 using multivariable linear and logistic regression. RESULTS: The data of 532 patients from 216 diabetes centers showed that the risk for DKA increased by 84.7% and the risk for severe DKA increased by 45.3% compared to the years 2018/2019. Children <6 years had the highest risk with an 141.6% increase for DKA and 97.0% for severe DKA compared to the previous years. Migration background was a risk factor independent of COVID-19. Of the patients 31% had either a delayed presentation or a missed diagnosis. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 lockdown the frequency of DKA and severe DKA at DM1 onset was significantly increased for children and adolescents in Germany.

METHODS: A cross-sectional seroprevalence study with prospective recruitment of volunteer families that included at least one first-reported adult case positive by SARS-CoV-2 PCR and at least one child aged less than 15 years living in the same household under strict home confinement was conducted in the Health Region of metropolitan Barcelona (Spain) during the pandemic period April 28-June 3, 2020. All household members were tested at home by a rapid SARS-CoV-2 antibody assay in finger-prick obtained capillary blood. RESULTS: A total of 381 family households including 381 first-reported PCR-positive adult cases and 1,084 contacts (672 children, 412 adults) were enrolled. SARS-CoV-2 infection seroprevalence rates were 17.6% (118/672) in children and 18.7% (77/335) in adult contacts (p=0.64). Among first-reported cases, seropositivity rates varied from 84.0% in adults previously hospitalized and tested within 6 weeks since the first positive PCR result to 31.5% in those not hospitalized and tested after that lag time (p<0.001).

Exosomes are emerging as necessary mediators of the cross-talk between tumor cells and the microenvironment. However, the underlying mechanisms of exosomes involving into crosstalk between tumor cells and macrophages during disease progression of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) have not been fully realized yet. APPROACH & RESULTS: We found that the macrophages of ICC tumor tissues upregulated the expression levels of immunosuppressive molecule programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). Increased PD-L1+ macrophages in tumor tissues effectively suppressed T cell immunity and correlated with poor survival rates in ICC patients. High-throughput RNA sequencing analysis that was performed to identify differential levels of miRNAs between exosomes derived from ICC cells and primary human intrahepatic biliary epithelial cells (HIBEpiC) revealed that miR-183-5p was increased in ICC cell-derived exosomes. Exosomal miR-183-5p inhibited phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) expression, to subsequently affect the elevations on both phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) and PD-L1 expression in macrophages. Furthermore, macrophages that treated with ICC cell-derived exosomes significantly suppressed T cell immunity in vitro and contributed to the growth and progression of ICC in vivo, which were reversible through blockages on PD-L1 of these macrophages. Finally, clinical data showed that upregulated levels of plasma exosomal miR-183-5p correlated with poor prognosis of ICC patients after curative resection. CONCLUSION: Tumor-derived exosomal miR-183-5p upregulates PD-L1 expressing macrophages to foster immune suppression and disease progression in ICC through miR-183-5p/PTEN/AKT/PD-L1 pathway. Exosomal miR-183-5p is a potential predictive biomarker for ICC progression, and a potential target for development of novel therapeutic strategies against immune tolerance feature of ICC.","output":"Tumor-Derived Exosomes Induce Immunosuppressive Macrophages to Foster Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma Progression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this review is to provide a short update on whether treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) has beneficial or harmful effects in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 Epidemiological studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infects all age groups, presenting a higher incidence in elderly patients with various comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular diseases A large proportion of these patients are treated with ACEIs and ARBs Since it has been demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) as an entry point into host cells, it is important to know whether ACEIs and ARBs could modify the expression of this enzyme, and thus promote the viral infection Animal studies and a few studies in humans have shown that renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors increase tissue expression of ACE2, but with potentially beneficial effects In this context, it is imperative to provide appropriate guidance for clinicians and patients The major cardiology associations across the world have released statements in which they recommend healthcare providers and patients to continue their treatments for hyper-tension and heart failure as prescribed","output":"Cessation of Renin-Angiotensin System Antagonists during the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic - Do We Have the Evidences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Mesh is recommended for umbilical hernias with defects > 1 cm to reduce recurrence.

Available data included details about comorbidity, surgical technique, 90-day readmission, 90-day reoperation and operation for recurrence. RESULTS A total of 7849 patients were included, of whom 25.7% (2013/7849) underwent mesh repair. Reoperation for recurrence was significantly decreased after mesh repair 3.1% (95% C.I. 2.1-4.1) compared with suture repair 6.7% (95% C.I. 6.0-7.4), P < 0.001. Readmission and reoperation rates were significantly higher for mesh repair 7.9% (159/2013) and 2.6% (52/2013) than for suture repair 6.5% (381/5836) and 1.5% (89/5836), P = 0.036 and P = 0.002, respectively. Onlay mesh repairs had the lowest risk of recurrence 2.0% (95% C.I. 0.6-3.5), and readmission [7.9% (65/826)] and reoperation [3.9% (32/826)] rates within 90 days were comparable to suture repairs [6.5% (381/5836)] and [3.3% (192/5836)], P = 0.149 and P = 0.382, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Even for the smallest umbilical hernias, mesh repair significantly decreased the recurrence rate. Onlay mesh repair was associated with lowest risk of recurrence without increasing early complications.","output":"Suture or Mesh Repair of the Smallest Umbilical Hernias: A Nationwide Database Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper discusses the challenges faced by rural learners in South Africa in the context of the world pandemic commonly known as COVID-19. Rural learners face unprecedented challenges in adjusting to a new mode of life and learning, the latter being characterised by the predominant use of online, learning management systems and low-tech applications. The paper is informed by critical emancipatory research, which argues for social justice, empowerment and social inclusion of all learners in teaching and learning, with the aim of constructing better futures for all learners. To generate data, I used participatory action research. A total of 10 learners and five teachers participated via WhatsApp. The paper answers two questions: what are the learning challenges faced by rural learners in South Africa, and how can online learning be enhanced in the context of COVID-19? The findings suggest that, while the South African government is promoting online learning as the only alternative in the context of COVID-19, this mode excludes many rural learners from teaching and learning, due to a lack of resources to connect to the internet, the learning management system, and low-tech software. Based on the findings of this study, the paper argues that rural learners are critical stakeholders in education and in the fight against COVID-19, and they cannot be left behind in efforts to fight the pandemic. Values such as social justice and the rights of rural learners should not be foregone in the fight against COVID-19.","output":"Rural online learning in the context of COVID-19 in South Africa: Evoking an inclusive education approach/ Aprendizaje rural online en el contexto de COVID-19 en Sudfrica: Evocando un enfoque de educacin inclusiva"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper provides an ex-post analysis of the determinants of within-country regional heterogeneity of the labour market impact of COVID-19.

Delirium among critically ill COVID-19 patients is due at least in part to iatrogenic causes such as staffing constraints, restricted mobility, and polypharmacy stemming from drug shortages. The aim of this study was to describe the sedation practices and prevalence of delirium at a tertiary level academic medical center. We tested the hypothesis that polypharmacy (PP, use of  4 classes of sedatives), is a mediator in the causal pathway of mechanical ventilation and delirium. METHODS: 212 patients admitted to ICUs at a tertiary level academic medical center in Boston, MA between Jan 2020 and April 2021 with a primary diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 were included. Mediation analysis was conducted with bootstrap estimation to assess whether association between mechanical ventilation and incidence of delirium was mediated by PP. Analyses were adjusted for potential confounders found to be related to the treatment, mediator, and outcome, including age, gender, vasopressor use, median RASS scores, and maximum CRP levels. RESULTS: Of the 212 patients in the cohort, 72.6% had delirium during their ICU stay, 76.9% were mechanically ventilated, and 54.7% received  4 classes of sedatives. The percentage of patients given Opioids, Benzodiazepines, Ketamine, Propofol, and Dexmedetomidine, were 81.1%, 60.4%, 40.6%, 75.9%, and 54.3%, respectively. Adjusting for potential confounders, patients given  4 classes of sedatives had 7.4 (95% CI: 2.5 - 22.4) times the odds of developing delirium compared to those given < 4. Mechanically ventilated patients had 4.9 (95% CI: 1.6 - 15.2) times the odds of developing delirium compared to patients not mechanically ventilated. Approximately 42.1% (95% CI: 39.8 - 50.6) of the mechanical ventilation effect is attributed to the mediation of PP. CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical ventilation is associated with higher risk of delirium and PP mediates > 40% of this effect which is clinically and statistically significant. Prospective studies should explore whether limiting PP among mechanically ventilated patients could reduce delirium.","output":"Polypharmacy mediates the effect of mechanical ventilation on incidence of delirium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Impaired physical functioning is one of the most critical consequences associated with fibromyalgia, especially when there is comorbid obesity. Psychological factors are known to contribute to perceived (i.e., subjective) physical functioning. However, physical function is a multidimensional concept encompassing both subjective and objective functioning. The contribution of psychological factors to performance-based (i.e., objective) functioning is unclear. This study aims to investigate the contribution of pain catastrophizing and pain acceptance to both self-reported and performance-based physical functioning. In this cross-sectional study, 160 participants completed self-report measures of pain catastrophizing, pain acceptance, and pain severity. A self-report measure and a performance-based test were used to assess physical functioning. Higher pain catastrophizing and lower pain acceptance were associated with poorer physical functioning at both self-reported and performance-based levels. Our results are consistent with previous evidence on the association between pain catastrophizing and pain acceptance with self-reported physical functioning. This study contributes to the current literature by providing novel insights into the role of psychological factors in performance-based physical functioning. Multidisciplinary interventions that address pain catastrophizing and pain acceptance are recommended and might be effective to improve both perceived and performance-based functioning in women with FM and obesity.","output":"The Role of Pain Catastrophizing and Pain Acceptance in Performance-Based and Self-Reported Physical Functioning in Individuals with Fibromyalgia and Obesity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since its first reported case on January 30, the Philippines has reached 5,453 cases of COVID-19.

International travel also is increasing among U.S. residents. In 2009, U.S. residents made approximately 61 million trips outside the country, a 5% increase from 1999. Travel-related morbidity can occur during or after travel. Worldwide, 8% of travelers from industrialized to developing countries report becoming ill enough to seek health care during or after travel. Travelers have contributed to the global spread of infectious diseases, including novel and emerging pathogens. Therefore, surveillance of travel-related morbidity is an essential component of global public health surveillance and will be of greater importance as international travel increases worldwide. REPORTING PERIOD September 1997-December 2011. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM GeoSentinel is a clinic-based global surveillance system that tracks infectious diseases and other adverse health outcomes in returned travelers, foreign visitors, and immigrants. GeoSentinel comprises 54 travel/tropical medicine clinics worldwide that electronically submit demographic, travel, and clinical diagnosis data for all patients evaluated for an illness or other health condition that is presumed to be related to international travel. Clinical information is collected by physicians with expertise or experience in travel/tropical medicine. Data collected at all sites are entered electronically into a database, which is housed at and maintained by CDC. The GeoSentinel network membership program comprises 235 additional clinics in 40 countries on six continents. Although these network members do not report surveillance data systematically, they can report unusual or concerning diagnoses in travelers and might be asked to perform enhanced surveillance in response to specific health events or concerns. RESULTS During September 1997-December 2011, data were collected on 141,789 patients with confirmed or probable travel-related diagnoses. Of these, 23,006 (16%) patients were evaluated in the United States, 10,032 (44%) of whom were evaluated after returning from travel outside of the United States (i.e., after-travel patients). Of the 10,032 after-travel patients, 4,977 (50%) were female, 4,856 (48%) were male, and 199 (2%) did not report sex; the median age was 34 years. Most were evaluated in outpatient settings (84%), were born in the United States (76%), and reported current U.S. residence (99%). The most common reasons for travel were tourism (38%), missionary/volunteer/research/aid work (24%), visiting friends and relatives (17%), and business (15%). The most common regions of exposure were Sub-Saharan Africa (23%), Central America (15%), and South America (12%). Fewer than half (44%) reported having had a pretravel visit with a health-care provider. Of the 13,059 diagnoses among the 10,032 after-travel patients, the most common diagnoses were acute unspecified diarrhea (8%), acute bacterial diarrhea (5%), postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome (5%), giardiasis (3%), and chronic unknown diarrhea (3%). The most common diagnostic groupings were acute diarrhea (22%), nondiarrheal gastrointestinal (15%), febrile/systemic illness (14%), and dermatologic (12%). Among 1,802 patients with febrile/systemic illness diagnoses, the most common diagnosis was Plasmodium falciparum malaria (19%). The rapid communication component of the GeoSentinel network has allowed prompt responses to important health events affecting travelers; during 2010 and 2011, the notification capability of the GeoSentinel network was used in the identification and public health response to East African trypanosomiasis in Eastern Zambia and North Central Zimbabwe, P. vivax malaria in Greece, and muscular sarcocystosis on Tioman Island, Malaysia. INTERPRETATION The GeoSentinel Global Surveillance System is the largest repository of provider-based data on travel-related illness. Among ill travelers evaluated in U.S. GeoSentinel sites after returning from international travel, gastrointestinal diagnoses were most frequent, suggesting that U.S. travelers might be exposed to unsafe food and water while traveling internationally. The most common febrile/systemic diagnosis was P. falciparum malaria, suggesting that some U.S. travelers to malarial areas are not receiving or using proper malaria chemoprophylaxis or mosquito-bite avoidance measures. The finding that fewer than half of all patients reported having made a pretravel visit with a health-care provider indicates that a substantial portion of U.S. travelers might not be following CDC travelers' health recommendations for international travel. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION GeoSentinel surveillance data have helped researchers define an evidence base for travel medicine that has informed travelers' health guidelines and the medical evaluation of ill international travelers. These data suggest that persons traveling internationally from the United States to developing countries remain at risk for illness. Health-care providers should help prepare travelers properly for safe travel and provide destination-specific medical evaluation of returning ill travelers. Training for health-care providers should focus on preventing and treating a variety of travel-related conditions, particularly traveler's diarrhea and malaria.","output":"Surveillance for travel-related disease--GeoSentinel Surveillance System, United States, 1997-2011."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, the first cases of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were identified in the city of Wuhan, China. Since then, it has spread worldwide with new mutations being reported. The aim of the present study was to monitor the changes in genetic diversity and track non-synonymous substitutions (dN) that could be implicated in the fitness of SARS-CoV-2 and its spread in different regions between December 2019 and November 2020. We analyzed 2213 complete genomes from six geographical regions worldwide, which were downloaded from GenBank and GISAID databases. Although SARS-CoV-2 presented low genetic diversity, there has been an increase over time, with the presence of several hotspot mutations throughout its genome. We identified seven frequent mutations that resulted in dN substitutions. Two of them, C14408T>P323L and A23403G>D614G, located in the nsp12 and Spike protein, respectively, emerged early in the pandemic and showed a considerable increase in frequency over time. Two other mutations, A1163T>I120F in nsp2 and G22992A>S477N in the Spike protein, emerged recently and have spread in Oceania and Europe. There were associations of P323L, D614G, R203K and G204R substitutions with disease severity.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected trauma database was reviewed at a level 1 major trauma centre from 1 December 2020 to 18 February 2021 looking at demographics, clinical characteristics, and nosocomial infections and compared to our previously published first wave data (26 January 2020 to 14 April 2020). RESULTS: From 1 December 2020 to 18 February 2021, 522 major trauma patients were identified with a mean age of 54.6 years, and 53.4% (n = 279) were male. Common admissions were falls (318; 60.9%) and road traffic accidents (RTAs; 71 (13.6%); 262 of these patients (50.2%) had surgery. In all, 75 patients (14.4%) tested positive for COVID-19, of which 51 (68%) were nosocomial. Surgery on COVID-19 patients increased to 46 (61.3%) in the second wave compared to 13 (33.3%) in the first wave (p = 0.005). ICU admissions of patients with COVID-19 infection increased from two (5.1%) to 16 (20.5%), respectively (p = 0.024). Second wave mortality was 6.1% (n = 32) compared to first wave of 4.7% (n = 31). Cardiovascular (CV) disease (35.9%; n = 14); p = 0.027) and dementia (17.9%; n = 7); p = 0.030) were less in second wave than the first. Overall, 13 patients (25.5%) were Black, Asian and Minority ethnic (BAME), and five (9.8%) had a BMI > 30 kg/m(2). The mean time from admission to diagnosis of COVID-19 was 13.9 days (3 to 44). Overall, 12/75 (16%) of all COVID-19 patients died. CONCLUSION: During the second wave, COVID-19 infected three-times more patients. There were double the number of operative cases, and quadruple the cases of ICU admissions. The patients were younger with less dementia and CV disease with lower mortality. Concomitant COVID-19 and the necessity of major trauma surgery showed 13% mortality in the second wave compared with 15.4% in the first wave.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the proportion of alumni from Primary Health Care Multiprofessional Residency Programs admitted into the SUS and associated factors. METHODS: This is a sectional study developed with alumni from Primary Health Care Multiprofessional Residency Programs from all over Brazil, encompassing the period from 2015 to 2019. Participants answered an online questionnaire with general personal information, admission into stricto sensu graduate school, the labor market and, specifically, the SUS. We applied Pearson's chi-square test for bivariate analyses and Poisson's regression for multiple analysis. RESULTS: A total of 365 alumni from Programs from all Brazilian regions participated in the study. Of those, 80.2% reported entry into the labor market and 47.9% reported being employed in the SUS. Admission into the SUS has been associated with the professions that make up the Reference Team for Primary Health Care (PHC) (PR = 1.87; 95% CI 1.54C2.28) and non-admission into stricto sensu graduate programs (PR = 0.77; 95% CI 0.61C0.97).

Crude oil has bolstered the continents economy and improved the wellbeing of the citizenry. Historically, Africa has suffered from conflicts due to uneven redistribution of crude oil revenue and severe environmental pollution. Advancements in geophysical survey techniques, such as magnetic and gravity methods, to seismic methods, have made the commercial exploration of crude oil possible for some other countries in Africa apart from Nigeria, Angola, Algeria, Libya, and Egypt. The occurrence of organic-rich, oil-prone Type I, II, and mixed II/III kerogens in sedimentary basins and entrapment within reservoir rocks with intrinsic petrophysical properties are majorly responsible for the large deposits of hydrocarbon in Africa. The unethical practices by some multinational oil corporations have resulted in social movements against them by host communities and human rights groups. The unscrupulous diversion of public funds, award of oil blocks, and production rights to certain individuals have impaired economic growth in Africa. The over-dependence on crude oil revenues has caused the economic recession in oil-producing countries due to plummeting oil prices and global pandemic. Most host communities of crude oil deposits suffer from a lack of infrastructure, arable soils, clean water, and their functioning capabilities are violated by crude oil exploratory activities, without adequate compensations and remedial actions taken by oil companies and the government.

Among the overall study population, 25.7% had immunocompromised condition(s), 23.1% were admitted to the ICU and 7.3% received IMV. The mean (median) hospital LOS was 4.3 (2) days, hospital costs and charges were $14,760 ($6,164) and $58,418 ($21,622), respectively; in-hospital mortality was 0.5%. LOS, costs, charges, and in-hospital mortality increased with ICU admission and/or IMV usage. In total, 2.1% had a COVID-19-associated readmission. Study outcomes appeared relatively more frequent and/or higher among those 5-11 than those 0-4. Results using the HealthVerity data source were generally consistent with main analyses. LimitationsThis retrospective administrative database analysis relied on coding accuracy and inpatient admissions with validated hospital costs. ConclusionsThese findings underscore that children aged 0-11 years can experience severe COVID-19 illness requiring hospitalization and substantial hospital resource use, further supporting recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination.","output":"COVID-19-Associated Hospitalizations Among Children Less Than 12 Years of Age in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented shifts in higher education worldwide, with some nations more adversely affected than others. Since the onset of the crisis, almost all education abruptly moved to ?emergency remote teaching and learning?.

(n?=?69) perspectives on the use of video cameras and microphones in online classes. Students? reflective writing and researcher observations in autumn 2020 revealed discomfort using video cameras and microphones due to a range of cultural and linguistic factors. Such factors include Islamic beliefs relating to modesty, home as a gendered space, noise considerations, concerns about privacy, struggles with language in their English-medium instruction university and fear of judgement from peers.

Here, the epidemiology of viruses circulating among backyard poultry in Vientiane Province was assessed to guide future control strategies. Oral/tracheal and cloacal swabs, collected from 605 poultry (308 ducks, 297 chickens) between 2011 and 2015, were screened by PCR for Newcastle disease virus (NDV), Coronavirus (CoV) and Chicken Anemia Virus (CAV). Chicken sera were screened for anti-NDV antibodies by ELISA. Statistical and phylogenetic analyses revealed transmission patterns and relationships. Closely related strains co-circulated in chickens and ducks. While CoV RNA was detected in oral/tracheal swabs of 9.3% of the chickens and 2.4% of the ducks, rates were higher in fecal swabs of both species (27.3% and 48.2%). RNA of Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and duck CoV was found in fecal swabs of chickens (19.7% and 7.1%) and of ducks (4.1% and 44.1%). Moreover, DNA of the generally chicken-specific CAV was detected in oral/tracheal swabs of chickens (18.1%) and sporadically of ducks (2.4%). Despite serological evidence of NDV circulation or vaccination (86.9%), NDV RNA was not detected. We found a high prevalence and indication for cross-species transmission of different CoV strains in backyard poultry. Interestingly, ducks served as biological or at least mechanical carrier of viral strains closely related not only to IBV, but also to CAV. Animal containment and poultry species separation could be first steps to avoid cross-species transmission and emergence of novel strains with broad host range and enhanced pathogenicity.","output":"Cross-species transmission of poultry pathogens in backyard farms: ducks as carriers of chicken viruses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global pandemic with a great impact on social and economic activities, as well as public health. In most patients, the symptoms of COVID-19 are a high-grade fever and a dry cough, and spontaneously resolve within ten days. However, in severe cases, COVID-19 leads to atypical bilateral interstitial pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and systemic thromboembolism, resulting in multiple organ failure with high mortality and morbidity. SARS-CoV-2 has immune evasion mechanisms, including inhibition of interferon signaling and suppression of T cell and B cell responses. SARS-CoV-2 infection directly and indirectly causes dysregulated immune responses, platelet hyperactivation, and endothelial dysfunction, which interact with each other and are exacerbated by cardiovascular risk factors. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on the pathogenic basis of thromboinflammation and endothelial injury in COVID-19. We highlight the distinct contributions of dysregulated immune responses, platelet hyperactivation, and endothelial dysfunction to the pathogenesis of COVID-19.

While marginal food security falls next to high food security on the spectrum, new quantitative research indicates marginal food security status is associated with negative health outcomes and poor academic performance among college students. Qualitative research focusing on college students experiencing marginal food security has not been conducted. The current study aims to qualitatively explore experiences of college students with marginal food security and to identify themes to better understand and provide context regarding how marginal food security impacts students. DESIGN: Students were recruited for semi-structured interviews with questions designed to study the challenges associated with students' food situations. All interviews were recorded and transcribed with themes identified via an inductive approach. SETTING: A large public university on the US west coast. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty college students. RESULTS: Key themes that emerged: purchasing cheap unhealthy foods, insufficient time to prepare and eat meals on a regular basis, stress and anxiety around the inability to eat healthy food and future health issues, self-perception of health when eating poorly along with physical symptoms and low academic motivation by not fully participating in their courses due to few healthy food options or missing meals. CONCLUSION: Marginal food security can potentially diminish students' health and their capacity to learn and succeed in their coursework.

The brain's limitations in the heat is often ascribed to inadequate cerebral blood flow (CBF), but elevated intracranial pressure is commonly observed in mammalian models of heat stroke and can on its own cause functional impairment. The CBF response to incremental heat strain was dependent on the mode of heating, decreasing by 30% when exposed passively to hot, humid air (sauna), while remaining unchanged or increasing with passive hot-water immersion (spa) and exercising in a hot environment. Non-invasive intracranial pressure estimates (nICP) were increased universally by 18% at volitional thermal tolerance across all modes of heat stress, and therefore may play a contributing role in eliciting thermal tolerance. The sauna, more so than the spa or exercise, poses a greater challenge to the brain under mild to severe heating due to lower blood flow but similarly increased nICP. ABSTRACT The human brain is particularly vulnerable to heat stress; this manifests as impaired cognitive function, orthostatic tolerance, work capacity, and eventually, brain death. This vulnerability is often ascribed to inadequate cerebral blood flow (CBF); however, elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is also observed in mammalian models of heat stroke. We investigated the changes in CBF with incremental heat strain under three fundamentally different modes of heating, and assessed whether heating per se increased ICP. Fourteen fit participants (7 female) were heated to thermal tolerance or 40C core temperature (Tc; oesophageal) via passive hot-water immersion (spa), passive hot, humid air exposure (sauna), cycling exercise, and cycling exercise with CO2 inhalation to prevent heat-induced hypocapnia. CBF was measured with duplex ultrasound at each 0.5C increment in Tc and ICP was estimated non-invasively (nICP) from optic nerve sheath diameter at thermal tolerance. At thermal tolerance, CBF was decreased by 30% in the sauna (p<0.001), but unchanged in the spa or with exercise (p0.140). CBF increased by 17% when end-tidal PCO2 was clamped at eupneic pressure (p<0.001). On the contrary, nICP increased universally by 18% with all modes of heating (p<0.001). The maximum Tc was achieved with passive heating, and preventing hypocapnia during exercise did not improve exercise or thermal tolerance (p0.146). Therefore, the regulation of CBF is dramatically different depending on the mode and dose of heating, whereas nICP responses are not. The sauna, more so than the spa or exercise, poses a greater challenge to the brain under equivalent heat strain. This article is protected by copyright.

To date, our understanding of the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and host innate immunity is still limited. Previous studies reported that SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 12 (NSP12) was able to suppress interferon- (IFN-) activation in IFN- promoter luciferase reporter assays, which provided insights into the pathogenesis of COVID-19. In this study, we demonstrated that IFN- promoter-mediated luciferase activity was reduced during coexpression of NSP12. However, we could show NSP12 did not affect IRF3 or NF-B activation. Moreover, IFN- production induced by Sendai virus (SeV) infection or other stimulus was not affected by NSP12 at mRNA or protein level. Additionally, the type I IFN signaling pathway was not affected by NSP12, as demonstrated by the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Further experiments revealed that different experiment systems, including protein tags and plasmid backbones, could affect the readouts of IFN- promoter luciferase assays. In conclusion, unlike as previously reported, our study showed SARS-CoV-2 NSP12 protein is not an IFN- antagonist. It also rings the alarm on the general usage of luciferase reporter assays in studying SARS-CoV-2. IMPORTANCE Previous studies investigated the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins and interferon signaling and proposed that several SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins, including NSP12, could suppress IFN- activation. However, most of these results were generated from IFN- promoter luciferase reporter assay and have not been validated functionally. In our study, we found that, although NSP12 could suppress IFN- promoter luciferase activity, it showed no inhibitory effect on IFN- production or its downstream signaling. Further study revealed that contradictory results could be generated from different experiment systems. On one hand, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 NSP12 could not suppress IFN- signaling. On the other hand, our study suggests that caution needs to be taken with the interpretation of SARS-CoV-2-related luciferase assays.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 NSP12 Protein Is Not an Interferon- Antagonist"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Cervical cancer remains the most common cancer of women worldwide. Its burden is more serious in developing countries. It is also the second common cancer deaths of women in Ethiopia followed by breast cancer. The aim of this study was to determine the pooled prevalence and associated factors of precancerous cervical lesions among women in Ethiopia. Methods: We systematically searched published and unpublished articles reported from 2010 to 2019 using a comprehensive search of electronic databases including PubMed and Google scholar for grey literature from August 1 to September 1, 2019. The methodological qualities of included studies were evaluated using Joanna Briggs Institute meta-analysis of Statistics Assessment. The pooled prevalence estimate was calculated using MedCalc software-version 19.0.7, and the pooled odd ratios for predictors was calculated using RevMan software version 5.3. Results: The pooled prevalence of precancerous cervical lesions among women in Ethiopia was 13.4% (95% CI:10.63% 16.37%). Statistically significant heterogeneity between studies was detected (I2=83.1%, P < 0.001).

By using methods such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the range of targets that can now be reliably diagnosed has grown to the extent that there are now extremely few, known pathogens that cannot be identified accurately by using laboratory-based diagnostics. However, while the detection of pathogens in individual, infected samples is becoming simpler, there are still many scenarios that present a major challenge to diagnosticians and plant pathologists. Amongst these are the detection of pathogens in soil or viruses in their vectors, high throughput testing and the development of generic methods, that allow samples to be simultaneously screened for large numbers of pathogens. Another major challenge is to develop robust technologies that avoid the reliance on well-equipped central laboratories and making reliable diagnostics available to pathologists in the field or in less-developed countries. In recent years, much of the research carried out on phytodiagnostics has focussed in these areas and as a result many novel, routine diagnostic tests are becoming available. This has been possible due to the introduction of new molecular technologies such real-time PCR and microarrays. These advances have been complemented by the development of new nucleic acid extraction methods, increased automation, reliable internal controls, assay multiplexing and generic amplification methods. With developments in new hardware, field-portable real-time PCR is now also a reality and offers the prospect of ultra-rapid, on-site molecular diagnostics for the first time.

Consequently, vimentin has complex implications in pathophysiology. Vimentin is required for a proper immune response, but it can also act as an autoantigen in autoimmune diseases or as a damage signal. Although vimentin is a predominantly cytoplasmic protein, it can also appear at extracellular locations, either in a secreted form or at the surface of numerous cell types, often in relation to cell activation, inflammation, injury or senescence. Cell surface targeting of vimentin appears to associate with the occurrence of certain posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation and/or oxidative damage. At the cell surface, vimentin can act as a receptor for bacterial and viral pathogens. Indeed, vimentin has been shown to play important roles in virus attachment and entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), dengue and encephalitis viruses, among others. Moreover, the presence of vimentin in specific virus-targeted cells and its induction by proinflammatory cytokines and tissue damage contribute to its implication in viral infection. Here, we recapitulate some of the pathophysiological implications of vimentin, including the involvement of cell surface vimentin in interaction with pathogens, with a special focus on its role as a cellular receptor or co-receptor for viruses. In addition, we provide a perspective on approaches to target vimentin, including antibodies or chemical agents that could modulate these interactions to potentially interfere with viral pathogenesis, which could be useful when multi-target antiviral strategies are needed .","output":"Vimentin as a Multifaceted Player and Potential Therapeutic Target in Viral Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Some countries have been more successful than others at dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. When we explore the different policy approaches adopted as well as the underlying socio-economic factors, we note an interesting set of correlations: countries led by women leaders have fared significantly better than those led by men on a wide range of dimensions concerning the global health crisis. In this paper, we analyze available data for 35 countries, focusing on the following variables: number of deaths per capita due to COVID-19, number of days with reported deaths, peaks in daily deaths, deaths occurred on the first day of lockdown, and excess mortality. Results show that countries governed by female leaders experienced much fewer COVID-19 deaths per capita and were more effective and rapid at flattening the epidemic's curve, with lower peaks in daily deaths. We argue that there are both contingent and structural reasons that may explain these stark differences. First of all, most women-led governments were more prompt at introducing restrictive measures in the initial phase of the epidemic, prioritizing public health over economic concerns, and more successful at eliciting collaboration from the population. Secondly, most countries led by women are also those with a stronger focus on social equality, human needs and generosity.

Thus, here we profiled the binding and functional capacity of convalescent antibodies and Moderna mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine-induced antibodies across SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC). While neutralizing antibody responses are affected by VOCs, antibodies generated after infection exhibited robust binding to VOCs but compromised interactions with Fc-receptors. Conversely, vaccine-induced antibodies bound robustly to VOCs and continued interacting with Fc-receptors and mediated antibody effector functions.

Functional assays for aPL (i.e., lupus anticoagulant) can be influenced by concomitant anticoagulation and/or high levels of C reactive protein. The presence of anti-cardiolipin (aCL), anti-beta2-glycoprotein I (anti-(2)GPI), and anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin (aPS/PT) antibodies was not investigated systematically.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence and the clinical association of aPL in a large cohort of COVID-19 patients, and to characterize the epitope specificity of anti-(2)GPI antibodies. METHODS: ELISA and chemiluminescence assays were used to test 122 sera of patients suffering from severe COVID-19. Of them, 16 displayed major thrombotic events. RESULTS: Anti-(2)GPI IgG/IgA/IgM was the most frequent in 15.6/6.6/9.0% of patients, while aCL IgG/IgM was detected in 5.7/6.6% by ELISA.

The relative importance of these has not been prospectively documented in a case-control study. OBJECTIVE To assess the relative importance of colds and other nonclimatic historical triggers of asthma exacerbations. METHODS One hundred and nineteen adults and children with asthma in two Canadian cities participated in a one-year study of the role of exacerbating factors in asthma. Among these, 36 pairs (21 adult, 15 children) completed the case-control study. Patients were considered cases if they developed an acute asthma exacerbation and notified the centre within 24 h to allow the completion of a questionnaire and viral studies (cultures of nasopharyngeal swabs and serology). Control people with asthma were matched for sex, age and area of residence, had no exacerbation during the preceding four weeks and participated within 48 h of the case patients. RESULTS Case patients versus control patients had a mean age of 22 years versus 20 years, 50% versus 55% were male, and 92% versus 86% had at least one positive aeroallergen skin test. Cases were more likely to have taken regular inhaled steroids (63% versus 33%, P<0.002). Cases were more likely to report the following within the previous week: fever (P<0.001), sore throat (P<0.001), increase in nasal symptoms (P<0.01), increased dust exposure (P<0. 05), exposure to others with a cold (P<0.001) and, over the previous year, increased passive smoke exposure (P<0.05). Viral cultures and paired serology were negative. CONCLUSIONS Symptomatic colds were the most common trigger of asthma exacerbations in the winter and spring, while a transient increase in dust exposure was also identified as a significant trigger. The association with chronic, passive smoke exposure and the use of inhaled costicosteroid medications likely reflected less stable pre-study asthma in those with exacerbations.","output":"A case-control study of the role of cold symptoms and other historical triggering factors in asthma exacerbations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2, is steadily mutating during continuous transmission among humans.

Nevertheless, the D614G mutation does not affect neutralization by antisera against prototypic viruses.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a worldwide study collecting cases of patients with NENs along with a positive nasopharyngeal swab reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 between June 1, 2020, and March 31, 2021. Centres treating patients with NENs were directly contacted by the principal investigator. Patients with NENs of any primary site, grade and stage were included, excluding small-cell lung carcinoma and mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma. RESULTS: Among 81 centres directly contacted, 88.8% responded and 48.6% of them declined due to lack of cases or interest. On March 31st, 2021, eight recruiting centres enrolled 89 patients. The median age was 64 years at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis. Most patients had metastatic, non-functioning, low-/intermediate-grade gastroenteropancreatic NENs on treatment with somatostatin analogues and radioligand therapy. Most of them had comorbidities. Only 8% of patients had high-grade NENs and 12% were receiving chemotherapy. Most patients had symptoms or signs of COVID-19, mainly fever and cough. Only 3 patients underwent sub-intensive treatment, whereas most of them received medical therapies, mostly antibiotics. In two third of cases, no changes occurred for the anti-NEN therapy. More than 80% of patients completely recovered without sequelae, whereas 7.8% patients died due to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Patients included in this study reflect the typical NEN population regardless of SARS-CoV-2. In most cases, they overcome COVID-19 without need of intensive care, short-term sequelae and discontinuation of systemic oncological therapy.","output":"Coronavirus disease 2019 in patients with neuroendocrine neoplasms: Preliminary results of the INTENSIVE study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of micro- and nanoparticles in biological applications has dramatically grown during the last few decades due to the ease of protocols development and compatibility with microfluidics devices. Particles can be composed by different materials, i.e., polymers, inorganic dielectrics, and metals. Among them, silica is a suitable material for the development of biosensing applications. Depending on their final application, the surface properties of particles, including silica, are tailored by means of chemical modification or polymeric coating. The latter strategy represents a powerful tool to create a hydrophilic environment that enables the functionalization of particles with biomolecules and the further interaction with analytes. Here, the use of MCP-6, a dimethylacrylamide (DMA)-based ter-copolymer, to coat silica microspheres is presented.

Our objective was to determine barriers for young adults with CHD actively missing from cardiac care and to re-engage them in care. Retrospective single-center cohort study of cardiology clinic patients ages 15C21 years with CHD between 2012 and 2019 for patients actively missing from care ( 12 months beyond requested clinic follow-up). We conducted prospective interviews, offered clinic scheduling information, and recorded cardiac follow-up. Data analyzed using descriptive statistics, univariable, and multivariable logistic regression. Of 1053 CHD patients, 33% (n = 349) were actively missing. Of those missing, 58% were male and median age was 17 years (IQR 16C19). Forty-six percent were Non-Hispanic White, 33% Hispanic, and 9% Black. Moderately complex CHD was in 71%, and 62% had private insurance. Patients with simple CHD, older age at last encounter (18C21), and scheduled follow-up > 12 months from last encounter were more likely to be actively missing. Interviews were completed by 125 patients/parents (36%). Lack of cardiac care was reported in 52%, and common barriers included: insurance (33%), appointment scheduling (26%), and unknown ACHD center care (15%). Roughly half (55%) accepted appointment information, yet only 3% successfully returned. Many patients require assistance beyond CHD knowledge to maintain and re-engage in care. Future interventions should include scheduling assistance, focused insurance maintenance, understanding where to obtain ACHD care, and educating on need for lifelong care.","output":"Hope is No Plan: Uncovering Actively Missing Transition-Aged Youth with Congenital Heart Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In May 2020, many European countries have begun to introduce an exit strategy for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic which involves relaxing social distancing measures. Predictive epidemiological modeling indicates that chances for resurgence are high. However, parametrization of the epidemiological nature of COVID-19 and the effect of relaxing social distancing is not well constrained, resulting in highly uncertain outcomes in view of managing future intensive care unit (ICU) needs. Methods and findings: For performance analysis of exit strategies we developed an open-source ensemble-based Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model. It takes into account uncertainties for the COVID-19 parametrization and social distancing measures. The model is calibrated to data of the outbreak and lockdown phase. For the exit phase, the model includes the capability to activate an emergency brake, reinstating lockdown conditions. Alternatively, the model uses an adaptive COVID-19 cruise control (ACCC) capable to retain a targeted ICU level. The model is demonstrated for the Netherlands and we analyzed progressive and adaptive exit strategies through a stress test of managing ICU rates. The progressive strategy reflects the outcome of social and economic pressure to use one-way steering toward progressively relaxing measures at an early stage. It is marked by a high probability for the activation of the emergency brake due to an unsolicited growth of ICU needs in the following months. Alternatively, the two-way steering ACCC can flatten ICU needs in a more gradual way and avoids activation of the emergency brake. It also performs well for seasonal variation in the reproduction number of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus. Conclusions: The adaptive strategy (ACCC) is favored, as it avoids the use of the emergency brake at the expense of small steps of restrictive measures and allows the exploration of riskier and potentially rewarding measures in the future pathways of the exit strategy.","output":"Performance of progressive and adaptive COVID-19 exit strategies: a stress test analysis for managing intensive care unit rates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite being around for more than 40 years, DNA sequencing is regarded as young technology in clinical medicine.

This study was aimed to determine the role of stimulator of IFN genes (STING), an essential regulator to innate immunity, in the context of SAH. METHODS: A total of 344 male C57BL/6 J mice were subjected to endovascular perforation to develop a model of SAH. Selective STING antagonist C-176 and STING agonist CMA were administered at 30 min or 1 h post-modeling separately. To investigate the underlying mechanism, the AMPK inhibitor compound C was administered intracerebroventricularly at 30 min before surgery. Post-SAH assessments included SAH grade, neurological test, brain water content, western blotting, RT-PCR, and immunofluorescence. Oxygenated hemoglobin was introduced into BV2 cells to establish a SAH model in vitro. RESULTS: STING was mainly distributed in microglia, and microglial STING expression was significantly increased after SAH. Administration of C-176 substantially attenuated SAH-induced brain edema and neuronal injury. More importantly, C-176 significantly alleviated both short-term and persistent neurological dysfunction after SAH. Meanwhile, STING agonist CMA remarkably exacerbated neuronal injury and deteriorated neurological impairments. Mechanically, STING activation aggravated neuroinflammation via promoting microglial activation and polarizing into M1 phenotype, evidenced by microglial morphological changes, as well as the increased level of microglial M1 markers including IL-1, iNOS, IL-6, TNF-, MCP-1, and NLRP3 inflammasome, while C-176 conferred a robust anti-inflammatory effect. However, all the mentioned beneficial effects of C-176 including alleviated neuroinflammation, attenuated neuronal injury and the improved neurological function were reversed by AMPK inhibitor compound C. Meanwhile, the critical role of AMPK signal in C-176 mediated anti-inflammatory effect was also confirmed in vitro. CONCLUSION: Microglial STING yielded neuroinflammation after SAH, while pharmacologic inhibition of STING could attenuate SAH-induced inflammatory injury at least partly by activating AMPK signal. These data supported the notion that STING might be a potential therapeutic target for SAH.","output":"Stimulator of IFN genes mediates neuroinflammatory injury by suppressing AMPK signal in experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this position paper is to present an opinion on the importance of understanding host community perspectives in any community-based corporate social responsibility initiative.

As many specialties plan to continue virtual interviews, it is essential to evaluate what aspects worked well and what can be improved. Methods: From April to June 2021, authors surveyed participants of the 2020-2021 Match about their experiences with the virtual application cycle. Survey items asked about benefits and drawbacks of virtual interviews, the utility of social media, and thoughts regarding preference signaling mechanisms and application/interview limits. Results: Participants (n=158) represented 24 states and applied to 31 specialties. The majority (73.1%) were satisfied with their experience during the 2020-2021 Match. Applicants found Twitter (78.4%) and Instagram (69.1%) to be the most helpful social media platforms. Almost all applicants (98.1%) believed that the virtual setting increased financial access to interviews. The majority (68.6%) indicated that residency programs should continue to provide virtual interviews. However, most applicants (73.9%) felt that the virtual setting allowed more students to hoard interviews. Many (66.1%) also felt their medical school did not provide adequate electronic equipment for conducting virtual interviews. While many applicants (56.9%) did not support a cap on the number of applications one can submit, most supported a limit on the number of interviews one can attend (62.7%) as well as a mechanism to signal genuine interest in a program (59.7%). Conclusions: Our study highlights that, across geography and specialty, many applicants would like virtual interviews to continue and offers insight into how medical schools and residency programs can best support applicants in the virtual environment.

METHODS: We compared mRNA levels of SARS-CoV-2 cell-entry mediators ACE2, TMPRSS2 and L-SIGN (an alternative entry receptor) by qPCR in 105 placentae: 45 from pregnant women with HIV (WHIV) exposed to protease inhibitor (PI)-based ART, 17 from WHIV on non-PI-based ART, and 43 from HIV-uninfected women. RESULTS: ACE2 levels were lower, while L-SIGN levels were higher in placentae from WHIV on PI-based ART as compared to those on non-PI-based ART and to HIV-uninfected women. TMPRSS2 levels were similar between groups. Black race was significantly associated with lower expression of ACE2 and higher expression of L-SIGN. ACE2 levels were significantly higher in placentae of female fetuses. DISCUSSION: We have identified pregnant women of Black race and WHIV who are on PI-based ART to have relatively lower expression of placental ACE2 than those of White race and HIV-uninfected women. This effect may potentially contribute to altered susceptibility to COVID-19 in these women, either favorably; by reduced viral entry, or detrimentally; by loss of ACE2 protection against hyperinflammation.","output":"ACE2, TMPRSS2 and L-SIGN expression in placentae from HIV-positive pregnancies exposed to antiretroviral therapyCimplications for SARS-CoV-2 placental infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a complex interplay between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) dynamics and host immune responses. Hosts with altered immunity, including solid organ transplant recipients, may be at increased risk of complications and death due to COVID-19. A synthesis of the available data on immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection is needed to inform therapeutic and preventative strategies in this special population. RECENT FINDINGS: Few studies have directly compared immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 between transplant recipients and the general population. Like non-transplant patients, transplant recipients mount an exuberant inflammatory response following initial SARS-CoV2 infection, with IL-6 levels correlating with disease severity in some, but not all studies. Transplant recipients display anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and activated B cells in a time frame and magnitude similar to non-transplant patientslimited data suggest these antibodies can be detected within 15 days of symptom onset and may be durable for several months. CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphopenia, a hallmark of COVID-19, is more profound in transplant recipients, but SARS-CoV-2Creactive T cells can be detected among patients with both mild and severe disease. SUMMARY: The limited available data indicate that immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 are similar between transplant recipients and the general population, but no studies have been sufficiently comprehensive to understand nuances between organ types or level of immunosuppression to meaningfully inform individualized therapeutic decisions. The ongoing pandemic provides an opportunity to generate higher-quality data to support rational treatment and vaccination strategies in this population.","output":"Immune Responses to SARS-CoV-2 in Solid Organ Transplant Recipients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Scientists always look for the most accurate and relevant answers to their queries in the literature.

The aim of this study was to assess quality of life and esthetic satisfaction of breast cancer patients undergoing muscle-sparing skin-reducing breast reconstruction (MS-SR) with pre-pectoral implants. METHODS Sixty-three patients who met definite oncological and reconstructive criteria were enrolled in the study. Specific questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30, QLQ-BR23) were administered preoperatively, 1, and 12 months after MS-SR breast reconstruction to evaluate patients' QoL. Satisfaction with procedure and related Quality of Life were assessed through BREAST-Q questionnaire preoperatively and 12 months after surgery. RESULTS Sixty-three breast cancer patients underwent MS-SR. Seventy-eight procedures were carried out; in 15 patients a bilateral reconstruction was performed. One month after surgery, both EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 average scores demonstrated a slight drop since preoperative values, but a significant improvement in QoL was documented 12 months after BR (p < 0.05).

Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the utilization behavior and user satisfaction of users contacting a German messenger-based chat counseling service (krisenchat) regarding suicidal ideation. METHODS: The present cross-sectional study analyzed retrospective anonymous data on sociodemographic variables, utilization behavior, and user satisfaction of krisenchat users who used the service between May 2020 and July 2021. Chi-square-tests were used to identify associations of sociodemographic characteristics and utilization behavior with suicidal ideation. Mann-Whitney-U-tests were used to compare the user satisfaction and the recommendation-to-others-rate between suicidal and non-suicidal krisenchat-users. RESULTS: In total, chat data of N = 11,031 users were collected. Of the n = 6,962 users included in the final analysis, n = 1,444 (20.7%) contacted krisenchat because of suicidal ideation. The average user experiencing suicidal ideation was 17 years old, female and currently not receiving other treatment. Further, suicidal ideation was significantly and positively associated with age and non-suicidal self-injury. Regarding utilization patterns, there were significant positive associations between suicidal ideation and counseling session count, mean amount of messages sent, and mean amount of words used per message by the user. User satisfaction was high, with 64.7% (n = 413) of users that answered the feedback survey and experiencing suicidal ideation rating the help they received as at least good and a recommendation rate of 89.6% (n = 571). Most importantly, no differences were found between users reporting suicidal ideation and those that do not regarding satisfaction and the probability of recommending the service.

We surveyed 135 physicians working at a tertiary-care hospital in Israel. The questionnaire was comprised of demographic and background information, DNR procedure information, encounters with terminally ill patients, familiarity with the law regarding end-of-life questions, and Attitudes toward Euthanasia. About 61% agreed that a person has the right to decide whether to expedite their own death, 54% agreed that euthanasia should be allowed, while 29% thought that physicians should preserve a patients' life even when they expressed the wish to die. A negative statistically significant relationship was found between the level of religiosity and attitudes toward euthanasia. The physicians' attitudes towards euthanasia are quite positive when compared to other countries. The data shows a conflict of values: the sacredness of human life versus the desire to alleviate patients' suffering. The Coronavirus-19 outbreak reinforces the importance of supporting physicians' efforts to provide ethical and empathic communication for terminally ill patients. Future studies should aim to improve our understanding and treatment of the specific types of suffering that lead to end-of-life requests.","output":"Facing Death: Attitudes toward Physician-Assisted End of Life among Physicians Working at a Tertiary-Care-Hospital in Israel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, the use of cost-effective, custom home experiment kits for remote teaching of first-semester introductory physics labs is described.

Even though the idea is not to intervene, the studies conducted during follow-up may affect the target population. Our hypotheses were that the participation to prospective Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 study (NFBC 1986) increases the use of mental health services and reduces the suicidal behaviour due to participation in follow-up study. Methods: The study cohort NFBC 1986 covers the people born with expected date of birth between July 1985 and June 1986 in northern Finland (N=9,396). The participants of the NFBC 1986 have been followed since antenatal time with follow-ups including clinical examinations. The comparison cohort comprises of people born in the same area in 1987 (N=8,959), who have not been contacted. Register data of psychiatric treatment, suicide attempts and suicides were available. Crude risk ratios (RR) and adjusted (with marital status and education) Mantel-Haenszel Risk Ratios (RRMH) were reported. Results: No significant differences between NFBC 1986 and comparison cohorts in any mental disorders were detected. In crude risk ratio analysis of female, the decreased risk for the suicide attempts was found (RR: 0.67 (95% CI: 0.49-0.92), p=0.011). Conclusion: Results did not support our first hypothesis of increased use of mental health services in the NFBC 1986. On the other hand, our second hypothesis gained some support as female participants of the NFBC 1986 had decreased risk for suicide attempts, although it was not due to higher number of participants receiving psychiatric treatment.","output":"Association between participation to the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 and mental disorders and suicidal behaviour"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"How social norms are formed likely has a bearing on the mechanisms underlying their effects on behavioral outcomes.

It is unclear how those most directly experiencing economic impacts may seek assistance from disparate safety net programs. To identify self-reported economic hardship and enrollment in major safety net programs before and early in the COVID-19 pandemic, we compared individuals with COVID-19 related employment or earnings reduction with other individuals. We created a set of questions related to COVID-19 economic impact that was added to a cross-sectional, nationally representative online survey of American adults (age &#8805;18, English-speaking) in the AmeriSpeak panel fielded from April 23-27, 2020. All analyses were weighted to account for survey non-response and known oversampling probabilities. We calculated unadjusted bivariate differences, comparing people with and without COVID-19 employment and earnings reductions with other individuals. Our study looked primarily at awareness and enrollment in seven major safety net programs before and since the pandemic (Medicaid, health insurance marketplaces/exchanges, unemployment insurance, food pantries/free meals, housing/renters assistance, SNAP, and TANF). Overall, 28.1% of all individuals experienced an employment reduction (job loss or reduced earnings). Prior to the pandemic, 39.0% of the sample was enrolled in &#8805;1 safety net program, and 50.0% of individuals who subsequently experienced COVID-19 employment reduction were enrolled in at least one safety net program.

The prevalence of DAH is reported to range from 1 to 5%, but while DAH is considered a rare complication there is a reported 50-80% mortality. There is at present no proven effective treatment for DAH and the therapeutics that have been tested have significant side effects. There is a clear necessity to discover new drugs to improve outcomes in DAH. Serine protease inhibitors, serpins, regulate thrombotic and thrombolytic protease cascades. We are investigating a Myxomavirus derived immune modulating serpin, Serp-1, as a new class of immune modulating therapeutics for vasculopathy and lung hemorrhage. Serp-1 has proven efficacy in models of herpes virus-induced arterial inflammation (vasculitis) and lung hemorrhage and has also proved safe in a clinical trial in patients with unstable coronary syndromes and stent implant. Here, we examine Serp-1, both as a native secreted protein expressed by CHO cells and as a polyethylene glycol modified (PEGylated) variant (Serp-1m5), for potential therapy in DAH. DAH was induced by intraperitoneal (IP) injection of pristane in C57BL/6J (B6) mice. Mice were treated with 100 ng/g bodyweight of either Serp-1 as native 55 kDa secreted glycoprotein, or as Serp-1m5, or saline controls after inducing DAH. Treatments were repeated daily for 14 days (6 mice/group). Serp-1 partially and Serp-1m5 significantly reduced pristane-induced DAH when compared with saline as assessed by gross pathology and H&E staining (Serp-1, p = 0.2172; Serp-1m5, p = 0.0252). Both Serp-1m5 and Serp-1 treatment reduced perivascular inflammation and reduced M1 macrophage (Serp-1, p = 0.0350; Serp-1m5, p = 0.0053), hemosiderin-laden macrophage (Serp-1, p = 0.0370; Serp-1m5, p = 0.0424) invasion, and complement C5b/9 staining.

PURPOSE: The proceedings of an international summit on the current and desired future state of use of robotic systems to compound intravenous (IV) solutions are summarized. SUMMARY: The International IV Robotics Summit was held at the Cleveland Clinic main campus in Cleveland, OH, on April 29 and 30, 2019. The purpose of the summit was 2-fold: (1) to define the current state of robotic IV compounding and (2) to develop a guide for automation companies, pharmacy departments, and drug manufacturers to improve the technology and expand the use of IV robotics in health systems in the future. The first day of the summit included 45-minute presentations by each of the speakers. Each lecturer recounted a different hospital's experience implementing and using IV robotics. On day 2 of the summit, an expert panel dedicated to mapping the future of IV robotics was convened to determine barriers to widespread adoption of IV robotics in health systems and offer potential solutions to remove these barriers. The expert panel targeted 3 specific audiences: robot manufacturers, drug manufacturers, and fellow pharmacy leaders. CONCLUSION: It is the hope of the international faculty that the information that emerged from the summit can be used by others to successfully implement IV compounding robotics in their sterile products areas to maximize patient safety. The summit also served as a call to action for pharmacy leaders, drug manufacturers, and robotic companies to develop a safer, more efficient future for patients by working together to optimize the development and operation of IV robotics.","output":"Cleveland Clinic International IV Robotics Summit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: It is not clear whether patients with some degree of immunosuppression have worse outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to healthy people.

Introduction of the conjugate Haemophilus influenzae B and multivalent pneumococcal vaccines in developed countries including Australia has significantly reduced the overall burden of bacterial pneumonia. With the availability of molecular diagnostics, viruses are frequently detected in children with pneumonia either as primary pathogens or predispose to secondary bacterial infection. Many respiratory pathogens that are known to cause pneumonia are also identified in asymptomatic children, so the true contribution of these pathogens to childhood community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains unclear. Since the introduction of pneumococcal vaccines, very few comprehensive studies from developed countries have attempted to determine the bacterial and viral aetiology of pneumonia. We aim to determine the contribution of bacteria and viruses to childhood CAP to inform further development of effective diagnosis, treatment and preventive strategies. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We are conducting a prospective caseCcontrol study (PneumoWA) where cases are children with radiologically confirmed pneumonia admitted to Princess Margaret Hospital for Children (PMH) and controls are healthy children identified from PMH outpatient clinics and from local community immunisation clinics. The caseCcontrol ratio is 1:1 with 250 children to be recruited in each arm. Nasopharyngeal swabs are collected from both cases and controls to detect the presence of viruses and bacteria by PCR; pathogen load will be assessed by quantitative PCR. The prevalence of pathogens detected in cases and controls will be compared, the OR of detection and population attributable fraction to CAP for each pathogen will be determined; relationships between pathogen load and disease status and severity will be explored.

Statistical analysis was conducted to explore the association between the daily local COVID-19 confirmed positive cases (LCPC) and both climate characteristics and the daily weather reported by the regional meteorological stations. In this work, the local transmission ratio (LTR) was calculated with the regional LCPC divided by the number of the effective contagion days since regional onset in each state. The results showed a negative association between temperature (mean, max and min) and climate classification with both LCPC and LTR variables. The precipitation associated positively with LCPC and LTR. The associations between the climate classification with LCPC and LTR are statistically significant. The tropical climate (mean temperature around 25.95 C and mean precipitation around 8.74 mm) delayed the regional onset. However, the regional onset in dry climates emerged earlier as consequence of the lower temperatures and higher precipitations (20.57 C and 20.87 mm respectively) than the observed in the tropical climate. The fastest regional onsets were observed in tempered climates in states where the lowest temperatures and lowest precipitations were registered (19.65 C and 8.48 mm respectively). Meteorological factors influenced the trend on the regional outbreaks in Mexican's states likely by the host predisposition and susceptibility during the cold winter season. In Mexico, the climate characteristics played a crucial role on the local infection during the phase 1 being the tempered regions (as Michoacn, Jalisco, Puebla, etc.) more vulnerable than the dry (as Chihuahua, Durango or Zacatecas, etc.) or tropical areas (as Colima, Campeche, Morelos etc.).","output":"The temperature and regional climate effects on communitarian COVID-19 contagion in Mexico throughout phase 1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fungal disease is an increasingly recognised global clinical challenge associated with high mortality.

METHODS: We performed a multicentre retrospective cohort study in 18 tertiary hospitals in Spain from March to April 2020. Consecutive patients admitted with severe COVID-19 treated with tocilizumab were compared to patients not treated with tocilizumab, adjusting by inverse probability of the treatment weights (IPTW). Tocilizumab's effect in patients receiving steroids during the 48 h following inclusion was analysed. RESULTS: During the study period, 506 patients with severe COVID-19 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Among them, 268 were treated with tocilizumab and 238 patients were not. Median time to tocilizumab treatment from onset of symptoms was 11 days [interquartile range (IQR) 8C14]. Global mortality was 23.7%. Mortality was lower in patients treated with tocilizumab than in controls: 16.8% versus 31.5%, hazard ratio (HR) 0.514 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.355C0.744], p < 0.001; weighted HR 0.741 (95% CI 0.619C0.887), p = 0.001. Tocilizumab treatment reduced mortality by 14.7% relative to no tocilizumab treatment [relative risk reduction (RRR) 46.7%]. We calculated a number necessary to treat of 7. Among patients treated with steroids, mortality was lower in those treated with tocilizumab than in those treated with steroids alone [10.9% versus 40.2%, HR 0.511 (95% CI 0.352C0.741), p = 0.036; weighted HR 0.6 (95% CI 0.449C0.804), p < 0.001] (interaction p = 0.094).

STUDY OBJECTIVE: To understand the impact of the density of African American communities (defined as the percentage of African Americans in a county) on COVID-19 prevalence and death rate within the three most populous counties in each U.S. state and territory (n=152). Design: An ecological study using linear regression was employed for the study. SETTING: The top three most populous counties of each U.S. state and territory were included in analyses for a final sample size of n=152 counties. PARTICIPANTS: Confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths that were accumulated between January 22, 2020 and April 12, 2020 in each of the three most populous counties in each U.S. state and territory were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Linear regression was used to determine the association between African American density and COVID-19 prevalence (defined as the percentage of cases for the county population), and death rate (defined as number of deaths per 100,000 population). The models were adjusted for median age and poverty. RESULTS: There was a direct association between African American density and COVID-19 prevalence; COVID-19 prevalence increased 5% for every 1% increase in county AA density (p<.01). There was also an association between county AA density and COVID-19 deaths, such; the death rate increased 2 per 100,000 for every percentage increase in county AA density (p=.02). CONCLUSION: These study findings indicate that communities with a high African American density have been disproportionately burdened with COVID-19. Further study is needed to indicate if this burden is related to environmental factors or individual factors such as types of employment or comorbidities that members of these community have.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on African American communities in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Owing to its clinical significance, modulation of functionally relevant amino acids in protein-protein complexes has attracted a great deal of attention. To this end, many approaches have been proposed to predict the partner-selecting amino acid positions in evolutionarily close complexes. These approaches can be grouped into sequence-based machine learning and structure-based energy-driven methods. In this work, we assessed these methods ability to map the specificity-determining positions of Axl, a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cancer progression and immune system diseases. For sequence-based predictions, we used SDPpred, Multi-RELIEF, and Sequence Harmony. For structure-based predictions, we utilized HADDOCK refinement and molecular dynamics simulations. As a result, we observed that (i) sequence-based methods overpredict partner-selecting residues of Axl and that (ii) combining Multi-RELIEF with HADDOCK-based predictions provides the key Axl residues, covered by the extensive molecular dynamics simulations. Expanding on these results, we propose that a sequence-structure-based approach is necessary to determine specificity-determining positions of Axl, which can guide the development of therapeutic molecules to combat Axl misregulation.","output":"Predicting the Specificity- Determining Positions of Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Axl"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Arboviruses transmitted by Aedes aegypti including dengue, Zika, and chikungunya are a major global health problem, with over 2.5 billion at risk for dengue alone. There are no licensed antivirals for these infections, and safe and effective vaccines are not yet widely available. Thus, prevention of arbovirus transmission by vector modification is a novel approach being pursued by multiple researchers. However, the field needs high-quality evidence derived from randomized, controlled trials upon which to base the implementation and maintenance of vector control programs. Here, we report the EVITA Dengue trial design (DMID 17-0111), which assesses the efficacy in decreasing arbovirus transmission of an innovative approach developed by the World Mosquito Program for vector modification of Aedes mosquitoes by Wolbachia pipientis. METHODS: DMID 17-0111 is a cluster-randomized trial in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, with clusters defined by primary school catchment areas. Clusters (n = 58) will be randomized 1:1 to intervention (release of Wolbachia-infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes) vs. control (no release). Standard vector control activities (i.e., insecticides and education campaigns for reduction of mosquito breeding sites) will continue as per current practice in the municipality. Participants (n = 3480, 60 per cluster) are children aged 6C11 years enrolled in the cluster-defining school and living within the cluster boundaries who will undergo annual serologic surveillance for arboviral infection. The primary objective is to compare sero-incidence of arboviral infection between arms. DISCUSSION: DMID 17-0111 aims to determine the efficacy of Wolbachia-infected mosquito releases in reducing human infections by arboviruses transmitted by Aedes aegypti and will complement the mounting evidence for this method from large-scale field releases and ongoing trials. The trial also represents a critical step towards robustness and rigor for how vector control methods are assessed, including the simultaneous measurement and correlation of entomologic and epidemiologic outcomes. Data from this trial will inform further the development of novel vector control methods. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.govNCT04514107.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: RDW was measured as a predictor along with age, sex, chronic illnesses, and BMI in logistic regressions to predict hospitalization and mortality. Hospitalization and mortality odds ratios (ORs) were estimated with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RDW was evaluated separately as continuous and discrete (High RDW  14.5) variables. RESULTS: Four thousand one hundred and sixty-eight patients were included in this study, where 824 patients (19.8%) had a high RDW value 14.5% (High RDW: 64.7% were female, mean age 58 years [22] vs. Normal RDW: 60.2% female, mean age 46 years [19]). Eight hundred and twenty-nine patients had a hospitalization, where the median time between positive PCR and hospital entry was 5 [IQR 1C18] days. Models were analyzed with RDW (continuous) and adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, and BMI suggested an OR of 1.242 [95% CI = 1.187C2.688] for hospitalization and an OR of 2.911 [95% CI = 1.928C4.395] for mortality (p < .001). RDW (discrete) with the same adjustments presented an OR of 2.232 [95% CI = 1.853C1.300] for hospitalization and an OR of 1.263 [95% CI = 1.166C1.368] for mortality (p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: High RDW values obtained from community blood tests are associated with greater odds of hospitalization and mortality for patients with COVID-19. KEY MESSAGES: RDW measures before SARS-CoV-2 infection is a predictive factor for hospitalization and mortality. RDW threshold of 14.5% provides high sensitivity and specificity for COVID-19 related mortality, comparatively to other blood tests. Patient records should be accessed by clinicians for prior RDW results, if available, followed by further monitoring.","output":"Evaluating red blood cell distribution width from community blood tests as a predictor of hospitalization and mortality in adults with SARS-CoV-2: a cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 was first reported of in December of 2019 and has since developed into a global pandemic disease An intratonsillar abscess is a rarely encountered diagnosis and the clinical presentation can mimic that of a peritonsillar abscess Here, we report on two cases of intratonsillar abscess and concurrent COVID-19 infection Case 1: A 19-year old male presented with a sore throat, right-sided neck pain and difficulty swallowing Needle aspiration of a peritonsillar bulging was negative for pus Computed tomography showed an intratonsillar abscess Intratonsillar needle aspiration was again negative for pus The patient was treated with antibiotics and his condition improved without surgical intervention Case 2: A 43-year-old female presented with a sore throat, difficulty swallowing, fever and myalgia Examination showed peritonsillar swelling on the right side Computed tomography showed an intratonsillar abscess on the right side Intratonsillar needle aspiration was positive for pus The patient was treated with antibiotics and her condition improved To our knowledge, this is the first publication to report the development of intratonsillar abscess in patients with COVID-19","output":"Intratonsillar abscess in patients with COVID-19: Two case reports"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent events have reaffirmed that racism is a pervasive disease plaguing the United States and infiltrating the fabric of this nation.

This prospective multicentric study aimed at investigating radiological markers of COVID-19-related emergency activity as global estimators of pandemic evolution in France. We incorporated two sources of data from March to November 2020: an open-source epidemiological dataset, collecting daily hospitalisations, intensive care unit admissions, hospital deaths and discharges, and a teleradiology dataset corresponding to the weekly number of CT-scans performed in 65 emergency centres and interpreted remotely. CT-scans specifically requested for COVID-19 suspicion were monitored. Teleradiological and epidemiological time series were aligned. Their relationships were estimated through a cross-correlation function, and their extremes and breakpoints were compared. Dynamic linear models were trained to forecast the weekly hospitalisations based on teleradiological activity predictors. RESULTS: A total of 100,018 CT-scans were included over 36 weeks, and 19,133 (19%) performed within the COVID-19 workflow. Concomitantly, 227,677 hospitalisations were reported. Teleradiological and epidemiological time series were almost perfectly superimposed (cross-correlation coefficients at lag 0: 0.90C0.92). Maximal number of COVID-19 CT-scans was reached the week of 2020-03-23 (1 086 CT-scans), 1 week before the highest hospitalisations (23,542 patients). The best valid forecasting model combined the number of COVID-19 CT-scans and the number of hospitalisations during the prior two weeks and provided the lowest mean absolute percentage (5.09%, testing period: 2020-11-02 to 2020-11-29). CONCLUSION: Monitoring COVID-19 CT-scan activity in emergencies accurately and instantly predicts hospitalisations and helps adjust medical resources, paving the way for complementary public health indicators.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) Extension for Scoping Reviews (ScR) guidelines, we conducted a scoping review assessing MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and CINAHL from inception to April 2020 for studies investigating documentation burden among physicians and nurses in ambulatory or inpatient settings. Two reviewers evaluated each potentially relevant study for inclusion/exclusion criteria. RESULTS Of the 3482 articles retrieved, 35 studies met inclusion criteria. We identified 15 measurement characteristics, including 7 effort constructs: EHR usage and workload, clinical documentation/review, EHR work after hours and remotely, administrative tasks, cognitively cumbersome work, fragmentation of workflow, and patient interaction. We uncovered 4 time constructs: average time, proportion of time, timeliness of completion, activity rate, and 11 units of analysis. Only 45.0% of studies assessed the impact of EHRs on clinicians and/or patients and 40.0% mentioned clinician burnout. DISCUSSION Standard and validated measures of documentation burden are lacking.

The first 4 years of life are a critical window where long-term developmental patterns of body mass index (BMI) are established and a critical period for microbiota maturation. Understanding how the early-life microbiota relate to preschool growth may be useful for identifying preventive interventions for childhood obesity. We aim to investigate whether longitudinal shifts within the bacterial community between 3 months and 1 year of life are associated with preschool BMI z-score trajectories. METHODS: BMI trajectories from birth to 5 years of age were identified using group-based trajectory modeling in 3059 children. Their association with familial and environmental factors were analyzed. Infant gut microbiota at 3 months and 1 year was defined by 16S RNA sequencing and changes in diversity and composition within each BMIz trajectory were analyzed. RESULTS: Four BMIz trajectories were identified: low stable, normative, high stable, and rapid growth. Infants in the rapid growth trajectory were less likely to have been breastfed, and gained less microbiota diversity in the first year of life. Relative abundance of Akkermansia increased with age in children with stable growth, but decreased in those with rapid growth, abundance of Ruminococcus and Clostridium at 1 year were elevated in children with rapid growth. Children who were breastfed at 6 months had increased levels of Sutterella, and decreased levels of Ruminococcus and Clostridium. CONCLUSION: This study provides new insights into the relationship between the gut microbiota in infancy and patterns of growth in a cohort of preschool Canadian children.

Inactivity is associated with an increased risk of hospitalisation and mortality. Even though pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is associated with improved quality of life (fewer symptoms, greater exercise capacity), its benefits with regard to PA remain unclear. STATE OF THE ART For each patient, it is important during a respiratory rehabilitation (RR) programme to evaluate PA and its determinants. Only programs aimed at improved self-management and including educational therapy (ETP) have shown a short-term increase of PA following PR. Several studies have reported better long-term adherence when professionals help the patient to construct a personalised PA project, with regular follow-up and an array of activities (local facilities, urban walking) chosen by the patient and adapted to the environment. PERSPECTIVES The ongoing SARS-CoV2 pandemic has highlighted the importance of human interaction, even at a distance using information and communication technologies, as a means of sustaining patient motivation. Future controlled and randomized studies should focus on the long-term impact on PA of innovative strategies in patients with chronic respiratory diseases. Moreover, it would be interesting to quantify the socioeconomic impact as well as the sustainable health benefits of the different strategies outlined in this review. CONCLUSION It is not possible to offer a single solution likely to maintain RR benefits over an extended lapse of time.

CAP-associated main pathogens in adults include viruses as well as bacteria. However, large-scale epidemiological investigations of adult viral CAP in China are still lacking. In this study, we analyzed the etiology of adult CAP in Beijing, China and constructed diagnostic models based on combinations of patient clinical factors. METHODS: A multicenter cohort was established with 500 adult CAP outpatients enrolled in Beijing between November 2010 to October 2011. Multiplex and quantitative real-time fluorescence PCR were used to detect 15 respiratory viruses and mycoplasma pneumoniae, respectively. Bacteria were detected with culture and enzyme immunoassay of the Streptococcus pneumoniae urinary antigen. Univariate analysis, multivariate analysis, discriminatory analysis and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were used to build predictive models for etiological diagnosis of adult CAP. RESULTS: Pathogens were detected in 54.2% (271/500) of study patients. Viruses accounted for 36.4% (182/500), mycoplasma pneumoniae for 18.0% (90/500) and bacteria for 14.4% (72/500) of the cases. In 182 of the patients with viruses, 219 virus strains were detected, including 166 single and 53 mixed viral infections. Influenza A virus represented the greatest proportion with 42.0% (92/219) and 9.1% (20/219) in single and mixed viral infections, respectively. Factors selected for the predictive etiological diagnostic model of viral CAP included cough, dyspnea, absence of chest pain and white blood cell count (4.0-10.0)  10(9)/L, and those of mycoplasma pneumoniae CAP were being younger than 45 years old and the absence of a coexisting disease. However, these models showed low accuracy levels for etiological diagnosis (areas under ROC curve for virus and mycoplasma pneumoniae were both 0.61, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Greater consideration should be given to viral and mycoplasma pneumoniae infections in adult CAP outpatients. While predictive etiological diagnostic models of viral and mycoplasma pneumoniae based on combinations of demographic and clinical factors may provide indications of etiology, diagnostic confirmation of CAP remains dependent on laboratory pathogen test results.","output":"Etiological analysis and predictive diagnostic model building of community-acquired pneumonia in adult outpatients in Beijing, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant P.1 emerged in the city of Manaus in late 2020 during a large resurgence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and has spread throughout Brazil. The effectiveness of vaccines in settings with widespread P.1 transmission has not been reported. Methods We performed a matched test-negative case-control study to estimate the effectiveness of an inactivated vaccine, CoronaVac, in healthcare workers (HCWs) in Manaus, where P.1 accounted for 75% of genotyped SARS-CoV-2 samples at the peak of its epidemic. Information from electronic surveillance databases was used to select cases of RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and matched test-negative controls from 19 January, 2021 to 25 March, 2021. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate the effectiveness in reducing the odds of primary and secondary outcomes of, respectively, symptomatic and any SARS-CoV-2 infection. Findings Among 53,176 HCWs, 46,884 (88%) received at least one dose of CoronaVac and 2,656 (5%) underwent RT-PCR testing from 19 January, 2021 to 25 March, 2021. Of 2,797 RT-PCR tests, 776 (28%) were positive. 393 and 135 case-control pairs with and without, respectively, symptomatic illness were selected for the matched analyses. Vaccination with at least one dose was associated with a 0.50-fold reduction (adjusted vaccine effectiveness, 49.6%; 95% CI, 11.3 - 71.4) in the odds of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection during the period 14 days or more after receiving the first dose. Estimated vaccine effectiveness of at least one dose against any SARS-CoV-2 infection was 35.1% (95% CI, -6.6 - 60.5) in the same time period. Interpretation Administration of at least one dose of CoronaVac showed effectiveness against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in the setting of epidemic P.1 transmission, underscoring the need to increase vaccination efforts in response to the spread of this variant in Brazil and globally.

This could be local antiseptics (silver, other antiseptics, honey) and pain relieving drugs such as ibuprofen and morphine. New treatments such as anti-tumor necrosis factor alfa (anti-TNFalpha) and Lactobacillus plantarum cultures have also been successfully used in hard to heal, atypical wounds. Knowledge on influencing factors as smoking and biofilm on the healing process has also been improved. Smoking results in delayed healing and increased risk of postoperative infection, whereas the role of biofilm is still at an exploratory level.

Drought conditions have led to a rapid rise in semi-permanent, urban water storage containers called rainwater tanks known to be critical larval habitat for the species. The presence of these larval habitats has increased the risk of establishment of highly urbanised, invasive mosquito vectors such as Ae. aegypti. Here we use a spatially explicit network model to examine the role that unsealed rainwater tanks may play in population connectivity of an Ae. aegypti invasion in suburbs of Brisbane, a major Australian city. We characterise movement between rainwater tanks as a diffusion-like process, limited by a maximum distance of movement, average life expectancy, and a probability that Ae. aegypti will cross wide open spaces such as roads. The simulation model was run against a number of scenarios that examined population spread through the rainwater tank network based on non-compliance rates of tanks (unsealed or sealed) and road grids. We show that Ae. aegypti tank infestation and population spread was greatest in areas of high tank density and road lengths were shortest e.g. cul-de-sacs. Rainwater tank non-compliance rates of over 30% show increased connectivity when compared to less than 10%, suggesting rainwater tanks non-compliance should be maintained under this level to minimize the spread of an invading Ae. aegypti population. These results presented as risk maps of Ae. aegypti spread across Brisbane, can assist health and government authorities on where to optimally target rainwater tank surveillance and educational activities.

In this study, we conduct a multiscale geographic analysis of the spread of COVID-19 in a policy-influenced dynamic network to quantify COVID-19 importation risk under different policy scenarios using evidence from China. Our spatial dynamic panel data (SDPD) model explicitly distinguishes the effects of travel flows from the effects of transmissibility within cities, across cities, and across national borders. We find that within-city transmission was the dominant transmission mechanism in China at the beginning of the outbreak and that all domestic transmission mechanisms were muted or significantly weakened before importation posed a threat. We identify effective containment policies by matching the change points of domestic and importation transmissibility parameters to the timing of various interventions. Our simulations suggest that importation risk is limited when domestic transmission is under control, but that cumulative cases would have been almost 13 times higher if domestic transmissibility had resurged to its precontainment level after importation and 32 times higher if domestic transmissibility had remained at its precontainment level since the outbreak. Our findings provide practical insights into infectious disease containment and call for collaborative and coordinated global suppression efforts.","output":"Quantifying COVID-19 importation risk in a dynamic network of domestic cities and international countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Large scale physical distancing measures and movement restrictions imposed to contain COVID-19, often referred to as 'lockdowns', abruptly and ubiquitously restricted access to routine healthcare services. This study describes reported barriers and coping mechanisms to accessing healthcare among chronic care patients during the nationwide COVID-19 lockdown in Rwanda. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted among chronic care patients enrolled in pediatric development, HIV/AIDS, non-communicable diseases, mental health, and oncology programs at 3 rural Rwandan districts. Active patients with an appointment scheduled between March-June 2020 and a phone number recorded in the electronic medical record system were eligible. Data were collected by telephone interviews between 23rd April and 11th May 2020, with proxy reporting by caregivers for children and critically ill-patients. Fisher's exact tests were used to measure associations. Logistic regression analysis was also used to assess factors associated with reporting at least one barrier to accessing healthcare during the lockdown. RESULTS: Of 220 patient respondents, 44% reported at least one barrier to accessing healthcare. Barriers included lack of access to emergency care (n = 50; 22.7%), lack of access to medication (n = 44; 20.0%) and skipping clinical appointments (n = 37; 16.8%). Experiencing barriers was associated with the clinical program (p < 0.001), with oncology patients being highly affected (64.5%), and with increasing distance from home to the health facility (p = 0.031). In the adjusted logistic regression model, reporting at least one barrier to accessing healthcare was associated with the patient's clinical program and district of residence. Forty (18.2%) patients identified positive coping mechanisms to ensure continuation of care, such as walking long distances during suspension of public transport (n = 21; 9.6%), contacting clinicians via telephone for guidance or rescheduling appointments (n = 15; 6.8%), and delegating someone else for medication pick-up (n = 6; 2.7%). Of 124 patients who reported no barriers to accessing healthcare, 9% used positive coping mechanisms. CONCLUSION: A large proportion of chronic care patients experienced barriers to accessing healthcare during the COVID-19 lockdown. However, many patients also independently identified positive coping mechanisms to ensure continuation of care - strategies that could be formally adopted by healthcare systems in Rwanda and similar settings to mitigate effects of future lockdowns on patients.","output":"Barriers and coping mechanisms to accessing healthcare during the COVID-19 lockdown: a cross-sectional survey among patients with chronic diseases in rural Rwanda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Technology changes continually, but the principles underlying informatics, epidemiology, and disease control are persistent.

The infection SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a broad spectrum of clinical syndromes, ranging from mild upper respiratory infection to life-threatening cardiovascular complications in humans. COVID-19-associated coagulopathy, endotelitis and immune-thrombosis are typical examples that thrombosis and inflammation mutually reinforce each other. Among the basic features of the COVID-19 disease are the endothelial vascular changes affecting the whole vascular system and leading to micro-thrombosis, mainly localized in the pulmonary microcirculation. The anticoagulants are gold stone of the therapy also for its increased anti-inflammatory and endothelial protective activity. Patients with COVID-19 are at increased risk of venous thromboembolism, and therefore pharmacologic prophylaxis with use of low-molecular-weight heparin, or fondaparinux is recommended not only when hospitalized but also after discharge for up to 45 days in patients at high risk for VTE and low risk of bleeding, independently of the patient recovering mobility. For hospitalized COVID-19 patients with proximal deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, standard initial parenteral anticoagulation with therapeutic weight adjusted doses is suggested. In general, a one-size-fits-all strategy cannot be applied to COVID-19 patients. These patients need an individualized approach carefully balancing thrombotic and hemorrhagic risk. Further research is required to provide better knowledge of the pathogenesis of COVID-19, more precisely targeted treatment and the correct timing of thromboprophylaxis for this vascular disease.","output":"COVID-19-associated coagulopathy and immuno-thrombosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The following paper considers pattern recognition-aided optimization of complex and relevant problem related to optical networks.

During first lockdown phase, 40C60% reduction in aerosol loading observed over most parts except central-west India and the southern BOB. HYSPLIT model-based back trajectory suggests the increase in anthropogenic aerosols over BOB due to long-range transport from an elevated layer. During second lockdown phase, an increase in AOD found over the eastern parts of India might come from the continuous operation of coal-fired thermal power plants and coal mines, besides domestic emissions. A surge in sea salt aerosols over BOB during the last two lockdown phases could be due to the Amphan super cyclone. During unlock phases, only natural aerosols show significant variation over the coastal and neighboring ocean regions with the simultaneous presence of intense summer monsoon. However, anthropogenic aerosols increased over the inland areas, which is most prominent in second and fourth unlock phases and could be attributed to the long-range transport. Temporal analysis of particulate matters and gaseous pollutants over coastal cities suggests Ahmedabad to be the most polluted one. The highest fall in NO2 was observed over Mumbai, whereas O3 concentration was appreciably enhanced over Ahmedabad, Visakhapatnam, and Chennai. Besides low anthropogenic emissions, long-range transport and prevailing meteorological conditions also played a significant role in governing the observed changes in aerosol loading and air pollutant concentration. ? 2021 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","output":"Variability in air-pollutants, aerosols, and associated meteorology over peninsular India and neighboring ocean regions during COVID-19 lockdown to unlock phases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Digitale zorg voor chronische pati?nten heeft zich in de huisartsenpraktijk de afgelopen jaren stormachtig ontwikkeld, mede door COVID-19.

We assessed the dynamic association of COVID-19-related coagulation abnormalities with respiratory failure and mortality. DESIGN: Single-centre, prospective cohort study with descriptive analysis and logistic regression. SETTING: Tertiary care hospital, North India. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission between August 2020 and November 2020. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: We compared the coagulation abnormalities using standard coagulation tests like prothrombin time, D-dimer, platelet count, etc and point-of-care global coagulation test, Sonoclot (glass beaded(gb) and heparinase-treated(h)). Incidence of thromboembolic or bleeding events and presence of endogenous heparinoids were assessed. Cox proportional Hazards test was used to assess the predictors of 28-day mortality. MEASUREMENT: All patients underwent Sonoclot (glass beaded) test at admission apart from the routine investigations. In patients at risk of thromboembolic or bleeding phenomena, paired tests were performed at day 1 and 3 with Sonoclot. Activated clotting time (ACT) <110 s and peak amplitude >75 units were used as the cut-off for hypercoagulable state. Presence of heparin-like effect (HLE) was defined by a correction of ACT 40 s in h-Sonoclot. RESULTS: Of 215 patients admitted to ICU, we included 74 treatment naive subjects. A procoagulant profile was seen in 45.5% (n=5), 32.4% (n=11) and 20.7% (n=6) in low-flow, high-flow and invasive ventilation groups. Paired Sonoclot assays in a subgroup of 33 patients demonstrated the presence of HLE in 17 (51.5%) and 20 (62.5%) at day 1 and 3, respectively. HLE (day 1) was noted in 59% of those who bled during the disease course. Mortality was observed only in the invasive ventilation group (16, 55.2%) with overall mortality of 21.6%. HLE predicted the need for mechanical ventilation (HR 1.2 CI 1.04 to 1.4 p=0.00). On multivariate analysis, the presence of HLE (HR 1.01; CI 1.006 to 1.030; p=0.025), increased C reactive protein (HR 1.040; CI 1.020 to 1.090; p=0.014), decreased platelet function (HR 0.901; CI 0.702 to 1.100 p=0.045) predicted mortality at 28days.

However, because the value of vaccines tends to accrue to a large extent beyond the vaccinated individual, they are systematically undervalued in many current HTA processes. This is also the case in the UK, where the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) is in charge of assessing preventative vaccines, while therapeutic vaccines fall in the realm of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE). To contribute to a forward-looking perspective, we designed a framework to capture the broader value of vaccination. We reviewed the current state of the global vaccines pipeline and selected seven preventative and three therapeutic vaccines that are likely to enter the UK market within five years. We assessed on which value elements the selected vaccines would potentially generate value, and compared those against the novel broader value framework. A review of the current value elements considered by the JCVI and NICE allowed identifying the critical gaps between potential value generation and value recognition. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the broader value of vaccination has been pro-actively assessed for pipeline vaccinations. Our findings show that the existing narrow evaluation frameworks are likely to systematically undervalue the value of potential future vaccines coming to the UK market. This is particularly relevant, where their impact on AMR and other health interventions, and on the productivity of the workforce is of concern.

Patients were divided into two groups based on the severity of cholecystitis. Those with unstable hemodynamics and co-morbidities who were deemed unfit for general anesthesia were excluded. Patient demographics, surgical results, and outcome were compared between the groups. RESULTS During the study period, 117 patients diagnosed with cholecystitis were found to have common bile duct (CBD) stones and underwent LC + LCBDE. Of these 117 patients, 87 had uncomplicated cholecystitis (UC) and the remaining 30 patients had CC. There was no demographic difference between the groups, but for patients with CC there were marginally longer operative times (190 vs. 223 min, p = 0.141), more blood loss (10 vs. 150 ml, p < 0.05), and longer postoperative hospital stays (6 vs. 7 days, p < 0.05). The risk of developing major intraoperative complications was not greater for those with CC. Conversion to open cholecystectomy was necessary in a total of 12 cases (10 %) with an overall 1 % mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS Complicated cholecystitis was not a contraindication for LCBDE.

In this study we demonstrate a concept of using a combination of RDTs in an algorithm to improve their performance for diagnostics. Method: Eighty six (86) EDTA whole blood samples were collected from SARS-CoV-2 positive cases admitted at Masaka and Mbarara Regional Referral Hospitals in Uganda. These were categorized from day when confirmed positive as follows; category A (0-3 days, 10 samples), category B (4-7 days, 20 samples), Category C (8-17 days, 11 samples) and Category D (18-28 days, 20 samples). Plasma was prepared, transported to the testing laboratory and stored at -200C prior to testing. A total of 13 RDTS were tested following manufacturers instructions. Data was entered in Microsoft Excel exported to STATA for computation of sensitivity and specificity. We computed for all possible combinations of 2 of the 13 RDTS (13C2) that were evaluated in parallel algorithm.

Yet, tumors at the gastroesophageal junction, on the posterior wall, or in the distal antrum are difficult to approach. Such tumors often must be exposed via gastrotomy or using a rendezvous maneuver. Our method of total intragastric laparoscopic resection using 'pneumogastrum', rigid laparoscope, and conventional laparoscopic instruments is described in an intuitive video. METHODS Two cases of total inverse transgastric resection involved resection of a submucosal GIST, one at the front wall of the cardia and the other on the posterior wall of the antrum. The third case required excision of a large prepyloric cystic lesion leading to a gastric outlet stenosis. After insertion of three trocars under laparoscopic control, a further trocar was introduced into the stomach and 'pneumogastrum' was established. Two additional 5-mm trocars were intragastrally placed. Intragastric endoscopy with a rigid optic provided an excellent view. The tumor was exposed resected with a linear stapler. The specimen was inserted into an Endo Pouch? which was sutured to an orally inserted gastric tube. The Endo Pouch? was gently pulled transorally. After removal of the intragastric trocars, the entrance points were laparoscopically closed. RESULTS From the first and second cases, we retrieved GIST tumors. In the third case, we retrieved a gastritis cystica profunda. Postoperative course was uneventful. CONCLUSIONS Gastric GIST should be resected laparoscopically if negative margins are safely achieved regardless of its size. Tumors at the frontwall and exophytic backwall GIST are addressed by laparoscopic wedge resection. Tumors at the gastrojejunal junction, in the prepyloric region, and fundus as well as submucous GIST of the gastric backwall are best approached by intragastric laparoscopic resection.

Methods and FindingsWe combined worldwide sequencing data from GISAID and Sequence Read Archive (SRA) repositories and discovered SARS-CoV-2 hypermutation occurring in less than 2% of COVID19 patients, likely caused by host mechanisms involved APOBEC3G complexes and intra-host microdiversity. Most of this intra-host variation occurring in SARS-CoV-2 are predicted to change viral proteins with defined variant signatures, demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 can be actively shaped by the host immune system to varying degrees. At the global population level, several SARS-CoV-2 proteins such as Nsp2, 3C-like proteinase, ORF3a and ORF8 are under active evolution, as evidenced by their increased {pi}N/{pi}S ratios per geographical region. Importantly, two emergent variants: V1176F in co-occurrence with D614G mutation in the viral Spike protein, and S477N, located in the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the Spike protein, are associated with high fatality rates and are increasingly spreading throughout the world.

The standard treatment refers to the published guidelines and specialist experience which varies in different articles, and the proposed treatment refers to the kind of interest suggested in the included studies. RESULTS: A number of 45 articles met the eligibility criteria (out of 6793 articles). Among them, 26 articles involving 3263 patients were included in quantitative analysis. Anti-COVID-19 interventions could significantly increase clinical improvement (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.08C1.27; I(2) = 49.8%) and reduce the mortality rate (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.35C0.95; I(2) = 74.8%). Although in terms of negative conversion, ICU entry, and mechanical ventilation demand, clinical intervention had no beneficial effect. The clinical effect of immunomodulatory agents (especially tocilizumab and anakinra) was noticeable compared to other medications with RR of 0.22 (95% CI 0.09C0.53; I(2) = 40.9%) for mortality and 1.25 (95% CI 1.07C1.46; I(2) = 45.4%) for clinical improvement. Moreover, Antivirals (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01C1.26; I(2) = 47.0%) and convalescent plasma therapy (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.01C1.98; I(2) = 66.6%) had significant beneficial effects on clinical improvement. CONCLUSION: Based on our findings, all the included interventions significantly declined the mortality and enhanced clinical improvements with no effect on negative conversion and mechanical ventilation demand. Especially, immunomodulators and plasma therapy showed favorable outcomes.

A wild-type virus (using African green monkey VeroE6 cells), a pseudovirus (using human Caco-2 cells), and a surrogate neutralization test platform were applied to characterize the SARS-CoV-2 neutralization potential of a cohort of 111 convalescent plasma donors over a period of seven months after diagnosis. This allowed an in-depth validation and assay performance analysis of these platforms. More importantly, we found that SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers were stable or even increased within the observation period, which contradicts earlier studies reporting a rapid waning of Ab titers after three to four months. Moreover, we observed a positive correlation of neutralization titers with increasing age, number of symptoms reported, and the presence of the Rhesus Ag RhD. Validation of the platforms revealed that highest assay performances were obtained with the wild-type virus and the surrogate neutralization platforms. However, our data also suggested that selection of cutoff titers had a strong impact on the evaluation of neutralization potency. When taking strong neutralization potency, as demonstrated by the wild-type virus platform as the gold standard, up to 55% of plasma products had low neutralization titers. However, a significant portion of these products were overrated in their potency when using the surrogate assay with the recommended cutoff titer. In summary, our study demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers are stable for at least seven months after diagnosis and offers a testing strategy for rapid selection of high-titer convalescent plasma products in a biosafety level 1 environment.","output":"Characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization Potential of COVID-19-Convalescent Donors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Influenza A virus belongs to the most studied virus and its mutant initiates epidemic and pandemics outbreaks. Inoculation is the significant foundation to diminish the risk of infection. To prevent an incidence of influenza from the transmission, various practical approaches require more advancement and progress. More efforts and research must take in front to enhance vaccine efficacy. METHODS: The present research emphasizes the development and expansion of a universal vaccine for the influenza virus. Research focuses on vaccine design with high efficacy. In this study, numerous computational approaches were used, covering a wide range of elements and ideas in bioinformatics methodology. Various B and T-cell epitopic peptides derived from the Neuraminidase protein N1 are recognized by these approaches. With the implementation of numerous obtained databases and bioinformatics tools, the different immune framework methods of the conserved sequences of N1 neuraminidase were analyzed. NCBI databases were employed to retrieve amino acid sequences. The antigenic nature of the neuraminidase sequence was achieved by the VaxiJen server and Kolaskar and Tongaonkar method. After screening of various B and T cell epitopes, one efficient peptide each from B cell epitope and T cell epitopes was assessed for their antigenic determinant vaccine efficacy. Identical two B cell epitopes were recognized from the N1 protein when analyzed using B-cell epitope prediction servers. The detailed examination of amino acid sequences for interpretation of B and T cell epitopes was achieved with the help of the ABCPred and Immune Epitope Database. RESULTS: Computational immunology via immunoinformatic study exhibited RPNDKTG as having its high conservancy efficiency and demonstrated as a good antigenic, accessible surface hydrophilic B-cell epitope. Among T cell epitope analysis, YVNISNTNF was selected for being a conserved epitope. T cell epitope was also analyzed for its allergenicity and cytotoxicity evaluation. YVNISNTNF epitope was found to be a non-allergen and not toxic for cells as well. This T-cell epitope with maximum world populace coverages was scrutinized for its association with the HLA-DRB1*0401 molecule. Results from docking simulation analyses showed YVNISNTNF having lower binding energy, the radius of gyration (Rg), RMSD values, and RMSE values which make the protein structure more stable and increase its ability to become an epitopic peptide for influenza virus vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that this epitope analysis may be successfully used as a measurement tool for the robustness of an antigenCantibody reaction between mutant strains in the annual design of the influenza vaccine.","output":"In silico epitope-based vaccine design against influenza a neuraminidase protein: Computational analysis established on B- and T-cell epitope predictions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social and behavioural factors are critical to the emergence, spread and containment of human disease, and are key determinants of the course, duration and outcomes of disease outbreaks.

METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Two hundred sixty four caregivers completed an online survey that assessed demographics, use and perspective on tele-rehabilitation, homecare therapy, caregivers strain and mental health. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: The prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms were found to be 62.5 %, 20.5 % and 36.4 % respectively. A significant difference in caregiver strain (p < 0.001, effect size = 0.93) was observed during the outbreak compared to levels pre-outbreak (pre-outbreak strain was measured retrospectively). Caregivers not using tele-rehabilitation along with a perception of it being a poor medium for rehabilitation were at greater risks for poor mental health whereas a negative perception on homecare therapy were strongly associated with higher psychological symptoms and strain. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This study identified a high prevalence of depression and significant change in strain displayed by caregivers during the COVID-19 outbreak.

The practice of preventive measures of the disease supports containment processes of the spread of coronavirus. However, the practice of preventive measures is affected by several associated risk factors. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the associated factors that limit the youths' practice of preventive measures against COVID-19 in the study area. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted. The study used a quantitative approach for collecting data from 384 youths using a survey method. Not practicing preventive measures was measured to determine whether or not youths applied hygiene practices, kept their distance, restricted their movements, and sought self-help or support in the past two months. Descriptive statistics were used to assess the distribution of study participants, and a binary regression model was executed to examine the association factors with inability to practice preventive measures with a p-value < 0.05 statistically significant. RESULTS: Male youths (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 0.06; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.16) were less likely to practice preventive measures. Older youth (AOR = 1.33; 95% CI: 1.13, 1.56), with higher education level (AOR = 1.03; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.06), and who had higher income (AOR = 1.34; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.78) were more likely to practice preventive measures. Further, the belief in the body's immunity to resist the disease (AOR = 0.27; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.67), lack of paying attention to the disease (AOR = 0.07; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.73), ignorance of evidence to the disease (AOR = 0.31; 95% CI: 0.13, 0.74), ease of restriction of movements (AOR = 0.29; 95% CI: 0.12, 0.72), lack of sensitization to actions in the community (AOR = 0.39; 95% CI: 0.16, 0.96), and substance use (AOR = 0.11; 95% CI: 0.05, 0.21) were other factors that were inversely related to practicing preventive measures. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggested that more intervention efforts, by either communicating to or reaching out all groups, should be employed.

Earlier studies have also pointed to healthier behaviors among whole blood donors than the general population. This study is aimed at assessing the prevalence of four healthy behaviors (sufficient physical activity, avoiding cigarette smoking, low to moderate alcohol use, and maintaining a healthy weight) among platelet donors and to compare the results with those in the general population of similar ages. METHODS: Eighty-six platelet donors were asked to complete a questionnaire designed to assess physical activity, smoking, and alcohol use. Sociodemographic information including gender, age, and education was also collected from all participants. Chi-square statistics and logistic regression were used in statistical analysis. RESULTS: The mean age of the study donors was 51 years, 56% were female. Most were employed (90%), and 48% hold a bachelor's or higher degree. The prevalence of healthy behaviors differed by education gradients but not by gender and age. About 49% of the donors met the weekly physical activity recommendations, less than 5% were daily smokers, and~26% were classified as more frequent drinkers (1 to 5 times per week). The corresponding percentages for the general population were, respectively, 33%, 13%, and 35%. The prevalence of overweight and obesity, as assessed by body mass index (BMI), among donors were 50% and 29%, respectively, much higher than the current prevalence of overweight and obesity of 37% and 19%, respectively, among adults in the general population. CONCLUSIONS: The individual health behaviors of the majority of the study population could be characterized by a relatively high level of physical activity, low prevalence of daily smoking, and moderate alcohol drinking.

All students (n=938 in Indonesia, n=734 in Thailand, and n=313 in Taiwan) answered questions concerning their anxiety, suicidal thoughts (or sadness), confidence in pandemic control, risk perception of susceptibility to infection, perceived support, resources for fighting infection, and sources of information in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Among the 3 student groups, Thai students had the highest levels of anxiety but the lowest levels of confidence in pandemic control and available resources for fighting COVID-19. Factors associated with higher anxiety differed across countries. Less perceived satisfactory support was associated with more suicidal thoughts among Indonesian students. On the other hand, Taiwanese students were more negatively affected by information gathered from the internet and from medical staff than were Indonesian or Thai students. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that health care providers in Thailand may need to pay special attention to Thai university students given that high levels of anxiety were observed in this study population.

We modeled such media impacts using a piecewise smooth function depending on both the case number and its rate of change.

By parameterizing the proposed model with the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza outbreak data in the Shaanxi province of China, we observed that media impact switched off almost as the epidemic peaked. Our analysis implies that media coverage significantly delayed the epidemic's peak and decreased the severity of the outbreak. Moreover, media impacts are not always effective in lowering the disease transmission during the entire outbreak, but switch on and off in a highly nonlinear fashion with the greatest effect during the early stage of the outbreak. The finding draws the attention to the important role of informing the public about the rate of change of case numbers' rather than the absolute number of cases' to alter behavioral changes, through a self-adaptive media impact switching on and off, for better control of disease transmission.","output":"Media impact switching surface during an infectious disease outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To assess the quality of molecular detection of respiratory viruses in clinical diagnostic laboratories.

Generic probiotic therapies have shown promise, but seem to lack specificity. We hypothesised that healthy children with no history of AOM carry protective commensal bacteria that could be translated into a specific probiotic therapy to break the cycle of re-infection. We characterised the nasopharyngeal microbiome of these children (controls) in comparison to children with rAOM (cases) to identify potentially protective bacteria. As some children with rAOM do not appear to carry any of the known otopathogens, we also hypothesised that characterisation of the middle ear microbiome could identify novel otopathogens, which may also guide the development of more effective therapies. RESULTS: Middle ear fluids, middle ear rinses and ear canal swabs from the cases and nasopharyngeal swabs from both groups underwent 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The nasopharyngeal microbiomes of cases and controls were distinct. We observed a significantly higher abundance of Corynebacterium and Dolosigranulum in the nasopharynx of controls.

Gemella and Neisseria were characteristic of the case nasopharynx, but were not prevalent in the middle ear. CONCLUSIONS: Corynebacterium and Dolosigranulum are characteristic of a healthy nasopharyngeal microbiome. Alloiococcus, Staphylococcus and Turicella are possible novel otopathogens, though their rarity in the nasopharynx and prevalence in the ear canal means that their role as normal aural flora cannot be ruled out. Gemella and Neisseria are unlikely to be novel otopathogens as they do not appear to colonise the middle ear in children with rAOM.

The data source for this study was the Current Population Survey, May 2020 through July 2021. The results showed that in the reduced model, the odds for Black and Hispanic workers to telework were 35% and 55% lower, respectively, and for Asian workers 44% higher than for White workers, controlling for covariates. When four-year college education and occupation were included as mediator variables in the model, the odds for Black and Hispanic workers to telework were reduced to 7% and 16%, respectively. Overall, disparities in four-year college education and occupation explained 83% and 78% of the variation in the odds of teleworking for Black and Hispanic workers, respectively. Between the mediators, occupation explained more than 60% of the total effect. The results of this study could not rule out the possibility of racial discrimination in teleworking.

Methods: We analyzed data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System from 2012 to 2016, excluding 2014. For Black, Hispanic, and low-income (<$35,000/year) adults 18C64 years of age, we estimated multivariable regression adjusted pre- (2012C2013) to post-ACA (2015C2016) percentage point changes in uninsurance for each U.S. state. We compared absolute and relative changes and the proportion remaining uninsured post-ACA across states. We also examined whether state-level variation in coverage gains was associated with changes in forgoing needed care due to cost. Results: The range in the percentage point reduction in uninsurance varied substantially across states: 19-fold for Black (0.9C17.4), 18-fold for Hispanic (1.2C21.5), and 23-fold for low-income (1.0C27.8) adults. State-level variation in changes in uninsurance relative to baseline uninsurance rates also varied substantially. In some states, more than one quarter of Black, one half of Hispanic, and approaching one half of low-income adults remained uninsured after full implementation of the ACA. Compared with states in the lowest quintile of change in coverage, states in the highest quintile experienced greater improvements in ability to see a physician. Conclusions: Performance on reducing uninsurance for Black, Hispanic, and low-income Americans under the ACA varied substantially among U.S. states with some making substantial progress and others making little.

Its effects on the respiratory system of the susceptible population have been less characterized. This study aimed to estimate the association of short-term PM2.5 exposure with respiratory outcomes of the retired adults, and to examine whether these associations were stronger among the subjects with GSTT-null genotype. 32 healthy subjects (55-77 years) were recruited for five follow-up examinations. Ambient concentrations of PM2.5 were monitored consecutively for 7 days prior to physical examination. Pulmonary outcomes including forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), peak expiratory flow (PEF), and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), and nasal fluid concentrations of 8-epi-prostaglandin F2 alpha (8-epi-PGF2), tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and IL-1 were measured. A linear mixed-effect model was introduced to evaluate the associations of PM2.5 concentrations with respiratory outcomes. Additionally, GSTT1 genotype-based stratification was performed to characterize modification on PM2.5-related respiratory outcomes. We found that a 10 g/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with decreases of 0.52 L (95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.04, -0.002), 0.64 L (95% CI: -1.13, -0.16), 0.1 (95% CI: -0.23, 0.04) and 2.87 L/s (95% CI: -5.09, -0.64) in FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio and PEF at lag 2, respectively.

Flavonoids, important secondary metabolites of plants, have long been studied as therapeutic interventions in inflammatory diseases due to their cytokine-modulatory effects. In this review, we discuss the potential role of flavonoids in the modulation of signaling pathways that are crucial for COVID-19 disease, particularly those related to inflammation and immunity. The immunomodulatory ability of flavonoids, carried out by the regulation of inflammatory mediators, the inhibition of endothelial activation, NLRP3 inflammasome, toll-like receptors (TLRs) or bromodomain containing protein 4 (BRD4), and the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), might be beneficial in regulating the cytokine storm during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, the ability of flavonoids to inhibit dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), neutralize 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) or to affect gut microbiota to maintain immune response, and the dual action of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) may potentially also be applied to the exaggerated inflammatory responses induced by SARS-CoV-2. Based on the previously proven effects of flavonoids in other diseases or on the basis of newly published studies associated with COVID-19 (bioinformatics, molecular docking), it is reasonable to assume positive effects of flavonoids on inflammatory changes associated with COVID-19. This review highlights the current state of knowledge of the utility of flavonoids in the management of COVID-19 and also points to the multiple biological effects of flavonoids on signaling pathways associated with the inflammation processes that are deregulated in the pathology induced by SARS-CoV-2. The identification of agents, including naturally occurring substances such as flavonoids, represents great approach potentially utilizable in the management of COVID-19. Although not clinically investigated yet, the applicability of flavonoids against COVID-19 could be a promising strategy due to a broad spectrum of their biological activities.","output":"Flavonoids against the SARS-CoV-2 induced inflammatory storm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, cases of reinfection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported, raising additional public health concerns. SARS-CoV-2 reinfection was assessed in healthcare workers in Tunisia, as they are at the greatest exposure to infection by different variants. Methods We conducted whole-genome sequencing of the viral RNA from clinical specimens at the initial infection and suspected second infection from four healthcare workers, working at the Habib Bourguiba University Hospital (Sfax, Tunisia), who were retested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR after recovery from a first infection. A total of 8 viral RNAs from the patients respiratory specimens were obtained, which allowed us to characterize the differences between viral genomes from initial infection and positive retest. The serology status for total Ig, IgG, and IgM against SARS-CoV-2 was also determined and followed after the first infection. Results We confirmed by whole-genome sequencing of the viral samples that all four cases experienced a reinfection event. The interval between the two infection events ranged from 45 to 141 days and symptoms were milder in the second infection for two patients and more severe for the two remaining cases. Reinfection occurred for all four cases, despite the presence of antibodies for three of them. Conclusion This study adds to the rapidly growing evidence of COVID-19 reinfection, where viral sequences were used to confirm infection by distinct isolates of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers. These findings suggest that individuals, who are exposed to different SARS-CoV-2 variants, might not acquire sufficiently protective immunity through natural infection and emphasis the necessity of their vaccination and the regular follow-up of their immune status both in quantitative and qualitative terms.","output":"Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 Symptomatic Reinfection in Four Health Care Professionals from the Same Hospital Despite the Presence of Antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Skin pigmentation is both a highly variable and highly visible human phenotypic trait. Investigations into the biology and origins of this variation have been the focus of research in the fields of dermatology, anthropology, and forensic science, among others. This manuscript explores how much of what we know about the biology, genetics, and evolutionary origins of pigmentation has been strongly influenced by investigations and applications that focus on lighter skin. METHODS I reviewed literature from the fields of dermatology, anthropology and evolutionary genetics, and forensic science to assess how perceptions of lighter skin as the \\"normal\\" state in humans can shape the ways that knowledge is gathered and applied in these fields. RESULTS This normalization of lighter skin has impacted common tools used in dermatology and shaped the framework of dermatological education. A strong Eurocentric bias has shaped our understanding of the genetic architecture of pigmentary traits, which influences the ways in we understand the evolutionary processes leading to modern pigmentation diversity. Finally, I discuss how these biases in pigmentation genetics work in combination with phenotypic systems that privilege predicting lighter pigmentation variation to impede accurate prediction of intermediate phenotypes, particularly in individuals with ancestry from multiple populations. This can lead to a disproportionate targeting of already over-policed populations with darker skin. CONCLUSIONS Potential changes to how we conceptualize clinical and basic pigmentation research may help to reduce existing health disparities and improve understanding of pigmentation genetic architecture and how this knowledge is applied in forensic contexts.","output":"The color of normal: How a Eurocentric focus erases pigmentation complexity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) remain a serious public health problem. In previous work, two models of an intensive care unit (ICU) showed that differing population structures had markedly different rates of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) transmission. One explanation for this difference is the models having differing long-term equilbrium dynamics, resulting from different basic reproductive numbers, R(0). We find in this system however that this is not the case, and that both models had the same value for R(0). Instead, short-term, transient dynamics, characterizing a series of small, self-limiting outbreaks caused by pathogen reintroduction were responsible for the differences. These results show the importance of these short-term factors for disease systems where reintroduction events are frequent, even if they are below the epidemic threshold. Further, we examine how subtle changes in how a hospital is organizedor how a model assumes a hospital is organizedin terms of the admission of new patients may impact transmission rates.

Thus, the research adopts a psychosocial perspective on spirituality and applies thematic analysis to qualitatively analyze written narratives. The results reveal that many respondents underwent a three-part, not-necessarily-sequential process of collapsing, self-distancing, and transcending during lockdown, which allowed them to rearrange themselves according to the new total social fact of the pandemic. Through this process, respondents negotiated themes of semiotic crisis, striving for meaning, and beyond meaning (the essential).

The aim of this research was to review evidence on emergency general patients operated on during the pandemic compared to patients undergoing emergency surgery during non-pandemic times to determine if operating during the Covid-19 pandemic led to an increased risk of death, length of hospital stay and complications. Method: A systematic review of the literature was performed. PubMed, Cochrane, MEDLINE, Science Direct, Springer Link, Elsevier, and reference lists were analysed for inclusion on 2 January 2021. Results: Nine studies and 5,022 patients were included. There were no significant differences in the control group vs pandemic group in mean age (52.3yrs vs 51.9yrs, p=0.67) or gender (44.4% females vs 49.3%, p=0.173). Pooled analysis of control vs pandemic showed a mortality rate of 1.26% vs 3.06% (CI:-6.58-6.58, p=1.00). Mean length of hospital stay was 7.9 vs 7.7 days in control v. pandemic (CI: -2.93-3.33, p=0.87) and post-operative complication rate of 20.2% vs 25.7% (CI -6.4-25.0, p=0.20), (control vs pandemic).

Rodent lungs were mechanically ventilated and imaged at various time points during the respiratory cycle. Pressure-Volume (P-V) characteristics were recorded to capture any changes in overall lung mechanical behaviour during the experiment. A sequence of tomograms was collected from the lungs within the intact thoracic cavity. Digital volume correlation (DVC) was used to compute the three-dimensional strain field at the alveolar level from the time sequence of reconstructed tomograms. Regional differences in ventilation were highlighted during the respiratory cycle, relating the local strains within the lung tissue to the global ventilation measurements. Strains locally reached approximately 150% compared to the averaged regional deformations of approximately 80C100%. Redistribution of air within the lungs was observed during cycling. Regions which were relatively poorly ventilated (low deformations compared to its neighbouring region) were deforming more uniformly at later stages of the experiment (consistent with its neighbouring region). Such heterogenous phenomena are common in everyday breathing. In pathological lungs, some of these non-uniformities in deformation behaviour can become exaggerated, leading to poor function or further damage.

RESULTS: The prevalence of moderate and severe wasting was 7.0% and 1.8%, respectively, whereas the prevalence of moderate and severe stunting was 19.2% and 8.0%, while 16.4% and 3.6% of children were moderately and severely underweight. Children from the poorest and poor households were suffering from at least one form of malnutrition. Adjusted ORs were estimated by controlling socio-economic and demographic risk factors, such as poor maternal body mass index, parents lower education level, use of unhygienic toilet, child age in months, and recent experience of diarrhea and fever. The pattern was almost similar for each malnutrition status (i.e., stunting, underweight, and wasting) in the poorest and poor households. CONCLUSION: Bangladesh achieved the Millennium Development Goals, focusing primarily on health-related indicators and working to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Even considering this success, the prevalence of malnutrition and poverty in same household remains relatively high compared to other developing countries. Therefore, the study recommends the implementation of nationwide systematic measures to prevent poverty and malnutrition.","output":"Poverty and childhood malnutrition: Evidence-based on a nationally representative survey of Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we examine university discretionary interpretation of the 2020 social upheaval that emanated from George Floyds murder as an element of university social responsibility (USR) policymaking. The paper addresses two research questions: (a) What are university presidents implicit and explicit social justice responses to George Floyds death and the idealistic protests of 2020? (b) To what degree are principles of social justice embedded in universities intellectual roots and social responsibility? Using a sample of university presidents public statements in response to George Floyds death and the idealistic protests of 2020, we analyze the response and responsibilities of universities in the struggle for a just society. We cross-check mission statements and strategic plans to corroborate universities public statements with their institutional philosophies, mission, and action plans relating to discrimination against racial and ethnic minorities and systemic racism. We use critical discourse analysis and the Voyant Tool to perform a textual analysis of 62 university presidents letters and mission statements. They all denounced the dehumanization and inequitable treatment of Black people. An important implication of our work is the sharp difference in the depth and forthrightness of responses by university presidents across university types. Some presidential letters are forthright in their denouncement of the murder of George Floyd and systemic racism, while others were, at best, vague in their approach. Presidential letters disclose their institutions priorities, organizational identities, and social responsibility convictions. Overall, mission statements and strategic plans included addressing systemic racism and inequality. While there is no ordered symmetry between presidential narratives and institutional action, we anticipate social responsibility as a core institutional value. We argue for social justice anti-racist platforms as critical dimensions of USR. We call for university milieus that promote a fair and just society among all stakeholders.","output":"University Social Responsibility: Challenging Systemic Racism in the Aftermath of George Floyds Murder"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Modular design is a widely used strategy that meets diverse customer requirements. Close relationships exist between parts inside a module and loose linkages between modules in the modular products. A change of one part or module may cause changes of other parts or modules, which in turn propagate through a product. This paper aims to present an approach to analyze the associations and change impacts between modules and identify influential modules in modular product design. The proposed framework explores all possible change propagation paths (CPPs), and measures change impact degrees between modules. In this article, a design structure matrix (DSM) is used to express dependence relationships between parts, and change propagation trees of affected parts within module are constructed. The influence of the affected part in the corresponding module is also analyzed, and a reachable matrix is employed to determine reachable parts of change propagation. The parallel breadth-first algorithm is used to search propagation paths. The influential modules are identified according to their comprehensive change impact degrees that are computed by the bat algorithm. Finally, a case study on the grab illustrates the impacts of design change in modular products.","output":"Identification of Influential Modules Considering Design Change Impacts Based on Parallel Breadth-First Search and Bat Algorithm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The primary objective is to demonstrate that, in patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 resulting in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), administration of 120mg/kg of body weight of intravenous Prolastin?(plasma-purified alpha-1 antitrypsin) reduces circulating plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6). Secondary objectives are to determine the effects of intravenous Prolastin? on important clinical outcomes including the incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). TRIAL DESIGN: Phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot trial. PARTICIPANTS: The study will be conducted in Intensive Care Units in hospitals across Ireland. Patients with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2-infection, moderate to severe ARDS (meeting Berlin criteria for a diagnosis of ARDS with a PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio <200 mmHg), >18 years of age and requiring invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation. All individuals meeting any of the following exclusion criteria at baseline or during screening will be excluded from study participation: more than 96 hours has elapsed from onset of ARDS; age < 18 years; known to be pregnant or breastfeeding; participation in a clinical trial of an investigational medicinal product (other than antibiotics or antivirals) within 30 days; major trauma in the prior 5 days; presence of any active malignancy (other than nonmelanoma skin cancer) which required treatment within the last year; WHO Class III or IV pulmonary hypertension; pulmonary embolism prior to hospital admission within past 3 months; currently receiving extracorporeal life support (ECLS); chronic kidney disease receiving dialysis; severe chronic liver disease with Child-Pugh score > 12; DNAR (Do Not Attempt Resuscitation) order in place; treatment withdrawal imminent within 24 hours; Prisoners; non-English speaking patients or those who do not adequately understand verbal or written information unless an interpreter is available; IgA deficiency. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Intervention: Either a once weekly intravenous infusion of Prolastin? at 120mg/kg of body weight for 4 weeks or a single dose of Prolastin? at 120mg/kg of body weight intravenously followed by once weekly intravenous infusion of an equal volume of 0.9% sodium chloride for a further 3 weeks. Comparator (placebo): An equal volume of 0.9% sodium chloride intravenously once per week for four weeks. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary effectiveness outcome measure is the change in plasma concentration of IL-6 at 7 days as measured by ELISA. Secondary outcomes include: safety and tolerability of Prolastin? in the respective groups (as defined by the number of SAEs and AEs); PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio; respiratory compliance; sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score; mortality; time on ventilator in days; plasma concentration of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) as measured by nephelometry; plasma concentrations of interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-10 (IL-10), soluble TNF receptor 1 (sTNFR1, a surrogate marker for TNF-) as measured by ELISA; development of shock; acute kidney injury; need for renal replacement therapy; clinical relapse, as defined by the need for readmission to the ICU or a marked decline in PaO(2)/FiO(2) or development of shock or mortality following a period of sustained clinical improvement; secondary bacterial pneumonia as defined by the combination of radiographic findings and sputum/airway secretion microscopy and culture. RANDOMISATION: Following informed consent/assent patients will be randomised. The randomisation lists will be prepared by the study statistician and given to the unblinded trial personnel. However, the statistician will not be exposed to how the planned treatment will be allocated to the treatment codes. Randomisation will be conducted in a 1:1:1 ratio, stratified by site and age. BLINDING (MASKING): The investigator, treating physician, other members of the site research team and patients will be blinded to treatment allocation. The clinical trial pharmacy personnel and research nurses will be unblinded to facilitate intervention and placebo preparation. The unblinded individuals will keep the treatment information confidential. The infusion bag will be masked at the time of preparation and will be administered via a masked infusion set to maintain blinding. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): A total of 36 patients will be recruited and randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to each of the trial arms. TRIAL STATUS: In March 2020, version 1.0 of the trial protocol was submitted to the local research ethics committee (REC), Health Research Consent Declaration Committee (HRCDC) and the Health Products regulatory Authority (HPRA). REC approval was granted on April 1(st) 2020, HPRA approval was granted on April 24(th) 2020 and the HRCDC provided a conditional declaration on April 17(th) 2020. In July 2020 a substantial amendment (version 2.0) was submitted to the REC, HRCDC and HPRA. Protocol changes in this amendment included: the addition of trial sites; extending the duration of the trial to 12 months from 3 months; removal of inclusion criteria requiring the need for vasopressors; amendment of randomisation schedule to stratify by age only and not BMI and sex; correction of grammatical error in relation to infusion duration; to allow for inclusion of subjects who may have been enrolled in a clinical trial involving either antibiotics or anti-virals in the past 30 days; to allow for inclusion of subjects who may be currently enrolled in a clinical trial involving either antibiotics or anti-virals; to remove the need for exclusion based on alpha-1 antitrypsin phenotype; removal of mandatory isoelectric focusing of plasma to confirm Pi*MM status at screening; removal of need for mandatory echocardiogram at screening; amendment on procedures around plasma analysis to reflect that this will be conducted at the central site laboratory (as trial is multi-site and no longer single site); wording amended to reflect that interim analysis of cytokine levels taken at 7 days may be conducted. HRCDC approved version 2.0 on September 14th 2020, and HPRA approved on October 22nd 2020. REC approved the substantial amendment on November 23(rd). In November 2020, version 3.0 of the trial protocol was submitted to the REC and HPRA. The rationale for this amendment was to allow for patients with moderate to severe ARDS from SARS-CoV-2 with non-invasive ventilation. HPRA approved this amendment on December 1st 2020 and the REC approved the amendment on December 8th 2020. Patient recruitment commenced in April 2020 and the last patient will be recruited to the trial in April 2021. The last visit of the last patient is anticipated to occur in April 2021.

The assembly of HBsAg into cylindrical and spherical particles occurred intracellularly within the endoplasmic reticulum. HBsAg particles accumulated within large dilated areas of the endoplasmic reticulum and remained within these structures for most of the time prior to secretion from the cells. Once the particles were formed, the HBsAg polypeptides did not appear to become associated with subsequent intracellular organelle membranes or the plasma membrane. HBsAg within the dilated structures did not bind wheat germ agglutinin, indicating that its oligosaccharide chains had not yet been processed to the complex form (containing terminal sialic acid-N-acetylglucosamine residues). The oligosaccharide chains of HBsAg are processed to the complex form and can be detected on the HBsAg after secretion, but this event was not detected within cells. In addition, HBsAg was not observed on the cell surface by indirect immunofluorescence or immunoprecipitation, although immunoelectron microscopy revealed some staining at or near the cell surface. These results suggested that HBsAg was either secreted from cells without being incorporated into the plasma membrane, or that the levels of HBsAg in the plasma membrane were below the limits of detection.","output":"Intracellular assembly and packaging of hepatitis B surface antigen particles occur in the endoplasmic reticulum."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, a new, severe and unusual condition called Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in children emerged, from which there is still much to learn.

Receptor-mediated uptake of oxLDL by the monocyte-derived macrophages activates the long-term epigenetic reprogramming of innate immunity, which is termed trained immunity. The aim of this work is to investigate the mechanisms and treatment possibilities that can control the activities of these specific macrophages. METHODS: Search in Medline and PubMed relevant articles on the trained immunity and cytokine storm of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: When oxLDL-trained macrophages encounter SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) in the lung, it causes unregulated cytokine secretion, leading to the alveolar damage. Therefore, blocking macrophage training by pioglitazone, a thiazolidinedione, could control the hyperactivation that the virus would trigger.","output":"Role of oxidized LDL-induced trained macrophages in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and benefits of pioglitazone: A hypothesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pertussis causes severe disease in young unvaccinated infants, with preterms potentially at highest risk. We studied pertussis in hospitalized infants as related to gestational age (GA) and vaccination history. METHODS: Medical record data of 0-2y old patients hospitalized for pertussis during 2005C2014 were linked to vaccination data. Multivariable logistic regression was used to study the association between GA and vaccination history on the clinical disease course. We compared vaccine effectiveness (VE) against hospitalization for pertussis between term and preterm infants (i.e., <37w GA) using the screening method as developed by Farrington. RESULTS: Of 1187 records, medical data from 676 were retrieved. Of these, 12% concerned preterms, whereas they are 8% of Dutch birth cohorts. Median age at admission was 3 m for preterms and 2 m for terms (p < 0.001). Preterms more often had received pertussis vaccination (62% vs 44%; p = 0.01) and more often had coinfections (37% vs 21%; p = 0.01). Preterms tended more often to have complications, to require artificial respiration or to need admittance to the intensive care unit (ICU). Preterms had longer ICU stays (15d vs 9d; p = 0.004). Vaccinated preterms and terms had a lower median length of hospital stay and lower crude risks of apneas and the need for artificial respiration, additional oxygen, and ICU admittance than those not vaccinated. After adjustment for presence of coinfections and age at admittance, these differences were not significant, except the lower need of oxygen treatment in vaccinated terms. Effectiveness of the first vaccination against pertussis hospitalizations was 95% (95% CI 93C96%) and 73% (95% CI 20C91%) in terms and preterms, respectively. Effectiveness of the second dose of the primary vaccination series was comparable in both groups (86 and 99%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Infants hospitalized for pertussis suffer from severe disease. Preterms were overrepresented, with higher need for intensive treatment and less VE of first vaccination. These findings stress the need for alternative prevention, in particular prenatal vaccination of mothers, to reduce pertussis in both groups.","output":"Pertussis hospitalizations among term and preterm infants: clinical course and vaccine effectiveness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The possibilities given by artificial intelligence are becoming enactments of what once were just distant fictional displays.

Its institutional leadership in long-established multilateral organizations has grown.

Students who lack this skill may over-estimate their knowledge and under-prepare for exams, resulting in poor academic performance. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the ability of allied health students to evaluate their exam performance in an anatomy course to identify which groups, if any, need support with this skill. Methods In an IRB-approved study, first-year physician assistant (PA), physical therapy (PT), and occupational therapy (OT) students (n=129) participated in a doctoral-level anatomy course. This course covered human anatomy through asynchronous lectures and synchronous virtual labs (due to COVID). Students? anatomical knowledge was assessed via four exams throughout the course. Prior to the start of the course and again at the end, students were invited to complete a de-identified pre-survey including the Metacognitive Awareness Inventory (MAI), a 52-item survey that assesses metacognition. Throughout the course, students were asked to reflect on their exam performances (anticipated grade, actual grade, and satisfaction) using a modified Likert scale. For analyses, students were divided into terciles based on their mean combined exam performance. Reflections and MAI scores were then compared across terciles in SPSS using Kruskal-Wallis H test. Results Average exam scores of high (93%2.0), middle (86%2.7), and low-performers (74%4.6) were significantly different from each other (p&lt;0.01). A total of 113 (88%) and 59 (46%) students completed the pre- and post-surveys, respectively, resulting in 52 matched pairs (40%). Overall, students significantly improved their metacognition (p&lt;0.01). Reflection participation ranged from 67% to 97%. When asked how their actual grade measured against their anticipated grade, high- and middle-performers? anticipated grades were similar to each other but significantly higher than those of low-performers (p&lt;0.01 for three exams). High-performers reported significantly greater exam satisfaction than middle- and low-performers on two exams (p&lt;0.01). The performance terciles scored similarly across all metacognition subcategories in the post-survey except declarative knowledge, the factual knowledge of structures and concepts that provides the foundation for higher-order thinking (p=0.01). Conclusion In this study, middle-performers appear to have the greatest mismatch between their anticipated grade, actual grade, and exam satisfaction when compared to high- and low-performers. These students anticipate strong exam performances, but appear to fall short, leaving them less satisfied. This metacognitive disconnect may be related to how students evaluate their knowledge. Students seem to evaluate their progress based on their declarative knowledge, which may not accurately represent their ability to apply that knowledge. Significance Metacognitive activities that improve student self-evaluation skills should be implemented in anatomy courses to minimize the metacognitive disconnect between anticipated and actual exam performance.","output":"Metacognition in the Middle: Mismatch between Anticipated and Actual Exam Grades of Allied Health Anatomy Students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic represents a crisis that affects several aspects of people's lives around the globe.

METHODS We analyzed patients in the REHAB-HF Trial. Patients were 60 years with preserved or reduced ejection fraction who were hospitalized with ADHF. RESULTS Of 202 patients, 67 (33.2%) lived alone. Patients who lived alone had a mean age of 72.47.8 years, 64% (n=43) of whom were female, 52% (n=35) were non-white and had a mean 6.15.5 comorbidities. Patients living alone were largely similar in baseline characteristics, comorbid burden and prescribed medications to patients living with someone else. However, patients living alone were more likely to be female than patients living with someone else (63% [n=43] vs. 49% [n=66], p=0.04). Patients living alone had severe impairments in physical function and QoL. Cognitive dysfunction was present in 81% of those living alone. However, after adjusting for sex, no differences in physical function, depression, cognitive dysfunction or QoL were noted between patients who lived alone or those who lived with someone else. CONCLUSIONS In this diverse population of older ADHF patients, 33% lived alone (versus 26% in the general population). Those living alone were more often female, non-white, and had >6 comorbidities.

To explore strategies for increasing access to palliative care among individuals living in remote/rural communities, a rapid review was conducted on studies that explored the use of telehealth applications with this population. From December 2019 to February 2020, the PRISMA methodology was used to gather peer-reviewed studies published in the English language. MedLine, Google Scholar, and EBSCO were searched; no date limitations were set. Given the diversity of study methodologies and outcomes, the findings were synthesized narratively. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias was also employed. Lastly, the studies were mapped to clinical guidelines for the various aspects of quality palliative care. The 18 studies found, published between 2004 and 2019, were conducted in seven countries and on five continents. Aims included evaluating feasibility, efficacy, and user satisfaction. Insights draw from a combined pool of 3,313 patients and 250 providers. Most studies involved oncology patients and employed videoconferencing or a web platform/online software with videoconferencing. Three themes emerged: delivery of care, symptom management and quality of life, and patient/caregiver/provider satisfaction levels. Telehealth proved effective for patient and medication monitoring, provider and specialist appointments, and palliative care consultations. Operational benefits included clinician time saved, shorter appointment wait times, and reduced no show rates; implementation challenges also emerged. Statistical improvements in quality of life and symptom management were reported. Nearly two-thirds of the studies reported positive experiences among patients, caregivers, and providers; about half included an interprofessional team.

There is an effective HPV vaccination program in almost all developed countries to prevent the incidence of cervical cancer, but reports suggest that the uptake of these vaccinations by Indigenous populations is low. The objective of this qualitative systematic review was to explore the knowledge and beliefs of global Indigenous populations regarding HPV vaccines. This review was performed to identify the barriers faced by Indigenous peoples and to provide evidence for more effective and acceptable execution of vaccination policies for Indigenous peoples. METHODS: Two investigators independently searched MEDLINE, PubMed, SCOPUS, and Web of Science databases using a pre-specified search strategy to identify qualitative studies on narratives of Indigenous peoples regarding HPV vaccine awareness, knowledge and experiences across all geographic and income-level settings. RESULTS: After performing the literature search and quality appraisals 5 papers were included in the final review. Three core synthesised findings were identified: reasons for acceptance or hesitancy, and areas for improvement. Lack of correct knowledge and mistrust in the healthcare system were important categories observed in all papers included in the review. Other categories within the conceptual model included prioritising disease prevention, health professional guidance, family support and supportive community environment. CONCLUSION: Qualitative systematic reviews are an excellent means of exploring the gaps in current healthcare practices. Indigenous healthcare research should be grounded in community experiences and feedback. This review provides insights into HPV vaccination understanding and acceptance amongst Indigenous populations, from which recommendations for increasing resonance of vaccination strategies with Indigenous communities can be formed.

We aimed to investigate its impact on procedure types, indications, and findings. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed endoscopies performed in 15 Dutch hospitals by comparing periods 15 March to 25 June of 2019 and 2020 using the prospective Trans.IT database. RESULTS: During lockdown in 2020, 9776 patients underwent endoscopy compared with 19a296 in 2019. Gastroscopies decreased by 57a% (from 7846 to 4467) and colonoscopies by 45a% (from 12219 to 5609), whereas endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography volumes remained comparable (from 578 to 522). Although endoscopy results indicative of cancer decreased (from 524 to 340), the likelihood of detecting cancer during endoscopy increased (2.7a% [95a% confidence interval (CI) 2.5a-a3.0] in 2019 versus 3.5a% [95a%CI 3.1a-a3.9] in 2020; Pa<a0.001). After lifting of lockdown, endoscopy volumes started to return to normal, except for colorectal cancer screening. CONCLUSIONS: Fewer endoscopies were performed during the COVID-19 lockdown, leading to a significant reduction in the absolute detection of cancer.

METHODS: This was a retrospective review of patients representing AIR symptoms following filler injection with HA or human collagen in our clinic. RESULTS: Although only one case of an AIR with an incidence rate of 0.01% was recorded following filler treatment between September 2008 and April 2020 in our clinic, we observed 14 AIR cases without anaphylaxis, with an incidence rate of 1.18% between May 2020 and June 2021, in line with the spreading of the new coronavirus pandemic. All cases were females aged 40C57 years, and the time of onset was within hours after filler injection. Three patients had been treated with HA fillers only, 2 with HA plus human collagen, and 9 with human collagen only. Most patients had been treated with these products in the past. Nine patients were treated with oral prednisolone. In all cases, symptoms resolved entirely within a week without sequelae.

Most of the researches focus on the qualitative properties or observations. In this research, we model the behaviours and collective intelligence of SARS-CoV-2 by minimal spanning trees (MSTs), which specify the underlying mechanisms of resource allocation in the viral colony. The vertices of the trees are 50 states, DC and NYC in the USA. The weights of the edges are assigned by the reciprocal of the sum of cases or deaths of COVID-19. The types of trees are decided by the chosen 18 factors. We sample 304 time-series data and compute their MST-based auto-correlations for stability analysis. Then we perform correlated analysis and comparative analysis on these stable factors. Our results show MST approach fits the collective intelligence modelling very well; the total cases and total deaths over areas are highly correlated in terms of MSTs; and these stable factors have little to do with the geographical distance. The results also indicate the colonisation of SARS-CoV-2 is pretty mature and organised. Based on the results, for environmental or health policies, we should also turn our attention to the transmission routes that are independent of or far away from human population or densities.

This rapid integrative review will draw on knowledge from the literature about misinformation during previous abrupt large-scale infectious disease outbreaks to enable policymakers, governments and health institutions to proactively mitigate the spread and effect of misinformation. SUBJECT AND METHODS: For this rapid integrative review, we systematically searched MEDLINE and Google Scholar and extracted the literature on misinformation during abrupt large-scale infectious disease outbreaks since 2000. We screened articles using predetermined inclusion criteria. We followed an updated methodology for integrated reviews and adjusted it for our rapid review approach. RESULTS: We found widespread misinformation in all aspects of large-scale infectious disease outbreaks since 2000, including prevention, treatment, risk factor, transmission mode, complications and vaccines. Conspiracy theories also prevailed, particularly involving vaccines. Misinformation most frequently has been reported regarding Ebola, and women and youth are particularly vulnerable to misinformation. A lack of scientific knowledge by individuals and a lack of trust in the government increased the consumption of misinformation, which is disseminated quickly by the unregulated media, particularly social media.

Furthermore, a COVID-19 reproductive number (R0) is evaluated to examine the relationship between specific command-directed policies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission. RESULTS The multidisciplinary partnership of military command, medical, and public health leadership implemented evidence-based and epidemiologically informed COVID-19 preventive base-wide policies, including appropriate isolation/quarantine policies. The R0 for the outbreak was 0.03 and remained <1 for the outbreak duration. This base remained COVID-19 free for multiple weeks after policy implementation. CONCLUSIONS The implementation of practical mitigating base-wide policies through seamless communication between military command/medical/public health leadership resolved the COVID-19 outbreak while maintaining mission readiness.

The first AEP tests were compared with the second results in 47 infants. I latency, V latency, I-III interpeak latency (IPL), and III-V IPL were checked. RESULTS In the first AEP test conducted on 440 ears, the average values of I and V latency and I-III IPL were delayed as compared with normal values. The second AEP results were conducted on 47 infants 92.36 days after the first exam. I latency and V latency of second exam were improved significantly (p < 0.05), but I-III and III-V IPL showed no significant changes. Two hearing impaired patients (4 ears) were confirmed through chart reviews. CONCLUSION The AEP test is a helpful study for early detection of hearing problem.

Yet the neural substrates underlying predatory hunting remain largely undefined. Here, we report that basal forebrain (BF) GABAergic neurons play an important role in regulating predatory hunting. Our results showed that BF GABAergic neurons were activated during the prey (cricket)-hunting and food feeding in mice. Optogenetic activation of BF GABAergic neurons evoked immediate predatory-like actions to both artificial and natural preys, significantly reducing the attack latency while increasing the attack probability and the number of killed natural prey (crickets). Similar to the effect of activating the soma of BF GABAergic neurons, photoactivation of their terminals in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) also strongly promotes predatory hunting. Moreover, photoactivation of GABAergic BF - VTA pathway significantly increases the intake of various food in mice. By synchronous recording of electroencephalogram and electromyogram, we showed that photoactivation of GABAergic BF - VTA pathway induces instant arousal and maintains long-term wakefulness. In summary, our results clearly demonstrated that the GABAergic BF is a key neural substrate for predatory hunting, and promotes this behavior through GABAergic BF - VTA pathway.","output":"Basal forebrain GABAergic neurons promote arousal and predatory hunting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A unique feature of the global coronavirus pandemic has been the widespread adoption of mask-wearing as a public health measure to minimize the risk of contagion.

METHODS: College students (N = 162) enrolled in an introductory core curriculum course completed a cross-sectional survey. The survey collected information on demographics, knowledge levels and sources of COVID-19 information, behavior changes, academic and everyday difficulties, and mental health measurements (depression, anxiety, somatization, and stress). Multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes. RESULTS: Descriptive findings indicate that students have a fundamental knowledge of COVID-19 transmission and common symptoms. Students tend to use and trust the official sources and have changed their behaviors in accordance with public health recommendations (i.e., increased hand washing, wearing mask). However, students reported a number of academic and everyday difficulties and high levels of mental health distress. High levels of depression were associated with difficulties in focusing on academic work and with employment losses, while higher levels of anxiety were more likely to be reported by students other than freshmen and those who spend more than one hour per day looking for information on COVID-19. Inability to focus on academic work and an elevated concern with COVID-19 were more likely to be associated with higher levels of somatization, while trusting news sources was associated with lower levels of somatization. Those with higher levels of perceived stress were more likely to be females, unable to focus on academic work, and report difficulties in obtaining medications and cleaning supplies.

Methods 7 days after identification of a COVID-19 resident, all residents and HCP underwent rRT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 with nasopharyngeal swabs. This was repeated weekly in all previously negative subjects until the testing identified no new cases and in all positive subjects until the testing was negative. COVID-19 infection prevention and control (IPC) measures were implemented in all residents and HCP with positive testing or with COVID-19 symptoms. Standard IPC was also implemented in all HCP. Six weeks after initial testing, all residents underwent testing for ELISA-based IgG antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-2. Symptoms were serially recorded in residents and HCP. Results 36 residents had a positive RT-PCR at baseline and two at day 7. Six HCP had a positive RT-PCR at baseline and two at day 7. No new COVID-19 cases were diagnosed later. Among the SARS-CoV-2-positive cases, six residents (16%) and three HCP (37%) were asymptomatic during the 14 days before testing. Twenty-five residents (92.3%) and all 8 HCP (100%) with a positive RT-PCR developed IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.

Participants then sat alone for 10 min. RESULTS: Across conditions, positive and negative mood significantly decreased after sitting alone. Participants who read about the benefits of solitude experienced a smaller reduction in positive mood than those in the control condition. Participants who less frequently used reappraisal in their everyday lives benefited most from the manipulation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide preliminary evidence that reappraising time alone as solitude may boost resilience to the decrements in positive mood associated with time alone.

Background: The COVID-19-pandemic is an unprecedented, exceptional situation and necessitates numerous adaptations of structures and processes in the acute inpatient setting. AIM: The aim of this study was to explore how acute inpatient care was influenced by the pandemic and which implications may result for the future from nursing managers' and hygiene specialists' point of view. METHODS: Qualitative study based on semi-structured interviews with five nursing managers and three hygiene specialists in four German acute care hospitals. Interviews were interpreted by using content analysis. RESULTS: Interviewees described how everyday routines in their hospitals were adapted to the prioritized care for COVID-19 patients. Main challenges were uncertainty and anxiety among staff, relative scarcity of equipment and workforce resources and rapid implementation of new requirements for treatment capacities. This was addressed by targeted communication and information, large efforts to ensure resources and coordinated control of all processes by cross-department, interprofessional task forces. CONCLUSIONS: Adaptations made to the structures and procedures of care delivery during the pandemic hold potential for future improvements of routine care, e. g. new workplace and skill mix models. To identify detailed practical implications, a renewed and deepened data analysis is needed at a later point of time, with a larger distance to the period of the pandemic.","output":"Die COVID-19-Pandemie im akutstation?ren Setting aus Sicht von Fhrungspersonen und Hygienefachkr?ften in der Pflege - Eine qualitative Studie"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"These days the world is facing Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.

We collected data from the inpatient and outpatient electronic health record, demographic, clinical and echocardiographic predictors. Our primary outcomes were hospitalization and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Our secondary outcome was mortality. RESULTS: We identified 400 COVID-19 positive patients (incidence 5.2; (95% CI 4.7-5.7) per 1000 patients). The mean age of our patients was 72+/-8, 60% were female, 82% were minorities and had a mean Charlson score of 2.9+/-1.4.

The elimination of sequencing noise is a non-trivial task that still remains open. Here we propose CliqueSNV based on extracting pairs of statistically linked mutations from noisy reads. This effectively reduces sequencing noise and enables identifying minority haplotypes with the frequency below the sequencing error rate. We comparatively assess the performance of CliqueSNV using an in vitro mixture of nine haplotypes that were derived from the mutation profile of an existing HIV patient.

Despite the implementation of automated detection systems and previous efficiencies, including barcoding, electronic data transfer, and extensive robotics, capacities have struggled to meet the demand. Sample pooling has been suggested as an additional strategy to address this need. The greatest concern with this approach in clinical settings is the potential for reduced sensitivity, particularly detection failures with weakly positive samples. To investigate this possibility, detection rates in pooled samples were evaluated, with a focus on pools containing weakly positive specimens. Additionally, the frequencies of occurrence of weakly positive samples during the pandemic were reviewed. Weakly positive specimens, with threshold cycle (CT ) values of 33 or higher, were detected in 95% of 60 five-sample pools but only 87% of 39 nine-sample pools. The proportion of positive samples with very low viral loads rose markedly during the first few months of the pandemic, peaking in June, decreasing thereafter, and remaining level since August. At all times, weakly positive specimens comprised a significant component of the sample population, ranging from 29% to >80% for CT values above 31. In assessing the benefits of pooling strategies, however, other aspects of the testing process must be considered.

Failure of embryos to firmly adhere results in implantation failure and infertility. A receptive endometrial luminal epithelium is achieved through the expression of adhesion molecules in the mid-secretory phase and is a requirement for implantation. Cadherin 6 (CDH6) is an adhesion molecule localizing to the endometrial luminal epithelial cell surface in the mid-secretory/receptive phase and knockdown of CDH6 in the Ishikawa cells (receptive endometrial epithelial cell line) compromises cell integrity. However, there are no studies investigating the role of CDH6 on receptivity and infertility. This study aimed to investigate whether CDH6 is dysregulated in the endometrium of women with infertility during the receptive window and the effect of CDH6 on endometrial adhesion and receptivity. METHODS: The expression and the localization of CDH6 in the human endometrium were determined by immunohistochemistry. Ishikawa cells were used to investigate the functional consequences of CDH6 knockdown on endometrial adhesive capacity to HTR8/SVneo (trophoblast cell line) spheroids in vitro. CDH6 knockdown was assessed by qPCR and immunoblotting. After CDH6 knockdown, the expression of type II cadherin family members and CDH6 functional partners were assessed by qPCR. Two-tailed unpaired student's t-test or one-way ANOVA as appropriate were used for statistical analysis with a significance threshold of P < 0.05. RESULTS: A significant reduction of CDH6 immunolocalization was recorded in the luminal and glandular epithelium of endometrium from women with infertility (P < 0.05) compared to fertile group respective cellular compartments in the mid-secretory phase. Functional analysis using Ishikawa cells demonstrated that knockdown of CDH6 (treated with 50 nM CDH6 siRNA) significantly reduced epithelial adhesive capacity (P < 0.05) to HTR8/SVneo spheroids compared to control and other type II cadherin family members likely failed to compensate for the loss of CDH6. The expression levels of CDH6 functional partners, catenin family members were not changed after CDH6 knockdown in Ishikawa cells. CONCLUSION: Together, our data revealed that CDH6 was dysregulated in the endometrium from women with infertility and altered Ishikawa cell adhesive capacity. Our study supports a role for CDH6 in regulating endometrial adhesion and implantation.","output":"Characterization of the role for cadherin 6 in the regulation of human endometrial receptivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During summer and early fall of 2012, the US experienced the largest outbreak of hemorrhagic disease (HD) on record; deer (both Odocoileus virginianus and Odocoileus hemionus) in 35 states were affected, including many northern states where HD typically does not occur. Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) was the predominant virus isolated, with serotype 2 (EHDV-2) representing 66% (135/205) of all isolated viruses. Viruses within the EHDV serogroup are genetically similar, but we hypothesized that subtle genetic distinctions between viruses would exist across the geographic range of the outbreak if multiple EHDV-2 strains were responsible. We examined viral relatedness and molecular epidemiology of the outbreak by sequencing the mammalian binding protein (VP2) gene and the insect vector binding protein (VP7) gene of 34 EHDV-2 isolates from 2012 across 21 states. Nucleotide sequences of VP2 had 99.0% pairwise identity; VP7 nucleotide sequences had 99.1% pairwise identity. Very few changes were observed in either protein at the amino acid level. Despite the high genetic similarity between isolates, subtle nucleotide differences existed. Both VP2 and VP7 gene sequences separated into two distinct clades based on patterns of single-nucleotide polymorphisms after phylogenetic analysis. The clades were divided geographically into eastern and western clades, although those divisions were not identical between VP2 and VP7. There was also an association between percent sequence identity and geographic distance between isolates. We concluded that multiple EHDV-2 strains contributed to this outbreak.","output":"GENETIC RELATEDNESS OF EPIZOOTIC HEMORRHAGIC DISEASE VIRUS SEROTYPE 2 FROM 2012 OUTBREAK IN THE USA."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a devastating malignancy with a poor prognosis and a dismal survival rate.

This review discusses multiple mechanisms responsible for the resistance of some PDACs to VSV-based OV therapy, as well multiple rational approaches to enhance permissiveness of PDACs to VSV and expand the spectrum of PDACs responsive to VSV-based oncolytic virotherapy. ABSTRACT: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a devastating malignancy with poor prognosis and a dismal survival rate, expected to become the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Oncolytic virus (OV) is an anticancer approach that utilizes replication-competent viruses to preferentially infect and kill tumor cells. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), one such OV, is already in several phase I clinical trials against different malignancies. VSV-based recombinant viruses are effective OVs against a majority of tested PDAC cell lines. However, some PDAC cell lines are resistant to VSV. Upregulated type I IFN signaling and constitutive expression of a subset of interferon-simulated genes (ISGs) play a major role in such resistance, while other mechanisms, such as inefficient viral attachment and resistance to VSV-mediated apoptosis, also play a role in some PDACs. Several alternative approaches have been shown to break the resistance of PDACs to VSV without compromising VSV oncoselectivity, including (i) combinations of VSV with JAK1/2 inhibitors (such as ruxolitinib); (ii) triple combinations of VSV with ruxolitinib and polycations improving both VSV replication and attachment; (iii) combinations of VSV with chemotherapeutic drugs (such as paclitaxel) arresting cells in the G2/M phase; (iv) arming VSV with p53 transgenes; (v) directed evolution approach producing more effective OVs. The latter study demonstrated impressive long-term genomic stability of complex VSV recombinants encoding large transgenes, supporting further clinical development of VSV as safe therapeutics for PDAC.","output":"Expanding the Spectrum of Pancreatic Cancers Responsive to Vesicular Stomatitis Virus-Based Oncolytic Virotherapy: Challenges and Solutions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We discuss a lattice model of vector-mediated transmission of a disease to illustrate how simulations can be applied in epidemiology.

However, only in Guatemala, Trinidad and Tobago, and Mexico have found antibodies in VEEV in bats, using immunohistochemistry, the sensitivity and specificity are improved; thus, it is better for demonstrating natural infection in bats as potential hosts. This study aimed to determine the presence of VEEV in tissues of frugivorous bats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective descriptive cross-sectional study with a non-probabilistic sampling was carried out in 12 localities of Crdoba and Sucre area of the Colombian Caribbean. Two hundred and eighty-six bats were captured using fog nets, and the specimens according to taxonomic keys were classified. According to the Ethics Committee of the University of Crdoba, the bats were treated with analgesics and anesthetics. Blood samples were taken and then euthanized to obtain tissues and organs which were preserved in liquid N2 at ?196C. A portion of each organ was fixed in 10% buffered formalin for the detection of antigens by immunohistochemistry. Several pathological anatomy analyses were performed to determine the histological characteristics of tissue lesions of frugivorous bats naturally infected with the VEEV. RESULTS: Of the 286 bats captured, 23 species were identified. In samples of the brain, spleen, and lung of two frugivorous bats (2/286=0.70%) Artibeus planirostris and Sturnira lilium, the presence of VEEV was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. CONCLUSION: A fragment of the nsP4 non-structural protein gene corresponding to the alphavirus was amplified. Two samples were positive (2/286=0.70%) in frugivorous bats; A. planirostris (code GenBank: MG820274) and S. lilium (code GenBank: MG820275).

RESULTS Although increased serum ATX levels were observed in almost all the patients treated with RFA, they were not reduced after RFA. Furthermore, serum ATX levels were associated not with tumor burden but with the parameters predicting for liver fibrosis, such as liver stiffness values. Then, in surgically-treated patients, there was no significant correlation between serum ATX levels and ATX mRNA expression levels in HCC tissues. Notably, ATX mRNA expression levels in HCC tissues were not higher than those in peri-tumorous tissues. Finally, serum ATX levels in surgically-treated HCC patients were rather correlated with ATX mRNA expression levels in peri-tumorous tissues as well as with liver fibrosis stage. CONCLUSION The increase in serum ATX levels in HCC patients may not be caused by abundant ATX production in HCC tissues but by fibrosis in the background livers.","output":"Increased serum autotaxin levels in hepatocellular carcinoma patients were caused by background liver fibrosis but not by carcinoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Women engaged in sex work (WESW) are disproportionately affected by HIV. In Uganda, HIV prevalence among WESW is estimated at 37%, accounting for 18% of all new infections in the country. WESW experience poverty, gender-based violence, and other issues that reduce their power and limit their ability to negotiate condom use. Female-controlled strategies, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), may afford women more transmission protection, but barriers to access and use persist. This cross-sectional study examined baseline PrEP acceptability and initiation among WESW recently enrolled in a randomized clinical trial in Uganda to test the impact of a combination HIV risk reduction and economic empowerment intervention on sexual risk outcomes (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03583541). METHODS: A total of 542 WESW from 19 high HIV-prevalent geographical areas were enrolled in the Kyaterekera study between June 2019 and March 2020. Women were eligible for the study if they: (1) were age 18 or over; (2) reported engagement in transactional sex (a sex act in exchange for pay) in the past 30 days; and (3) reported engagement in one or more episodes of unprotected sex in the past 30 days. Women completed a baseline assessment, were tested for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) at enrollment, and were connected with antiretroviral therapy (ART), STI treatment, or PrEP, based on need and interest. Descriptive statistics examined baseline data on PrEP acceptability and initiation. Independent variables (i.e. years in sex work, recent sexual coercion, perceived HIV and sex work stigmas, harmful alcohol use, barriers to medical care, and social support) were derived from the empirical literature and women's self-report. Bivariate analysis was performed to test associations between main effects of these variables. Using binomial logistic regression, predictive models were evaluated for two distinct outcomesPrEP acceptability and PrEP initiation/uptake. FINDINGS: At baseline, 59% of women (n = 322) tested HIV negative. Among WESW testing negative, 11% (n = 36) were already PrEP enrolled. Most women reported willingness to use PrEP (n = 317; 91%). Slightly over half of WESW not already on PrEP agreed to initiate PrEP (n = 158; 55%). Logistic regression models demonstrate that acceptability of or willingness to use PrEP was significantly associated with fewer years engaged in sex work (AOR= 18, 95% CI 005-66, p<01) and greater perceived social support from family (AOR= 139, 95% CI 103 -1.88, p<05). PrEP initiation was negatively associated with greater perceived social support from friends (AOR=81, 95% CI 68C097, p<05) and positively associated with higher perceived stigma due to sex work among family members (AOR=220, 95% CI 115C422, p<05). INTERPRETATION: Despite endorsing PrEP use, many WESW remain reluctant to use it. This gap in prevention practice highlights the heart of a failing PrEP prevention cascade. Findings point to the important role family and friend support may play in destigmatizing sex work and PrEP use for women. Social and structural-level efforts are needed to improve educational messaging and to integrate positive messaging into health promotion campaigns for women and their families, while also working toward decriminalizing sex work.

OBJECTIVES: This review summarises the underlying principles and performance of COVID-19 serological and immunological testing. SOURCES: Selected peer-reviewed publications on COVID-19 related serology and immunology published between December 2019 and March 2021. CONTENT: Serological tests are highly specific but heterogeneous in their sensitivity for the diagnosis of COVID-19. For certain indications, including delayed disease presentations, serological tests can have added value. The presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 may indicate a recent or past COVID-19 infection. Lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) antibody tests have the advantages of being easy and fast to perform, but many have a low sensitivity in acute settings. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and chemiluminescence immunoassays (CLIA) have higher sensitivities. Besides humoral immunity, cellular immunity is also essential for successful host defences against viruses. Enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assays can be used to measure T-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2. The presence of cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cells in never exposed patients suggests the possibility of cellular immunity induced by other circulating coronaviruses. T-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 have also been detected in recovered COVID-19 patients with no detectable antibodies. IMPLICATIONS: Serological and immunological tests are primarily applied for population-based seroprevalence studies to evaluate the effectiveness of COVID-19 control measures and increase our understanding of the immunology behind COVID-19. Combining molecular diagnostics with serological tests may optimise the detection of COVID-19. As not all infected patients will develop antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, assessment of cellular immunity may provide complementary information on whether a patient has been previously infected with COVID-19. More studies are needed to understand the correlations of these serological and immunological parameters with protective immunity, taking into account the different circulating virus variants.","output":"How to interpret and use COVID-19 serology and immunology tests"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Home health aides are essential members of the home care team, but often report limited communication with agency supervisors.

Setting and Participants Doctors, nurses, allied health professionals, administrative and support staff in four public hospitals and one primary care service in Singapore 3 months after COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic. Methods Study questionnaire captured demographic and workplace environment information and comprised three validated instruments, namely the Oldenberg Burnout Inventory (OLBI), Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Multivariate mixed model regression analyses were employed to evaluate independent associations of mean OLBI-Disengagement and -Exhaustion scores. Further subgroup analysis was performed among redeployed HCWs. Results Among 11,286 invited HCWs, 3,075 valid responses were received, giving an overall response rate of 27.2%. Mean OLBI scores were 2.38 and 2.50 for Disengagement and Exhaustion respectively. Burnout thresholds in Disengagement and Exhaustion were met by 79.7% and 75.3% of respondents respectively. On multivariate regression analysis, Chinese or Malay ethnicity, HADS anxiety or depression scores 8, shifts lasting 8 hours and being redeployed were significantly associated with higher OLBI mean scores, while high SAQ scores were significantly associated with lower scores. Among redeployed HCWs, those redeployed to high-risk areas in a different facility (offsite) had lower burnout scores than those redeployed within their own work facility (onsite). A higher proportion of HCWs redeployed offsite assessed their training to be good or better compared to those redeployed onsite.

We explore county level associations between COVID-19 attributed deaths and social, demographic, vulnerability, and political variables to develop a better understanding of the evolving roles these variables play in relation to mortality. We focus on the role of political variables, as captured by support for either the Republican or Democrat presidential candidates in the 2020 elections and the stringency of state-wide governor mandates, during three non-overlapping time periods between February 2020 and February 2021. We find that during the first three months of the pandemic, Democratic-leaning and internationally-connected urban counties were affected. During subsequent months (between May and September, 2020), Republican counties with high percentages of Hispanic and Black populations were most hardly hit. Importantly, in the time period between October 2020 and February 2021, when the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing and wearing masks indoors, had been well-established. During this period, we find that Republican-leaning counties experienced up to 3 times higher death rates than Democratic-leaning counties, even after controlling for multiple social vulnerability factors. We also find that Republican-leaning counties in states with less strict mandates experienced the most severe outbreaks. Our findings suggest that ideologies promoted by prominent political actors may not align with efforts to mitigate the impact of the ongoing pandemic and prevent deaths.","output":"The Evolving Roles of US Political Partisanship and Social Vulnerability in the COVID-19 Pandemic from February 2020 - February 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Italy has adopted the strategy of inner areas, mainly based on physical distance from public services.

In this article, rather than focusing the discussion on individual-level factors like health behaviors that have the potential to blame Black women and those living in poverty for their conditions, we view breast cancer disparities through the lens of Critical Race Theory, taking a historical perspective. This allows us to delve beyond individual risk factors to explore social determinants of breast cancer disparities at the population level, paying special attention to the myriad ways in which social factors, notably views of race and discriminatory public policies, over time have contributed to the disproportionate breast cancer mortality experienced by Black women.

Latin American and the Caribbean countries have been harshly affected by the pandemic mainly due to less prepared healthcare systems and fragmented social safety nets. In the region, health status population-based indicators are worse than compared to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Recent evidence suggests that the progression and severity of COVID-19 are associated with the prior health status of individuals, and studies have shown that the case fatality rate is highly stratified among different populations. This narrative review aims to describe factors associated with adverse outcomes of COVID-19 in the context of social determinants of health in Latin American and Caribbean countries. In this review, we state that genetic and biological factors interact in a sophisticated way with social determinants of health, impacting the rapid spread of COVID-19 in Latin American and Caribbean countries. Behavioral factors, such as physical inactivity, smoking, and unhealthy diets, are related to chronic systemic inflammation. Also, air pollution can prolong inflammation and the hyper-activation of the immune system. Air pollutants could facilitate the spread of the virus. Finally, frailty and comorbidities can be associated with COVID-19 severity through increasing vulnerability to stressors and leading to more severe symptoms of COVID-19 disease, including a higher mortality risk. All these factors contribute to increasing the impact of COVID-19 in Latin American and Caribbean countries. We highlight the relevance of considering social determinants of health in Latin American and the Caribbean countries, not only in controlling the likelihood of getting the disease but also its progression and severity. All these social determinants can guide the design and implementation of tailored interventions promoting healthy lifestyle behaviors, which should lower the spread of the disease, its severity, and lethality.","output":"Pre-existing conditions in Latin America and factors associated with adverse outcomes of COVID-19: A review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Viral diseases increasingly endanger the world public health because of the transient efficacy of antiviral therapies. The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been recently identified as caused by a new type of coronaviruses. This type of coronavirus binds to the human receptor through the Spike glycoprotein (S) Receptor Binding Domain (RBD). The spike protein is found in inaccessible (closed) or accessible (open) conformations in which the accessible conformation causes severe infection. Thus, this receptor is a significant target for antiviral drug design. METHODS: An attempt was made to recognize 111 natural and synthesized compounds in order to utilize them against SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein to inhibit Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using simulation methods, such as molecular docking. The FAF-Drugs3, Pan-Assay Interference Compounds (PAINS), ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) databases along with Lipinskis rules were used to evaluate the drug-like properties of the identified ligands. In order to analyze and identify the residues critical in the docking process of the spike glycoprotein, the interactions of proposed ligands with both conformations of the spike glycoprotein was simulated. RESULTS: The results showed that among the available ligands, seven ligands had significant interactions with the binding site of the spike glycoprotein, in which angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is bounded. Out of seven candidate molecules, six ligands exhibited drug-like characteristics. The results also demonstrated that fluorophenyl and propane groups of ligands had optimal interactions with the binding site of the spike glycoprotein. CONCLUSION: According to the results, our findings indicated the ability of six ligands to prevent the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein to its cognate receptor, providing novel compounds for the treatment of COVID-19.

First, it notes that the use of carebots to take care of the physical and mental health of the elderly, children and the disabled as well as to serve as assistive tools and social companions encounter a few main challenges. They relate to the extent of the care robots ability to care for humans, potential deception by robot morphology and communications, (over)reliance on or attachment to robots, and the risks of carebot use without informed consent and potential infringements of privacy. Secondly, these challenges impinge upon issues of ethics and trust which are somewhat overlapping in terms of concept and practice. The existing ethical guidelines, standards and regulations are general in nature and lack a central ethical framework and concrete principles applicable to the care contexts. Hence, to deal with these important challenges, it is proposed in the third part of the paper that carebots be designed by taking account of Ethics of Care as the central ethical framework. It argues that the Ethics of Care offer the following advantages: (a) it provides sufficiently concrete principles and embodies values that are sensitive and applicable to the design of carebots and the contexts of caring practices; (b) it coheres with the tenets of Principlism and select ethical theories (utilitarianism, deontology and virtue ethics); and (c) it is closely associated with the preservation and maintenance of trust.","output":"Trust in and Ethical Design of Carebots: The Case for Ethics of Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and objectives: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public health emergency of imminent concern in March 2020, the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and its related disease (COVID-19) has become a topic of much-needed research. This study primarily focused on what effect smoking had on hospitalization; however, asymptomaticity and severity were discussed. Data: Data was collected through searches on databases including PubMed and Google Scholar. Eligibility criteria included being RT-PCR verified and including smoking data. Discussion: This study found that smokers were significantly underrepresented in COVID-19 hospitalization on a purely epidemiological level in some areas, including China and Manhattan, but not others: Seattle, Greater New York City Area, and Italy. Furthermore, smokers were equally represented in asymptomatic populations, but smokers will likely experience a more severe manifestation of the disease if they are symptomatic. Further inquiry into possible mechanisms by which the observed epidemiological effect is necessary, as it has implications for recommendations on loosening restrictions on social distancing measures. Conclusions and Recommendations: This study recommends that smokers consider themselves to be at higher risk for COVID-19, as they may experience a more severe manifestation of the disease. Health care providers and policymakers should consider smokers at higher risk as well, as there is evidence to claim that smokers may contract a more severe form of COVID-19.","output":"An International Review of Tobacco Use and the COVID-19 Pandemic: Examining Hospitalization, Asymptomatic Cases, and Severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE to assess the effect of implementation of the extended placement option available to midwifery students during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

FINDINGS A total of 38 of 55 LMEs responded (response rate 69%). The majority of Approved Education Institutions (AEIs) offered an extended placement to students, but with some variation in the choices offered, unrelated to geographical location or size of student cohort.

Underlying factors, including Social Determinants of Health (SDoH), could contribute to these statistics. Our prior work has explored associations between SDoH and several adverse health outcomes (eg, asthma and obesity). Our findings reinforce the emerging consensus that SDoH factors should be considered when implementing intelligent public health surveillance solutions to inform public health policies and interventions. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to redefine the Healthy People 2030's SDoH taxonomy to accommodate the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, we aim to provide a blueprint and implement a prototype for the Urban Population Health Observatory (UPHO), a web-based platform that integrates classified group-level SDoH indicators to individual- and aggregate-level population health data. METHODS: The process of building the UPHO involves collecting and integrating data from several sources, classifying the collected data into drivers and outcomes, incorporating data science techniques for calculating measurable indicators from the raw variables, and studying the extent to which interventions are identified or developed to mitigate drivers that lead to the undesired outcomes. RESULTS: We generated and classified the indicators of social determinants of health, which are linked to COVID-19. To display the functionalities of the UPHO platform, we presented a prototype design to demonstrate its features. We provided a use case scenario for 4 different users. CONCLUSIONS: UPHO serves as an apparatus for implementing effective interventions and can be adopted as a global platform for chronic and infectious diseases. The UPHO surveillance platform provides a novel approach and novel insights into immediate and long-term health policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and other future public health crises.

Ferrets have a long, slender body with short muscular legs, a long thin tail, small eyes, and short ears. The life span of the ferret is 5 to 8 years. Ferrets may be housed singly or in groups, inside or outside of a house. When kept outdoors, however, they must be protected from extreme weather. Ferrets have difficulty tolerating temperatures above 90F or below 20F, and appropriate precautions must be taken to prevent their exposure to these extremes. Ferrets are carnivorous and require a suitable diet. A diet that is high in good-quality animal protein and fat and low in complex carbohydrates and fiber is recommended. Ferrets are routinely immunized against canine distemper virus (CDV) and rabies virus. Ferrets are quite susceptible to CDV, and there is a 100% mortality rate in unvaccinated ferrets infected with CDV. When a new ferret is brought into the household, a quarantine period is recommended before introducing it to other animals, particularly other ferrets. The purpose of the quarantine period is to identify and prevent transmission of infectious disease potentially carried by the new ferret. The duration of this period allows for the development of any clinical signs in a seemingly healthy ferret following entrance into the new household.","output":"CHAPTER 13 FERRETS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transformation is an art of wavering chattels from one location to the other location or one zone to the other zone or one pattern to the other pattern.

We find that the resulting corrected CFR (deaths shifted back by this time lag, divided by cases) is actually constant over many months, for many countries, but also for the entire world. This optimal time lag and constant CFR for each country can be found through a simple data driven algorithm. The traditional CFR (ignoring time lag) is spuriously time-dependent and its evolution is hard to quantify.

AIMS: Evaluate radiographic findings in COVID-19 patients and calculate sensitivity of radiographs with RT-PCR as gold standard. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Total 116 COVID-19 patients underwent portable CXR between April-June, 2020. Two radiologists reviewed radiographs with respect to laterality, craniocaudal, mediolateral distribution, shape, density, unifocality/multifocality and number of lung zones. Sensitivity of radiography was calculated with RT-PCR as gold standard. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: IBM SPSS Statistics Subscription software (IBM, New York, USA). RESULTS: Many patients 67.2% (78/116) were asymptomatic. Cough (21.5%, 25/116) and fever (17.6%, 20/116) were the most frequent symptoms. 36.2% (42/116) patients revealed COVID-19 pneumonia-like abnormalities on CXR. Sensitivity of CXR with RT-PCR as gold standard was 36.2% (CI: Confidence interval = 27.46% - 44.95%). More patients in symptomatic group (68.4%, 26/38) had abnormal CXR compared to asymptomatic group (20.5%, 16/78) [P < 0.0001].

For systems governed by consensus dynamics, network structure is key to optimising the spread of information. For disease spread over contact networks, the structure would be expected to be similarly influential. However, metrics that are essentially agnostic to the networks structure, such as weighted degree (strength) centrality and its variants, perform near-optimally in selecting effective spreaders. These degree-based metrics outperform eigenvector centrality, despite disease spread over a network being a random walk process. This paper improves eigenvector-based spreader selection by introducing the non-linear relationship between contact time and the probability of disease transmission into the assessment of network dynamics. This approximation of disease spread dynamics is achieved by altering the Laplacian matrix, which in turn highlights why nodes with a high degree are such influential disease spreaders. From this approach, a trichotomy emerges on the definition of an effective spreader where, for susceptible-infected simulations, eigenvector-based selections can either optimise the initial rate of infection, the average rate of infection, or produce the fastest time to full infection of the network. Simulated and real-world human contact networks are examined, with insights also drawn on the effective adaptation of ant colony contact networks to reduce pathogen spread and protect the queen ant.","output":"Identification of effective spreaders in contact networks using dynamical influence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: With the rise of chronic medical problems involving lifestyle behaviors and the benefits of patient involvement in preventative care, medical students need to learn how to help patients change health risk behaviors and improve patient involvement in order to improve health outcomes.

METHODS: The questionnaire distributed to dental students comprised of two main sections. The first part covered the online education experience, and the second part measured the level of self-perceived preparedness for a range of cognitive, communication and professional skills. RESULTS: The survey yielded a response rate of 72%. The majority of students (77%) agreed that they missed educational experiences as a result of the lockdown. More than half of them felt less motivated to follow-up with distant e-learning and believed that online assessment is not a good method for evaluation.

The necessity of analyzing cytogenetic effects of such exposure is related to the need to estimate the associated risk. Cytogenetic biological dosimetry is based on the relationship between the absorbed dose and the frequency of scored chromosomal aberrations. The influence of confounding factors on radiation response is a topical issue. The role of ethnicity is unclear. Here, we compared the dose-response curves obtained after irradiation of circulating lymphocytes from healthy donors of African and European ancestry. Materials and Methods: Blood samples from six Africans living in Africa, five Africans living in Europe, and five Caucasians living in Europe were exposed to various doses (0C4 Gy) of X-rays at a dose-rate of 0.1 Gy/min using an X-RAD320 irradiator. A validated cohort composed of 14 healthy Africans living in three African countries was included and blood samples were irradiated using the same protocols. Blood lymphocytes were cultured for 48 h and chromosomal aberrations scored during the first mitosis by telomere and centromere staining. The distribution of dicentric chromosomes was determined and the Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare the dose-response curves of the two populations. Results: No spontaneous dicentric chromosomes were detected in African donors, thus establishing a very low background of unstable chromosomal aberrations relative to the European population. There was a significant difference in the dose response curves between native African and European donors. At 4 Gy, African donors showed a significantly lower frequency of dicentric chromosomes (p = 8.65 10(C17)), centric rings (p = 4.0310(C14)), and resulting double-strand-breaks (DSB) (p = 1.32 10(C18)) than European donors.

To date, the majority of hospitalized patients, per CDC, have a median age of 24 years. Here we present a case series of two patients diagnosed with EVALI after admission to our community children's hospital with non-specific symptoms. Case descriptionA 17-year-old previously healthy male presents with one week of worsening abdominal pain, intractable vomiting, fever, night sweats, chest pain and dyspnea with exertion. History of chronic diarrhea and significant unintentional weight loss dropping BMI percentiles from 61 th to 9th. Baseline labs significant for CRP of 423 mg/dl and ESR 103 mm/hr. Negative COVID-19 PCR. Chest XR remarkable for peri-bronchial disease. Concerns for abdominal pathology lead to CT scan of chest/abdomen/pelvis which showed patchy ground glass pulmonary opacities and small volume ascites. Our second patient is a 15-year-old male with history of five days of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and unintentional 15 lb weight loss (BMI dropped from the 18th to the 0.03 percentile). Physical exam significant for jaundice and had tenderness to palpation over right upper quadrant. Initial labs were significant for elevated AST 115 u/L, ALT 117 u/L, Alkaline phosphatase of 168 u/L and total bilirubin of 2 mg/dl, CRP 281 mg/dl and ESR 27 mm/h. Chest x-ray showed interstitial edema and small pleural effusions. Initially both patients denied vaping or cigarette smoking however, they later endorsed vaping THC based cartridges for 1-2 years. Mainstream therapy included supportive treatment, supplemental oxygen and steroids. Given concern for infection, our first patient also received a five day course of doxycycline in addition to prednisone. Improvement of symptoms was noted within 24-48 hours since initiation of steroids. Complete resolution of symptoms seen later in follow up appointments and both patients successfully quit vaping. DiscussionVaping products, particularly those containing THC, are popular within the adolescent population, as has been shown in previous nationwide surveys.

Exposures: The last vitamin D level before COVID-19 testing was categorized as less than 20 ng/mL (ie, deficient), 20 to less than 30 ng/mL (ie, insufficient), 30 to less than 40 ng/mL, or 40 ng/mL or greater. Treatment was defined by vitamin D type and dose 14 days before COVID-19 testing and treatment changes after last vitamin D level. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was a positive result for COVID-19 in polymerase chain reaction testing. Multivariable analyses tested whether previously measured vitamin D level was associated with having test results positive for COVID-19 in White individuals and in Black individuals, controlling for months and treatment changes since the vitamin D level was measured, as well as demographic characteristics and comorbidity indicators. Results: A total of 4638 individuals (mean [SD] age 52.8 [19.5] years; 3205 [69%] women) had data for a vitamin D level within 1 year before COVID-19 testing, including 2288 (49%) Black individuals, 1999 (43%) White individuals, and 351 individuals (8%) who were another race/ethnicity (eg, Asian, Mideast Indian, >1 race). Stratified by vitamin D level, 1251 individuals (27%) had less than 20 ng/mL, 1267 individuals (27%) had 20 to less than 30 ng/mL, 1023 individuals (22%) had 30 to less than 40 ng/mL, and 1097 individuals (24%) had 40 ng/mL or greater. Lower vitamin D levels were more common in Black individuals (<20 ng/mL: 829 of 2288 Black individuals [36%]) than White individuals (<20 ng/mL: 315 of 1999 White individuals [16%]). A total of 333 individuals (7%) had test results positive for COVID-19, including 102 White individuals (5%) and 211 Black individuals (9%). Multivariate analysis controlling for time since last vitamin D level measurement was used to estimate the outcomes associated with levels 14 days before COVID-19 testing. A positive test result for COVID-19 was not significantly associated with vitamin D levels in White individuals but was associated with vitamin D levels in Black individuals (compared with &#8805;40 ng/mL: <20 ng/mL incidence rate ratio [IRR], 2.55 [95% CI, 1.26-5.15]; P = .009; 20 to <30 ng/mL IRR, 1.69 [95% CI, 0.75-3.84]; P = .21; 30 to <40 ng/mL IRR, 2.64 [95% CI, 1.24-5.66]; P = .01). Stratified by vitamin D level, estimated COVID-19 positivity rates in Black individuals were 9.72% (95% CI, 6.74%-13.41%) for individuals with a vitamin D level less than 20 ng/mL, 6.47% (95% CI, 3.33%-10.28%) for individuals with a vitamin D level of 20 to less than 30 ng/mL, 10.10% (95% CI, 6.00%-15.47%) for individuals with a vitamin D level of 30 to less than 40 ng/mL, and 3.82% (95% CI, 1.78%-6.68%) for individuals with a vitamin D level of 40 ng/mL or higher. Multivariate analysis in individuals with a vitamin D level of 30 ng/mL or greater found that the IRR of a positive COVID-19 test result was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.94-0.99; P = .008) per 1-ng/mL increase in vitamin D overall and 0.95 (95% CI, 0.91-0.98; P = .003) per 1-ng/mL increase in vitamin D in Black individuals. Conclusions and Relevance: In this single-center retrospective cohort study, COVID-19 risk increased among Black individuals with vitamin D level less than 40 ng/mL compared with those with 40 ng/mL or greater and decreased with increasing levels among individuals with levels greater than 30 ng/mL. No significant associations were noted for White individuals. Randomized clinical trials should examine whether increasing vitamin D level to greater than 40 ng/mL affects COVID-19 risk.","output":"Association of Vitamin D Levels, Race/Ethnicity, and Clinical Characteristics With COVID-19 Test Results"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinical features of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and correlates of sleep disturbances during the early phase of COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This web-based cross-sectional study recruited 1138 Hong Kong adults using convenience sampling over a two-week period from 6th April 2020. The survey collected data on sleep disturbances, mood, stress, stock of infection control supplies, perceived risk of being infected by COVID-19, and sources for acquiring COVID-19 information. The participants were asked to compare their recent sleep and sleep before the outbreak. The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) was used to assess their current insomnia severity. Prevalence was weighted according to 2016 population census. RESULTS: The weighted prevalence of worsened sleep quality, difficulty in sleep initiation, and shortened sleep duration since the outbreak were 38.3%, 29.8%, and 29.1%, respectively. The prevalence of current insomnia (ISI score of &#8805;10) was 29.9%. Insufficient stock of masks was significantly associated with worsened sleep quality, impaired sleep initiation, shortened sleep duration, and current insomnia in multivariate logistic regression (adjusted OR = 1.57, 1.72, 1.99, and 1.96 respectively, all p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: A high proportion of people in Hong Kong felt that their sleep had worsened since the COVID-19 outbreak. Insufficient stock of masks was one of the risk factors that were associated with sleep disturbances. Adequate and stable supply of masks may play an important role to maintain the sleep health in the Hong Kong general population during a pandemic outbreak.","output":"Prevalence of sleep disturbances during COVID-19 outbreak in an urban Chinese population: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we report for the first time the existence of complemented palindromic small RNAs (cpsRNAs) and propose that cpsRNAs and palindromic small RNAs (psRNAs) constitute a novel class of small RNAs.

The phylogenetic analysis supported that this DNA complemented palindrome originated from bat betacoronavirus. The results of RNA interference (RNAi) experiments showed that one 19-nt segment corresponding to SARS-CoV-cpsR-19 significantly induced cell apoptosis. Using this joint analysis of the molecular function and phylogeny, our results suggested that SARS-CoV-cpsR-19 could play a role in SARS-CoV infection or pathogenesis. The discovery of cpsRNAs has paved a way to find novel markers for pathogen detection and to reveal the mechanisms underlying infection or pathogenesis from a different point of view. Researchers can use cpsRNAs to study the infection or pathogenesis of pathogenic viruses when these viruses are not available.

Two-dimensional, unique dual indexing, using four indices per sample, enables unambiguous and scalable assignment of reads to individual samples. We calibrate SARSeq on SARS-CoV-2 synthetic RNA, virions, and hundreds of human samples of various types. Robustness and sensitivity were virtually identical to quantitative RT-PCR. Double-blinded benchmarking to gold standard quantitative-RT-PCR performed by human diagnostics laboratories confirms this high sensitivity.

Design Retrospective review of appointments scheduled over a 11-week period between March 17th and May 29th, 2020, in the MIGS division of an academic obstetrics and gynecology department. During this period, the office was closed except for emergency visits due to the restrictions secondary to COVID-19. Successful conversion from in-person to televisits was defined as appointments rescheduled within 2 months of the initial in-person visit. Setting N/A. Patients or Participants All patients scheduled for in-person visits during this time were included. Patients were excluded from the analysis if they were seen emergently in person or newly scheduled as a televisit. Interventions N/A. Measurements and Main Results Data extracted included age, race/ethnicity, primary language, insurance type, appointment type, reason for visit, and time to rescheduled visit. 132 patients were originally scheduled during 11 weeks. 32 (24.2%) appointments were newly scheduled televisits and 20 (15.2%) were emergent in-person visits, leaving 87 visits. 21 (24%) appointments were rescheduled as televisits; 14 (66.7%) via telephone and 7 (33.3)% of these as video. There were no significant differences between age, race, primary language. insurance type, appointment type and the reason seen between the converted and non-converted groups. Median time to rescheduled appointments was sooner in successful conversions (16 days (-7 to 73) versus 96 days (8-234), p<.001). Conclusion Conversion to televisits was reasonable for a telemedicine na?ve practice, despite having an overall low conversion rate to televisits. Utilizing telemedicine allowed patients to receive care sooner when compared to the non-converted group.

The world is still more democratic than it was in the 1970s and 1980s, but a trend of autocratization is ongoing and affecting 25 countries in 2020, home to 34% of the worlds population. At the same time, the number of democratizing countries has dwindled by nearly half, reducing to 16 countries, home to a mere 4% of the global population. Freedom of expression, deliberation, rule of law and elections show the most substantial net declines in the last decade. A major change is that India, formerly the worlds largest democracy, turned into an electoral autocracy. The V-Dem data suggests that direct effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on levels of liberal democracy were limited in 2020. Still, the longer-term consequences may be worse and must be monitored closely. Due to the pandemic and state restrictions on the freedom of assembly, mass mobilization declined to its lowest level in over a decade, yet the decline in pro-democracy protests in 2020 may well prove to be short-lived once the pandemic subdues.

Blood samples were screened using the ELISAs, and confirmed using the Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay (TPPA) and toluidine red unheated serum test (TRUST). RESULTS: Among 394 792 blood donors, 733 tested TPPA and TRUST positive (active infection), and 728 tested only TPPA positive (historical infection). The overall prevalence of syphilis seropositivity was 370.1 per 100 000 (95% CI 351.1 to 389.0 per 100 000); the prevalence of active infection was 185.7 per 100 000 (95% CI 172.2 to 199.1 per 100 000). People aged 45 years displayed a prevalence of 621.8 per 100 000 in syphilis seropositivity and 280.5 per 100 000 in active infection, which were 3.8 times and 2.4 times higher than that for people aged <25 years, respectively. The prevalence of syphilis seropositivity ((2) (trend)=311.9, p (trend)<0.001) and active infection ((2) (trend)=72.1, p (trend)<0.001) increased significantly with age.

The N95 mask is a prototype, high-efficiency protective device that can effectively protect against airborne pathogens of less than 0.3 m. The N95 mask is tightly fitting and has high filtration capacity. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to a greater requirement for FFR. This rising demand greatly exceeds current production capabilities and stockpiles, resulting in shortages. To address this, our team has invented a new type of half-piece respirator made from silicone and assembled with HEPA or elastostatic filter. A variety of methods have been used to evaluate this new device, including a qualitative fit test with the Bitrex(?) test kit and filtration test. The preliminary results showed that the new elastometric respirators pass the fit test. The filtration tests also confirmed the superiority of the new respirator over traditional N95 masks, with a mean performance of protection greater than 95%. For the filters, we used two types: SafeStar, which is a kind of HEPA filter; and CareStar, which is considered an elastostatic filler. CareStar was developed to filter virus and bacteria in the operating room, with a limit duration of use up to 24 h, while the safe star was designed for 72 h use and has the quality equivalent to a HEPA filter. Our study demonstrated superior filtration efficacy of both filters, more than 98% even after 24 h of use. CareStar has significantly more filtration efficacy than a safe star (p < 0.001). In conclusion, the development of our new N99 half-piece respirator should ultimately be applicable to healthcare workers with at least non-inferiority to the previously used N 95 respirators. As a universal masking policy is generally implemented, health care workers who are at risk must be protected with appropriate devices. Currently, the adequate supply of such equipment is not feasible. The advent of the new protective device will help protect healthcare workers and replenish the shortage of N95 respirators during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"The new silicone elastometric half-piece respirator, VJR-NMU: A novel and effective tool to prevent COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a natural reservoir of manifold zoonotic viruses, fruit bats have been involved in at least three emerging zoonoses in recent years.

Patients and methods: Between April 2020 and January 2021, a total of 38 patients (31 males, 7 females;mean age: 49.2 +/- 8.1 years;range, 38 to 65 years) who were previously diagnosed with SLE and on different lines of lupus management were included. The patients presented to chest outpatient clinic and emergency hospital with manifestations suggesting COVID-19 infection. Vitamin D levels were measured in serum by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Vitamin D supplement was added to treatment protocols for COVID-19. Results: Thirteen (34.2%) patients had normal baseline serum vitamin D levels (>= 30 ng/mL), nine (23.7%) patients had vitamin D insufficiency (21 to 29 ng/mL), and 16 (42.1%) patients had vitamin D deficiency (<= 20 ng/mL). Low vitamin D levels (insufficiency & deficiency) patients had long SLE disease duration (p=0.06). Also, there was a significant long time spent until recovery from COVID-19 infection in low vitamin D levels (insufficiency & deficiency) patient groups versus those with normal vitamin D (p=0.019). Low baseline vitamin D level patients mainly presented with severe COVID19 symptoms (p=0.04). Patients recovered from COVID-19 had normal vitamin D levels than those who died or were lost to follow-up (p=0.07). After recovery from COVID-19, fatigue was more common in SLE patients with low baseline vitamin D level. Conclusion: Vitamin D seems to play a certain role in the management of COVID-19 infection in SLE patients. Patients with normal vitamin D levels have less severe symptoms, shorter time to recovery, improved COVID-19 outcomes, and less development of fatigue after COVID-19 infection.","output":"Impact of vitamin D level and supplementation on systemic lupus erythematosus patients during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Due to the rapid surge in the number of COVID-19 cases in India, the health-care supply chain (HCSC) disruptions and uncertainties have increased manifold posing severe challenges to health-care facilities and significantly hampering the functioning of the health industry. This study aims to propose a hierarchical structural model of enablers of HCSC in the COVID-19 outbreak and identifies inter-relationships among them in the health-care market. Design/methodology/approach: Enablers of emergency HCSC have been identified through extensive literature review and experts opinions. Subsequently, total interpretive structural modeling (TISM) and cross-impact matrix-multiplication (MICMAC) analysis have been implemented to determine the hierarchical inter-relationships among enablers and classify them according to their contribution to the overall system. Findings: The research has identified and validated 15 enablers of the emergency supply chain in health-care businesses. The study resulted in a seven-level hierarchical structural model based on enablers driving and dependence powers. Further, the application of MICMAC analysis resulted in the classification of enablers into four groups, namely, autonomous, dependent, linkage and independent group. Research limitations/implications: This study would help health professionals, policymakers and academia to implement the theoretical model constructed to alleviate the effect of COVID-19 by improving the HCSC performances in pandemic situations. This study has social and economic implications in terms of cost-effective and efficient delivery of care services in health emergencies. Originality/value: The proposed theoretical model constructed is a new effort addressing the issues of HCSC in the COVID-19 crisis. Procedural implementation of TISM and MICMAC analysis in this study would help researchers to grasp concepts in a very lucid manner. The present study is one of the very few studies analyzing enablers in pandemic situations by implementing the TISM approach. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Modeling the emergency health-care supply chains: responding to the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The use of social media presents a unique opportunity for cancer screening programs to motivate individuals to get screened. However, we need a better understanding of what types of social media messages for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening are preferred. The objective of this study was to develop social media messages promoting CRC screening uptake to identify messages preferred by the target audience. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative descriptive study and collected data through focus groups with Facebook users of screen-eligible age. Participants were presented with social media messages and asked to provide feedback. Messages were informed by the Health Belief Model, current evidence regarding screening communication and health communication and social media best practices. Focus groups were audio-recorded and transcribed and analysis was completed by two independent coders. If messages generated sufficient discussion, we developed a recommendation regarding the use of the message in a future social media campaign. Recommendations included: strongly consider using this message, consider using this message, proceed with caution, and do not use this message. General considerations about social media campaigns were also noted. RESULTS: A total of 45 individuals participated in six focus groups. We developed recommendations for 7 out of the 18 messages tested; 1 was classified as strongly consider using this message, 4 as consider using this message and 2 as proceed with caution. The data suggest that participants preferred social media messages that were believed to be credible, educational, and with a positive or reassuring tone. Preferred messages tended to increase awareness about CRC risk and screening and prompted participants to ask questions, and to want to learn more about what they could do to lower their risk. Messages that were viewed as humorous, strange or offensive or that had a negative or excessively fearful tone were less well received by study participants. CONCLUSIONS: Facebook users prefer social media messages for CRC that have a positive or reassuring tone, are educational, and that have a credible ad sponsor. Campaign planners should proceed with caution when considering messages that use humor or a fearful tone to avoid undermining their campaign objectives.

With the outbreaks of the COVID-19 epidemic, the governments of multiple countries announced and enacted various anti-epidemic policies to deal with it. The present research proposed that cultural tightness, which is a basic cultural dimension to evaluate how strictly the social norms are abided by people in a society, could accelerate the effects of the anti-epidemic policies on constraints of the transmission of COVID-19. In specific, the new confirmed cases would be reduced by anti-epidemic policies in the tighter societies much earlier than the looser ones. In this work, we used cross-correlation analysis to investigate and analyze the leading and lagging associations between the stringency of anti-epidemic policies and the number of new confirmed cases among the usual tight and loose countries. The findings revealed that the severity of anti-epidemic policies is negatively correlated with the number of new confirmed cases in general. Moreover, cultural tightness does impact the effectiveness of the anti-epidemic policies on the constraints of COVID-19;that is, the lag weeks of new confirmed cases predicted by the stringency of anti-epidemic policies in the tight countries are significantly shorter than that of the loose countries.

This research studies the specific role of financial policy, the mechanism of support, and how financial policy can be coordinated with other public policies that encourage the green transition, particularly in the recovery period after the COVID-19 pandemic. The method we employ is a macroeconomic growth model with directed technical change, the natural environment, and financial features. It is found that (1) financial constraints are non-trivial in the economy and could delay the green transition if no additional policy is introduced. (2) Financial policy directionally supporting the green economic sector can facilitate the green transition and help stop the environmental degradation. (3) A financial policy can bring effects similar to some other policies in supporting the green transition. Compared with related policies, financial policy has certain advantages and disadvantages. There is a clear theoretical rationale to combine financial policy with other policies to save cost and improve the effect.

DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model reflecting local practices for LTBI treatment. SETTING: A remote Canadian arctic community with a high incidence of TB. PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical patients with LTBI. INTERVENTIONS: The cost effectiveness of 3HP was compared with the existing standard of care in the study region which consists of 9 months of twice weekly isoniazid (9H) given by directly observed therapy. OUTCOME MEASURES: Effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) with model parameters were derived from historical programmatic data, a local implementation study of 3HP and published literature. Costs from the perspective of the Nunavut healthcare system were measured in 2019 US dollars and were obtained primarily from local, empirically collected data. Secondary health outcomes included estimated TB cases and TB deaths averted using 3HP versus 9H. One way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: The 3HP regimen was dominant over 9H: costs were lower (US$628 vs US$924/person) and health outcomes slightly improved (20.14 vs 20.13 QALYs/person). In comparison to 9H, 3HP treatment resulted in fewer TB cases (27.89 vs 30.16/1000 persons) and TB deaths (2.29 vs 2.48/1000 persons). 3HP completion, initiation and risk of fatal adverse events were the primary drivers of cost effectiveness. CONCLUSION: In a remote Canadian arctic setting, using 3HP instead of 9H for LTBI treatment may result in cost savings and similar or improved health outcomes.","output":"Cost-effectiveness analysis of 3 months of weekly rifapentine and isoniazid compared to isoniazid monotherapy in a Canadian arctic setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To characterize and compare early coverage of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in newspapers, television, and social media, and discuss implications for public health communication strategies that are relevant to an initial pandemic response.

AM is moving from being a definitive diagnosis based on histological evidence of inflammatory infiltrates on cardiac tissue to a working diagnosis supported by high sensitivity troponin increase in association with specific cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) findings. Though experts still diverge between those advocating for histological definition versus those supporting a mainly clinical definition of myocarditis, in the real-world practice the diagnosis of AM has undoubtedly shifted from being mainly biopsy-based to solely CMRI-based in most of clinical scenarios. It is thus important to clearly define selected settings where EMB is a must, as information derived from histology is essential for an optimal management. As in other medical conditions, a risk-based approach should be promoted in order to identify the most severe AM cases requiring appropriate bundles of care, including early recognition, transfer to tertiary centers, aggressive circulatory supports with inotropes and mechanical devices, histologic confirmation and eventual immunosuppressive therapy. Despite improvements in recognition and treatment of AM, including a broader use of promising mechanical circulatory supports, severe forms of AM are still burdened by dismal outcomes. This review is focused on recent clinical studies and registries that shed new insights on AM. Attention will be paid to contemporary outcomes and predictors of prognosis, the emerging entity of immune checkpoint inhibitors-associated myocarditis, updated CMRI diagnostic criteria, new data on the use of temporary mechanical circulatory supports in fulminant myocarditis.

METHODS: We reviewed all patients admitted to our hospital during a 6-week period with a positive nasopharyngeal swab test for SARS-CoV-2. Among these patients, we identified AIS. We reviewed the demographics, clinical, laboratory, imaging characteristics, treatments received and outcomes of AIS in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: We identified 683 patients admitted with COVID-19 during the study period, of which 20 patients had AIS. Large-vessel occlusion (LVO) was noted in 11 patients (55%). Intravenous alteplase was administered in four patients (20%) and mechanical thrombectomy was performed in five patients (25%). Respiratory symptoms preceded the onset of AIS in most of the patients (70%) by 1 to 21 days. Mortality in patients with AIS was 50% compared with 26% of all COVID-19 admissions. Most of these patients died due to non-neurological causes (70%). Three patients with AIS had clinical and imaging findings consistent with COVID-19, but were negative for multiple nasopharyngeal swab tests. INTERPRETATION: LVO was more common in patients with AIS and COVID-19. They had more severe disease and higher mortality rates.

The objective of this study was to investigate whether microbiological outcomes and fracture-healing in osteoporotic bone is worse than normal bone with fracture-related infection (FRI). METHODS: A total of 120 six-month-old Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomized to six groups: Sham, sham + infection (Sham-Inf), sham with infection + antibiotics (Sham-Inf-A), ovariectomized (OVX), OVX + infection (OVX-Inf), and OVX + infection + antibiotics (OVX-Inf-A). Open femoral diaphysis fractures with Kirschner wire fixation were performed. Staphylococcus aureus at 4  10(4) colony-forming units (CFU)/ml was inoculated. Rats were euthanized at four and eight weeks post-surgery. Radiography, micro-CT, haematoxylin-eosin, mechanical testing, immunohistochemistry (IHC), gram staining, agar plating, crystal violet staining, and scanning electron microscopy were performed. RESULTS: Agar plating analysis revealed a higher bacterial load in bone (p = 0.002), and gram staining showed higher cortical bone colonization (p = 0.039) in OVX-Inf compared to Sham-Inf. OVX-Inf showed significantly increased callus area (p = 0.013), but decreased high-density bone volume (p = 0.023) compared to Sham-Inf.

HDGC is further complicated by difficulty of effective screening. Gastrectomy provides definitive treatment for CDH1 mutation-positive patients. Attempting to minimize the morbidity and mortality of this procedure via a laparoscopic approach is appropriate. METHODS Six consanguineous patients, 21 to 51 years of age, were identified as carriers of the CDH1 gene mutation. All of the patients' gastric mucosa was normal by endoscopic appearance and biopsy. After appropriate multispecialty counseling, all patients elected to undergo a laparoscopic total gastrectomy. Demographics, genealogy, operative approach, outcomes, and pathology were reviewed. RESULTS All gastrectomies were completed using a laparoscopic approach. Gross examination of resected stomachs was unremarkable. Histological examination demonstrated multiple foci of invasive signet ring adenocarcinoma in all patients. There were no anastomotic leaks, one small bowel obstruction requiring reoperation, and one esophageal stricture requiring dilation.

Moreover, the current review highlights the differential behavior of MBL on exposure with extra/intracellular pathogens and in autoimmune diseases, stressing the fact that high MBL levels can increase diseases susceptibility, a paradox that needs justification. Attributable to these discrepancies, no absolute level of MBL deficiency could be defined so far and thus must be interpreted for specific diseases through caseCcontrol population-specific designs.

Apart from this, it is necessary to adopt an extensive locus-wide methodology to apprehend the clinical significance of MBL2 polymorphisms in a variety of infectious diseases by the future studies.","output":"The ambiguous role of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) in human immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current strategies for improving protective response to influenza vaccines during immunosenescence do not adequately protect individuals over 65 years of age. Here, we used an aged mouse model to investigate the potential of co-delivery of influenza vaccine with the recently identified combination of a saponin adjuvant Quil-A and an activator of the STING pathway, 23 cyclic guanosine monophosphateCadenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) via dissolving microneedle patches (MNPs) applied to skin. We demonstrate that synergy between the two adjuvant components is observed after their incorporation with H1N1 vaccine into MNPs as revealed by analysis of the immune responses in adult mice. Aged 21-month-old mice were found to be completely protected against live influenza challenge after vaccination with the MNPs adjuvanted with the Quil-A/cGAMP combination (5 g each) and demonstrated significantly reduced morbidity compared to the observed responses in these mice vaccinated with unadjuvanted MNPs. Analysis of the lung lysates of the surviving aged mice post challenge revealed the lowest level of residual inflammation in the adjuvanted groups. We conclude that combining influenza vaccine with a STING pathway activator and saponin-based adjuvant in MNPs is a novel option for skin vaccination of the immunosenescent population, which is at high risk for influenza.","output":"cGAMP/Saponin Adjuvant Combination Improves Protective Response to Influenza Vaccination by Microneedle Patch in an Aged Mouse Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Initiation and inhibition are executive functions whose disruption in Parkinson's disease impacts substantially on everyday activities. Management of Parkinson's disease with subthalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) modifies initiation and inhibition, with prior work suggesting that these effects may be mediated via the connectivity of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) with the frontal cortex. Here, we employed high-resolution structural neuroimaging to investigate the variability in initiation, inhibition and strategy use in a cohort of twenty-five (ten females, mean age 62.5, mean Hoehn and Yahr stage 2.5) participants undertaking subthalamic DBS for Parkinson's disease. Neuropsychological assessment of initiation and inhibition was performed preoperatively and at six months postoperatively. We first reconstructed the preoperative connectivity of the STN with a frontal network of anterior and superior medial cortical regions. We then modelled the postoperative site of subthalamic stimulation and reconstructed the connectivity of the stimulation field within this same network. We found that, at both pre- and postoperative intervals, inter-individual variability in inhibition and initiation were strongly associated with structural network connectivity. Measures of subcortical atrophy and local stimulation effects did not play a significant role. Preoperatively, we replicated prior work, including a role for the right inferior frontal gyrus in inhibition and strategy use, as well as the left inferior frontal gyrus in tasks requiring selection under conditions of maintained inhibition. Postoperatively, greater connectivity of the stimulation field with right anterior cortical regions was associated with greater rule violations and suppression errors, supporting prior work implicating right-hemispheric STN stimulation in disinhibition. Our findings suggest that, in Parkinson's disease, connectivity of the frontal cortex with the STN is an important mediator of individual variability in initiation and inhibition,.

This paper evaluated COVID-19s impact on national and regional healthcare service utilisation and expenditure in China. METHODS: Using a big data approach, we collected data from 300 million bank card transactions to measure individual healthcare expenditure and utilisation in mainland China. Since the outbreak coincided with the 2020 Chinese Spring Festival holiday, a difference-in-difference (DID) method was employed to compare changes in healthcare utilisation before, during and after the Spring Festival in 2020 and 2019. We also tracked healthcare utilisation before, during and after the outbreak. RESULTS: Healthcare utilisation declined overall, especially during the post-festival period in 2020. Total healthcare expenditure and utilisation declined by 37.8% and 40.8%, respectively, while per capita expenditure increased by 3.3%. In a subgroup analysis, we found that the outbreak had a greater impact on healthcare utilisation in cities at higher risk of COVID-19, with stricter lockdown measures and those located in the western region. The DID results suggest that, compared with low-risk cities, the pandemic induced a 14.8%, 26.4% and 27.5% reduction in total healthcare expenditure in medium-risk and high-risk cities, and in cities located in Hubei province during the post-festival period in 2020 relative to 2019, an 8.6%, 15.9% and 24.4% reduction in utilisation services; and a 7.3% and 18.4% reduction in per capita expenditure in medium-risk and high-risk cities, respectively. By the last week of April 2020, as the outbreak came under control, healthcare utilisation gradually recovered, but only to 79.9%C89.3% of its pre-outbreak levels. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic had a significantly negative effect on healthcare utilisation in China, evident by a dramatic decline in healthcare expenditure. While the utilisation level has gradually increased post-outbreak, it has yet to return to normal levels.","output":"Reduction in healthcare services during the COVID-19 pandemic in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we described two cases with COVID-19 pneumonia, who developed pulmonary emphysema, bullae and pneumothorax during therapy.

Severe COVID-19 can be complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis and septic shock leading to death. These complications are thought to result from an overactivation of the immune system, leading to a cytokine storm syndrome associated with multiple organ failure. Here, we report that high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a prototypical damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) and a central mediator of lethal inflammation, could be a potential target for innovative therapeutic strategies for COVID-19. Serum HMGB1 in severe COVID-19 patients is elevated (189.40  140.88 ng/ml). Exogenous HMGB1 induces the expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 in alveolar epithelial cells in an AGER-dependent manner. Importantly, genetic (using AGER siRNA) or pharmacological (using glycyrrhizin, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and FPS-ZM1) inhibition of the HMGB1-AGER pathway blocks ACE2 expression.

Although many studies have evaluated the impact of these interventions, there is a lack of mapping between model parameters and actual geographic areas. In this study, a non-pharmaceutical intervention model of COVID-19 based on a discrete grid is proposed from the perspective of geography. This model can provide more direct and effective information for the formulation of prevention and control policies. First, a multi-level grid was introduced to divide the geographical space, and the properties of the grid boundary were used to describe the quarantine status and intensity in these different spaces;this was also combined with the model of hospital isolation and self-protection. Then, a process for the spatiotemporal evolution of the early COVID-19 spread is proposed that integrated the characteristics of residents daily activities. Finally, the effect of the interventions was quantitatively analyzed by the dynamic transmission model of COVID-19. The results showed that quarantining is the most effective intervention, especially for infectious diseases with a high infectivity. The introduction of a quarantine could effectively reduce the number of infected humans, advance the peak of the maximum infected number of people, and shorten the duration of the pandemic. However, quarantines only function properly when employed at sufficient intensity;hospital isolation and self-protection measures can effectively slow the spread of COVID-19, thus providing more time for the relevant departments to prepare, but an outbreak will occur again when the hospital reaches full capacity.

This model of health emergency governance replicates the practice of 'calculative technologies' and 'bio-politics' embedded in population management. Previous research on COVID-19 governance both in the United Kingdom and beyond provides varied revelations on broader 'technologies of government' and bio-politics by numerous governments. However, rarely have any studies explicitly and distinctively highlighted the unique 'calculative technologies' mobilised by governments within their bio-politically designed \\"technologies of government\\" to compel the populations to manage their lives under their COVID-19 guidance. The paper therefor examines how the UK government deployed \\"calculative technologies,\\" as part of its strategies of health governance and governmentality during the first wave of COVID-19 in England. METHODS This study uses document analysis as its data collection method. Its review includes documents, press releases, social media disclosures and health guidance issued by the UK government from March to December, 2020. The data are analysed employing the Foucault's governmentality and bio-political scholarship. RESULTS The paper's findings reveal the UK government's use of integrated calculative technologies of self-governance in the form of risk calculations and metrices/statistics (eg, death tolls, infection rates), performance management (eg, two metre social distancing, and hand washing for twenty seconds) and discipline and control (eg, fourteen days self-isolation), in addition to a more conventional top-down, managerial decision-making process adopted in the past. By these newly initiated \\"calculative technologies,\\" the government has \\"bio-politically\\" governed the behaviours and lifestyles of vulnerable community members, health workers and general public at a distance, inculcating self-management and individualisation of responsibility. CONCLUSION The newly adopted calculative technologies used by the UK government created a multi-faceted discourse of obligations, entitlements and scale of engagement, and facilitated directions about what people should do to protect themselves and others from the spread of the virus. Overall, the overtly and idiosyncratically used calculative technologies resemble a unique 'art of government' and produce a set of 'bio-political' interventions enforcing the populations to manage their own wellbeing and governing them at a distance during COVID-19.","output":"Bio-Politics and Calculative Technologies in COVID-19 Governance: Reflections From England."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article explores the oral histories of five parents from the United States and Europe who found themselves teaching their children at home, last spring, when school buildings closed in response to the COVID ?19 pandemic.

Lack of high-quality evidence is often cited as a barrier to DHI implementation. This review captures and appraises the current use, evidence base and reporting quality of mobile and wearable DHI following surgery. Keyword searches were performed within Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and WHO Global Index Medicus databases, together with clinical trial registries and Google scholar. Studies involving patients undergoing any surgery requiring skin incision where postoperative outcomes were measured using a DHI following hospital discharge were included, with DHI defined as mobile and wireless technologies for health to improve health system efficiency and health outcomes. Methodological reporting quality was determined using the validated mobile health evidence reporting and assessment (mERA) guidelines. Bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for randomised studies or MINORS depending on study type. Overall, 6969 articles were screened, with 44 articles included. The majority (n = 34) described small prospective study designs, with a high risk of bias demonstrated. Reporting standards were suboptimal across all domains, particularly in relation to data security, prior patient engagement and cost analysis. Despite the potential of DHI to improve postoperative patient care, current progress is severely restricted by limitations in methodological reporting.

Despite the growing body of research, quantitative synthesis of SARS-CoV-2 titers in wastewater generated from studies across space and time using diverse methods has not been performed. Objective: The objective of this study is to examine the correlations between SARS-CoV-2 viral titers in wastewater across studies, stratified by key covariates in study methodologies. In addition, we examined the associations of proportions of positive detections (PPD) in wastewater samples and methodological covariates. Methods: We systematically searched the Web of Science for studies published by February 16th, 2021, performed a reproducible screen, and employed mixed-effects models to estimate the levels of SARS-CoV-2 viral titers in wastewater samples and their correlations to case prevalence, sampling mode (grab or composite sampling), and the fraction of analysis (FOA, i.e., solids, solid-supernatant mixtures, or supernatants/filtrates) Results: A hundred and one studies were found; twenty studies (1,877 observations) were retained following a reproducible screen. The mean of PPD across all studies was 0.67 (95%-CI, [0.56, 0.79]). The mean titer was 5,244.37 copies/mL (95%-CI, [0; 16,432.65]). The Pearson Correlation coefficients (PCC) between viral titers and case prevalences were 0.28 (95%-CI, [0.01; 0.51) for daily new cases or 0.29 (95%-CI, [-0.15; 0.73]) for cumulative cases. FOA accounted for 12.4% of the variability in PPD, followed by case prevalence (9.3% by daily new cases and 5.9% by cumulative cases) and sampling mode (0.6%). Among observations with positive detections, FOA accounted for 56.0% of the variability in titers, followed by sampling mode (6.9%) and case prevalence (0.9% by daily new cases and 0.8% by cumulative cases). While sampling mode and FOA both significantly correlated with SARS-CoV-2 titers, the magnitudes of increase in PPD associated with FOA were larger. Mixed-effects model treating studies as random effects and case prevalence as fixed effects accounted for over 90% of the variability in SARS-CoV-2 PPD and titers. Interpretations: Positive pooled means and confidence intervals in PCC between SARS-CoV-2 titers and case prevalence indicators provide quantitative evidence reinforcing the value of wastewater-based monitoring of COVID-19. Large heterogeneities among studies in proportions of positive detections, titers, and PCC suggest a strong demand in methods to generate data accounting for cross-study heterogeneities and more detailed metadata reporting. Large variance explained by FOA suggesting FOA as a direction that needs to be prioritized in method standardization. Mixed-effects models accounting for study level variations provide a new perspective to synthesize data from multiple studies.","output":"Meta-analyses on SARS-CoV-2 Viral Titers in Wastewater and Their Correlations to Epidemiological Indicators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the precarious situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines is promising for prevention against the infection However, this type of vaccine has not been effectively commercialized because it needs to be stored and transported at ultracold conditions mRNA vaccines exposed to undesired temperatures may not show any visible changes but can deteriorate and cause negative effects Consumers' demand for vaccine authenticity requires logistics to develop a robust monitoring tool to ensure the integrity of ultracold supply chain from manufacturing until vaccination Here, we report a time-temperature indicator (TTI) that can detect a relatively small change in temperature within subzero ranges, for example, from -70 to -60 degreeC, which cannot be achieved by current TTIs operating at room temperature A dyed noneutectic ethylene glycol/water mixture that melts near the mRNA conservation temperature (-69 degreeC) diffuses into a white absorbent and leaves a colored trace In addition, the heterogeneous ice particles in the noneutectic mobile phase can prevent absorption during short-term exposure to room temperature Therefore, the proposed TTI will not record inevitable \\"meaningless\\" short-term exposure to room temperature during the cold supply chain but monitor the \\"meaningful\\" relatively long-term exposure above -60 degreeC These findings help facilitate the safe distribution of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines","output":"Tamper-Proof Time-Temperature Indicator for Inspecting Ultracold Supply Chain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose To present the response of the Israel National Transplantation Center (NTC) to the evolving challenge of COVID-19, the impact on deceased organ donation and living organ kidney donation during 2020, and resultant policy and ethical implications.

Fewer donors were admitted to ICU (P = 0.1) and the number of organs retrieved/donor decreased (3.8/donor to 3.4/donor). The overall result was a decrease of 24.2% in the number of transplant procedures (306 vs. 232). Living kidney donation, initially halted, resumed in May and the total number of procedures increased compared to 2019 due to a significant increase in altruistic donations (P < 0.0001), while the number of related-living donations decreased. Conclusion This study of organ donation during a crisis has informed the introduction of policy changes in the NTC including the necessity to mobilize rapidly a war room, the use of innovative virtual tools for contact-less communication, and the importance of cooperation with hospital authorities in allocating scarce health-care resources. Finally, the pandemic highlighted and intensified ethical considerations, such as under what circumstances living kidney donation be continued in the face of uncertainty, and what information to provide to altruistic donors regarding a prospective recipient, in particular whether all options for related living donation have been exhausted.

With ectodomains of only 20C40 residues, it is unclear how such diminutive viral fusion proteins mediate the initial stages (i.e. membrane contact and close membrane apposition) of the fusion reaction that precede actual membrane merger. We now show that the FAST proteins lack specific receptor-binding activity, and in their natural biological context of promoting cellCcell fusion, rely on cadherins to promote close membrane apposition. The FAST proteins, however, are not specifically reliant on cadherin engagement to mediate membrane apposition as indicated by their ability to efficiently utilize other adhesins in the fusion reaction. Results further indicate that surrogate adhesion proteins that bridge membranes as close as 13 nm apart enhance FAST protein-induced cellCcell fusion, but active actin remodelling is required for maximal fusion activity. The FAST proteins are the first example of membrane fusion proteins that have specifically evolved to function as opportunistic fusogens, designed to exploit and convert naturally occurring adhesion sites into fusion sites. The capacity of surrogate, non-cognate adhesins and active actin remodelling to enhance the cellCcell fusion activity of the FAST proteins are features perfectly suited to the structural and functional evolution of these fusogens as the minimal fusion component of a virus-encoded cellular fusion machine. These results also provide a basis for reconciling the rudimentary structure of the FAST proteins with their capacity to fuse cellular membranes.","output":"A Virus-Encoded CellCCell Fusion Machine Dependent on Surrogate Adhesins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pandemics including COVID-19 have disproportionately affected socioeconomically vulnerable populations. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to create a repeatable modeling process to identify regional population centers with pandemic vulnerability. METHODS: Using readily available COVID-19 and socioeconomic variable data sets, we used stepwise linear regression techniques to build predictive models during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. The models were validated later in the pandemic timeline using actual COVID-19 mortality rates in high population density states. The mean sample size was 43 and ranged from 8 (Connecticut) to 82 (Michigan). RESULTS: The New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Louisiana, Michigan, and Pennsylvania models provided the strongest predictions of top counties in densely populated states with a high likelihood of disproportionate COVID-19 mortality rates. For all of these models, P values were less than .05. CONCLUSIONS: The models have been shared with the Department of Health Commissioners of each of these states with strong model predictions as input into a much needed pandemic playbook for local health care agencies in allocating medical testing and treatment resources. We have also confirmed the utility of our models with pharmaceutical companies for use in decisions pertaining to vaccine trial and distribution locations.","output":"Predicting Health Disparities in Regions at Risk of Severe Illness to Inform Health Care Resource Allocation During Pandemics: Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Qatar experienced a large severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic that disproportionately affected the craft and manual workers (CMWs) who constitute 60% of the population. This study aimed to investigate level of immunity in communities within this population as well as infection exposure required to achieve herd immunity. Methods: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was assessed in ten CMW communities between June 21 and September 9, 2020. PCR positivity, infection positivity (antibody and/or PCR positive), and infection severity rate were also estimated. Associations with anti-SARS-CoV-2 positivity were investigated using regression analyses. Results: Study included 4,970 CMWs who were mostly men (95.0%) and <40 years of age (71.5%). Seropositivity ranged from 54.9% (95% CI: 50.2-59.4%) to 83.8% (95% CI: 79.1-87.7%) in the different CMW communities. Pooled mean seropositivity across all communities was 66.1% (95% CI: 61.5-70.6%). PCR positivity ranged from 0.0% to 10.5% (95% CI: 7.4-14.8%) in the different CMW communities. Pooled mean PCR positivity was 3.9% (95% CI: 1.6-6.9%). Median cycle threshold (Ct) value was 34.0 (range: 15.8-37.4). The majority (79.5%) of PCR-positive individuals had Ct value >30 indicative of earlier rather than recent infection. Infection positivity (antibody and/or PCR positive) ranged from 62.5% (95% CI: 58.3-66.7%) to 83.8% (95% CI: 79.1-87.7%) in the different CMW communities.

A disease surveillance team was organized to establish a hospital emergency department-based syndromic surveillance system (ED-SSS) capable of automatically transmitting patient data electronically from the hospitals responsible for emergency care throughout the country to the Centers for Disease Control in Taiwan (Taiwan-CDC) starting March, 2004. This report describes the challenges and steps involved in developing ED-SSS and the timely information it provides to improve in public health decision-making. METHODS: Between June 2003 and March 2004, after comparing various surveillance systems used around the world and consulting with ED physicians, pediatricians and internal medicine physicians involved in infectious disease control, the Syndromic Surveillance Research Team in Taiwan worked with the Real-time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance (RODS) Laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh to create Taiwan's ED-SSS. The system was evaluated by analyzing daily electronic ED data received in real-time from the 189 hospitals participating in this system between April 1, 2004 and March 31, 2005. RESULTS: Taiwan's ED-SSS identified winter and summer spikes in two syndrome groups: influenza-like illnesses and respiratory syndrome illnesses, while total numbers of ED visits were significantly higher on weekends, national holidays and the days of Chinese lunar new year than weekdays (p < 0.001). It also identified increases in the upper, lower, and total gastrointestinal (GI) syndrome groups starting in November 2004 and two clear spikes in enterovirus-like infections coinciding with the two school semesters. Using ED-SSS for surveillance of influenza-like illnesses and enteroviruses-related infections has improved Taiwan's pandemic flu preparedness and disease control capabilities. CONCLUSION: Taiwan's ED-SSS represents the first nationwide real-time syndromic surveillance system ever established in Asia. The experiences reported herein can encourage other countries to develop their own surveillance systems. The system can be adapted to other cultural and language environments for better global surveillance of infectious diseases and international collaboration.","output":"Establishing a nationwide emergency department-based syndromic surveillance system for better public health responses in Taiwan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed businesses and societies to the shortfalls of normal patterns of production, consumption, and their long-lasting impact on supply chains In this opinion paper, we provide insights from the COVID-19 pandemic for making supply chains more resilient, transparent, and sustainable These insights include supply chains needing to develop localization, agility, and digitization (LAD) characteristics We link LAD to a potential solution using blockchain technology and circular economy principle capabilities Use cases are used to show how blockchain-enabled circular economy practices can support supply chain LAD efforts Supply chain tracking, tracing, and responsiveness can be supported blockchain-enabled circular economy practices One result of identifying these relationships include solutions and insights at multiple levels and stakeholders C individual, organizational, supply chain, governmental, and community These crisis-related observations and findings set a future research foundation for sustainable production and consumption","output":"Redesigning Supply Chains using Blockchain-Enabled Circular Economy and COVID-19 Experiences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the pandemic caused by coronavirus disease (COVID-19), social media has played an important role by enabling people to discuss their experiences and feelings of this global crisis. To help combat the prolonged pandemic that has exposed vulnerabilities impacting community resilience, in this paper, based on our established large-scale COVID-19 related social media data, we propose and develop an integrated framework (named Dr.Emotion) to learn disentangled representations of social media posts (i.e., tweets) for emotion analysis and thus to gain deep insights into public perceptions towards COVID-19. In Dr.Emotion, for given social media posts, we first post-train a transformer-based model to obtain the initial post embeddings. Since users may implicitly express their emotions in social media posts which could be highly entangled with other descriptive information in the post content, to address this challenge for emotion analysis, we propose an adversarial disentangler by integrating emotion-independent (i.e., sentiment-neutral) priors of the posts generated by another post-trained transformer-based model to separate and disentangle the implicitly encoded emotions from the content in latent space for emotion classification at the first attempt. Extensive experimental studies are conducted to fully evaluate Dr.Emotion and promising results demonstrate its performance in emotion analysis by comparison with the state-of-the-art baseline methods. By exploiting our developed Dr.Emotion, we further perform emotion analysis over a large number of social media posts and provide in-depth investigation from both temporal and geographical perspectives, based on which additional work can be conducted to extract and transform the constructive ideas, experiences and support into actionable information to improve community resilience in responses to a variety of crises created by COVID-19 and well beyond.  2021 ACM.","output":"Dr.emotion: Disentangled representation learning for emotion analysis on social media to improve community resilience in the COVID-19 era and beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in an unprecedented global pandemic.

Aim: To confirm and study the incidence of the non amplification of the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid gene (N gene) target among known SARS-CoV-2 positive samples. Materials and Methods: This retrospective observational study was carried out at the State Virology Laboratory, Gandhi Medical College, Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India during January 2021 to May 2021. During the study period, a total of 159 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples were failed to amplify the N gene target. To investigate the non amplification of N gene target of SARSCoV-2, a total of 20 samples were selected and retested using the initially used RT-PCR kit (VIRALDTECT RT-PCR kit) and also with the two different RT-PCR kits (TaqPath RT-PCR kit and Hi-PCR RT-PCR kit) which also contain primers/probes for the SARS-CoV-2 N gene target. Results: Amplification and detection of the SARS-CoV-2 N target gene was not observed in VIRALDTECT RT-PCR test results. In contrast, amplification was detected in the N gene target of SARS-CoV-2 while using the TaqPath and Hi-PCR kits. Obtained results confirm the failure of the annealing of VIRALDTECT kit N gene primer/probe and suggest the possible mutation event in the SARS-CoV-2 N gene among the N gene non amplified samples. Conclusion: Present study reports, the incidence of non amplification of SARS-CoV-2 N gene, where the RT-PCR kit failed to detect N gene target and seriously affect RT-PCR diagnosis.

The primary outcome was defined as a combination of in-hospital mortality or discharge with palliative care. Logistic regression analysis was performed to analyze the associations between sex, age, and comorbidities with the primary outcome. The effect of comorbidities on the relation of age with the primary outcome was evaluated using mediation analysis. RESULTS: In-hospital COVID-19 related mortality occurred in 1108 (23%) patients, 836 (76%) were aged 70 years (70+). Both age 70+ and female sex were univariably associated with outcome (odds ratio [OR]4.68, 95%confidence interval [4.02C5.45], OR0.68[0.59C0.79], respectively;both p< 0.001). All comorbidities were univariably associated with outcome (p<0.001), and all but dyslipidemia remained significant after adjustment for age70+ and sex.

This study aims to investigate the seroprevalence of COVID-19 among HCWs in one of the COVID-19 referral centers in Makkah, Saudi Arabia using three different serological methods. METHODS: In-house developed enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA), commercially available electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA), and microneutralization (MN) assay were utilized to determine the seroprevalence rate among the study population. 204 HCWs participated in the study. Both physicians and nurses working in the COVID-19 and non COVID-19 areas were included. Twelve out of 204 were confirmed cases of COVID-19 with variable disease severity. Samples from recovered HCWs were collected four weeks post diagnosis. RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence rate was 6.3% (13 out of 204) using the in-house ELISA and MN assay and it was 5.8% (12 out of 204) using the commercial ECLIA. Among HCWs undiagnosed with COVID-19, the seroprevalence was 2% (4 out 192). Notably, neutralizing antibodies were not detected in 3 (25%) out 12 confirmed cases of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our study, similar to the recent national multi-center study, showed a low seroprevalence of SARS-Cov-2 antibodies among HCWs.

However, it is important to mention that high levels of glucose have deleterious effects on the walls of the vessels, causing microangiopathic damage to the lung, consequently this leads to pulmonary dysfunction. There is local oxidative stress, increased vascular permeability, producing changes in the secretion of the mucus that leads to reduced lung volumes, lung diffusion capacity, decrease bronchodilation. Knowing this complication at the pulmonary level derived from poor control of Diabetes Mellitus, diabetic pulmonary microangiopathy represents a challenge for the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a high prevalence of diabetic patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and the complications derived from this, that is why the idea arose to carry out this review and evaluate the impact that admission glucose levels have on the clinical evolution and prognosis of these patients. Elevated serum glucose levels have deleterious effects on the walls of blood vessels, leading to microangiopathy. Such a destructive process also involves the pulmonary circulation, where it is known as diabetic pulmonary microangiopathy. This hypothesis has been confirmed in histopathological examinations of the lung parenchyma, as well as in lung function tests. However, until now there have been no clinical implications of these findings.(1) Histopathological evidence of pulmonary involvement in subjects with diabetes mellitus has included thickened pulmonary capillary basal plates and alveolar epithelial plates, the latter suggesting existing pulmonary microangiopathy. Abnormal lung function has been detected in some diabetic patients. Glycosylation-induced non-enzymatic alteration of lung connective tissue is the most likely pathogenetic mechanism underlying mechanical lung dysfunction in diabetic subjects. while the most sustainable explanation for altered pulmonary microangiopathy.(2) Metodos: This short review looks at the main findings, prospective cross-sectional analytical study, in Guatemala Central America that included 319 patients with COVID 19, hospitalized with comorbidities like type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, hypertension and chronic kidney disease as medical history. These patients did not have a history of pulmonary pathology and who required a low- and high-flow oxygen device since admission, presenting moderate and severe COVID-19. These laboratories were carried out in the first chemistry performed after the onset of respiratory symptoms in the arrival at the hospital. Chi square was used for categorical variables and t student for numeric variables for the rest of the variables. Results: The study showed that in the severe group of patients the median age was 52 years old and in the moderate group it was 51. In the severe group of patients, a male gender predominance with 50.7% and 49.3% in moderate; showing the female sex 46% and 53% respectively. Regarding glucose levels at admission, there was a mean of 189mg / dl for severe patients and 156 mg / dl in moderate patients, with a P: 0.021. Conclusion: The primary point in this study is to see how the correlation was measured since they had to be two numerical variables for it to be correlation. In this case, blood glucose and vascular damage, the most severe cases were related to blood glucose levels greater than 125 mg/dl. In our study, we conclude that the presence of glycemic levels below 125 mg/dl is a protective factor with respect to mortality with an OR 0.521 (CL 0.324C0.835, Po.007). That means, that those patients who are admitted with glycemic levels greater than 126 mg/d have twice the risk to die at 28 days of admission than those who do not have levels greater than 125mg/dl. In the same way, those patients who were admitted with less than 95% saturation were compared and there was no significant difference OR 1.174 (0.492C2.806, p0.822). 1.

Policy guidance recommended that they should serve populations of 30 000-50 000 people to perform effectively. AIM To describe variation in the size and characteristics of PCNs and their populations. DESIGN AND SETTING Cross-sectional analysis in England. METHOD Using published information from January 2020, PCNs were identified that contained <30 000, between 30 000-50 000, and >50 000 people. Percentiles were calculated to describe variation in size and population characteristics. PCN composition within each commissioning region was also examined. RESULTS In total, 6758 practices had formed 1250 PCNs. Seven hundred and twenty-six (58%) PCNs had the recommended population of 30 000-50 000 people. Eighty-four (7%) PCNs contained <30 000 people. Four hundred and forty (35%) PCNs contained >50 000 people. Thirty-four (3%) PCNs comprised just one practice and 77 (6%) PCNs contained >10 practices. Some PCNs contained more than double the proportions of older people and people with chronic conditions compared to other PCNs. More than half of the population were from very socioeconomically deprived areas in 172 (14%) PCNs. Only six (4%) of the 135 commissioning regions ensured all PCNs were in the recommended population range. All practices had joined a single PCN in three (2%) commissioning regions. CONCLUSION More than 40% of the PCNs were not of the recommended size, and there was substantial variation in their composition and characteristics.

Here we report the safety and efficacy compared to standard dose (SD) schedules. METHOD: In this retrospective analysis patients who received ICI mono- or consolidation therapy, or adjuvant ICI therapy were assessed. Safety and efficacy of EI dosing with data of SD schedules were compared. RESULTS: One hundred seventeen patients received EI dosing for ICI and 88 patients SD. Patient characteristics were comparable. We observed 237 adverse events in the EI dosing cohort versus 118 in the SD group (p = 0.02). Overall, there was no difference in the occurrence of grade 3 adverse events (EI dosing: 21/237 [8.9%]; SD group: 20/118 [17.0%], p = 0.42), except for the pembrolizumab EI dosing cohort. Of all patients who received an EI dosing schedule, however, only 8 (6.8%) were reduced to SD because of toxicity. In 5 (4.3%) patients ICI was permanently stopped because of severe toxicity compared to 11 (12.5%) discontinuations in the SD group. Short-term treatment interruption occurred with similar frequencies in both groups. PFS and OS were comparable in patients receiving pembrolizumab and in those receiving adjuvant durvalumab. Progression-free survival and OS were better in the EI dosing cohort of nivolumab. CONCLUSION: EI dosing for ICI did not lead to an increase of clinically relevant toxicities resulting in dose reduction and/or treatment discontinuation. Efficacy of EI dosing of pembrolizumab and durvalumab were comparable to SD. Based on our safety and efficacy data EI dosing for ICI seems a safe and effective strategy. MICRO ABSTRACT: Aim Retrospective analysis of the safety and efficacy of extended interval dosing (EI) ICI compared to standard dose (SD) schedules. Results 117 patients received EI dosing and 88 SD. In the EI dosing cohort was no increase in toxicity leading to dose reduction and/or discontinuation of treatment. Furthermore, efficacy of EI dosing of pembrolizumab and durvalumab were comparable to SD.

The study had a cross-sectional and observational design. A total of 274 older adults in Lima, Peru (Mage = 67.86) filled out a sociodemographic survey, the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, Mental Health Inventory-5, Patient Health Questionnaire-2 item, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale. A Structural Equation Model (SEM) was estimated to test an a priori model that relates the sociodemographic variables, COVID-19 Anxiety, psychological well-being, anxiety and depression. The model fit indices indicated a good fit to the data. The socio-demographic variables explained 23.8% of the variance of the COVID-19 Anxiety (R2 = .238). Socio-demographic variables explained 50.5% of psychological well-being variance, 52% of anxiety and 46.9% of depression. Also, sex, work; being diagnosed with COVID-19; family member with COVID-19 diagnosis; and time of exposure to COVID-19 information had statistically significant effects psychological well-being, anxiety and depression.

The virus infects pigs of all ages, but it cause severe clinical disease in neonatal suckling pigs with up to 100% mortality. Currently, available vaccines are not completely effective and feedback methods utilizing PEDV infected material has variable success in preventing reinfection. Comprehensive information on the levels and duration of effector/memory IgA and IgG antibody secreting B cell response in the intestines and lymphoid organs of PEDV-infected sows, and their association with specific antibody levels in clinical samples such as plasma, oral fluid, and feces is important. Therefore, our goal in this study was to quantify PEDV specific IgA and IgG B cell responses in sows at approximately 1 and 6 months post-infection in commercial swine herds, including parity one and higher sows. Our data indicated that evaluation of both PEDV specific IgA and IgG antibody levels in the plasma and oral fluid (but not feces) samples is beneficial in disease diagnosis. PEDV specific B cell response in the intestine and spleen of infected sows decline by 6 months, and this associates with specific antibody levels in the plasma and oral fluid samples; but the virus neutralization titers in plasma remains high beyond 6 months post-infection. In conclusion, in sows infected with PEDV the presence of effector/memory B cell response and strong virus neutralization titers in plasma up to 6 months post-infection, suggests their potential to protect sows from reinfection and provide maternal immunity to neonates, but challenge studies are required to confirm such responses.","output":"Evaluation of humoral immune status in porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infected sows under field conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 global pandemic has caused millions of infections and deaths despite mitigation efforts that involve physical distancing, mask-wearing, avoiding indoor gatherings and increasing indoor ventilation.

It was hypothesized that inbuilt kitchen vents would be more effective in reducing indoor aerosol counts than opening windows alone. A fixed amount of saline aerosol was dispersed in the experimental area using a nebulizer under constant temperature and a narrow range of humidity. A laser air quality monitor was used to record small particle counts every 30 minutes from baseline to 120 minutes for four different experimental groups for each combination of kitchen vents and windows. The results of the study demonstrate that aerosol counts were lowest with the kitchen exhaust vents on. This study suggests that liberal use of home exhaust systems like the kitchen vents could achieve significantly more air exchange than open windows alone and may present an effective solution to improving indoor ventilation, especially during the colder months when people tend to congregate indoors in closed spaces.

With the recent rise of smart systems (e.g. Internet of things) and digital platforms (e.g. blockchain), smart contracts are gaining high interest in both business and academia. In this work, a framework for smart contracts was proposed with using reputation as the system currency, and conducts currency mining through fulfilling the physical commitments that are agreed upon. Design/methodology/approach: A game theory model is developed to represent the proposed system, and then a system dynamics simulator is used to check the response of the blockchain with different sizes. Findings: The numerical results showed that the proposed system could identify the takeover attacks and protect the blockchain from being controlled by an outsider. Another important finding is that careful setting of the maximum currency amount can improve the scalability of the blockchain and prevent the currency inflation. Research limitations/implications: This work is proposed as a conceptual framework for supply chain 4.0. Future work will be dedicated to implement and experiment the proposed framework for other characteristics that may be encountered in the context of supply chain 4.0, such as different suppliers' tiers, different customer typologies and smart logistics applications, which may reveal other challenges and provide additional interesting insights. Practical implications: By using the proposed framework, smart contracts and blockchains can be implemented to handle many issues in the context of operations and supply chain 4.0, especially in times of turbulence such as the COVID-19 global pandemic crisis. Originality/value: This work emphasizes that smart contracts are not too smart to be applied in the context of supply chain 4.0. The proposed framework of smart contracts is expected to serve supply chain 4.0 by automating the knowledge work and enabling scenario planning through the game theory model. It will also improve online transparency and order processing in real-time through secured multitier connectivity. This can be applied in global supply chain functions backed with digitization, notably during the time of the pandemic, in which e-commerce and online shopping have changed the rules of the game. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Are smart contracts too smart for Supply Chain 4.0?

This study analyzes the correlation between tumor size and malignancy in patients with nonfunctioning pancreatic endocrine tumors. METHODS All patients with nonfunctioning pancreatic endocrine tumors who underwent curative resection (R0) at our institution between 1990 and 2008 were considered. Their clinicopathologic characteristics were compared among 3 different groups according to tumor size. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed. RESULTS Over the study period, 177 patients were identified. Overall, 90 patients (51%) had a tumor size 2 cm (group 1), 46 (26%) had tumor size between >2 cm and 4 cm (group 2), and 41 (23%) had tumor size >4 cm (group 3). Tumors 2 cm were more frequently incidentally discovered (group 1, 57% vs group 2, 51% vs group 3, 32%; P = .014) and benign (group 1, 81% vs group 2, 65% vs group 3, 5%; P < .0001). The presence of a nonfunctioning pancreatic endocrine tumor >2 cm and a nonincidental diagnosis of the tumor were independent predictors of malignancy at multivariable analysis. None of the 51 patients (29%) with a pancreatic endocrine tumor 2 cm that was incidentally diagnosed died of disease. CONCLUSION A strict correlation between tumor size and malignancy in nonfunctioning pancreatic endocrine tumors was demonstrated.

EVALUATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS: HBO(2) is used in clinical practice to treat inflammatory conditions but has not been scientifically evaluated for COVID-19. Experimental and empirical data suggests that HBO(2) may reduce inflammatory response in COVID-19.

Public emergency usually spreads via network. Due to the temporal and spatial flexibility and the information amplification of network, the opinions from different regions and background are easy to be represented as network public opinion, and have important impact on social and economic life. Thus, studying the formation mechanism of network public opinion has important theoretical and practical significance. Taking the formation process of network public opinion under emergencies as the research object, this paper first identifies the key factors influencing the formation of network public opinion, namely the internal characteristics (include individual education level, individual stubbornness, individual initial opinion, and so on) and external information of individuals (include external information intensity). Second, information intensity is introduced to describe the influence of external information feature on the formation of network public opinion. Individual education level, individual stubbornness, and individual initial opinion are analyzed to describe the influence of individual internal factors on the formation, and then its model is constructed. Through the simulation experiments, this paper analyzes the influence of external information intensity, individual education level, individual stubbornness, individual initial opinion, and other factors on the formation of network public opinion. The simulation results show that: (1) the greater intensity of public emergency reporting causes the easier formation of network public opinion; (2) the higher individual education level leads to the shorter time for completing the final formation and stable state of online public opinions, and after the formation of online public opinions, the opinion of the event is mainly neutral; (3) the greater individual's stubbornness makes the shorter formation time of online public opinion. When online public opinion reaches a stable state, the neutral opinion group dominates and firmly controls the development trend of public opinion; (4) the difference of opinions among individuals is the most important factor affecting the formation of network public opinion. Finally, the rationality and validity of the proposed model are verified by a real case. Compared with previous studies on the formation mechanism of network public opinion, this paper divides the formation process of network public opinion into three stages: individual information perception, individual decision making, and individual opinion transmission. Meanwhile, the influence of individual internal factors and external information characteristics on the formation process of network public opinion is also considered.","output":"Modeling, simulation, and case analysis of COVID\\\\19 over network public opinion formation with individual internal factors and external information characteristics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: India reported first laboratory-confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on 30 January from Kerala. Media surveillance is useful to capture unstructured information about outbreaks. We established media surveillance and described the characteristics of the COVID-19 cases, clusters, deaths by time, place, and person during January-March 2020 in India. Methods: The media surveillance team of ICMR-National Institute of Epidemiology abstracted data from public domains of India's Central and State health ministries, online news and social media platforms for the period of January 31 to March 26, 2020. We collected data on person (socio-demographics, circumstances of travel/contact, clinical and laboratory), time (date/period of reported exposures; laboratory confirmation and death) and place (location). We drew epidemic curve, described frequencies of cases by age and gender. We described available details for identified clusters. Results: As of March 26, 2020, India reported 694 (Foreigners = 45, 6%) confirmed COVID-19 cases (Attack rate = 0.5 per million population) and 17 deaths (Fatality = 2.5%) from 21 States and 6 Union Territories. The cases were higher among 20-59 years of age (60 of 85) and male gender (65 of 107). Median age at death was 68 years (Range: 38-85 years). We identified 13 clusters with a total of 63 cases and four deaths among the first 200 cases. Conclusion: Surveillance of media sources was useful in characterizing the epidemic in the early phase.

Antigen detection tests can be used to aid in the diagnosis of various infectious-related disorders including COVID-19 where it has become especially important due to the serious nature of this disease and its worldwide prevalence. These tests closely mimic one of the earliest prototypes - the urine pregnancy test - and as a result they have gained wide acceptance based on their overall simplicity, low cost and relative accuracy. In some situations, especially as a screening test, they can be used instead of the more technically demanding and complex molecular and serologic assays that are still useful and helpful under many different circumstances. Antigen detection systems are based on finding a particular immunogenic component, typically a protein or polysaccharide molecule, that is both unique and an integral part of the pathogen or other biological entity. Because these tests generally provide only qualitative results, they often need to be supplemented with other and sometimes more sophisticated laboratory-based diagnostic procedures to corroborate the initial test result. In this review, we first describe general background information on antigen-detection methods, including any unique aspects of their overall design, and then follow with an extensive description on the merits and limitations of these tests for detecting COVID-19 and, to a lesser extent, for other serious respiratory diseases caused by three common bacterial pathogens - Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila.","output":"The evolution of rapid antigen detection systems and their application for COVID-19 and other serious respiratory infectious diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The comparison of the numbers of cases and deaths due to SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 shows that people in Central Europe are much more affected than people in East Asia where the disease originally occurred.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Computed tomography (CT) scans from major trauma patients (considered as a random population sample) from the radiology department of St George's University Hospitals NHS Trust, London, have been used to explore COVID-19 disease at the population level. RESULTS: At lockdown on 23 March 2020 in the catchment area of St George's University Hospitals NHS Trust, an earlier paper showed that there was a high prevalence of disease of >20%. With further follow-up and at the end of lockdown, it have been now estimated that around 57% of the population had been affected, which was similar to that predicted from a simple model based on average household size and prevalence at lockdown. With an average household size of around three persons, there was a 2-week sustain period and a 5-week decline period before the prevalence of the disease returned to background levels. CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest that the effect of lockdown is dependent on the disease prevalence at the start of lockdown and the average household size. It may therefore be important to lockdown early in an area with a high average household size. This paper is the second in a series of papers to show how radiology measurements of major trauma patients can be used to help monitor the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"COVID-19: using chest CT of major trauma patients to monitor and evaluate the effect of lockdown and the importance of household size"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose - Paper points out the importance of introducing and attending various educational programs, courses and workshops that are crucial in times of crisis.

However, the predictive value for protection against new variants of concern (VOCs) has not been firmly established. Here, we used bead-based arrays and flow cytometry to measure binding of antibodies to spike proteins and receptor-binding domains (RBDs) from VOCs in 12,000 sera. Effects of sera on RBD-ACE2 interactions were measured as a proxy for neutralizing antibodies. The samples were obtained from healthy individuals or patients on immunosuppressive therapy who had received two to four doses of COVID-19 vaccines and from COVID-19 convalescents. The results show that anti-RBDwt titers correlate with the levels of binding- and neutralizing antibodies against the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon and Omicron variants. The benefit of multiplexed analysis lies in the ability to measure a wide range of anti-RBD titers using a single dilution of serum for each assay. The reactivity patterns also yield an internal reference for neutralizing activity and binding antibody units per milliliter (BAU/ml). Results obtained with sera from vaccinated healthy individuals and patients confirmed and extended results from previous studies on time-dependent waning of antibody levels and effects of immunosuppressive agents. We conclude that anti-RBDwt titers correlate with levels of neutralizing antibodies against VOCs and propose that our method may be implemented to enhance the precision and throughput of immunomonitoring.","output":"Titers of antibodies the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of ancestral SARS-CoV-2 are predictive for levels of neutralizing antibodies to multiple variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AimsAt the start of the COVID-19 pandemic there was significant uncertainty for the NHS and it's workforce.

Many psychiatrist expressed anxieties around their competency in assessing and managing acutely physically unwell patients in a mental health setting.This project aimed to improve confidence of psychiatrists in core physical health competencies through devising and delivering an evolving SBE package.MethodSussex Partnership Foundation Trust redeployed two higher trainees from their simulation faculty to work full time on developing a SBE package. This was requested by senior leadership to deliver training about assessing and managing physically unwell patients in the context of COVID-19. This training was devised as a 90 minute didactic lecture following by 90 minutes of SBE.This was delivered at 6 sites through 10 opt-in sessions available to all doctors in the trust over 4 weeks. Pre and post-course questionnaires were given to all participants to measure the effect.Result102 medical staff attended the SBE workshops. Feedback was completed by 93 (91%) doctors prior to the course and 97 (95%) post. Before the workshop, 33% did not feel they had a structured approach for assessing an acutely unwell patient, which reduced to 0% after completing the course.On a 5-point Likert scale, confidence in managing COVID-19 symptoms increased from 2.54/5 to 4.07/5 overall with 89% of doctors feeling confident or very confident.

DESIGN: Population-based cohort study. SETTING: 264 Dutch general practices contributing to the NL-COVID database. PARTICIPANTS: 6074 people aged 0C99 diagnosed with COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOMES: Severe complications (hospitalisation, institutionalisation, death). The algorithm was developed from a training data set comprising 70% of the patients and validated in the remaining 30%. Potential predictor variables included age, sex, chronic comorbidity score (CCS) based on risk factors for COVID-19 complications, obesity, neighbourhood deprivation score (NDS), first or second COVID-19 wave and confirmation test. Six population vaccination scenarios were explored: (1) random (naive), (2) random for persons above 60 years (60plus), (3) oldest patients first in age band of 5 years (oldest first), (4) target population of the annual influenza vaccination programme (influenza), (5) those 25C65 years of age first (worker), and (6) risk based using the prediction algorithm (sCOVID). RESULTS: Severe complications were reported in 243 (4.8%) people with 59 (20.3%) nursing home admissions, 181 (62.2%) hospitalisations and 51 (17.5%) deaths. The algorithm included age, sex, CCS, NDS, wave and confirmation test (c-statistic=0.91, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.94) in the validation set. Applied to different vaccination scenarios, the proportion of people needed to be vaccinated to reach a 50% reduction of severe complications was 67.5%, 50.0%, 26.1%, 16.0%, 10.0% and 8.4% for the worker, naive, influenza, 60plus, oldest first and sCOVID scenarios, respectively. CONCLUSION: The sCOVID algorithm performed well to predict the risk of severe complications of COVID-19 in the first and second waves of COVID-19 infections in this Dutch population. The regression estimates can and need to be adjusted for future predictions.

We report the first recombinase-mediated MCV minicircle (MCVmc) system that generates high levels of circularized virus, allowing facile MCV genetic manipulation and characterization of viral gene expression kinetics during replication. Mutations to Fbw7, Skp2, ?-TrCP and hVam6p interaction sites, or to the stem loop sequence for the MCV-encoded miRNA precursor, markedly increase viral replication, whereas point mutation to an origin-binding site eliminates active virus replication. To further increase the utility of this system, an mScarlet fusion protein was inserted into the VP1 c-terminus to generate a non-infectious reporter virus for studies on virus kinetics. When this reporter virus genome is heterologously expressed together with MCV VP1 and VP2, virus-like particles are generated. The reporter virus genome is encapsidated and can be used at lower biosafety levels for one-round infection studies. Our findings reveal that MCV has multiple, self-encoded viral restriction mechanisms to promote viral latency over lytic replication, and these mechanisms are now amenable to examination using a recombinase technology.","output":"Replication Kinetics for a Reporter Merkel Cell Polyomavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak has caused a multi-sector global crisis on health, social, economic, and leadership aspects.

Our objective was to determine the pooled prevalence of AKI and KRT among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Study Design: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Data sources: Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and a registry of preprinted studies, published up to 14 Oct 2020. Study Selection: Eligible studies reported the prevalence of AKI in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) definition. Data Extraction and Synthesis: We extracted data on patient characteristics, the proportion of patients developing AKI and commencing KRT, important clinical outcomes (discharge from hospital, ongoing hospitalization and death), and risk of bias. Outcomes and Measures: We calculated the pooled prevalence of AKI and receipt of KRT, along with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a random effects model. We performed subgroup analysis based on admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). Results: Of 2,711 records reviewed, we included 53 published and 1 preprint study in the analysis, which comprised 30,657 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Data on AKI were available for 30,639 patients (n=54 studies), and the receipt of KRT for 27,525 patients (n=48 studies). The pooled prevalence of AKI was 28% (95% CI 22% to 34%; I2=99%), and the pooled prevalence of KRT was 9% (95% CI 7% to 11%; I2=97). The pooled prevalence of AKI among patients admitted to the ICU was 46% (95% CI 35% to 57%, I2=99%) and 19% of all ICU patients with COVID-19 (95% CI 15% to 22%; I2=88%) commenced KRT. Limitations: There was significant heterogeneity among the included studies which remained unaccounted for in sub-group analysis. Conclusions: AKI complicated the course of nearly 1 in 3 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The risk of AKI was higher in critically ill patients with a substantial number receiving KRT at rates higher than the general ICU population. Since COVID-19 will be a public health threat for the foreseeable future, these estimates should help guide KRT resource planning.","output":"The Prevalence of Acute Kidney Injury in Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19 Infection: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Knowledge landscapes require a platform run by information and communications technologies (ICT).

Smartphone apps have the potential to increase immunization rates through their ability to provide vaccine education, send vaccine reminders, and facilitate communication between parents and a multidisciplinary medical group. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the development of a smartphone app, Immunize PediatricTransplant, to promote pretransplant immunization and to report on app functionality and usability when applied to the target population. METHODS: We used a mixed methods study design guided by the Mobile Health Agile Development and Evaluation Lifecycle. We first completed a formative research including semistructured interviews with transplant stakeholders (12 primary care physicians, 40 parents or guardians of transplant recipients, 11 transplant nurse coordinators, and 19 transplant subspecialists) to explore the acceptability of an immunization app to be used in the pretransplant period. Based on these findings, CANImmunize Inc developed the Immunize PediatricTransplant app. We next held 2 focus group discussions with 5-6 transplant stakeholders/group (n=11; 5 parents of transplant recipients, 2 primary care physicians, 2 transplant nurse coordinators, and 2 transplant subspecialists) to receive feedback on the app. After the app modifications were made, alpha testing was conducted on the functional prototype. We then implemented beta testing with 12 stakeholders (6 parents of transplant recipients, 2 primary care doctors, 2 transplant nurse coordinators, and 2 transplant subspecialists) to refine the app through an iterative process. Finally, the stakeholders completed the user version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale (uMARS) to assess the functionality and quality of the app. RESULTS: A new Android- and Apple-compatible app, Immunize PediatricTransplant, was developed to improve immunization delivery in the pretransplant period. The app contains information about vaccine use in the pretransplant period, houses a complete immunization record for each child, includes a communication tool for parents and care providers, and sends automated reminders to parents and care providers when immunizations are due. During usability testing, the stakeholders were able to enter a mock vaccine record containing 16 vaccines in an average of 8.1 minutes (SD 1.8) with 87% accuracy. The stakeholders rated engagement, functionality, aesthetics, and information quality of the app as 4.2/5, 4.5/5, 4.6/5, and 4.8/5, respectively. All participants reported that they would recommend this app to families and care teams with a child awaiting solid organ transplant. CONCLUSIONS: Through a systematic, user-centered, agile, iterative approach, the Immunize PediatricTransplant app was developed to improve immunization delivery in the pretransplant period. The app tested well with end users. Further testing and agile development among patients awaiting transplant are needed to understand real-world acceptability and effectiveness in improving immunization rates in children awaiting transplant.","output":"A Smartphone App to Increase Immunizations in the Pediatric Solid Organ Transplant Population: Development and Initial Usability Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES The objective of the study were to examine the safety and efficacy of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) for reducing seizure frequency and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in children younger than six years and to examine long-term VNS efficacy for children who receive the device at ages 1-3 and at ages 4-6. METHODS We conducted a 10-year retrospective analysis of VNS implantations at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. Relevant data were collected within 12 months of VNS implantation and at six months, one, two, and four years after VNS implantation. RESULTS This analysis included 99 patients ages 0-3 (n = 40) and 4-6 (n = 59) at first VNS implantation. Eighty-six patients followed up for 4 years. There were no significant differences between age at VNS implant (0-3 vs. 4-6) and seizure etiology or most seizure semiologies. Patients took an average of 3.01  1.29 AEDs prior to VNS and 3.84  1.68 AEDs at their latest follow-up. The overall response to VNS therapy (50% seizure reduction) at one year, two years, and four years after VNS implantation was 55%, 60%, and 52%, respectively. At two years, 59% of 0- to 3-year-old patients responded to VNS and 52% of 4- to 6-year-old patients responded to VNS. The overall major complication rate was 5.6%, consistent with VNS use for older age groups. SIGNIFICANCE This study demonstrates the safety and efficacy of VNS for children with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) younger than six. One, two, and four years after VNS implantation, 55%, 60%, and 52% of these patients, respectively, achieved 50% reduction in seizure frequency. The safety of VNS is also comparable with older, better studied, age groups. Based on these data, VNS therapy should be considered for children younger than six.","output":"Efficacy of vagus nerve stimulation for drug-resistant epilepsy in children age six and younger."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionElectroconvulsive therapy is a highly effective treatment for severe psychopharmacological resistant patients but it is also a procedure that involves open airway management and has been considered as an aerosol generating procedure.

METHODS: Information on individual hospitalizations related to the 2017/2018 influenza epidemic were accessed from Statistics Netherlands. The influenza cases were stratified between non-carnival and carnival regions. Distributions of influenza cases were plotted with time and compared between regions. A similar investigation in the early outbreak of COVID-19 was also conducted using open data from the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics between non-carnival and carnival regions were broadly similar. There were 13,836 influenza-related hospitalizations in the 2017/2018 influenza epidemic, and carnival fell about 1 week before the peak of these hospitalizations. The distributions of new influenza-related hospitalizations per 100,000 inhabitants with time between regions followed the same pattern with a surge of new cases in the carnival region about 1 week after carnival, which did not occur in the non-carnival region. The increase of new cases for COVID-19 in the carnival region exceeded that in the non-carnival region about 1 week after the first case was reported, but these results warrant caution as for COVID-19 there were no cases reported before the carnival and social measures were introduced shortly after carnival.

Due to the speedy development in the field of salivaomics, saliva is now well accepted as a pool of biological markers that vary from changes in biochemicals, nucleic acids and proteins to the microflora. Saliva has an immense potential as a diagnostic fluid and offers an edge over other biological fluids as its collection method does not require invasive procedure, economical and is useful for monitoring systemic health. Development of sensitive and precise salivary diagnostic tools and the formulation of defined guidelines following meticulous testing will allow salivary diagnostics to be utilised as chair side tests for various oral and systemic diseases in the near future. The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic is the biggest challenge and global health crisis for the world since World War Two. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of Covid-19 is crucial in controlling the outbreak in the community and in hospitals. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs are the recommended specimen types for Covid-19 diagnostic testing. The collection of these specimen types requires close contact between healthcare workers and patients and poses a risk of transmission of the virus, causes discomfort and may cause bleeding, especially in patients with condition such as thrombocytopenia. Hence, nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs are not desirable for sequential monitoring of viral load. Saliva specimens can be obtained easily as the patient is asked to spit into a sterile bottle. The collection of saliva is non-invasive and greatly minimizes the exposure of healthcare workers to Covid-19. Saliva has a high consistency rate of greater than 90% with nasopharyngeal specimens in the detection of respiratory viruses, including coronaviruses. Saliva has also been used in screening respiratory viruses among hospitalized patients without pyrexia or respiratory symptoms. SARS-CoV can be detected in saliva at high titers. Salivary diagnostics is a dynamic field that is being incorporated as part of disease diagnosis, clinical monitoring of systemic health and to make significant clinical decisions for patient care. More research is required to analyze the potential diagnostic of Covid-19 in saliva to develop rapid chair side tests for the detection of Covid-19 and it is also pivotal to improve and develop successful strategies for prevention, especially for dentists and healthcare professionals who are involved in performing aerosol-generating procedures.","output":"A Review of Salivary Diagnostics and Its Potential Implication in Detection of Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral infections are known to be the main trigger for Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations.

This study aims to determine the effectiveness of a comprehensive geriatric assessment and a tailored intervention in the elderly calling on an Emergency Medical Service (EMS) for a fall at home, but not conveyed to the ED or rapidly discharged from it (less than 24 h from hospitalisation), to the time to institutionalisation or death. METHODS: Rising-Dom is a two-arm randomised (ratio 1:1), interventional, multi-centre and open study. Community-dwelling elderly people ( 70 years) who call an EMS for a fall at home are recruited. The intervention group receives home visits by a nurse with a comprehensive fall risk assessment and a personalised intervention care plan with a planned follow-up (six nurse home visits and five nurse phone calls). Subjects enrolled in the usual care-control group continue to receive their routine care for the prevention or treatment of diseases. Primary (time to institutionalisation or death) and secondary (unscheduled hospitalisations, additional EMS calls relating to falls, functional decline and quality of life) outcome data will be collected for both groups through five phone calls made by Clinical Research Associates (CRA) blind to the participants group during the follow-up period (24-months). Twelve hospital centres in the South-West of France are participating in the study as study sites. The inclusion period started in October 2019 and will end in March 2022.

After introducing two modifications into the wild-type RBD gene to reduce yeast-derived hyperglycosylation and improve stability during protein expression, we show that the recombinant protein, RBD219-N1C1, is equivalent to the wild-type RBD recombinant protein (RBD219-WT) in an in vitro ACE-2 binding assay. Immunogenicity studies of RBD219-N1C1 and RBD219-WT proteins formulated with Alhydrogel? were conducted in mice, and, after two doses, both the RBD219-WT and RBD219-N1C1 vaccines induced high levels of binding IgG antibodies. Using a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, we further showed that sera obtained after a two-dose immunization schedule of the vaccines were sufficient to elicit strong neutralizing antibody titers in the 1:1,000 to 1:10,000 range, for both antigens tested. The vaccines induced IFN-?3 IL-6, and IL-10 secretion, among other cytokines.

This paper presents results from a stochastic simulation designed to assess this risk. The model incorporates a queueing network to simulate people flow and touchscreen interactions. It also describes an updated model for microbial transmission using an asymmetric gradient transfer assumption that incorporates literature reviewed empirical data concerning touch-transfer efficiency between fingers and surfaces. In addition to natural decay/die-off, pathogens are removed from the system by simulated cleaning / disinfection and personal-touching rates (e.g. face, dermal, hair and clothing). The dose response is implemented with an exponential moving average filter to model the temporal dynamics of exposure. Public touchscreens were shown to pose a considerable infection risk (3%) using plausible default simulation parameters. Sensitivity of key model parameters, including the rate of surface disinfection is examined and discussed. A distinctive and important advancement of this simulation was its ability to distinguish between infection risk from a primary contaminated source and that due to the re-deposition of pathogens onto secondary, initially uncontaminated touchscreens from sequential use. The simulator is easily configurable and readily adapted to more general fomite-mediated transmission modelling and may provide a valuable framework for future research.","output":"A quantitative microbial risk assessment for touchscreen user interfaces using an asymmetric transfer gradient transmission mode"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM To develop a cognitive behavioural therapy based intervention for people with type 1 diabetes and disordered eating using Experience-Based Co-Design as part of the Safe management of people with Type 1 diabetes and EAting Disorders studY (STEADY).

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis with the primary aim of estimating mortality from major causes of adult meningitis in routine care settings, and to contrast this with outcomes from clinical trial settings. METHODS We searched PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library for published clinical trials (defined as randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) or investigator-managed prospective cohorts) and observational studies that evaluated outcomes of adult meningitis in SSA from 1 January 1990 through 15 September 2019. We performed random effects modelling to estimate pooled mortality, both in clinical trial and routine care settings. Outcomes were stratified as short-term (in-hospital or two weeks), medium-term (up to 10 weeks) and long-term (up to six months). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Seventy-nine studies met inclusion criteria. In routine care settings, pooled short-term mortality from cryptococcal meningitis was 44% (95% confidence interval (95% CI):39% to 49%, 40 studies), which did not differ between amphotericin (either alone or with fluconazole) and fluconazole-based induction regimens, and was twofold higher than pooled mortality in clinical trials using amphotericin based treatment (21% (95% CI:17% to 25%), 17 studies). Pooled short-term mortality of TB meningitis was 46% (95% CI: 33% to 59%, 11 studies, all routine care). For pneumococcal meningitis, pooled short-term mortality was 54% in routine care settings (95% CI:44% to 64%, nine studies), with similar mortality reported in two included randomized-controlled trials. Few studies evaluated long-term outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Mortality rates from HIV-associated meningitis in SSA are very high under routine care conditions.

The objective of this study was to assess the well-being, resilience, burnout, and wellness factors and needs of EM physicians and advanced practice providers (e.g., nurse practitioners and physician assistants; APPs) during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A descriptive, prospective, cohort survey study of EM physicians and APPs was performed across ten emergency departments in a single state, including academic and community settings. Participants were recruited via email to complete four weekly, voluntary, anonymous questionnaires comprised of customized and validated tools for assessing wellness (Well Being Index), burnout (Physician Work Life Study item), and resilience (Brief Resilience Scale) during the initial acceleration phase of COVID-19. Univariate and multivariate analysis with Chi-squared, Fisher's Exact, and logistic regression was performed. RESULTS: Of 213 eligible participants, response rates ranged from 31 to 53% over four weeks. Women comprised 54 to 60% of responses. Nonrespondent characteristics were similar to respondents. Concern for personal safety decreased from 85 to 61% (p < 0.001). Impact on basic self-care declined from 66 to 32% (p < 0.001). Symptoms of stress, anxiety, or fear was initially 83% and reduced to 66% (p = 0.009). Reported strain on relationships and feelings of isolation affected > 50% of respondents initially without significant change (p = 0.05 and p = 0.30 respectively). Women were nearly twice as likely to report feelings of isolation as men (OR 1.95; 95% CI 1.82-5.88). Working part-time carried twice the risk of burnout (OR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.10-5.47). Baseline resilience was normal to high. Provider well-being improved over the four weeks (30 to 14%; p = 0.01), but burnout did not significantly change (30 to 22%; p = 0.39). CONCLUSION: This survey of frontline EM providers, including physicians and APPs, during the initial surge of COVID-19 found that despite being a resilient group, the majority experienced stress, anxiety, fear, and concerns about personal safety due to COVID-19, putting many at risk for burnout.

One of the contributing factors for these problems is cultural malpractices during pregnancy and childbirth. The actual incidence of cultural malpractices in developing countries accounts for about 5C15% of maternal deaths. Thus, understanding the link between cultural affairs and maternal health is critical to saving the lives of women and their babies. Therefore, this research was aimed to assess cultural malpractices during labor and delivery and associated factors among women who had at least one history of delivery in selected Zones of the Amhara region, North West Ethiopia. METHOD: Community based cross-sectional study was conducted on women who had at least one delivery history in Awi, West, and East Gojjam Zones from January 1 to May 30, 2020. The multistage cluster sampling technique was used to select 845 study participants. Data was collected through a pre-tested and structured interview questionnaire, entered and cleaned using EPI info version 7.2, and exported to SPSS version 23 for analysis. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression was employed to assess the association of the variables and a P-value less than 0.05 was declared as statistically significant. RESULT: Out of 845 women 162(19.2%) practiced nutritional taboo, 77(9.1%) women practiced abdominal massage and 273(32.3%) delivered their babies at home.

Our model is conservative in that it ignores sample dilution effects, which can only worsen pooling performance. Results: We show that one can expect a 60-80% increase in false-negative rates under Dorfman pooling, for reasonable parameter values. On average, when separate testing misses, e.g., ten infected individuals - Dorfman pooling misses more than sixteen.

The most prominent features of the disease are its endemic nature, long-incubation period, familial clustering of the disease and an unusually high incidence of associated upper urothelial cancer (UUC). There are no clear-cut data on BEN incidence and prevalence, since the studies carried out in different endemic areas yielded contradictory information. In spite of intermittent variations, the incidence of new cases has remained stable over time. It has been estimated that almost 100 000 people are at risk of BEN, whereas 25 000 have the disease. The clinical signs and symptoms of BEN are non-specific and often remain unrecognized for years. There are no pathognomonic diagnostic features of BEN, but the set of epidemiological, clinical and biochemical data along with the pattern of pathologic injury in the absence of any other renal diseases are highly suggestive of this entity. Although the aetiology has been extensively studied, fostering the publication of various hypotheses, only one of them has provided conclusive evidence related to the aetiology of BEN. Studies conducted over the past decade have provided particularly strong arguments that BEN and UUC are caused by chronic poisoning with aristolochic acids (AAs).

More than 130 types of herbal injections are used clinically for 400 million patients annually with total sales of over four billion US dollars per year. However, the current quality control (QC) methods relying mainly on chemical fingerprints (CF) can hardly ensure quality and safety of the herbal injections with complex chemical composition and have resulted in an increase in serious adverse drug reactions. In this study, a comprehensive approach for the QC of a controversial herbal injection Shuang-Huang-Lian lyophilized powder (SHL) was established based on the quality fluctuation detection by a combination of CF and biological fingerprint (BF). High-performance liquid chromatography and the impedance-based xCELLigence system were applied to establish the CF and BF, respectively. In addition, multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate the discriminant ability of the two methods.

However, several factors cause older people to be particularly reluctant to adopt digital health technologies such as mobile health (mHealth) tools. In addition to previously studied technology acceptance factors, those related to perceived risks of mHealth use (eg, leakage of sensitive information or receiving incorrect health recommendations) may further diminish mHealth adoption by older adults. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between perceived risks of using mHealth applications and the intention to use these applications among older adults. METHODS: We designed a cross-sectional study wherein a questionnaire was used to collect data from participants aged 65 years and older in the Netherlands. Perceived risk was divided into four constructs: privacy risk, performance risk, legal concern, and trust. Linear regression analyses were performed to determine the associations between these perceived risk constructs and the intention to use mHealth applications. RESULTS: Linear regression per perceived risk factor showed that each of the four constructs is significantly associated with the intention to use mobile medical applications among older adults (adjusted for age, sex, education, and health status). Performance risk (=C.266; P=<.001), legal concern (=C.125; P=.007), and privacy risk (=C.100; P=.03) were found to be negatively correlated to intention to use mHealth applications, whereas trust (=.352; P=<.001) was found to be positively correlated to the intention to use mHealth applications. CONCLUSIONS: Performance risk, legal concern, and privacy risk as perceived by older adults may substantially and significantly decrease their intention to use mHealth applications. Trust may significantly and positively affect this intention. Health care professionals, designers of mHealth applications, and policy makers can use these findings to diminish performance risks, and tailor campaigns and applications to address legal and privacy concerns and promote mHealth uptake and health care access for older adults, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Relationship Between Perceived Risks of Using mHealth Applications and the Intention to Use Them Among Older Adults in the Netherlands: Cross-sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since it was first recognized in bacteria and archaea as a mechanism for innate viral immunity in the early 2010s, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) has rapidly been developed into a robust, multifunctional genome editing tool with many uses. Following the discovery of the initial CRISPR/Cas-based system, the technology has been advanced to facilitate a multitude of different functions. These include development as a base editor, prime editor, epigenetic editor, and CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and CRISPR activator (CRISPRa) gene regulators. It can also be used for chromatin and RNA targeting and imaging. Its applications have proved revolutionary across numerous biological fields, especially in biomedical and agricultural improvement. As a diagnostic tool, CRISPR has been developed to aid the detection and screening of both human and plant diseases, and has even been applied during the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. CRISPR/Cas is also being trialed as a new form of gene therapy for treating various human diseases, including cancers, and has aided drug development. In terms of agricultural breeding, precise targeting of biological pathways via CRISPR/Cas has been key to regulating molecular biosynthesis and allowing modification of proteins, starch, oil, and other functional components for crop improvement. Adding to this, CRISPR/Cas has been shown capable of significantly enhancing both plant tolerance to environmental stresses and overall crop yield via the targeting of various agronomically important gene regulators. Looking to the future, increasing the efficiency and precision of CRISPR/Cas delivery systems and limiting off-target activity are two major challenges for wider application of the technology. This review provides an in-depth overview of current CRISPR development, including the advantages and disadvantages of the technology, recent applications, and future considerations.","output":"CRISPR/Cas: a Nobel Prize award-winning precise genome editing technology for gene therapy and crop improvement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Objectives This study aims to compare clinical course and outcomes between pregnant and reproductive-aged non-pregnant women with COVID-19 and assess the vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 in pregnancy. Methods Medical records of pregnant and reproductive-aged non-pregnant women hospitalized with COVID-19 from January 15 to March 15, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. The severity of disease, virus clearance time, and length of hospital stay were measured as the primary interest and the vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 was also assessed. Results Eighty-two patients (28 pregnant women, 54 reproductive-aged non-pregnant women) with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in this study. Univariate regression indicated no association between pregnancy and the severity of disease (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.08-5.15; p =0.76), virus clearance time (HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.65-2.01; p =0.62), and length of hospital stay (HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.66-1.84; p =0.71).

Current methods for automatic beat-by-beat arrhythmia detection suffer from poor generalization ability due to the lack of large-sample and finely-annotated (labels are given to each beat) ECG data for model training. In this work, we propose a weakly supervised deep learning framework for arrhythmia detection (WSDL-AD), which permits training a fine-grained (beat-by-beat) arrhythmia detector with the use of large amounts of coarsely annotated ECG data (labels are given to each recording) to improve the generalization ability. In this framework, heartbeat classification and recording classification are integrated into a deep neural network for end-to-end training with only recording labels. Several techniques, including knowledge-based features, masked aggregation, and supervised pre-training, are proposed to improve the accuracy and stability of the heartbeat classification under weak supervision. The developed WSDL-AD model is trained for the detection of ventricular ectopic beats (VEB) and supraventricular ectopic beats (SVEB) on five large-sample and coarsely-annotated datasets and the model performance is evaluated on three independent benchmarks according to the recommendations from the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI). The experimental results show that our method improves the F (1) score of supraventricular ectopic beats detection by 8%C290% and the F1 of ventricular ectopic beats detection by 4%C11% on the benchmarks compared with the state-of-the-art methods of supervised learning. It demonstrates that the WSDL-AD framework can leverage the abundant coarsely-labeled data to achieve a better generalization ability than previous methods while retaining fine detection granularity. Therefore, this framework has a great potential to be used in clinical and telehealth applications.

DESIGN: Regression discontinuity and time-to-event analysis. SETTING: Two large academic hospitals in a unified health system. PATIENTS OR SUBJECTS: Adult decedents who received greater than or equal to 1 day of ICU care during their terminal admission over a 12-month period. INTERVENTIONS: Implementation of a visit restriction policy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We identified 940 adult decedents without coronavirus disease 2019 during the study period. For these patients, ICU length of stay was 0.8 days longer following policy implementation, although this effect was not statistically significant (95% CI, -2.3 to 3.8; p = 0.63). After excluding patients admitted before the policy but who died after implementation, we observed that ICU length of stay was 2.9 days longer post-policy (95% CI, 0.27-5.6; p = 0.03). A time-to-event analysis revealed that admission after policy implementation was associated with a significantly longer time to first do not resuscitate/do not intubate/comfort care order (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.6-3.1; p < 0.0001).

METHODS: Adults involved in studies prior to the pandemic were contacted during the COVID-19 lockdown. Seventeen young adults (age range: 18-35 years) and 21 older adults (age range: 65-90 years) agreed to participate. Participants were interviewed by phone (between 27th April and 4th May, 2020) to complete the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Dysfunctional Beliefs About Sleep (DBAS) questionnaire they had been administered before the pandemic. RESULTS: In terms of mean changes, the results showed null effect sizes for changes in self-reported sleep quality for both age groups. In young adults, a medium effect size emerged for changes in sleep latency, which increased during lockdown. No changes in any of the self-reported sleep quality dimensions emerged in older adults. In both age groups, the effect sizes for changes in dysfunctional sleep-related beliefs were negligible. In older adults, however, changes in self-reported sleep quality were largely associated with changes in dysfunctional sleep-related beliefs. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that self-reported sleep quality and dysfunctional sleep-related beliefs were not affected by the COVID-19 lockdown in young or older adults. They also suggest that it might be useful to consider changes in dysfunctional sleep-related beliefs to better capture the impact of stressful events (such as a period of quarantine) on sleep quality, especially where older adults are concerned.","output":"Self-reported sleep quality and dysfunctional sleep-related beliefs in young and older adults: changes in times of COVID-19 lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Disruption of sleep has great impact on quality of life. In children with a suprasellar tumor and hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction, the circadian rhythm may be disturbed causing sleep problems. However, also other factors may influence sleep. Awareness of these different etiologies and careful history taking with appropriate additional diagnostics will aid in restoring sleep quality. METHODS We present the workup of 4 cases with a suprasellar tumor and disturbances of sleep initiation, sleep maintenance, and daytime sleepiness. In parallel, we developed a flowchart, to aid clinicians in the diagnostics of sleep problems in children after treatment for a (supra) sellar brain tumor. RESULTS All four patients, known with hypopituitarism, presented with sleep complaints and increased daytime sleepiness. In all four, the cause of sleep problems showed to be different. In the first case, sleep evaluation revealed a severe obstructive sleep apnea, whereupon nocturnal ventilation was started. The second case revealed poor sleep hygiene in combination with an obsessive compulsive disorder. Sleep hygiene was addressed and psychiatric consultation was offered. Dexamphetamine treatment was started to reduce her obsessive compulsive complaints. The third case showed a delayed sleep phase syndrome, which improved by educational support. The fourth case revealed a secondary organic hypersomnia for which modafinil treatment was started.

Preliminary findings suggest that procrastination emerges due to dysfunctional emotion regulation efforts to regulate aversive emotions. This studys objective was to clarify whether the enhancement of general adaptive emotion regulation skills reduces subsequent procrastination. For the purpose of this study, data from a two-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT) with (N = 148) university students, comprising an active intervention (IG) and a passive wait-list control (WLC) group, was collected. Participants of the intervention group were provided with an online emotion regulation training over a period of 9 weeks. The results showed that the enhancement of general emotion regulation skills significantly reduced subsequent procrastination behavior within the IG as compared to the untreated WLC. Moreover, subsequent mediation analyses revealed that the reduction of procrastination was significantly mediated by the increase in general ER skills. The present results suggest that trainings which enhance general ER skills are an appropriate measure to reduce procrastination behavior among university students.

The objective of this study was to compare NAVA and pressure support ventilation (PSV) in the early phase of weaning from mechanical ventilation. METHODS A multicentre randomized controlled trial of 128 intubated adults recovering from acute respiratory failure was conducted in 11 intensive care units. Patients were randomly assigned to NAVA or PSV. The primary outcome was the probability of remaining in a partial ventilatory mode (either NAVA or PSV) throughout the first 48 h without any return to assist-control ventilation. Secondary outcomes included asynchrony index, ventilator-free days and mortality. RESULTS In the NAVA and PSV groups respectively, the proportion of patients remaining in partial ventilatory mode throughout the first 48 h was 67.2 vs. 63.3 % (P = 0.66), the asynchrony index was 14.7 vs. 26.7 % (P < 0.001), the ventilator-free days at day 7 were 1.0 day [1.0-4.0] vs. 0.0 days [0.0-1.0] (P < 0.01), the ventilator-free days at day 28 were 21 days [4-25] vs. 17 days [0-23] (P = 0.12), the day-28 mortality rate was 15.0 vs. 22.7 % (P = 0.21) and the rate of use of post-extubation noninvasive mechanical ventilation was 43.5 vs. 66.6 % (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS NAVA is safe and feasible over a prolonged period of time but does not increase the probability of remaining in a partial ventilatory mode. However, NAVA decreases patient-ventilator asynchrony and is associated with less frequent application of post-extubation noninvasive mechanical ventilation.

In the current study, we investigated whether pSn is a sialic acid binding protein and, whether so, whether this property is important for its function as a PRRSV receptor. Using untreated and neuraminidase-treated sheep erythrocytes, we showed that pSn binds sialic acid. Furthermore, pSn-specific monoclonal antibody 41D3, which blocks PRRSV infection, inhibited this interaction. PRRSV attachment to and infection of porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM) were both shown to be dependent on the presence of sialic acid on the virus: neuraminidase treatment of virus but not of PAM blocked infection and reduced attachment. Enzymatic removal of all N-linked glycans on the virus with N-glycosidase F reduced PRRSV infection, while exclusive removal of nonsialylated N-linked glycans of the high-mannose type with endoglycosidase H had no significant effect. Free sialyllactose and sialic acid containing (neo)glycoproteins reduced infection, while lactose and (neo)glycoproteins devoid of sialic acids had no significant effect. Studies with linkage-specific neuraminidases and lectins indicated that alpha2-3- and alpha2-6-linked sialic acids on the virion are important for PRRSV infection of PAM. From these results, we conclude that pSn is a sialic acid binding lectin and that interactions between sialic acid on the PRRS virion and pSn are essential for PRRSV infection of PAM.","output":"Porcine arterivirus infection of alveolar macrophages is mediated by sialic acid on the virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The global outbreak of COVID-19 has become an international public health crisis. Specific antiviral treatments for COVID-19 are not yet available, and prevention is of particular importance to fight the virus. This study tends to explore and compare the roles of cognitive and affective factors in predicting preventive behavior adoption during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. METHODS: An online survey using a quota sampling method to collect responses from 3000 Chinese adults was conducted from March 2, 2020 to March 23, 2020. Questions included sociodemographic features, coronavirus knowledge, negative emotion, risk perception, and behavioral responses. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine the predictors of behavioral responses toward COVID-19. RESULTS: On average, respondents had low levels of knowledge about COVID-19 (the overall correct response rate was 7.5%). Most respondents reported moderate to strong negative emotions towards the virus (3.47 out of 5). The average reported perceived chance of infection was 23.89%. For behavioral responses, respondents reported low frequencies of going out for activities (1.98 out of 4) and high frequencies of taking preventive measures (3.22 out of 4). Behavioral responses toward COVID-19 were found to be determined by cognitive and affective variables. Knowledge was negatively related to frequency of going out for activities (? = - 0.11, p < .001). Negative emotion (? = 0.34, p < .001), and risk perception (? = 0.05, p = .007) were positively associated with going out for activities. The explanatory power of affective variables (&#916;R2 = 12.1%) was greater than cognitive variables (&#916;R2 = 1.0%). For preventive behaviors, knowledge was positively associated with preventive behaviors (? = 0.22, p < .001). Negative emotion (? = - 0.28, p < .001) and risk perception (? = - 0.05, p = .002) were all negatively associated with preventive measures. Affective variables still showed stronger explanatory power (&#916;R2 = 8%) than cognitive variables (&#916;R2 = 4.4%) in predicting preventive behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: After the rising period of the COVID-19 outbreak in mainland China, cognitive and affective variables still played important roles in predicting behavioral responses. Compared with cognitive factors, affective factors demonstrated stronger explanatory power in predicting behavioral responses toward COVID-19.

As a result, this study aims to assess office building performance adaptability by investigating the impact of four different technologies, including occupancy-based lighting, smart plugs (occupancy-based plug load), demand-controlled ventilation (DCV), occupancy-based thermostat, and their cumulative effect in office buildings in six different Canadian climates. A three-story office building is simulated in EnergyPlus version 9.3.0 under five occupancy scenarios, including 0% occupancy, 100% occupancy, 50% uniformly distributed occupancy across the floor, 50% consolidated occupancy scenario where occupants work in core zones, and 50% consolidated occupancy scenario where occupants work in perimeter zones. The results are compared using energy use intensity (EUI), energy use intensity per occupant (EUP), and the corresponding greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. A total of 180 simulations demonstrate the occupancy-adaptive technologies are generally most beneficial for low occupancy scenarios and milder climates. The results also show the cumulative impact of all these technologies on the potential energy savings is significant in the climates under consideration. Overall, the results show office buildings can improve their performance adaptability during partial occupancy by implementing the studied technologies. Aside from filling in the current knowledge gap in the literature on partial occupancy, the for the first time results of this study systemically demonstrate how each technology performs under different partial occupancy scenarios and how they perform together at each climate.","output":"A comprehensive simulation-based assessment of office building performance adaptability to teleworking scenarios in different Canadian climate zones"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects cells at mucosal surfaces.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SUBJECTS AND SETTINGS: Random sample of primary care physicians (PCPs) in California. MEASURES: PCP practices for discussion and referral for LCS and ratings of LCS barriers. ANALYSIS: We performed exploratory factor analysis to identify four barrier constructs: (1) Physician Visit-Level Barriers to screening referral; (2) Physician System and Evidence Barriers; (3) Patient Cost Barrier; and (4) Other Patient Barriers. We then performed multivariable logistic regression adjusted for physician and practice characteristics to assess the association between the physician-reported barriers and whether PCPs discussed or referred for LCS. RESULTS: 368 physicians responded (response rate 42%). Most worked in large metropolitan areas (80%) and large health systems (59%). After adjusting for physician and practice characteristics, we found that physician-reporting of System and Evidence Barriers was associated with lower odds of discussion or referral for LDCT (aOR .18, 95% CI 0.09-0.37), while physician-reported Visit-Level Barriers were associated with increased odds discussion or referral (aOR 2.65, 95% CI 1.30-5.04).

Due to their novelty, pharmacokinetic DOAC drug-drug interactions (DDIs) that result in clinical adverse events have not been well-documented. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to systematically review reported pharmacokinetic DDIs resulting in clinical adverse events through documented observational evidence to better inform clinicians in clinical practice. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review of EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Ovid HealthStar was conducted through March 10th, 2020. Two independent reviewers screened and extracted data from eligible articles according to pre-established inclusion and exclusion criteria. Articles reporting bleeding or thrombotic outcomes in non-controlled (observational) settings resulting from suggested pharmacokinetic DOAC DDIs were included. RESULTS: A total of 5567 citations were reviewed, of which 24 were included following data extraction. The majority were case reports (n = 21) documenting a single adverse event resulting from a suspected DOAC DDI, while the remaining papers were a case series (n = 1) and cohort studies (n = 2). The most commonly reported interacting drugs were amiodarone and ritonavir (bleeding), and phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine (thrombosis). Bleeding events more often resulted from a combined mechanism (P-glycoprotein AND CYP3A4 inhibition), whereas thrombotic events resulted from either combined OR single P-glycoprotein/CYP3A4 induction. CONCLUSION: Current literature evaluating the real-world risk of DOAC DDIs is limited to few case reports and retrospective observational analyses.

While vaccination has started and several clinical trials for a number of vaccines are currently underway, there is a pressing need for a cure for those already infected with the virus. Of particular interest in the design of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics is the human protein angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) to which this virus adheres before entry into the host cell. The SARS-CoV-2 virion binds to cell-surface bound ACE2 via interactions of the spike protein (s-protein) on the viral surface with ACE2. In this paper, we use all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and binding enthalpy calculations to determine the effect that a bound ACE2 active site inhibitor (MLN-4760) would have on the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 s-protein with ACE2. Our analysis indicates that the binding enthalpy could be reduced for s-protein adherence to the active site inhibitor-bound ACE2 protein by as much as 1.48-fold as an upper limit. This weakening of binding strength was observed to be due to the destabilization of the interactions between ACE2 residues Glu-35, Glu-37, Tyr-83, Lys-353, and Arg-393 and the SARS-CoV-2 s-protein receptor binding domain (RBD). The conformational changes were shown to lead to weakening of ACE2 interactions with SARS-CoV-2 s-protein, therefore reducing s-protein binding strength. Further, we observed increased conformational lability of the N-terminal helix and a conformational shift of a significant portion of the ACE2 motifs involved in s-protein binding, which may affect the kinetics of the s-protein binding when the small molecule inhibitor is bound to the ACE2 active site. These observations suggest potential new ways for interfering with the SARS-CoV-2 adhesion by modulating ACE2 conformation through distal active site inhibitor binding.","output":"An Active Site Inhibitor Induces Conformational Penalties for ACE2 Recognition by the Spike Protein of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Here we report the identification of human CD66b-CD64dimCD115- neutrophil-committed progenitor cells (NCPs) within the SSCloCD45dimCD34+ and CD34dim/- subsets in the bone marrow.

METHODS: Children diagnosed with MIS-C and followed in Pediatric Clinic between November 2020 and January 2021, were included in study. Data about patients' demographic characteristics, clinical and laboratory findings, treatment and outcomes were collected from medical records. RESULTS: The median age of 20 children with MIS-C was 80.5 months, 11 of them were male. The most common symptoms at admission were fever (100%), abdominal pain (70%), myalgia (50%), and rash (50%). Lymphopenia, elevated inflammatory markers and cardiac enzymes were their main laboratory findings. Cardiac involvement (90%) consisted of myopericarditis, valvulitis, left ventricular dysfunction, and coronary arteritis. Symptoms mimicking acute appendicitis and ileus were due to gastrointestinal involvement (50%). Macular rash on the trunk, erythema on upper eyelids were striking. Empiric antibiotics and intravenous immunoglobulin were used in all patients, glucocorticoids (90%), anti-thrombotic (65%) and vasoactive (45%) agents were used according to severity of disease.

We estimated SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody prevalence (seroprevalence) among blood donors in metropolitan Melbourne following a COVID-19 outbreak in the city between June and September 2020. The aim was to determine the extent of infection spread and whether seroprevalence varied demographically in proportion to reported cases of infection. The design involved stratified sampling of residual specimens from blood donors (aged 20-69 years) in three postcode groups defined by low (<3 cases/1,000 population), medium (3-7 cases/1,000 population) and high (>7 cases/1,000 population) COVID-19 incidence based on case notification data. All specimens were tested using the Wantai SARS-CoV-2 total antibody assay. Seroprevalence was estimated with adjustment for test sensitivity and specificity for the Melbourne metropolitan blood donor and residential populations, using multilevel regression and poststratification. Overall, 4,799 specimens were collected between 23 November and 17 December 2020. Seroprevalence for blood donors was 0.87% (90% credible interval: 0.25-1.49%). The highest estimates, of 1.13% (0.25-2.15%) and 1.11% (0.28-1.95%), respectively, were observed among donors living in the lowest socioeconomic areas (Quintiles 1 and 2) and lowest at 0.69% (0.14-1.39%) among donors living in the highest socioeconomic areas (Quintile 5). When extrapolated to the Melbourne residential population, overall seroprevalence was 0.90% (0.26-1.51%), with estimates by demography groups similar to those for the blood donors. The results suggest a lack of extensive community transmission and good COVID-19 case ascertainment based on routine testing during Victorias second epidemic wave. Residual blood donor samples provide a practical epidemiological tool for estimating seroprevalence and information on population patterns of infection, against which the effectiveness of ongoing responses to the pandemic can be assessed.","output":"Serological Testing of Blood Donors to Characterise the Impact of Covid-19 in Melbourne, Australia, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"TOPIC: Chest Infections TYPE: Original Investigations PURPOSE: Many patients diagnosed with COVID-19 develop a post-viral syndrome commonly known as Long COVID-19. Long COVID is described as when a patient experiences persistent symptoms for more than 12 weeks after their initial infection. Recent studies have shown that patients may experience long covid for as many as 6 months after initial infection. We conducted a follow up study on patients diagnosed with COVID-19 one year ago at one of the worst affected tertiary hospitals in the state of New Jersey. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study consisting of patients with a confirmed positive COVID-19 test by PCR in the months of March and April of 2020 in the St. Josephs University Hospital network. Individuals who were either admitted to the hospital or tested positive in the outpatient setting with Sars- CoV2 were included in the study. Patients under 18 years of age or those with cognitive impairment or inability to complete the survey were excluded. Informed consent was taken over the telephone. The participants completed a comprehensive questionnaire including sociodemographic information and a review of systems to evaluate for persistent symptoms they have experienced over the past year directly due to COVID-19. All patient identifying information was de-identified in compliance with HIPAA rules and regulations. RESULTS: There were 91 inpatients ( 91/173 [52.6%]) and 82 outpatients (82/173 [47.4%]) with a mean age of 51.5. The most common ethnicities were Hispanic (80/173 [46.24%]) African American (48/173 [27.74%]), Caucasian (32/173 [18.49%]) and the most common comorbidities were hypertension (68/173 [39.5%]), obesity (45/173 [26.9%]) and diabetes (33/173 [19.1%]). There were 91 inpatients ( 91/173 [52.6%]) and 82 outpatients (82/173 [47.4%]), of which 85 were male (85/173 [49.42%]). Overall 83 patients (47.9%) still experienced at least one persistent symptom after initial infection. The most commonly reported symptoms were shortness of breath (44/173 [25.4%]), fatigue (43/173 [21%]), anxiety (36/173 [20.8%]), difficulty focusing/brain fog (32/173 [18.5%]), body aches (32/173 [18.5%]), headaches (29/173 [16.8%]), memory loss (25/173 [14.5%]), cough (23/173 [13.3%]), depression (22/173 [12.7%]), chest pain (19/173 [11%]), palpitations (15/173 [8.7%]), lightheadedness (15/173 [8.7%]), runny nose (12/173 [6.9%]) and loss of taste (11/173 [6.4%]). CONCLUSIONS: In our patient population nearly half of all patients (47.9%) still experienced at least one symptom 12 months after their initial infection. In both patient populations the most common persistent symptoms were shortness of breath, fatigue, anxiety and difficulty focusing/brain fog. The risk factors and pathophysiology of long covid remain unknown, highlighting the importance of further research into the topics. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Nearly half of our patient population still experienced at least one symptom from their COVID-19 infection after one year. This further suggests that infection with COVID-19 may carry a risk of developing long term and possibly permanent sequelae from the virus. As more patients continue to be infected with COVID-19 and subsequently develop long covid, a public health crisis may be looming in the future. This highlights the need for continued public education on COVID-19 as well as the critical importance of widespread vaccination across the world to end the pandemic.

We developed a machine learning algorithm, based on a deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), for continuous management of oxygen flow rate for critical ill patients under intensive care, which can identify the optimal personalized oxygen flow rate with strong potentials to reduce mortality rate relative to the current clinical practice. Basically, we modeled the oxygen flow trajectory of COVID-19 patients and their health outcomes as a Markov decision process. Based on individual patient characteristics and health status, a reinforcement learning based oxygen control policy is learned and real-time recommends the oxygen flow rate to reduce the mortality rate. We assessed the performance of proposed methods through cross validation by using a retrospective cohort of 1,372 critically ill patients with COVID-19 from New York University Langone Health ambulatory care with electronic health records from April 2020 to January 2021. The mean mortality rate under the RL algorithm is lower than standard of care by 2.57% (95% CI: 2.08- 3.06) reduction (P<0.001) from 7.94% under the standard of care to 5.37 % under our algorithm and the averaged recommended oxygen flow rate is 1.28 L/min (95% CI: 1.14-1.42) lower than the rate actually delivered to patients. Thus, the RL algorithm could potentially lead to better intensive care treatment that can reduce mortality rate, while saving the oxygen scarce resources.

A survey of American Level 1 trauma centers was performed to elucidate the extent to which these products are currently employed. METHODS A survey was written that probed into the current use of blood products in trauma resuscitation with specific emphasis on LTOWB and group A plasma. A list of adult civilian Level 1 trauma centers in the continental USA was obtained from two public surgery and trauma focused websites. An email was then sent to each center's transfusion service medical director or laboratory manager providing them with a link to the online survey. RESULTS Responses were received from 103/187 (55%) adult civilian Level 1 trauma centers. For the resuscitation of trauma patients, group A plasma was used at 94/103 (91%) centers, while LTOWB was used at 43/103 (42%) centers. There were 39/103 (38%) centers that used both products. At 62/94 (66%) of the centers that used group A plasma, there was no limit on the number of units that could be administered, while an unlimited number of LTOWB units could be used at 5/43 (12%) of the centers that used LTOWB.

METHOD: We retrospectively evaluated clinical and X-ray features in all patients referred to the emergency department for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 1st and March 13th. A single radiologist with more than 15 years of experience in chest-imaging evaluated the presence and extent of alveolar opacities, reticulations, and/or pleural effusion. The percentage of lung involvement (range <25 % to 75-100 %) was also calculated. We stratified patients in groups according to the time interval between symptoms onset and X-ray imaging (&#8804; 5 and > 5 days) and according to age (&#8804; 50 and > 50 years old). RESULTS: A total of 518 patients were enrolled. Overall 314 patients had negative and 204 had positive RT-PCR results. Lung lesions in patients with SARS-Cov2 pneumonia primarily manifested as alveolar and interstitial opacities and were mainly bilateral (60.8 %). Lung abnormalities were more frequent and more severe by symptom duration and by increasing age. The sensitivity and specificity of chest X-ray at admission in the overall cohort were 57 % (95 % CIa?=a?47-67) and 89 % (83-94), respectively. Sensitivity was higher for patients with symptom onset > 5 days compared to &#8804; 5 days (76 % [62-87] vs 37 % [24-52]) and in patients > 50 years old compared to &#8804; 50 years (59 % [48-69] vs 47 % [23-72]), at the expense of a slightly lower specificity (68 % [45-86] and 82 % [73-89], respectively).

The generation of these syncytia results from activation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at the cell plasma membrane level. On the basis of these observations, we performed two high-content microscopy-based screenings with more than 3,000 approved drugs to search for inhibitors of spike-driven syncytia. We converged on the identification of 83 drugs that inhibited spike-mediated cell fusion, several of which belonged to defined pharmacological classes. We focused our attention on effective drugs that also protected against virus replication and associated cytopathicity. One of the most effective molecules was the antihelminthic drug niclosamide, which markedly blunted calcium oscillations and membrane conductance in spike-expressing cells by suppressing the activity of TMEM16F (also known as anoctamin 6), a calcium-activated ion channel and scramblase that is responsible for exposure of phosphatidylserine on the cell surface.

The aim of this paper is to share with all the vascular community the protocol developed by the USL (Unit Sanitaria Locale) Toscana Centro for the reorganization of the Vascular Surgery Unit during the COVID-19 emergency, hoping to help other institutions to face the emergency during the hard weeks coming. METHODS: The USL Toscana Centro is a public Italian health care institution including four districts (Empoli, Florence, Pistoia, Prato) with 13 different hospitals, serving more than 1,500,000 people in a 5000 km2 area. The USL adopted a protocol of reorganization of the Vascular Surgery Unit during the first difficult weeks of the epidemic, consisting in the creation of a Vascular Hub for urgent cases, with a profound reorganization of activities, wards, surgical operators, operating blocks, and intensive care unit (ICU) beds. RESULTS: All 13 hospitals are now COVID-19 as the first days of April passed. The San Giovanni di Dio Hospital (Florence) has more than 80 COVID-19 patients in different settings (ICU, medical and surgical ward), which at the time of writing is almost one-third of the total hospital capacity (80/260 beds). It has been identified as the Surgical Hub for urgent vascular COVID-19 cases. Therefore, the elective surgical and office activities were reduced by 30% and 80%, respectively, and reserved to priority cases. A corner of the whole operating block, well separate from the remaining operating rooms, was rapidly converted into one operating room and six ICU beds dedicated to COVID patients. The COVID-19 surgical path now includes an emergency room for suspected COVID-19 patients directly connected to an elevator for the transfer of COVID patients in the COVID operating block and dedicated COVID-19 ward and ICU beds.

Methods Real-time PCR was used to detect the expression of breast cancer tissues and cells from patients admitted to our hospital and the expression of lncRNA FOXD2-AS1 in MCF-7/ADR in adriamycin- (ADR-) resistant breast cancer cells. After interfering with or overexpressing lncRNA FOXD2-AS1 in MCF-7/ADR cells, cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and migration were detected using CCK-8, flow cytometry, Transwell assay, and scratch test, respectively. The protein levels of PI3K, p-PI3K, AKT, and p-AKT in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway were detected by Western blot. Results lncRNA FOXD2-AS1 was upregulated in breast cancer tissues and cells and increased cell drug resistance to ADR. Downregulation of lncRNA FOXD2-AS1 inhibited invasion and migration of MCF-7/ADR cells, promoted apoptosis, increased chemosensitivity of MCF-7/ADR cells, and inhibited the activity of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in MCF-7/ADR cells. Conclusions lncRNA FOXD2-AS1 can promote the proliferation, invasion, migration, and drug resistance of breast cancer cells, inhibit apoptosis, and accelerate the development of breast cancer by positively regulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.","output":"Knockdown of lncRNA FOXD2-AS1 Inhibits Proliferation, Migration, and Drug Resistance of Breast Cancer Cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viroporins are oligomeric, pore forming, viral proteins that play critical roles in the life cycle of pathogenic viruses. Viroporins like HIV-1 Vpu, Alphavirus 6 K, Influenza M2, HCV p7, and Picornavirus 2B, form discrete aqueous passageways which mediate ion and small molecule transport in infected cells. The alterations in host membrane structures induced by viroporins is essential for key steps in the virus life cycle like entry, replication and egress. Any disruption in viroporin functionality severely compromises viral pathogenesis. The envelope (E) protein encoded by coronaviruses is a viroporin with ion channel activity and has been shown to be crucial for the assembly and pathophysiology of coronaviruses. We used a combination of virtual database screening, molecular docking, all-atom molecular dynamics simulation and MM-PBSA analysis to test four FDA approved drugs - Tretinoin, Mefenamic Acid, Ondansetron and Artemether - as potential inhibitors of ion channels formed by SARS-CoV-2 E protein. Interaction and binding energy analysis showed that electrostatic interactions and polar solvation energy were the major driving forces for binding of the drugs, with Tretinoin being the most promising inhibitor. Tretinoin bound within the lumen of the channel formed by E protein, which is lined by hydrophobic residues like Phe, Val and Ala, indicating its potential for blocking the channel and inhibiting the viroporin functionality of E. In control simulations, tretinoin demonstrated a lower binding energy with a known target as compared to SARS-CoV-2 E protein. This work thus highlights the possibility of exploring Tretinoin as a potential SARS-CoV-2 E protein ion channel blocker and virus assembly inhibitor, which could be an important therapeutic strategy in the treatment for coronaviruses.","output":"In silico identification of Tretinoin as a SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) protein ion channel inhibitor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] To address the challenge of the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, photosensitized electrospun nanofibrous membranes were fabricated to effectively capture and inactivate coronavirus aerosols. With an ultrafine fiber diameter (200 nm) and a small pore size (1.5 m), optimized membranes caught 99.2% of the aerosols of the murine hepatitis virus A59 (MHV-A59), a coronavirus surrogate for SARS-CoV-2. In addition, rose bengal was used as the photosensitizer for membranes because of its excellent reactivity in generating virucidal singlet oxygen, and the membranes rapidly inactivated 97.1% of MHV-A59 in virus-laden droplets only after 15 min irradiation of simulated reading light. Singlet oxygen damaged the virus genome and impaired virus binding to host cells, which elucidated the mechanism of disinfection at a molecular level. Membrane robustness was also evaluated, and in general, the performance of virus filtration and disinfection was maintained in artificial saliva and for long-term use. Only sunlight exposure photobleached membranes, reduced singlet oxygen production, and compromised the performance of virus disinfection. In summary, photosensitized electrospun nanofibrous membranes have been developed to capture and kill airborne environmental pathogens under ambient conditions, and they hold promise for broad applications as personal protective equipment and indoor air filters.","output":"Photosensitized Electrospun Nanofibrous Filters for Capturing and Killing Airborne Coronaviruses under Visible Light Irradiation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein has been highly studied as a key catalytic regulator of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), involved in fluid homeostasis and blood pressure modulation. In addition to its important physiological role as a broadly-expressed membrane-bound protein, ACE2 serves as a cell-surface receptor for some viruses - most notably, coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Differing levels of ACE2 expression may impact viral susceptibility and subsequent changes to expression may be a pathogenic mechanism of disease risk and manifestation. Therefore, an improved understanding of how ACE2 expression is regulated at the genomic and transcriptional level may help us understand not only how the effects of pre-existing conditions (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) may manifest with increased COVID-19 incidence, but also the mechanisms that regulate ACE2 levels following viral infection. Here, we initially perform bioinformatic analyses of several datasets to generate hypotheses about ACE2 gene-regulatory mechanisms in the context of immune signaling and chronic oxidative stress. We then identify putative non-coding regulatory elements within ACE2 intronic regions as potential determinants of ACE2 expression activity. We perform functional validation of our computational predictions in vitro via targeted CRISPR-Cas9 deletions of the identified ACE2 cis-regulatory elements in the context of both immunological stimulation and oxidative stress conditions. We demonstrate that intronic ACE2 regulatory elements are responsive to both immune signaling and oxidative-stress pathways, and this contributes to our understanding of how expression of this gene may be modulated at both baseline and during immune challenge. Our work supports the further pursuit of these putative mechanisms in our understanding, prevention, and treatment of infection and disease caused by ACE2-utilizing viruses such as SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and future emerging SARS-related viruses. Author Summary The recent emergence of the virus SARS-CoV-2 which has caused the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted scientists to intensively study how the virus enters human host cells. This work has revealed a key protein, ACE2, that acts as a receptor permitting the virus to infect cells. Much research has focused on how the virus physically interacts with ACE2, yet little is known on how ACE2 is turned on or off in human cells at the level of the DNA molecule. Understanding this level of regulation may offer additional ways to prevent or lower viral entry into human hosts. Here, we have examined the control of the ACE2 gene, the DNA sequence that instructs ACE2 protein receptor formation, and we have done so in the context of immune stimulation. We have indeed identified a number of DNA on/off switches for ACE2 that appear responsive to immuno-logical and oxidative stress. These switches may fine-tune how ACE2 is turned on or off before, during, and/or after infection by SARS-CoV-2 or other related coronaviruses. Our studies help pave the way for additional functional studies on these switches, and their potential therapeutic targeting in the future.","output":"Intronic regulation of SARS-CoV-2 receptor (ACE2) expression mediated by immune signaling and oxidative stress pathways"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The exodus from Venezuela increased in intensity until the Covid-19 pandemic. Arrivals in Europe were significantly lower than in Latin America, but also grew and displayed a shift in composition, including a decreasing percentage of people with European origins. This study investigates migration from Venezuela to Spain, Italy, and Hungary, in the 21st century. It begins with a detailed theoretical framework and then examines the particular migratory flows. The analysis covers the major features of these migration moves, including antecedents, reasons and motivations, size, geographical distribution, and indicators related to integration. Mixed methods are used, both qualitative and quantitative. Findings show that current emigration from Venezuela to Spain, Italy, and Hungary can be considered as return migration because original flows existed in the 19th and 20th centuries, and current counterflows not only incorporate descendants of immigrants, but are also based on the existing migratory systems and networks between these countries. ? 2021 Editora PUC-Minas.

The principles of free drug theory have been forged and applied across drug development but are not currently being routinely applied for SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drugs. Consideration of protein binding is of critical importance to candidate selection but requires correct interpretation, in a drug-specific manner, to avoid either underinterpretation or overinterpretation of its consequences.

The proposed method requires less computational power and uses ensemble learning to increase the models' overall predictive performance. In the simulation, it was found that each model performs better in some areas than the other. The proposed scheme uses ensemble learning to take advantage of such an occurrence and achieved an accuracy of 86.2% and an AUC score of 89.8% on the COVIDCT-Dataset.

A self-made questionnaire was made and entered into the questionnaire star. In August 2020, through the snowball sampling method, the nursing branch of Henan Society of Traditional Chinese Medicine was used to calculate the sample size that would be further used for this study. RESULTS: Of the 370 medical institutions in 17 district-level cities in our province, 47 have set up TCM nursing clinics, accounting for 12.70%. From the perspective of regional distribution, there are 14 TCM nursing clinics in Zhengzhou, 8 in Luoyang, 6 in Kaifeng, 4 in Shangqiu, 3 in Jiyuan, and 3 in Zhoukou. The number of TCM nursing clinics in Jiaozuo City, Xinxiang City, Anyang City, Hebi City, Puyang City, Zhumadian City, and Nanyang City is relatively small, and there are no TCM nursing clinics in Pingdingshan City, Sanmenxia City, and Xinyang City. Among the 47 medical institutions offering TCM nursing clinics, there are 38 TCM hospitals, 5 integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine hospitals, 3 Western medicine hospitals, and 1 ethnic medicine hospital. Among them, 31 medical institutions are tertiary care hospitals and 16 are secondary care hospitals. First-class and undetermined medical institutions do not set up TCM nursing clinics. (1) Management mode: among the 47 medical institutions, 26 medical institutions have separate nursing units, which are managed by the nursing department head nurse, and 13 medical institutions are managed by the director head nurse of the department. (2) Performance management: of the 47 medical institutions that set up TCM nursing clinics, 18 adopted independent accounting, 21 adopted secondary distribution of departmental performance, and 7 adopted average awards and other methods. (3) The process of seeing a doctor: there are three kinds of medical procedures: 124 medical institutions are treated by TCM nursing outpatients by hanging the consultation number of doctors in various departments. 210 medical institutions are treated by traditional Chinese medicine nursing outpatient nurses by hanging the consultation number of traditional Chinese medicine nursing outpatient doctors. Thirty-five medical institutions are retreated by hanging the number of nurses in the nursing clinic of TCM. (4) Allocation of human resources: in the survey of the total number of nurses in TCM nursing clinics in 74 medical institutions, the largest number of nurses was 46 in one of the TCM nursing clinics. In terms of personnel qualification requirements, 43 medical institutions put forward requirements for nurses' qualifications. Among them, 39 medical institutions have requirements for nurses' professional titles, 38 medical institutions have requirements for nurses working years, and 22 medical institutions have more specific requirements for nurses. For example, nurses are required to be the backbone of TCM nursing that includes specialist nurses, nurses who graduated from TCM colleges, and nurses who have obtained hospital assessment and certification. In terms of working years, 87.96% of medical institutions require nursing service of more than 5 years. The average number of TCM nursing technical projects offered by 47 medical institutions is about 10, a maximum of 34 and a minimum of 1. The commonly carried out TCM nursing techniques include scraping, auricular point pressing, cupping, moxibustion, and ear tip bloodletting, and among all of them, scraping technology is most important and 40 medical institutions offer this technology, followed by auricular point pressing technique, cupping, and moxibustion.

Compared to classical pathway enrichment analysis methods, de novo pathway enrichment is not limited to predefined lists of pathways from (curated) databases and thus particularly suited for discovering novel disease mechanisms. While several tools have been proposed for pathway enrichment, the integration of de novo pathway enrichment in end-to-end OMICS analysis workflows in the R programming language is currently limited to a single tool. To close this gap, we have implemented an R package KeyPathwayMineR (KPM-R). The package extends the features and usability of existing versions of KeyPathwayMiner by leveraging the power, flexibility and versatility of R and by providing various novel functionalities for performing data preparation, visualization, and comparison. In addition, thanks to its interoperability with a plethora of existing R packages in e.g., Bioconductor, CRAN, and GitHub, KPM-R allows carrying out the initial preparation of the datasets and to meaningfully interpret the extracted subnetworks. To demonstrate the packages potential, KPM-R was applied to bulk RNA-Seq data of nasopharyngeal swabs from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, and on single cell RNA-Seq data of aging mice tissue from the Tabula Muris Senis atlas.","output":"KeyPathwayMineR: De Novo Pathway Enrichment in the R Ecosystem"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 patients have been reported to have digestive symptoms with poor outcome. Ivermectin, an antiparasitic drug, has been used in COVID-19 patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether ivermectin has effects on gastrointestinal complications and ventilator-free days in ventilated patients with COVID-19. METHODS: COVID-19 patients who were mechanically ventilated in the ICU were included in this study. The ventilated patients who received ivermectin within 3 days after admission were assigned to the Ivermectin group, and the others were assigned to the Control group. Patients in the Ivermectin group received ivermectin 200 g/kg via nasal tube. The incidence of gastrointestinal complications and ventilator-free days within 4 weeks from admission were evaluated as clinical outcomes using a propensity score with the inverse probability weighting method. RESULTS: We included 88 patients in this study, of whom 39 patients were classified into the Ivermectin group, and 49 patients were classified into the Control group. The hazard ratio for gastrointestinal complications in the Ivermectin group as compared with the Control group was 0.221 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.057 to 0.855; p = 0.029) in a Cox proportional-hazard regression model. The odds ratio for ventilator-free days as compared with the Control group was 1.920 (95% CI, 1.076 to 3.425; p = 0.027) in a proportional odds logistic regression model. CONCLUSIONS: Ivermectin improved gastrointestinal complications and the number of ventilator-free days in severe COVID-19 patients undergoing mechanical ventilation.

The aim of this cross-sectional study was to estimate the prevalence and to determine some associated factors of ED among a sample of adult Egyptian male patients with T2DM. METHODS This cross-sectional study included 150 adult male patients with T2DM (aged 40-60 years) who attended the outpatient clinic of Diabetes in Alexandria Main University hospital. They were evaluated for the presence of ED which was assessed by the validated Arabic-translated five-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5) questionnaire. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), HbA1c, total serum cholesterol, HDL-C, total serum testosterone (TT) and urinary albumin creatinine ratio (uACR) were measured for all study subjects. RESULTS The prevalence of ED was 80% among the studied sample. Significant negative correlation was found between IIEF-5 score and age, duration of diabetes, FBG and urinary ACR; while there was a significant positive correlation between IIEF-5 score and serum total testosterone. On performing multiple linear regression analysis for the parameters affecting IIEF-5 questionnaire score, TT, urinary ACR, age and FBG were the independent predictors of ED.

In addition, it serves as a benchmark developed by the Australian Palliative Care Outcome Collaboration (PCOC) and is used nationwide for comparisons between services. In Germany, the concept is not used consistently due to various translations. Furthermore, there is no nationwide systematic approach to routinely assess clinical outcomes in palliative care. The study aims to develop a German version of the palliative care phase definitions by adapting them culturally, and to examine the inter-rater reliability of the adjusted definitions with healthcare professionals. METHODS: Mixed-methods approach: Cognitive interview study using think aloud and verbal probing techniques and a consecutive multi-center cross-sectional study with two clinicians independently assigning the phase definitions. Interviewees/participants were selected through convenience and purposive sampling in specialist palliative care inpatient units, advisory and community services and in three specialist palliative care units with doctors, nursing staff and allied health professionals. RESULTS: Fifteen interviews were conducted. Identified difficulties were: Some translated terms were 1) not self-explanatory (e.g. family/carer or care plan) and (2) too limited to the medical dimension neglecting the holistic approach of palliative care. (3) Problems of comprehension regarding the concept in general occurred, e.g. in differentiating between the unstable and deteriorating phase. Inter-rater reliability was moderate (kappa = 0.44; 95% CI = 0.39C0.52). The assignment of the phase deteriorating has caused the most difficulties. CONCLUSION: Overall, the adapted palliative care phases are suitable to use in the German specialist palliative care setting. However, the concept of the phases is not self-explanatory. To implement it nationwide for outcome measurement/benchmarking, it requires further education, on-the-job training and experience as well as the involvement of healthcare professionals in implementation process. For the use of international concepts in different healthcare systems, a deeper discussion and cultural adaptation is necessary besides the formal translation.

While the overall match winner and result is interesting, it conveys little information about the underlying scoring trends throughout the match. Modeling approaches that accommodate a finer granularity of the score difference throughout the match is needed to evaluate in-game strategies, discuss scoring streaks, teams strengths, and other aspects of the game. We propose a latent Gaussian process to model the score difference between two teams and introduce the Trend Direction Index as an easily interpretable probabilistic measure of the current trend in the match as well as a measure of post-game trend evaluation. In addition we propose the Excitement Trend Index - the expected number of monotonicity changes in the running score difference - as a measure of overall game excitement. Our proposed methodology is applied to all 1143 matches from the 2019-2020 National Basketball Association (NBA) season.

MATERIAL AND METHODS A prospective cohort study of 60 women of reproductive age was conducted. The main group consisted of 32 patients suffering from the symptomatic course of uterine fibroids who received treatment with HIFU ablation of uterine fibroids. The control group consisted of 28 healthy fertile women examined voluntarily. The endometrium obtained with pipelle biopsy on days 20-22 of the cycle was examined by scanning electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry before and three months after the treatment. The results were processed by the method of variation statistics using the SPSS 22.0. RESULTS The focused ultrasound rays passing through the endometrium did not cause any change in the maturation rate or the state of intercellular contacts. At the same time, a significant increase in the frequency of asynchronous maturation of pinopodia was found to be 14.28% before HIFU versus 50.00% after HIFU; p = .021 and the number of heteromorphic secretory cells 5.88% before HIFU versus 53.33% after HIFU; p = .002 in implantation endometrium. A significant decrease in the stromal expression of CD95+bright in the endometrium to the level comparable with control values was observed after HIFU (from 70.22  9.77 c/s to 48.81  5.47 c/s; p < .001; the control level - 47.80  2.13 c/s).

Outcomes from infection with the Omicron remain uncertain. We evaluate whether clinical outcomes and viral loads differ between Delta and Omicron infections during the period when both variants were co-circulating. Methods Remnant clinical specimens from patients that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after standard of care testing between the last week of November and the end of December 2021were used for whole viral genome sequencing. Cycle threshold values (Ct) for viral RNA, the presence of infectious virus, and levels of respiratory IgG were measured, and clinical outcomes were obtained. Differences in each measure were compared between variants stratified by vaccination status. Results The Omicron variant displaced the Delta during the study period and constituted 95% of the circulating lineages by the end of December 2021. Patients with Omicron infections (N= 1121) were more likely to be vaccinated compared to patients with Delta (N = 910), but were less likely to be admitted, require ICU level care, or succumb to infection regardless of vaccination status. There was no significant difference in Ct values based on the lineage regardless of the vaccination status. Recovery of infectious virus in cell culture was reduced in boosted patients compared to fully vaccinated without a booster and unvaccinated when infected with the Delta lineage. However, in patients with Omicron infections, recovery of infectious virus was not affected by vaccination. Conclusions Omicron infections of vaccinated individuals are expected, yet admissions are less frequent. Admitted patients might develop severe disease comparable to Delta. Efforts for reducing the Omicron transmission are required as even though the admission risk is lower, the numbers of infections continue to be high.","output":"A Quick Displacement of the SARS-CoV-2 variant Delta with Omicron: Unprecedented Spike in COVID-19 Cases Associated with Fewer Admissions and Comparable Upper Respiratory Viral Loads"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Computed tomography (CT) images are currently being adopted as the visual evidence for COVID-19 diagnosis in clinical practice. Automated detection of COVID-19 infection from CT images based on deep models is important for faster examination. Unfortunately, collecting large-scale training data systematically in the early stage is difficult. To address this problem, we explore the feasibility of learning deep models for lung and COVID-19 infection segmentation from a single radiological image by resorting to synthesizing diverse radiological images. Specifically, we propose a novel conditional generative model, called CoSinGAN, which can be learned from a single radiological image with a given condition, i.e., the annotation mask of the lungs and infected regions. Our CoSinGAN is able to capture the conditional distribution of the single radiological image, and further synthesize high-resolution (512  512) and diverse radiological images that match the input conditions precisely. We evaluate the efficacy of CoSinGAN in learning lung and infection segmentation from very few radiological images by performing 5-fold cross validation on COVID-19-CT-Seg dataset (20 CT cases) and an independent testing on the MosMed dataset (50 CT cases). Both 2D U-Net and 3D U-Net, learned from four CT slices by using our CoSinGAN, have achieved notable infection segmentation performance, surpassing the COVID-19-CT-Seg-Benchmark, i.e., the counterparts trained on an average of 704 CT slices, by a large margin.

We focused on the practices of Malaysian NPOs in measuring and reporting the impact of their programmes. Through an analysis of their official websites, we sought evidence of how programme outcomes were reported and the extent to which NPOs engaged in dialogic communication using readily available multimedia tools. Finally, we devised and tested a programme evaluation instrument for use by Malaysian NPOs when planning for outcome-driven activities. The findings revealed that a significant number of Malaysian NPOs were operating without an official website. Those which had websites generally appeared to provide opportunities for dialogic communication with stakeholders and the wider community. A survey of NPOs suggested that they took dialogic communication seriously and responded to communication in a timely manner.

Recovery of screening volumes has varied across patient subgroups and facilities. Objective: We compared screening mammography volumes, as well as patient and facility characteristics, between pre-COVID-19 periods and early and later post-closure recovery periods. Methods: This retrospective study included screening mammograms performed in the same 2-month period (May 26-July 26) in 2019 (pre-COVID-19), 2020 (early recovery) and 2021 (late recovery, following targeted interventions to expand access), across multiple facility types (urban, suburban, community health center). Suburban sites had highest proportion of White patients as well as greatest scheduling flexibility and expanded appointments during initial reopening. Findings were compared across years. Results: For White patients, volumes decreased 36.6% from 6550 in 2019 to 4384 in 2020, and then increased 61.0% to 6579 in 2021; for patients with races other than White, volumes decreased 53.9% from 1321 in 2019 to 609 in 2020, and then increased 136.8% to 1442 in 2021. Percentage of mammograms in patients with races other than White was 16.9% in 2019, 12.2% in 2020, and 18.0% in 2021. Proportion performed at the urban center was 55.3% in 2019, 42.2% in 2020, and 45.9% in 2021; proportion at suburban sites was 34.0% in 2019, 49.2% in 2020, and 43.5% in 2021. Pre-COVID-19 volumes were reached by the sixth week after reopening for suburban sites, but not reached during early recovery for other sites. Proportion performed on Saturdays for suburban sites was similar across periods, while for the urban site was 7.6% in 2019, 5.3% in 2020, and 8.8% in 2021; the community health center did not offer Saturday appointments during recovery. Conclusion: After reopening, screening shifted from urban to suburban settings, with disproportionate screening decrease in patients with races other than White. Initial delayed access at facilities serving underserved populations exacerbated disparities. Interventions to expand access resulted in late recovery volumes exceeding prepandemic volumes in patients with races other than White.

METHODS: A systematic search of biomedical literature databases was performed from inception to October 29, 2021 to identify prospective and retrospective studies comparing the rates for functional independence (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2) and mortality at 90 days, symptomatic hemorrhage (sICH), and successful recanalization rates for MT and BT. Effect size was represented by odds ratio (OR) and analysis was done using random effects meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was assessed by I2 and Cochrane's Q statistics. RESULTS: Overall, 41 studies with 14885 patients were included. Mean age  standard deviation (years) was 6911 for BT and 7011 for MT. All studies used alteplase as thrombolytic agent. BT group had 29% higher odds for functional independence (OR=1.29, 95% CI 1.16-1.44, I2=42%), 25% higher odds of successful reperfusion (OR=1.25, 95% CI=1.08-1.44, I2=42%) and a 31% decrease in odds for mortality (OR=.69, 95% CI .60-.80, I2=47%) compared with MT. sICH prevalence was similar between groups (OR=1.10, 95% CI=.95-1.28, I2=0%). Six of the studies were randomized clinical trials (RCT) with intention-to-treat analysis done in patients presenting directly to MT-capable centers. When analysis was restricted to these six RCT (n= 2333), no differences were observed in functional independence (OR=1.08, 95% CI=.91-1.27, I2=0%), sICH (OR=1.37, 95% CI=.95-1.97, I2=0%) or mortality (OR=.93, 95% CI=.74-1.16, I2=0%) between groups. However, successful reperfusion favored BT group (OR=1.35, 95% CI=1.06-1.73, I2=0%). DISCUSSION: The odds for functional independence, successful reperfusion and mortality for the entire dataset favored the use of BT over MT (medium heterogeneity and low quality of the evidence). When analysis was restricted to RCT, both treatments had similar functional and safety outcomes (no heterogeneity), but recanalization rates favored BT group (no heterogeneity). Because these findings may differ in patients that present to non-MT-capable centers or with the use of other thrombolytic agents, further RCTs are needed.","output":"Mechanical Thrombectomy vs Bridging Therapy for Anterior Circulation Large Vessel Occlusion Stroke: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Astroviruses are recognized as a leading cause of gastroenteritis in humans and animals. They are also associated with extra-intestinal diseases, such as hepatitis in ducklings, nephritis in chickens, and encephalitis in cattle. In February 2017, a fatal infection of goslings characterized by visceral urate deposition was reported in the Shandong province, China. Our systematic investigation led to the isolation of an astrovirus, designated AAstV/Goose/CHN/2017/SD01, and similar disease was reproduced by experimental infection of healthy goslings, fulfilling Kochs postulates. The isolated astrovirus replicated well and resulted in 100% mortality of goose embryos. Complete genome sequence analysis revealed that the isolate was genetically distinct from known astroviruses and closely related to members of the avastrovirus genogroup II. Experimental infection showed that the isolate was highly pathogenic in goslings, causing clinical signs, growth repression and in many cases mortality. Histopathological examination indicated that lesions occurred mainly in the kidneys of infected birds. However, virus-specific genomic RNA was detected in all representative tissues, and virus shedding was detected up to 12 days after inoculation, suggesting that the isolate was able to spread systemically and replicate efficiently in vivo. Collectively, our study demonstrates, for the first time, the etiological role of a genetically distinct astrovirus in the fatal infection of goslings.","output":"Isolation and characterization of an astrovirus causing fatal visceral gout in domestic goslings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite extensive efforts to support teachers with the integration of information and communication technologies (ICT) into their classroom practice, current research reports that teachers face immense challenges when integrating ICT into their teaching. This issue has become even more relevant with the rapid spread of the COVID-19 virus, forcing schools around the world to close for an indefinite period of time and thus to offer remote digital learning solutions. Against this background, this study focused on examining the predictors of pre-service teachers prospective ICT use and investigated the heterogeneous results of previous research related to ICT use and gender. Following the will, skill, tool framework, the study examined relevant factors of pre-service teachers (N = 103) prospective ICT use for teaching and learning processes by means of multiple regression analyses. The analyses included pre-service teachers background characteristics, ICT profiles (attitudes and self-efficacy), digital competencies and use of digital tools in order to explore their role in future in-class use of ICT. They also show that there are no gender differences in pre-service teachers prospective ICT integration. However, male pre-service teachers hold more positive attitudes towards ICT use than their female counterparts. Additionally, the findings reveal that the two strongest predictors of pre-service teachers future ICT use are their attitudes and perceived competency to teach and implement technology in their teaching practices.

We sought to describe characteristics and predictors of acute kidney injury (AKI), remission and mortality in high-risk TLS patients. In this retrospective monocentric study, we included all patients with the diagnosis of biological and/or clinical TLS from 2012 to 2018. The primary outcome was the prevalence of AKI during the acute phase of TLS. Secondary outcomes were overall mortality and remission of the underlying malignancy at 1 year. RESULTS: Among 153 patients with TLS, 123 (80.4%) patients experienced AKI and 83 (54.2%) required renal replacement therapy. mSOFA score (OR = 1.15, IC 95% [1.02C1.34]), age (OR = 1.05, IC 95% [1.02C1.08]) and male gender (OR = 6.79, IC 95% [2.59C19.44]) were associated with AKI. Rasburicase use (HR = 2.45, IC 95% [1.17C5.15]) was associated with remission of the underlying malignancy at 1 year. Parameters associated with mortality at 1 year were mechanical ventilation (HR = 1.96, IC 95% [1.02C3.78]), vasopressors (HR = 3.13, IC 95% [1.59C6.15]), age (HR = 1.02, IC 95% [1C1.03]), spontaneous TLS (HR = 1.65, IC 95% [1.01C2.69]) and delay of chemotherapy administration (HR = 1.01, IC 95% [1C1.03]). CONCLUSIONS: AKI is highly prevalent in TLS patients. Rasburicase is associated with better outcomes regarding remission of the underlying malignancy. As rasburicase may be an indirect marker of a high degree of tumor lysis and chemosensitivity, more studies are warranted to confirm the protective role of urate oxidase. Delaying chemotherapy may be deleterious in terms of long-term outcomes.

It was noticed that Aspergillus terreus, Aspergillus flavus, and Aspergillus fumigatus induced variable toxic potential that was cell type, secondary metabolite type, and concentration dependent. Human colonic adenocarcinoma cells (Caco-2) showed less sensitivity than hepatocyte-derived cellular carcinoma cells (HuH-7), and in turn, the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was variable. Also, the apoptotic potential of Aspergillus species-derived fungal secondary metabolites was proven via detection of up-regulated pro-apoptotic genes and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes. The expression level was cell type dependent. Concurrently, apoptotic profile was accompanied with cellular DNA accumulation at the G2/M phase, as well as an elevation in Pre-G1 phase but not during G0/G1 and S phases. Also, there were characteristic apoptotic features of treated cells presented as abnormal intra-nuclear eosinophilic structures, dead cells with mixed euchromatin and heterochromatin, ruptured cell membranes, apoptotic cells with irregular cellular and nuclear membranes, as well as peripheral chromatin condensation. It can be concluded that Aspergillus secondary metabolites are promising agents that can be used as supplementary agents to the currently applied anti-cancer drug regimen.","output":"Genetic and Histopathological Alterations in Caco-2 and HuH-7 Cells Treated with Secondary Metabolites of Marine fungi"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Alcohol-based disinfectant shortage is a serious concern in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic.

In striking contrast to the influenza C virus enzyme, the MHV-S esterase was unable to release acetate from bovine submandibulary gland mucin. Furthermore, MHV-S could not remove influenza C virus receptors from erythrocytes. Analysis with free sialic acid derivatives revealed that the MHV-S HE protein specifically de-O-acetylates 5-N-acetyl-4-O-acetyl sialic acid (Neu4, 5Ac2) but not 5-N-acetyl-9-O-acetyl sialic acid (Neu5,9Ac2), which is the major substrate for esterases of influenza C virus and bovine coronaviruses. In addition, the MHV-S esterase converted glycosidically bound Neu4,5Ac2 of guinea pig serum glycoproteins to Neu5Ac. By expression of the MHV esterase with recombinant vaccinia virus and incubation with guinea pig serum, we demonstrated that the viral HE possesses sialate-4-O-acetylesterase activity. In addition to observed enzymatic activity, MHV-S exhibited affinity to guinea pig and horse serum glycoproteins. Binding required sialate-4-O-acetyl groups and was abolished by chemical de-O-acetylation. Since Neu4,5Ac2 has not been identified in mice, the nature of potential substrates and/or secondary receptors for MHV-S in the natural host remains to be determined. The esterase of MHV-S is the first example of a viral enzyme with high specificity and affinity toward 4-O-acetylated sialic acids.","output":"The hemagglutinin-esterase of mouse hepatitis virus strain S is a sialate-4-O-acetylesterase."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted mobility worldwide. As a corollary, the health of top- and lower-level athletes alike is profoundly reliant on movement and exercise. Thus, the aim of this study is to understand impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on athletes motivation to exercise and train. In detail, we aim to better understand who (i.e., demographic, sport-specific, and psychological state and trait variables) reported a change in motivation to train due to the lockdown, why they reported lower motivation (i.e., open-ended questions on problems), what they did to help themselves, what support they received from others, and what they are looking forward to after the lockdown (i.e., open questions). Questionnaire data and answers to these open-ended questions were assessed via an online questionnaire, completed by 95 amateur and recreational athletes during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Germany (April to mid-May 2020). Results show that greater numbers of female athletes are less motivated to train in comparison to male athletes (p = 0.029). No differences in motivation were found regarding type of sport (individual vs. team sport) and number of competitions during the year. Also, more motivated to train amateur and recreational athletes showed lower athletic identity than athletes who reported no change in motivation to exercise during the lockdown (p = 0.03). Additionally, differences in state emotional, perceived stress, and personality variables (i.e., orientation to happiness, volition) were found between athletes who stated that they were less motivated to train compared to athletes who reported no changes in motivation. In particular, closure of sports facilities and social distancing measures were perceived to be highly problematic. Even though athletes received emotional support, organized themselves via routines and schedules, and trained using online tools, they predominately stated that they wished that their coaches would have supported them more.

Impaired immune homeostasis and immune cell dysregulation in adipose tissue are associated with phenotypic and functional changes in the pool of T lymphocytes and the development of chronic hypovitaminosis D. Low vitamin D levels in obesity lead to the activation, proliferation and production of pro-inflammatory mediators by T cells. Hypovitaminosis D is the cause of a decrease in the functional potential of regulatory and anti-inflammatory lymphocytes and the maintenance of the inflammatory response. The exact molecular genetic mechanisms of the effect of vitamin D on T lymphocytes have not been fully elucidated. Therefore, uncovering the functional role of T cells and their relationship to vitamin D homeostasis in the context of obesity development may contribute to the development of new pathogenetic methods for clinical prediction of the risk of metabolic, oncologic, autoimmune and infectious complications.

A wide variety of lightweight mesh models are currently available on the market to overcome some of these problems showing good preliminary results, but no data representing the medium- or long-term results. The present study aims to report the clinical outcomes of two institutional series of patients who underwent hernia repair using a partially absorbable auto adherent mesh (Parietene? Progrip?--PP). METHODS A prospective analysis was performed including unselected patients with primary groin hernia who underwent a standardized Lichtenstein procedure using the PP mesh at two tertiary institutions. RESULTS During the 2-year study period, 181 patients (167 males; 14 females) with a median age of 63 years (19-85 years) were operated on at both centers. Short-term complications occurred in 27 patients (15%), the most commonly seen being urinary retention (6%) followed by hematoma (5%) and acute orchitis (2%). With a median follow-up of 17 months (12-29 months), 4 patients (2%) had a feeling of a foreign body in the groin, and 7 (4%) developed chronic pain. A total of four patients (2%) developed recurrence. CONCLUSIONS In our experience, the use of the PP mesh for hernioplasties offers a potential benefit not only in the short-term period but also in a medium-term follow-up with low recurrence and late chronic pain rates.

Since there are currently no effective therapeutic or widely available vaccines, it is of urgent need to look for new strategies for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection diseases. Binding of a viral protein onto cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) is generally the first step in a cascade of interaction that is required for viral entry and the initiation of infection. Meanwhile, interactions of selectins and cytokines (e.g., IL-6 and TNF-) with HS expressed on endothelial cells are crucial in controlling the recruitment of immune cells during inflammation. Thus, structurally defined heparin/HS and their mimetics might serve as potential drugs by competing with cell surface HS for the prevention of viral adhesion and modulation of inflammatory reaction. In this review, we will elaborate coronavirus invasion mechanisms and summarize the latest advances in HSCprotein interactions, especially proteins relevant to the process of coronavirus infection and subsequent inflammation.

Here we assessed the suitability of using 100-well BioScreen plates or 96-well plates incubated in a robot hotel to cultivate eight filamentous marine fungi, six sporulating and two non-sporulating, to obtain data on growth and substrate (glucose, xylose, galactose or glycerol) utilisation in a high throughput manner. All eight fungi grew in both cultivation systems, but growth was more variable and with more noise in the data in the Cytomat plate hotel than in the BioScreen. Specific growth rates between 0.01 (no added substrate) and 0.07 h-1 were measured for strains growing in the BioScreen and between 0.01 and 0.27 h-1 for strains in the plate hotel. Three strains, Dendryphiella salina LF304, Penicillium chrysogenum KF657 and Penicillium pinophilum LF458, consistently had higher specific growth rates on glucose and xylose in the plate hotel than in the BioScreen, but otherwise results were similar in the two systems. However, because of the noise in data from the plate hotel, the data obtained from it could only be used to distinguish between substrates which did or did not support growth, whereas data from BioScreen also provided information on substrate preference. Glucose was the preferred substrate for all strains, followed by xylose and galactose. Five strains also grew on glycerol. Therefore it was important to minimise the amount of glycerol introduced with the inoculum to avoid misinterpreting the results for growth on poor substrates.

OBJECTIVE: Our study aims to assess the impact of only-child status on the mental health of adolescents confined at home during the COVID-19 outbreak. The exposure risk to COVID-19, adverse experience, parent-child relationship, and resilience have also been measured and considered. METHODS: From March 20 to 31, 2020, a cross-sectional survey test was conducted on 11,681 adolescents aged from 12 to 18 years in middle schools (Grade 7 to Grade 9) across five provinces in China. The self-reported online questionnarie was used to collected data of demographic information, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, the short form of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale and the exposure risk to COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 11,180 valid questionnaires were collected, with an effective rate of 95.7%. 35.2% of only children and 38.8% of non-only children reported depression symptoms, while 20.5% of only children and 24.7% of non-only children reported anxiety symptoms. It was significant that non-only children were more likely to have anxiety and depression symptoms than only children (ORa?=a?1.164, 95%CI: 1.064-1.273, pa?=a?0.001). The risk of exposure to COVID-19 was a risk factor of depression (ORa?=a?2.284, 95%CI: 1.640-3.180, p < 0.001) and anxiety symptoms (ORa?=a?1.959, 95%CI: 1.402-2.737, p < 0.001) in non-only children, but not in only children. For both only children and non-only children, the resilience and parent-child relationship were protective factors of depression and anxiety symptoms, while emotional abuse was a risk factor (p < 0.001).

However, recent attention to their adverse effects in the intensive care unit (ICU) has led to the use of strategies that aim to reduce these side effects. Among these strategies, there are multimodal analgesia protocols, which prioritize pain management and employ a combination of different analgesics to spare excessive doses of opioids and sedatives in continuous infusion. Objective The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of a multimodal analgesia protocol on clinical outcomes and consumption of sedatives and analgesics in two intensive care units. Methods We conducted a single-center, quasi-experimental, retrospective, and prospective cohort study comparing clinical outcomes and consumption of sedatives and analgesics before and after the implementation of a multimodal pain management protocol in critically ill adult patients. We included 465 patients in 2017 (pre-intervention group) and 1508 between 2018 and 2020 (post-intervention group). Results In the analysis of the primary outcome, there was a significant reduction in mortality between 2017 and 2020 (27.7% - 21.7%, p=0.0134). There was no statistical difference in mechanical ventilation time or concerning the infection rate. Patients who received the multimodal analgesia protocol had a decrease of 24% regarding mean fentanyl intake and a progressive reduction in morphine milligram equivalents (MME) (8.4% - 19%).

(2021), namely that leadership is to influence others to produce results, is acquired, and can be exercised and developed by anyone. In the model, the transformation in the motivation aspect leads to the behavior, and therefore the transformation of making an improvement plan based on previous results, and implementing the plan by considering good points and areas of improvement based on the advice of others. As a methodology, a questionnaire survey was used to investigate the change in consciousness and behavior before and after the LDP was promoted at a womens university. As a result, the change in consciousness related to the items emphasized in this leadership development, such as goal confirmation and leadership awareness, leads to this behavior. This change in the positive direction of behavior can be thought of as revealing sufficient conditions for leadership behavior (and the change in consciousness that leads to it), indicating how it can be better achieved when practicing leadership behavior. Achieving both necessary and sufficient conditions to prevent and respond to negative changes while extending positive changes is required in leadership development programs.

Cai et al., Virology 355:152-163, 2006). Here we show that inhibition of the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway by the MEK inhibitor UO126 significantly impaired MHV progeny production (a reduction of 95 to 99% in virus titer), which correlated with the phosphorylation status of ERK1/2. Moreover, knockdown of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 by small interfering RNAs suppressed MHV replication. The inhibitory effect of UO126 on MHV production appeared to be a general phenomenon since the effect was consistently observed in all six different MHV strains and in three different cell types tested; it was likely exerted at the postentry steps of the virus life cycle because the virus titers were similarly inhibited from infected cells treated at 1 h prior to, during, or after infection. Furthermore, the treatment did not affect the virus entry, as revealed by the virus internalization assay. Metabolic labeling and reporter gene assays demonstrated that translation of cellular and viral mRNAs appeared unaffected by UO126 treatment. However, synthesis of viral genomic and subgenomic RNAs was severely suppressed by UO126 treatment, as demonstrated by a reduced incorporation of [3H]uridine and a decrease in chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity in a defective-interfering RNA-CAT reporter assay. These findings indicate that the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway is involved in MHV RNA synthesis.","output":"Suppression of coronavirus replication by inhibition of the MEK signaling pathway."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Paliperidone and mirtazapine are psychotropic agents associated with proarrhythmic effects Case Presentation: A 21-year-old woman was admitted to the intensive care unit on two separate occasions for attempting suicide by overdosing on paliperidone and mirtazapine During both admissions, the patient had atypical chest pain and a first-degree atrioventricular block (AVB) with paradoxical sinus tachycardia, which resolved with the discontinuation of paliperidone and mirtazapine and aggressive intravenous fluids Conclusion: Drug-induced first-degree AVB from paliperidone and mirtazapine should be on the differential diagnosis in patients on paliperidone and/or mirtazapine who present with chest pain, tachycardia or new-onset first-degree AVB LEARNING POINTS: Paliperidone and mirtazapine are associated with first-degree heart block, which may be a harbinger of torsades de pointes and ventricular fibrillation Paliperidone and mirtazapine may potentiate each other's proarrhythmic effects since the metabolism of both involve the cytochrome P450 2D6 enzyme A history of psychiatric illness makes it difficult to rule out atypical chest pain without ECG or troponins and often leads to increased resource utilization, even during times of heavy use like the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"First-Degree Atrioventricular Block with Tachycardia from Paliperidone and Mirtazapine Overdose"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ability to measure the quality of antibiotic prescription is a critical element in any antimicrobial stewardship programme.

Thus, the aim of this scoping review is to map out the existing evidence on the impact of long-distance truck drivers on the spread of COVID-19 and measures that countries can implement to mitigate this route of spread in the African region. METHODS: we searched the PubMed database and the website of the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020 for eligible studies. RESULTS: the search strategy identified 669 citations, of which six met the inclusion criteria. The most frequently reported interventions were maintaining hand hygiene, social distance, testing truck drivers, regulation of trade and transport e.g. only trucks with the food, medical supplies, fuels, agricultural supplies will be allowed to operate in interstate operations and regulating and controlling trucks carrying essential goods and services e.g. truck drivers are required to declare their final destination and are urged to stop only at designated points.

Results show that lockdown measures have significant effects to encourage people to maintain social distancing. However, pandemic severity and socioeconomic and institutional factors have limited effects to sustain social distancing practice. The results also explain that socioeconomic and institutional factors of urbanity and modernity have significant effects on pandemic severity.

The first group received a combination of I.V. TCZ (400C800 mg every 24 hours for only two doses) and HCQ (400 mg twice in the first day then 200 mg twice for 5 days) while the second group of patients received I.V. RMV of 200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg once daily infused over 60 minutes for 5 days with the same TCZ regimen used in the first group. All clinical parameters and laboratory investigations were assessed before and after treatment. RESULTS: The CRP was significantly decreased while PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio post-treatment was significantly improved in both treatment groups. TCZ-HCQ group showed a significant decrease in the ferritin, LDH, and D. Dimer levels. The median days of hospitalization with interquartile range (IQR) were 10 (6C16) and 8 (5C12) for TCZ-HCQ and TCZ-RMV groups, respectively. The numbers of mechanically ventilated patients were 25 and 43 for TCZ-HCQ and TCZ-RMV groups, respectively. Therapeutic failure was about 26.8% in the TCZ-HCQ group and 30.8% in the TCZ-RMV group but there was no significant difference between both groups. Some complications were recognized only in TCZ-RMV following treatment including secondary bacterial infections (42.3%), myocarditis (15.4%), and finally pulmonary embolism (7.7%). CONCLUSION: Efficacy of both TCZ-RMV and TCZ-HCQ combinations are observed in the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients; however the increased need for ICU or mechanical ventilation in the TCZ-RMV arm contributed to the appearance of cardiac and thrombotic events.

In Argentina, the pandemic is advancing despite prolonged lockdown measures. We aim to analyze the impact of the easing of lockdown measures in the number of visits to the emergency department (ED), and outpatient consultations (OC) to a tertiary neurological center. Methods: We compared the number of ED visits with the social mobility overtime. We also compared the number of OC, and the geographic distribution of patients' addresses between 2019 and 2020. Results: ED visits decreased 48.33% (n = 14,697 in 2019 vs. n = 7,595 in 2020). At the beginning of the lockdown, the social mobility decreased in pharmacies/groceries, and workplaces, along with a reduction in the number of ED visits. With the easing of lockdown restrictions, the social mobility decreased in residential places, slightly increased in workplaces and almost return to normal in pharmacies/groceries. Variations in ED visits correlate better with social mobility in workplaces (coef. =0.75, p < 0.001) than in groceries/pharmacies (coef. =0.68, p < 0.001). OC decreased 43%. Fourteen percent of OC were tele consults. This was associated with an increase of the geographical area of influence of our center (standard distance of 109 km in 2019 and 127 km in 2020). Conclusions: Despite an increase in social mobility, the number of ED visits and OC to an Argentinian tertiary neurological center remain worrisomely low.

METHODS: All ICU COVID-19 patients in Sweden until 27 May 2020 were matched to population controls on age and gender to assess the risk of ICU admission. Cases were identified, comorbidities and medications were retrieved from high-quality registries. Three conditional logistic regression models were used for risk of ICU admission and three Cox proportional hazards models for risk of ICU mortality, one with comorbidities, one with medications and finally with both models combined, respectively. RESULTS: We included 1981 patients and 7924 controls. Hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, asthma, obesity, being a solid organ transplant recipient and immunosuppressant medications were independent risk factors of ICU admission and oral anticoagulants were protective. Stroke, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and treatment with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors (RAASi) were independent risk factors of ICU mortality in the pre-specified primary analyses; treatment with statins was protective. However, after adjusting for the use of continuous renal replacement therapy, RAASi were no longer an independent risk factor.

To evaluate the different tissues obtained by biopsy and autopsy from five patients who expired from severe COVID-19 in our medical center. METHODS This retrospective study reviewed five patients with severe COVID-19, confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and imaging, to determine the potential correlations between histologic findings with patient outcome. RESULTS Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and micro-thrombosis were the most common histologic finding in the lung tissues (4 of 5 cases), and immunohistochemical (IHC) findings (3 of 4 cases) suggested perivascular aggregation and diffuse infiltration of alveolar walls by CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. Two of five cases had mild predominantly perivascular lymphocytic infiltration, single cell myocardial necrosis and variable interstitial edema in myocardial samples. Hypertrophic cardiac myocytes, representing hypertensive cardiomyopathy was seen in one patient and CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes were detected on IHC in two cases. In renal samples, acute tubular necrosis was observed in 3 of 5 cases, while chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis, crescent formation and small vessel fibrin thrombi were observed in 1 of 5 samples. Sinusoidal dilation, mild to moderate chronic portal inflammation and mild mixed macro- and micro-vesicular steatosis were detected in all liver samples.

Furthermore, adsorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) profiles for screened compounds were predicted in silico. Methods: The crystal structure of Mpro was retrieved from the Protein Data Bank, while the plant bioactive compounds were retrieved from Pubchem. Drug-likeness of the selected compounds and a control drug (hydroxychloroquine) were assessed, and the compounds that satisfied the drug-likeness rule were docked against Mpro. The docked complexes were analyzed using LigPlot and the protein-ligand profiler server. The top five compound hits were subjected to ADMET screening using the ADMETSar server. Results: A total of 17 out of 22 screened compounds passed Lipinski's assessment. Additionally, the most active compounds from the investigated plants exhibited relative inhibitory potentials against Mpro compared with hydroxychloroquine, which alludes to their possible involvement in inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease replication process.

Increased mass testing and surveillance are crucial for controlling the disease spread, obtaining better pandemic statistics, and developing realistic epidemiological models. Despite the advantages of nucleic acid- and antigen-based tests such as accuracy, specificity, and non-invasive approaches of sample collection, they can only detect active infections. Antibodies (immunoglobulins) are produced by the host immune system within a few days after infection and persist in the blood for at least several weeks after infection resolution. Antibody-based tests have provided a substitute and effective method of ultra-rapid detection for multiple contagious disease outbreaks in the past, including viral diseases such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome). Thus, although not highly suitable for early diagnosis, antibody-based methods can be utilized to detect past infections hidden in the population, including asymptomatic ones. In an active community spread scenario of a disease that can provide a bigger window for mass detections and a practical approach for continuous surveillance. These factors encouraged researchers to investigate means of improving antibody-based rapid tests and employ them as reliable, reproducible, sensitive, specific, and economic tools for COVID-19 mass testing and surveillance. The development and integration of such immunoglobulin-based tests can transform the pandemic diagnosis by moving the same out of the clinics and laboratories into community testing sites and homes.

To assist with the development of preventive measures and targeted interventions to combat the pandemic in Brazil, we present a geographic study to detect active and emerging spaceCtime clusters of COVID-19. We document the relationship between relative risk of COVID-19 and mortality, inequality, socioeconomic vulnerability variables. We used the prospective spaceCtime scan statistic to detect daily COVID-19 clusters and examine the relative risk between February 25CJune 7, 2020, and February 25CJuly 20, 2020, in 5570 Brazilian municipalities. We apply a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) to assess whether mortality rate, GINI index, and social inequality are predictors for the relative risk of each cluster. We detected 7 active clusters in the first time period, being one in the north, two in the northeast, two in the southeast, one in the south, and one in the capital of Brazil. In the second period, we found 9 clusters with RR > 1 located in all Brazilian regions. The results obtained through the GLM showed that there is a significant positive correlation between the predictor variables in relation to the relative risk of COVID-19. Given the presence of spatial autocorrelation in the GLM residuals, a spatial lag model was conducted that revealed that spatial effects, and both GINI index and mortality rate were strong predictors in the increase in COVID-19 relative risk in Brazil. Our research can be utilized to improve COVID-19 response and planning in all Brazilian states. The results from this study are particularly salient to public health, as they can guide targeted intervention measures, lowering the magnitude and spread of COVID-19.

INTERVENTION Training group (n = 51): 10 weeks (3 times/week) of intensive balance and gait training, incorporating dual tasks. Control group (n = 49): care as usual. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Spatiotemporal gait variables collected during normal and fast walking on a pressure-sensitive mat. A linear mixed model was used to evaluate training effects post intervention and at the 6 and 12 month follow-up. RESULTS Immediate training effects in the pace domain of gait were increased step velocity (normal speed: 8.2 cm/s, P = 0.04; fast: 10.8 cm/s, P < 0.01), increased step length (normal speed: 3 cm, P = 0.05; fast: 2.3 cm, P = 0.05) and reduced swing time variability (fast speed: -2.5 ms, P = 0.02). In the rhythm domain reduced step time (fast speed: -19.3 ms, P = 0.02), stance time (normal: -24.3 ms, P = 0.01; fast: -29.6 ms, P = 0.02) and swing time (fast speed: -8.7 ms, P = 0.04) was seen.

The main objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of fatigue, anxiety, depression and sleep quality among patients receiving haemodialysis during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and to explore the contributing predictors. METHODS: A cross-sectional and descriptive correlational design using Qualtrics software was performed. Data were collected using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue (FACT-F), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Logistic regression analyses were used to explore the predictors that were associated with fatigue, anxiety, depression and sleep quality. RESULTS: Of the 123 patients undergoing haemodialysis who participated, 53.7% (n = 66) reported fatigue, 43.9% (n = 54) reported anxiety, 33.3% (n = 41) reported depression and 56.9% (n = 70) reported poor sleep. Fatigue, anxiety and sleep quality (P < .05) were significantly associated with being female, and whether family members or relatives were suspected or confirmed with COVID-19.

Contrary to other studies, we also took the demographic development between 2016 and 2020 and increasing life expectancy into account. METHODS: Using death and population figures from the EUROSTAT database, we estimated weekly and cumulative Standardized Mortality Ratios (SMR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the year 2020. We applied two approaches to calculate weekly numbers of death expected in 2020: first, we used mean weekly mortality rates from 2016 to 2019 as expected mortality rates for 2020, and, second, to consider increasing life expectancy, we calculated expected mortality rates for 2020 by extrapolation from mortality rates from 2016 to 2019. RESULTS: In the first approach, the cumulative SMRs show that in Germany and Sweden there was no or little excess mortality in 2020 (SMR = 0.976 (95% CI: 0.974C0.978), and 1.030 (1.023C1.036), respectively), while in Spain the excess mortality was 14.8% (1.148 (1.144C1.151)).

Yet, to the best of our knowledge, large-scale studies addressing the mental health of adult Syrian refugees in Lebanon are lacking. We examined the prevalence of depression symptoms, which represent a common and debilitating mental health disorder among Syrian refugee populations in Lebanon, along with their sociodemographic and clinical correlates. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey design was conducted as part of a collaborative project-Sijilli- led by the Global Health Institute at the American University of Beirut (Beirut, Lebanon) across 4 informal tented settlements for refugees (Beirut, Bekaa, North, South) in Lebanon among adult Syrian refugees (18), over a period extending from 2018 to 2020. The survey inquired about participants sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, and screened participants for symptoms of depression through sequential methodology using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2 and PHQ-9). RESULTS: A total of 3255 adult Syrian refugees were enrolled in the study. Of those refugees, 46.73% (n = 1521) screened positive on the PHQ-2 and were therefore eligible to complete the PHQ-9. In the entire sample (n = 3255), the prevalence of moderate to severe depression symptoms (PHQ-2  2 and then PHQ-9  10) was 22% (n = 706).

The aim of this study was to report the effectiveness of an essential-oil extract of three Cretan aromatic plants in the treatment of cases with an upper respiratory tract infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A double blind randomized controlled trial was implemented between October 2013 and February 2014. An essential-oil extract of Cretan aromatic plants in olive oil (total volume of 15 ml of essential oil per litre of olive oil) was administered as 0.5 ml soft gel capsules, twice a day, for 7 days. Placebo treatment was 0.5 ml olive oil in soft gel capsules. Eligible patients were those presenting for clinical examination in the selected setting with signs and symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection that had begun within the previous 24 hours. Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was used for the detection of respiratory viruses. The primary outcome was the severity and duration of symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, assessed using the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory System Survey (WURSS-21) questionnaire. A secondary outcome of interest was the change in C-reactive protein (CRP) status. RESULTS: One hundred and five patients completed the study: 51 in the placebo group, and 54 in the intervention (treated) group. Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. No statistically significant differences were found in symptom duration or severity between the two groups, although small and clinically favorable effects were observed.

Deep learning methods especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great success in COVID-19 diagnosis in recent works. But they are efficient when the depth of network is high enough. However, the use of a deep network requires a sufficiently large training set, which is not available in practice. From the other hand, the use of a shallow CNN may not provide superior results because it is not able to rich feature extraction due to lacking enough convolutional layers. To deal with this difficulty, the contextual features reduced by convolutional filters (CFRCF) is proposed in this work. CFRCF extracts shape and textural features as contextual feature maps from the chest X-ray radiographs and abdominal computed tomography (CT) images. Morphological operators, Gabor filter banks and attribute filters are used for contextual feature extraction. Then, two convolutional filters are applied to the contextual feature cube to extract the nonlinear sub-features and hidden relationships among the contextual features. Finally, a fully connected layer is used to produce a reduced feature vector which is fed to a classifier. Support vector machine and random forest are used as classifier. The experimental results show the superior performance of the proposed method from the recognition accuracy and running time point of view using limited training samples. More than 76% and 94% overall classification accuracy is obtained by the proposed method in CT scan and X-ray images datasets, respectively.","output":"Automatic Diagnosis of Coronavirus (COVID-19) Using Shape and Texture Characteristics Extracted From X-Ray and CT-Scan Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We introduce the concept of places of social inclusioninstitutions endowed by a society or a community with material resources, meaning, and values at geographic sites where citizens can access services for specific needsas taken-for-granted, essential, and inherently precarious Based on our study of an emergency department that was disrupted by the threat of the Ebola virus in 2014, we develop a process model to explain how a place of social inclusion can be maintained by custodians We show how these custodiansin our fieldsite, doctors and nursesexperience and engage in institutional work to manage different levels of tension between the value of inclusion and the reality of finite resources, as well as tension between inclusion and the desire for safety We also demonstrate how the interplay of custodians emotions is integral to maintaining the place of social inclusion The primary contribution of our study is to shine light on places of social inclusion as important institutions in democratic society We also reveal the theoretical and practical importance of places as institutions, deepen understanding of custodians and custodianship as a form of institutional work, and offer new insight into the dynamic processes that connect emotions and institutional work ?

Methods A review of qualitative data drawn from public and private sources was conducted, as well as various studies related to national procurement systems in four G20 countries, to (1) identify differences, strengths and weaknesses;(2) evaluate how each system responded to the COVID-19 crisis;and, (3) identify best practices for policy-makers. Results While some governments have centralized the procurement of medical devices, developing a national scheme for tendering and purchase, other countries have deployed a decentralized approach where regions or even individual hospitals are responsible for all or some aspects of procurement. This dichotomy has led to a variety of efficiency and quality of service outcomes, with models implementing national uniformity achieving greater cost-savings. Furthermore centralized systems of procurement performed better during times of health crisis. It remains unclear whether these short-term savings lead to long-term efficiencies achieved through improved patient outcomes as data is lacking.

We aimed to clarify radiological alterations of olfactory pathways in patients with long COVID-19 characterized by olfactory dysfunction. A comprehensive review of the English literature was performed by analyzing relevant papers about this topic. A case series was presented: all patients underwent complete otorhinolaryngology evaluation including the Sniffin' Sticks battery test. A previous diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by positive swabs. The MRIs were acquired using a 3.0T MR scanner with a standardized protocol for olfactory tract analysis. Images were first analysed by a dedicated neuroradiologist and subsequently reviewed and compared with the previous available MRIs. The review of the literature retrieved 25 studies;most cases of olfactory dysfunction more than 3 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection showed olfactory bulb (OB) reduction. Patients in the personal case series had asymmetry and a reduction in the volume of the OB. This evidence was strengthened by the comparison with a previous MRI, where the OBs were normal.

However, pregnant people were not included in vaccine trials, and there is limited data on COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy. The objectives of this systematic review were to identify the safety, immunogenicity, effectiveness, and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination among pregnant people in the U.S. Data Sources: Four databases (PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Google Scholar) were used to identify eligible studies published from January 01, 2020, through February 06, 2022. Study Eligibility Criteria: Inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed empirical research conducted in the U.S., published in English, and addressed one of the following topics: safety, immunogenicity, effectiveness, and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination among pregnant people. Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods: A narrative synthesis approach was used to synthesize findings. Critical appraisal was done using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) tool. Results: Thirty-two studies were identified. The majority of studies (n = 25) reported the use of Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines among pregnant people; only six reported the Janssen vaccine. Of the 32 studies, 11 examined COVID-19 vaccine safety, 10 investigated immunogenicity and effectiveness, and 11 assessed vaccine acceptance among pregnant people. Injection site pain and fatigue were the most common adverse events. One case study reported immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). COVID-19 vaccination did not increase the risk of adverse pregnancy or neonatal outcomes in comparison to unvaccinated pregnant people. After COVID-19 vaccination, pregnant people elicited a robust immune response, and vaccinations conferred protective immunity to newborns through breast milk and the placental transfer. COVID-19 vaccine acceptance was low among pregnant people in the U.S. African American race, Hispanic ethnicity, younger age, low education, prior refusal of the influenza vaccine, and lack of provider counseling were associated with low vaccine acceptance. Conclusions: Peer-reviewed studies support COVID-19 vaccine safety and protective effects on pregnant people and their newborns. Future studies that use rigorous methodologies and include diverse populations are needed to confirm current findings. In addition, targeted and tailored strategies are needed to improve vaccine acceptance especially among minorities.","output":"COVID-19 Vaccination among Pregnant People in the U.S.: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE WORK: The worldwide incidence of fractures of the proximal end of the femur is increasing as the average age of the population rises. The current surgical gold treatment standard is intramedullary nail fixation. The Authors present their experience with the D-Nail system for intertrochanteric femur fractures. METHODS: From January 1st to February 21st 2020 (breakout of COVID-19 pandemic) 34 patients were treated with the D-Nail system: 11 with basicervical fractures, 16 with intertrochanteric stable fractures and 7 with intertrochanteric unstable fractures. In 11 cases, a single cephalic screw was used; in 23 cases, two of them were used. Distal locking was executed in 7 patients. Follow-up time ranged from 2 to 3 months. RESULTS: None of the reported intra- or post-operative complication was linked to the fixation device or the surgical technique. Patients were monitored with clinical and radiological checkups using modified Harris Hip Score to accurately evaluate the fluctuations in the rehabilitation period. CONCLUSION: The main advantages of this synthesis device are the proximal hole's peculiar shape, which allows the possibility to position one or two cephalic screws on the same nail, and the silicon coating, which provides numerous biological advantages. Distal locking was executed in selected cases only, based on fracture type. Optimum treatment involves rapid execution of surgery, minimal trauma during surgery, maximum mechanical stability, and rapid weight-bearing.

EM can be confused with other more serious conditions like StevensCJohnson syndrome (SJS); however, clinical research has provided significant evidence to classify EM and SJS as separate disorders. Treatment of EM is highly variable, depending on the etiology, the involvement of mucosal sites, and the chronicity (acute vs. recurring) of the disease. If the etiology or causal medication/infection is identified, then the medication is stopped and/or the infection is treated prior to initiating symptomatic treatment. Treatment for acute EM is focused on relieving symptoms with topical steroids or antihistamines. Treatment for recurrent EM is most successful when tailored to individual patients. First line treatment for recurrent EM includes both systemic and topical therapies. Systemic therapies include corticosteroid therapy and antiviral prophylaxis. Topical therapies include high-potency corticosteroids, and antiseptic or anesthetic solutions for mucosal involvement.

DESIGN: Analysis of anonymised routine care data extracted from electronic medical records from three large Dutch primary care registries. SETTING: Primary care. PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive adult patients seen in primary care for COVID-19 symptoms in the first wave of COVID-19 infections (March 1 2020 to June 1 2020) and in the second wave (June 1 2020 to April 15 2021) in the Netherlands. OUTCOME MEASURES: A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to predict hospital referral within 90 days after first COVID-19 consultation in primary care. Data from the first wave was used for derivation (n = 5,475 patients). Age, sex, the interaction between age and sex, and the number of cardiovascular conditions and/or diabetes (0, 1, or 2) were pre-specified as candidate predictors. This full model was (i) compared to a simple model including only age and sex and its interaction, and (ii) externally validated in COVID-19 patients during the second wave (n = 16,693). RESULTS: The full model performed better than the simple model (likelihood ratio test p<0.001).

In the proposed work, for sentimental analysis, a unique classifier named the Sentimental DataBase Miner algorithm (SADBM) is used to categorize the opinions and parallel processing, and is applied on the data collected from various online social media websites like Twitter, Facebook, and Linkedin. The accuracy of the proposed model is validated with trained data and compared with basic classifiers, such as logistic regression and decision tree. The proposed algorithm is executed on CPU as well as GPU and calculated the acceleration ratio of the model. The results show that the proposed model provides the best accuracy compared with the other two models, i.e., 96% (GPU).","output":"Feature-Based Sentimental Analysis on Public Attention towards COVID-19 Using CUDA-SADBM Classification Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to better understand the factors associated with the heterogeneity of in-hospital COVID-19 morbidity and mortality across France, one of the countries most affected by COVID-19 in the early months of the pandemic. METHODS: This geo-epidemiological analysis was based on data publicly available on government and administration websites for the 96 administrative departments of metropolitan France between March 19 and May 11, 2020, including Public Health France, the Regional Health Agencies, the French national statistics institute, and the Ministry of Health. Using hierarchical ascendant classification on principal component analysis of multidimensional variables, and multivariate analyses with generalised additive models, we assessed the associations between several factors (spatiotemporal spread of the epidemic between Feb 7 and March 17, 2020, the national lockdown, demographic population structure, baseline intensive care capacities, baseline population health and health-care services, new chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine dispensations, economic indicators, degree of urbanisation, and climate profile) and in-hospital COVID-19 incidence, mortality, and case fatality rates. Incidence rate was defined as the cumulative number of in-hospital COVID-19 cases per 100a000 inhabitants, mortality rate as the cumulative number of in-hospital COVID-19 deaths per 100a000, and case fatality rate as the cumulative number of in-hospital COVID-19 deaths per cumulative number of in-hospital COVID-19 cases. FINDINGS: From March 19 to May 11, 2020, hospitals in metropolitan France notified a total of 100a988 COVID-19 cases, including 16a597 people who were admitted to intensive care and 17a062 deaths. There was an overall cumulative in-hospital incidence rate of 1556 cases per 100a000 inhabitants (range 194-4895), in-hospital mortality rate of 263 deaths per 100a000 (11-1192), and in-hospital case fatality rate of 169% (48-262). We found clear spatial heterogeneity of in-hospital COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates, following the spread of the epidemic. After multivariate adjustment, the delay between the first COVID-19-associated death and the onset of the national lockdown was positively associated with in-hospital incidence (adjusted standardised incidence ratio 102, 95% CI 101-104), mortality (adjusted standardised mortality ratio 104, 102-106), and case fatality rates (adjusted standardised fatality ratio 101, 101-102). Mortality and case fatality rates were higher in departments with older populations (adjusted standardised ratio for populations with a high proportion older than aged >85 years 217 [95% CI 120-390] for mortality and 143 [108-188] for case fatality rate). Mortality rate was also associated with incidence rate (10004, 10002-1001), but mortality and case fatality rates did not appear to be associated with baseline intensive care capacities. We found no association between climate and in-hospital COVID-19 incidence, or between economic indicators and in-hospital COVID-19 incidence or mortality rates. INTERPRETATION: This ecological study highlights the impact of the epidemic spread, national lockdown, and reactive adaptation of intensive care capacities on the spatial distribution of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. It provides information for future geo-epidemiological analyses and has implications for preparedness and response policies to current and future epidemic waves in France and elsewhere.

However, the extent to which non-COVID deaths contributed to excess mortality, its regional characterization, and the association between municipal- and individual-level sociodemographic inequality has not been characterized. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective municipal an individual-level study using death certificate data in Mexico from 2016-2020. We analyzed mortality related to COVID-19 and to non-COVID-19 causes using ICD-10 codes to identify cause-specific mortality. Excess mortality was estimated as the increase in deaths in 2020 compared to the average of 2016-2019, disaggregated by primary cause of death, death setting (in-hospital and out-of-hospital) and geographical location. We evaluated correlates of non-COVID-19 mortality at the individual level using mixed effects logistic regression and correlates of non-COVID-19 excess mortality in 2020 at the municipal level using negative binomial regression. RESULTS: We identified 1,069,174 deaths in 2020 (833.5 per 100,000 inhabitants), which was 49% higher compared to the 2016-2019 average (557.38 per 100,000 inhabitants). Overall excess mortality (276.11 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants) was attributable in 76.1% to COVID-19; however, non-COVID-19 causes comprised one-fifth of excess deaths. COVID-19 deaths occurred primarily in-hospital, while excess non-COVID-19 deaths decreased in this setting and increased out-of-hospital. Excess non-COVID-19 mortality displayed geographical heterogeneity linked to sociodemographic inequalities with clustering in states in southern Mexico. Municipal-level predictors of non-COVID-19 excess mortality included levels of social security coverage, higher rates of COVID-19 hospitalization, and social marginalization. At the individual level, lower educational attainment, blue collar workers, and lack of medical care assistance were associated with non-COVID-19 mortality during 2020. CONCLUSION: Non-COVID-19 causes of death, largely chronic cardiometabolic conditions, comprised up to one-fifth of excess deaths in Mexico during 2020. Non-COVID-19 excess deaths occurred disproportionately out-of-hospital and were associated with both individual- and municipal-level sociodemographic inequalities. These findings should prompt an urgent call to action to improve healthcare coverage and access to reduce health and sociodemographic inequalities in Mexico to reduce preventable mortality in situations which increase the stress of healthcare systems, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Sociodemographic inequalities and excess non-COVID-19 mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic: A data-driven analysis of 1,069,174 death certificates in Mexico"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 57-year old man with cold symptoms and muscle pain, with elevated blood glucose of 200mg/dL, was prescribed paracetamol (500mg every 6 hours) and naproxen (550mg daily for 5 days) and continued to take 850mg of metformin twice a day for the treatment of 10-year-old type 2 diabetes.

The WSG used primary and secondary data to create a representative workforce model. Pediatric rheumatology supply and demand was projected through 2030 using an integrated data-driven framework to capture a more realistic clinical full-time equivalent (FTE) and produce a better picture of access to care issues in pediatric rheumatology. RESULTS The 2015 pediatric workforce was estimated at 287 FTE (300 providers), while the estimated excess demand was 95 (33%). The projected demand will continue to increase to almost 100% (N=230) by 2030 if no changes occur in succession planning, new graduate entrants into the profession, and other factors associated with the workforce. CONCLUSION This study projects that the pediatric rheumatology workforce gap will continue to worsen significantly from the 2015 baseline, and by 2030 the demand for pediatric rheumatologists will be twice the supply.

We evaluated health and healthcare usage after SARS-CoV-2 infection via surveys and longitudinal electronic medical record (EMR) review within the Military Health System (MHS). Methods We studied MHS beneficiaries enrolled in the Epidemiology, Immunology, and Clinical Characteristics of Emerging Infectious Diseases with Pandemic Potential (EPICC) cohort from March to December 2020. COVID-19 illness symptom severity and duration were derived from surveys initiated in late 2020. In addition, multi-year healthcare encounter history before and after onset of COVID-19 symptoms was collected from the MHS EMR. Odds of organ-system clinical diagnoses within the 3 months pre- and post-symptom onset were calculated using generalized linear models, controlling for age, sex, and race, and including participant as a random effect. Results 1,015 participants were included who were SARS-CoV-2 positive, symptomatic, and had 3-month follow-up data available in the EMR (Table 1). 625 of these participants had survey data collected more than 28 days post-symptom onset, among whom 17% and 6% reported persistent symptoms at 28-84 days, and 85+ days, respectively. 9.6% had not resumed normal activities by one month. The most frequently reported symptoms persisting beyond 28 days were dyspnea, loss of smell and/or taste, fatigue, and exercise intolerance (Figure 1A). When compared with the period 61 to 90 days prior to symptom onset, the first month post-symptom onset period was associated with increases of pulmonary (aOR = 57, 95% CI 28-112), renal (aOR = 29, 95% CI 10-84), cardiovascular (aOR = 7, 95% CI 5-11), and neurological diagnoses (aOR = 3, 95% CI 2-4) (Figures 1B and 1C). Cardiovascular disease diagnoses remained elevated through 3 months (aOR = 2, 95% CI 1-3). Table 1.

The abnormal ICAT expression in mesangial cells under high glucose(HG) contributes to the development of diabetes and its complications such as diabetic nephropathy (DN). METHODS: Human mesangial cells (HMCs) were cultured in either 5.5 (normal control) or 30 (high glucose) mmol/L glucose medium. Overexpression and knock-down of ICAT or ?-catenin were carried out by transient transfection. PPAR?3 transcriptional activity was evaluated by luciferase assay. Protein-protein interactions were tested by Coimmunoprecipitation and GST-pull down assay. Cell phenotype transition of HMCs was detected by the expression level of &#945;-SMA and fibronectin, as well as MTT assay. RESULTS: High ?-catenin protein expression but low ICAT was accompanied by low PPAR?3 transcriptional activity in HMCs cultured in HG. By using bioinformatics prediction, protein-protein and protein-DNA interaction experimental methods, ICAT and ?-catenin were confirmed to act as coactivators in regulating PPAR?3 transcriptional activity. Overexpression of ICAT could mitigate the decrease of PPAR?3 transcriptional activity and partly relieve cell phenotype transition in HMCs. CONCLUSIONS: ?-catenin and ICAT interact as coactivator to modulate PPAR?3 transcriptional activation.

Here we propose a lineage classification system based on the dynamic nomenclature used for SARS-CoV-2, defining a lineage by phylogenetic methods, for tracking virus spread and comparing sequences across geographic areas.

We further show how integration of this tool with a new rabies virus sequence data resource (RABV-GLUE) enables rapid application, for example, highlighting lineage dynamics relevant to control and elimination programmes, such as identifying importations and their sources, and areas of persistence and transmission, including transboundary incursions. This system and the tools developed should be useful for coordinating and targeting control programmes and monitoring progress as we work towards eliminating dog-mediated rabies, as well as having potential for broad application to the surveillance of other viruses. Author Summary The importance of the ability to track the diversity and spread of viruses in a universal way that can be clearly communicated has been highlighted during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. This, accompanied with the increase in the availability and use of pathogen sequence data, means the development of new genomic tools and classification systems can strengthen outbreak response and disease control. Here, we present an easy-to-use objective and transferable classification tool for tracking viruses at high resolution. We use rabies virus, a neglected zoonotic disease that causes around 59,000 human deaths each year, as an example use case of this tool. Applying our tool to a global clade of rabies virus, we find an over 200% increase in the definition at which we can classify the virus, allowing us to identify areas of persistence and transmission that were not previously apparent, and patterns of virus spread. Insights from the application of this tool should prove valuable in targeting vaccination campaigns and improving surveillance as countries work towards the elimination of dog-mediated rabies.","output":"Making Genomic Surveillance Deliver: A Lineage Classification and Nomenclature System to Inform Rabies Elimination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report the field experience of the psychological staff of Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, a local health system conglomerate serving half a million inhabitants within a catchment area of the Emilia Romagna Region of Italy, during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

The most basic of these models consider the total population of a region to be closed. Many incorporate human mobility into their transmission dynamics, usually based on static and aggregated data. However, mobility can change dramatically during a global pandemic as seen with COVID-19, making static data unsuitable. Recently, large mobility datasets derived from mobile devices have been used, along with COVID-19 infections data, to better understand the relationship between mobility and COVID-19. However, studies to date have relied on data that represent only a fraction of their target populations, and the data from mobile devices have been used for measuring mobility within the study region, without considering changes to the population as people enter and leave the region. This work presents a unique case study in Andorra, with comprehensive datasets that include telecoms data covering 100% of mobile subscribers in the country, and results from a serology testing program that more than 90% of the population voluntarily participated in. We use the telecoms data to both measure mobility within the country and to provide a real-time census of people entering, leaving and remaining in the country. We develop multiple SEIR (compartmental) models parameterized on these metrics and show how dynamic population metrics can improve the models. We find that total daily trips did not have predictive value in the SEIR models while country entrances did. As a secondary contribution of this work, we show how Andorra's serology testing program was likely impacted by people leaving the country. Overall, this case study suggests how using mobile phone data to measure dynamic population changes could improve studies that rely on more commonly used mobility metrics and the overall understanding of a pandemic.","output":"Using mobile phone data to estimate dynamic population changes and improve the understanding of a pandemic: A case study in Andorra"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19, the global pandemic, has taught us the importance of contactless delivery service and robotic automation Using self-driving delivery robots can provide flexibility for on-time deliveries and help better protect both driver and customers by minimizing contact To this end, this paper introduces a new vehicle routing problem with time windows and delivery robots (VRPTWDR) With the help of delivery robots, considerable operational time savings can be achieved by dispatching robots to serve nearby customers while a driver is also serving a customer We provide a mathematical model for the VRPTWDR and investigate the challenges and benefits of using delivery robots as assistants for city logistics A two-stage matheurisitic algorithm is developed to solve medium scale VRPTWDR instances Finally, results of computational experiments demonstrate the value of self-driving delivery robots in urban areas by highlighting operational limitations on route planning","output":"The adoption of self-driving delivery robots in last mile logistics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"O mundo sofre com a pandemia da Covid-19.

Each face was randomly presented with six different expressions (angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, neutral, and sad) while being fully visible or partly covered by a face mask. Lower accuracy and lower confidence in ones own assessment of the displayed emotions indicate that emotional reading was strongly irritated by the presence of a mask. We further detected specific confusion patterns, mostly pronounced in the case of misinterpreting disgusted faces as being angry plus assessing many other emotions (e.g., happy, sad, and angry) as neutral.

The authors sought to characterize applicant experiences and perceptions concerning the change in the application, interview, and match process for neurological surgery residency during the 2020-2021 recruitment cycle. METHODS A national survey of neurosurgical residency applicants from the 2020-2021 application cycle was performed. This survey was developed in cooperation with the Society of Neurological Surgeons (SNS) and the American Association of Neurological Surgeons Young Neurosurgeons Committee (YNC) and sent to all applicants (n = 280) who included academic video submissions to the SNS repository as part of their application package. These 280 applicants accounted for 69.6% of the total 402 neurosurgical applicants this year. RESULTS Nearly half of the applicants responded to the survey (44.3%, 124 of 280). Applicants favored additional reform of the interview scheduling process, including a centralized scheduling method, a set of standardized release dates for interview invitations, and interview caps for applicants. Less than 8% of students desired a virtual-only platform in the future, though the majority of applicants supported incorporating virtual interviews as part of the process to contain applicant costs and combining them with traditional in-person interview opportunities. Program culture and fit, as well as clinical and research opportunities in subspecialty areas, were the most important factors applicants used to rank programs. However, subjective program \\"fit\\" was deemed challenging to assess during virtual-only interviews. CONCLUSIONS Neurosurgery resident applicants identified standardized interview invitation release dates, centralized interview scheduling methods, caps on the number of interviews available to each candidate, and regulated opportunities for both virtual and in-person recruitment as measures that could significantly improve the applicant experience during and effectiveness of future neurosurgery residency application cycles. Applicants prioritized program culture and \\"fit\\" during recruitment, and a majority were open to incorporating virtual elements into future cycles to reduce costs while retaining in-person opportunities to gauge programs and their locations.","output":"Applying to residency: survey of neurosurgical residency applicants on virtual recruitment during COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Dental caries is one of the most preventable oral diseases among children in developing countries. This study aims to estimate the prevalence and severity of dental caries in the first permanent molar and analyze the related risk factors among sixth-grade students in S?o Tom Island. METHODS A cross-sectional study with a stratified cluster sampling method was conducted on 1855 sixth-grade school children, mainly aged 11 to 14 years old, from 10 schools in 6 regions of S?o Tom Island, from April 17 to June 27, 2021. Dental caries examination was performed by using the CAST criteria (DMFT) index, and the self-administered questionnaires about family background, oral hygiene, and relevant behaviors were collected. Multivariable logistic regression was used to study risk factors related to dental caries of the first permanent molar, and all data analyses were done using SPSS version 25. RESULTS The prevalence of dental caries in the first permanent molar was 68.79%, without significant difference between gender, age, residence, and whether only child or not. The mean Decayed, Missing, and Filled Teeth (DMFT) index and mean Decayed, Missing, and Filled Surface (DMFS) index were 1.751  1.514 and 3.542  3.941, respectively. The rate of filling teeth was 5.50%, and Pit and Fissure Sealant (PFS) rate was 2.21%. The overall prevalence and DMFT index of dental caries of permanent teeth was 76.01% and 2.753  4.569, respectively. The results of logistic regression analysis indicated that the frequency of candy/chocolate consumption (OR = 1.095) and fair self-assessment of dental health (OR = 1.354) were significantly associated with dental caries (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS The high prevalence of dental caries in the first permanent molar was a public health issue among sixth-grade school children in S?o Tom Island. The prevalence of dental caries, mean DMFT and DMFS scores were higher, while the rate of filling and PFS teeth were lower than the average score of other African countries.

Even with the recent rollout of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines and availability of medicines such as remdesivir, and monoclonal antibodies, host nutritional status is pivotal in the fight against the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and outcomes. The purpose of this review is to discuss the effects of COVID-19-related lockdown on lifestyle behaviors, and the nutritional consequences, and the direct sequelae of the infection on nutrition including potential nutritional interventions. RECENT FINDINGS: The COVID-19-related lockdown imposed radical changes in lifestyle behaviors with considerable short-term and long-term health and nutritional consequences including weight gain and obesity and increased cardiometabolic risk, consistently linked to worsened prognosis. The extent of the impact was dependent on food insecurity, overall stress and disordered eating, physical inactivity, and exposure to COVID-19-related nutrition information sources. COVID-19 could directly induce inflammatory responses and poor nutrient intake and absorption leading to undernutrition with micronutrient deficiencies, which impairs immune system function with subsequent amplified risk of infection and disease severity. Nutrition interventions through nutrition support, dietary supplementation, and home remedies such as use of zinc, selenium, vitamin D, and omega-3 fatty acids showed the most significant promise to mitigate the course of COVID-19 infection and improve survival rates.

It also forecasts the probability of changes in those government policies at each of these future times, which is essential for the longer-range forecasts. We applied SIMLR to data from in Canada and the United States, and show that its mean average percentage error is as good as state-of-the-art forecasting models, with the added advantage of being an interpretable model.

DesignQualitative study SettingData were collected over the first year of the pandemic (February 2019-20), from the five most widely read UK based newspapers by searching the Nexis database using keywords \\"vitamin D\\" and \\"COVID\\". An inductive thematic analysis was carried out on the data to identify themes and subthemes. Quality control of the coding was conducted on a sample of the dataset (20%). Data were also compared to the \\"ground truth\\" identified as the NICE report titled \\"COVID-19 rapid guideline: vitamin D\\" to explore the accuracy of media outputs. ResultsThe four main themes identified were association of vitamin D with COVID-19, politically informed views, vitamin D deficiency and vitamin D sources. When compared to the ground truth, most of the information from newspaper articles relating to the key findings was correct for each of the findings, except for COVID-19 infection. ConclusionsAlthough most of the information included in newspaper articles concerning the relationship of vitamin D with COVID-19 was correct, this study highlighted that there was still a notable amount of incorrect information published. In the context of COVID-19, it is imperative that media outputs are accurate and inform the public and front-line health professionals as correct information is a key factor in disease prevention. Future research should focus on the accuracy of media outputs to further investigate health misinformation as an issue in traditional media and how that may affect public health.

Chronic stress might even induce formation of cytotoxic pathological SGs. SGs participate in various biological functions including response to apoptosis, inflammation, immune modulation, and signalling pathways; moreover, SGs are involved in pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, viral infection, aging, cancers and many other diseases. Emerging evidence has shown that small molecules can affect SG dynamics, including assembly, disassembly, maintenance and clearance. Thus, targeting SGs is a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of human diseases and the promotion of health. The established methods for detecting SGs provided ready tools for large-scale screening of agents that alter the dynamics of SGs. Here, we describe the effects of small molecules on SG assembly, disassembly, and their roles in the disease.

However, there have been limited efforts to discover the size of the gaps in the seal required to compromise filtering facepiece respirator performance, with prior studies estimating this size based on in vitro models. In this study, we measure the size of leak necessary to compromise the fit of N95 respirators. METHODS: Two methods were used to create a gap of specific dimensions. A set of 3D-printed resin spacers and hollow steel rods were used to generate gaps in N95 respirators while worn on 2 participants. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) quantitative fit testing methods were used to quantify mask performance with gaps between 0.4 and 2.9-mm diameters. RESULTS: Gap size was regressed against fit factor, showing that overall, the minimum gap size to compromise N95 performance was between 1.5 mm(2) and 3 mm(2). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest the fit of a N95 respirator is compromised by gaps that may be difficult to visually detect.

Most African countries, even with their less advanced healthcare systems, continue to experience lower COVID-19 mortality rates. This was the case as the pandemic reached its first peak, plateaued, and declined. It is currently rising again in some countries, though not as rapidly as before. This study aimed to determine the predictors of COVID-19 mortality rate. This may help explain why Africa's COVID-19 mortality rate is, ironically, lower than that of more advanced countries with better health systems. This will also assist various governments in balancing their COVID-19 restrictive and socioeconomic measures. METHODOLOGY: This was an analytical review, which used pre-COVID-19 era population data and current COVID-19 mortality figures to determine predictors of COVID-19 mortality rates. Pearson's correlation was used to test the association between some population variables and COVID-19 mortality rates. Next, stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to determine significant predictors of COVID-19 mortality rates. RESULTS: Significant positive predictors of COVID-19 mortality rate included pre-COVID-19 era '65-yr+ mortality %' (R2 = 0.574, B = 2.86, p < 0.001), population mean age (R2 = 0.570, B = 4.77, p = 0.001), and life expectancy (R2 = 0.524, B = 1.67, p = 0.008). Pre-COVID-19 era CVD death rate was a negative predictor of COVID-19 mortality rate (R2 = 0.524, B = -0.584, p = 0.012). CONCLUSION: Africa's lower COVID-19 mortality rate is due to the lower population mean age, lower life expectancy, lower pre-COVID-19 era '65yr+ mortality rate', and smaller pool of people surviving and living with cardiovascular diseases.","output":"Africa's low COVID-19 mortality rate: A paradox?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Covid-19 pandemic has particularly affected older people living in Long-term Care settings.

The aim of this study was to determine the potential mechanism(s) of action of single-use negative pressure wound therapy versus traditional negative pressure wound therapy. Approach: Single-use negative pressure wound therapy and traditional negative pressure wound therapy were applied to an in vivo porcine excisional wound model, following product use guidelines. Macroscopic, histological and biochemical analyses were performed at defined healing time-points to assess multiple aspects of the healing response. Results: Wounds treated with single-use negative pressure displayed greater wound closure and increased re-epithelialisation versus those treated with traditional negative pressure. The resulting granulation tissue was more advanced with fewer neutrophils, reduced inflammatory markers, more mature collagen and no wound filler-associated foreign body reactions. Of note, single-use negative pressure therapy failed to induce wound edge epithelial hyperproliferation, while traditional negative pressure therapy compromised peri-wound skin, which remained inflamed with high transepidermal water loss; features not observed following single-use treatment. Innovation: Single-use negative pressure was identified to improve multiple aspects of healing versus traditional negative pressure treatment.

Government response measures for disadvantaged groups against infectious disease should be prioritized based on evidence and affordability. We investigated whether COVID-19 infection, intensive care unit (ICU) care, and mortality from COVID-19 are related to social and medical vulnerability, including tuberculosis (TB). Patients and Methods: Using the National Health Insurance Service COVID-19 database in South Korea, we analyzed 129,128 patients, including controls, from 1 January to 30 May 2020, during the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic. The relationship between health insurance premiums (representing socioeconomic status), the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) score for the severity of the underlying disease, and additional TB diagnosis was analyzed using the chi-square test and logistic regression. Results: For the demographics, 3244 out of 51,783 men (6.3%) and 4836 out of 77,345 women (6.3%) were infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 infection, ICU care, and mortality were related to older age (p < 0.001) and lower health insurance premium levels (p < 0.05). Regarding the CCI score, the CCI score, COVID-19 infection, and mortality increased (p < 0.0001). In terms of premium level, the highest group showed a lower risk of infection (OR 0.52, 0.48-0.57, p = 0.004), ICU care (OR 0.59, 0.46-0.75, p < 0.001), and mortality (OR 0.51, 0.32-0.78, p = 0.016) than the medical aid group.

Despite knowing about the benefits, it has been reported that 71% of patients refuse insulin and the adherence rate ranges from 30 to 80%. PatientCprovider relationship (PPR) may affect such insulin-related behaviours, but little is known about which aspect of PPR affects this. This study aimed to explore the key aspect of the patientCprovider relationship that affects the initial insulin acceptance and continued adherence. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used the grounded theory approach in this qualitative research. The study was conducted at two primary care clinics between September 2019 and January 2021. Patients with T2DM on basal or premixed insulin were recruited using maximum variation sampling. Data were collected using semi-structured in-depth interviews and transcribed verbatim for analysis using constant comparison and synthesis. RESULTS: Twenty-one participants with different levels of diabetes control and adherence were recruited. Four themes that emerged were 1) patientCprovider interaction, 2) addressing the psychological fears, 3) gaining confidence in handling insulin equipment and 4) follow-up after insulin initiation. Among the subthemes, trust in doctors, providers communication skills, patient-centred decision-making and continuity of care positively influenced insulin acceptance and adherence. Conversely, fear of being judged by the provider hindered open communication around non-adherence. Various aspects of interaction with nurses helped in alleviating patients fear of injection and gaining confidence with the insulin equipment. CONCLUSION: Many aspects of PPR affect insulin acceptance and adherence. Among these, gaining patients trust, effective patientCprovider communication, patient-centred decision-making, and ensuring continuity of care improve both insulin acceptance and treatment adherence. Various interactions with nurses help in addressing fears surrounding injection and gaining acceptance towards insulin therapy. Patients fear of being blamed or judged by the provider negatively affects open communication around non-adherence.","output":"Which Aspect of PatientCProvider Relationship Affects Acceptance and Adherence of Insulin Therapy in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus?

What are the challenges of the near-zero interest and inflation rates for monetary policy? What can the policymakers learn from the latest developments in the monetary and interest rate theory? This paper aims to answer these questions by reviewing both basic principles of interest rate determination and recent academic and policy debates.Design/methodology/approachThe paper critically reviews the explanations for the downward trend of real interest rates in recent decades and monetary policy options in a near-zero interest rate environment.FindingsThe decline of real interest rates is likely an outcome of multiple technological, social and economic factors including diminished productivity growth, changing demographics, elevated tail-risk concerns, time-varying convenience yields of safe assets, increased global demand for safe assets, rising wealth and income inequality, falling relative price of capital, accommodative monetary policies, and changes in industry structure that alter the investment and saving behaviors of the corporate sector. The near-zero interest rate limits the space of central banks' response to economic crises. It also challenges some conventional wisdoms of monetary theory and sparks radically new ideas about monetary policy.Originality/valueThis survey differs from the existing work by taking a broader view of both economics and finance literature. It critically assesses the economic forces driving the global decline of real interest rates through the lens of basic principles and empirical evidence and discusses the merits and limitations of each proposed explanation. The study emphasizes the importance of a better understanding of economic forces driving diverging trends of corporate investment and saving behaviors. It also discusses the implications of the neo-Fisherism and the fiscal theory of price level for monetary policy in a low interest rate environment.","output":"The causes and challenges of low interest rates: insights from basic principles and recent literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The one airway, one disease hypothesis proposes that the upper and lower airways share the same physiology and histomorphology. Epidemiological clinical studies support a link between rhinosinusitis and asthma. The relationship can occur in both directions, with nasal allergen challenge leading to inflammatory changes in the lower airway and bronchoprovocation studies of the lower airway leading to inflammatory changes in the upper airway. In addition, both similarities and differences exist in the pathogenesis of nasal polyps and asthma. The mechanism for the connection between the upper and lower airways is a matter of great debate. It has been proposed that inflammatory changes in the lower airway may lead to systemic inflammatory effects that play a role in increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Similarly, lower airway inflammatory changes may affect nasal airway patency via systemic effects. Moreover, nasopharyngeal-bronchial reflexes may play a non-immunologic role in the interaction between the lower and upper airways. An example of the connection between the upper and lower airways is found in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease whereby leukotrienes play a role in the pathology of chronic rhinosinusitis with polyps and asthma.

The peak of the epidemics has not yet been reached and it is expected to be delayed in Central and Southern Italian regions compared to Northern ones. Objective: We have modeled the Covid-19 outbreak progression in Italian Regions vs. Lombardy to assess the epidemics. Primary and Secondary Measures: In our models, we have estimated the basic reproduction number (R0) which represents the average number of people that can be infected by a person who has already acquired the infection both by fitting the exponential growth rate of the infection across a 1month period and also by using day by day assessment, based on single observations. We used the susceptible exposed infected removed (SEIR) compartment model to predict the spreading of the pandemic in Italy. Results. The two methods provide agreements of values, although the first method based on exponential fit should provide a better estimation, being computed on the entire time series. Taking into account the growth rate of the infection across a 1-month period, in Lombardy each infected person has involved other 5 people (4.94 based on data of March 22nd) compared to a value of R0=2.68 reported in the Chinese city of Whuan. According to our model and Piedmont, Veneto, Emilia Romagna, Tuscany and Marche reach an R0 value up to 4. The R0 is 3.7 for Lazio and 3.6 for Campania region, where this latter shows the highest value among the Southern Italian regions, followed by Apulia (3.5), Sicily (3.4), Abruzzo (3.4), Calabria (3.1), Basilicata (2.5) and Molise (2.4).

However, the high similarity between Y. pestis and its sister species within the same genus makes detection work problematic. Here, the genome sequence from the Y. pestis CO92 strain was electronically separated into millions of fragments. These fragments were analyzed and compared with the genome sequences of 539 Y. pestis strains and 572 strains of 20 species within the Yersinia genus. Altogether, 97 Y. pestis-specific tags containing two or more single nucleotide polymorphism sites were screened out. These 97 tags efficiently distinguished Y. pestis from all other closely related species. We chose four of these tags to design a Cas12a-based detection system. PCRCfluorescence methodology was used to test the specificity of these tags, and the results showed that the fluorescence intensity produced by Y. pestis was significantly higher than that of non-Y. pestis (p < 0.0001).

METHODS: A university mandate, due to severe SARS-CoV-2, was issued requiring didactic courses to transition to remote learning in spring 2020. The third-year internal medicine elective had six remaining weekly OSCEs, accounting for 55% of course grades. Full credit was awarded for the first OSCE as students familiarized themselves with the new virtual format. The primary outcome was the overall average OSCE performance for the course's remaining five virtual simulations compared to the traditional in-person offering in 2019. Secondary outcomes included individual OSCE performance, OSCE performance with inclusion of the first OSCE, and overall course grades. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in overall average OSCE performance between 2019 and 2020 cohorts for the five simulations (82.7% vs. 86.8%, P = .20). Secondary outcomes showed statistically significant differences favoring performance in the 2020 cohort for infectious diseases (78.3% vs. 89.4%, P < .001) and anticoagulation (74.4% vs. 90%, P = .002), while cardiology favored the 2019 cohort (91.1% vs. 82.8%, P = .03).

Specifically, the developed system performs face mask detection, face-hand interaction detection, and measures social distance. For these purposes, we collected and annotated images that represent face mask usage and face-hand interaction in the real world.

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends a 30 mL/kg fluid bolus in these patients, but recent studies suggest an association between large volume crystalloid resuscitation and increased mortality. The optimal amount of pre-operative fluid resuscitation prior to source control in patients with intra-abdominal sepsis is unknown. This study aims to determine if increasing volume of resuscitation prior to surgical source control is associated with worsening outcomes. METHODS: We conducted an 8-year retrospective chart review of EGS patients undergoing surgery for abdominal sepsis within 24 h of admission. Patients in hemorrhagic shock and those with outside hospital index surgeries were excluded. We grouped patients by increasing pre-operative resuscitation volume in 10 ml/kg intervals up to > 70 ml/kg and later grouped them into < 30 ml/kg or  30 ml/kg. A relative risk regression model compared amounts of fluid administration. Mortality was the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcomes were time to operation, ventilator days, and length of stay (LOS). Groups were compared by quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) and SOFA scoring systems. RESULTS: Of the 301 patients included, the mean age was 55, 51% were male, 257 (85%) survived to discharge. With increasing fluid per kg (< 10 to < 70 ml/kg), there was an increasing mortality per decile, 8.8% versus 31.6% (p = 0.004). Patients who received < 30 mL/kg had lower mortality (11.3 vs 21%) than those who received > 30 ml/kg (p = 0.02). These groups had median qSOFA scores (1.0 vs. 1.0, p = 0.06). There were no differences in time to operation (6.1 vs 4.9 h p = 0.11), ventilator days (1 vs 3, p = 0.08), or hospital LOS (8 vs 9 days, p = 0.57). Relative risk regression correcting for age and physiologic factors showed no significant differences in mortality between the fluid groups. CONCLUSIONS: Greater pre-operative resuscitation volumes were initially associated with significantly higher mortality, despite similar organ failure scores. However, fluid volumes were not associated with mortality following adjustment for other physiologic factors in a regression model. The amount of pre-operative volume resuscitation was not associated with differences in time to operation, ventilator days, ICU or hospital LOS.","output":"Pre-operative fluid resuscitation in the emergency general surgery septic patient: does it really matter?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article describes the first reported case of trans-conjunctival Preserflo? microshunt erosion after revision surgery augmented with MMC.

This is the question that has occupied ophthalmologists since the beginning of the outbreak. In order to infect a certain type of tissue specific receptors for each virus and sometimes also coreceptors or other proteins must be present. The aim of this review was to summarize and reflect the current state of research with the help of the currently available literature as of 28 May 2020. At the time of the research, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was clearly identified as the receptor and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) as the necessary protease to enable the infection of human cells with SARS-CoV-2. In the eye both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed, although sometimes very weakly and with varying degrees in different tissues. It is noteworthy that very different results were obtained with different methods. Several reasons can account for this effect: Firstly, the method of detection or preservation of the tissue, secondly, the possibly different expression of the tested tissue samples and thirdly, a possibly rapid loss of receptor expression post-mortem. Therefore, an infection of the eye seems possible, which has already been reported in various publications. The amount of virus or receptor expression necessary to cause an infection is not known. According to current state of knowledge the eye is not considered to be a high-risk tissue due to the low ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression. Nevertheless, appropriate protective measures are necessary for both medical personnel and patients.

Analysis of the motor units revealed that Sam68 ablation impairs the establishment of neuromuscular junctions and causes progressive loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord. Importantly, alterations of neuromuscular junction morphology and properties in Sam68 -/- mice correlate with defects in muscle and motor unit integrity. Sam68 -/- muscles display defects in postnatal development, with manifest signs of atrophy. Furthermore, fast-twitch muscles in Sam68 -/- mice show structural features typical of slow-twitch muscles, suggesting alterations in the metabolic and functional properties of myofibers.

Consequently, these were compared to the medical records of 2018 and 2019 from the same time period and from other control periods (JanuaryCFebruary 2019 and 2020, and JulyCAugust 2018 and 2019). The total number of ED visits declined by 73% from 2019 to 2020 (3051 vs 818).

Increasingly, tall buildings (TB) are common features of the urban landscape, yet their impact on urban air flow and dispersion is not well understood, and their effects are not appropriately captured in parameterisation schemes. Here, hardware models of areas within two global mega-cities (London and Beijing) are used to analyse the impact of TB on flow and transport in isolated and cluster settings. Results show that TB generate strong updrafts and downdrafts that affect street-level flow fields. Velocity differences do not decay monotonically with distance from the TB, especially in the near-wake region where the flow is characterised by recirculating winds and jets. Lateral distance from an isolated TB centreline is crucial, and flow is still strongly impacted at longitudinal distances of several TB heights. Evaluation of a wake-flow scheme (ADMS-Build) in the isolated TB case indicates important characteristics are not captured. There is better agreement for a slender, shorter TB than a taller non-cuboidal TB. Better prediction of flow occurs horizontally further away and vertically further from the surface. TB clusters modify the shape of pollutant plumes. Strong updrafts generated by the overlapping wakes of TB clusters lift pollutants out of the canopy, causing a much deeper tracer plume in the lee of the cluster, and an elevated plume centreline with maximum concentrations around the TB mean height. Enhanced vertical spread of the pollutants in the near-wake of the cluster results in overall lower maximum concentrations, but higher concentrations above the mean TB height. These results have important implications for interpreting observations in areas with TB. Using real world ceilometer observations in two mega-cities (Beijing and Paris), we assess the diurnal seasonal variability of the urban boundary layer and evaluate a mixed layer height (MLH) empirical model with parameters derived from a third mega-city (London). The MLH model works well in central Beijing but less well in suburban Paris.

Victim-survivors were less likely to have contacted police following the most recent incident if the time spent at home with their partner had increased. They were also more likely to say they were unable to safely seek advice or support on at least one occasion. Police were more likely to be contacted by the victim-survivor if they or their partner had lost their job or taken a pay cut, but there was no relationship with changes in financial stress.

To improve system integration and outcomes for patients, in 2017/2018 Alberta Health Services (largest health services delivery organization in Canada) called for a coordinated approach to improve transitions in care (TiC). Healthcare leadership responded by initiating the development of a province-wide guideline outlining core components of effective transitions in care. This case study highlights the extensive design process used to develop this guideline, with a focus on the participatory design (PD) approach used throughout. METHODS: An iterative, mixed methods PD approach was used to engage over 750 stakeholders through the following activities to establish Guideline content: i) learning collaborative; ii) design-team; iii) targeted online surveys; iv) primary care stakeholder consultation; v) modified Delphi panel; and vi) patient advisory committee. RESULTS: The result was Albertas first guideline for supporting patients through TiC: Albertas Home to Hospital to Home Transitions Guideline.

It has also meant the closure of some public medical services such as reproductive care. This situation may have impacted the health-related behaviour and quality of life of women with fertility problems. Objective: The objective of this study was to analyse the effects of confinement and the suspension of reproductive medical care on the lifestyle (diet, physical exercise, and smoking habits), anxiety and depression, and quality of life of infertile women by comparing their pre- and post-confinement situations. Methods: We carried out a cross-sectional, internet-based study. Information was collected on these women's adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MEDAS questionnaire), physical exercise (IPAQ-SF), anxiety and depression (HADS), and quality of life related to fertility (FertiQol) before, during, and after confinement. The survey was conducted between 1 September and 28 October 2020. Results: A total of 85 women participated. There had been a significant increase in anxiety and depression levels (P < 0.001) and an increase in tobacco consumption among female smokers during confinement vs. pre-confinement (62.5% had increased their consumption). The participants had also increased the mean number of hours they spent sitting (P < 0.001). There had also been an increase in vigorous and moderate exercise levels by 40 and 30%, respectively (P = 0.004). However, no differences were observed in these patients' eating habits as a result of confinement (P = 0.416). When the reproduction service was resumed, the participants showed higher anxiety level scores (P = 0.001) with respect to the pre-confinement situation as well as lower mean FertiQol scale score (P = 0.008). Conclusions: Confinement had increased anxiety and depression levels among these infertile women as well as tobacco use among the participants who were smokers. The prolonged closure of reproductive care units decreased the quality of life of the participants of this study.

METHOD An Alexis wound retractor was placed through the umbilical incision, and a pair of sterile surgical gloves was then snapped onto it. Standard laparoscopic trocars were inserted through the gloves after the upper half parts of the gloves were truncated. Using this port and Roticulator articulating instruments, we performed 14 urologic LESS procedures on porcine laboratory and cadaveric cases, and we performed 10 transabdominal pre-peritoneal inguinal hernia repairs (TAPP), and 5 laparoscopic varicocelectomies on human cases, respectively.

Upon signal peptide removal, the resulting 55-residue isoform, proapelin/apelin-55, can be further processed to 36-, 17-, or 13-residue isoforms with length-dependent pharmacological properties. Processing was initially proposed to occur intracellularly. However, detection of apelin-55 in extracellular fluids indicates that extracellular processing may also occur. To test for this, apelin-55 was applied exogenously to HEK293A cells overexpressing proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 3 (PCSK3), the only apelin processing enzyme identified thus far, and to differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which endogenously express apelin, PCSK3 and other proprotein convertases. Analysis of culture media constituents from each cell type by high performance liquid chromatographyCmass spectrometry and western blot demonstrated a time-dependent decrease in apelin-55 levels. This decrease was partially, but not fully, attenuated by PCSK inhibitor treatment in both cell lines.

Viral maturation requires a main protease (3CL(pro)) to cleave the virus-encoded polyproteins. We report here that the 3CL(pro) containing additional N- and/or C-terminal segments of the polyprotein sequences undergoes autoprocessing and yields the mature protease in vitro. The dimeric three-dimensional structure of the C145A mutant protease shows that the active site of one protomer binds with the C-terminal six amino acids of the protomer from another asymmetric unit, mimicking the product-bound form and suggesting a possible mechanism for maturation. The P1 pocket of the active site binds the Gln side chain specifically, and the P2 and P4 sites are clustered together to accommodate large hydrophobic side chains. The tagged C145A mutant protein served as a substrate for the wild-type protease, and the N terminus was first digested (55-fold faster) at the Gln(-1)-Ser(1) site followed by the C-terminal cleavage at the Gln(306)-Gly(307) site. Analytical ultracentrifuge of the quaternary structures of the tagged and mature proteases reveals the remarkably tighter dimer formation for the mature enzyme (K(d) = 0.35 nm) than for the mutant (C145A) containing 10 extra N-terminal (K(d) = 17.2 nm) or C-terminal amino acids (K(d) = 5.6 nm). The data indicate that immature 3CL(pro) can form dimer enabling it to undergo autoprocessing to yield the mature enzyme, which further serves as a seed for facilitated maturation.

Here we report the rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies by high-throughput single-cell RNA and VDJ sequencing of antigen-enriched B cells from 60 convalescent patients. From 8,558 antigen-binding IgG1+ clonotypes, 14 potent neutralizing antibodies were identified with the most potent one, BD-368-2, exhibiting an IC50 of 1.2 ng/mL and 15 ng/mL against pseudotyped and authentic SARS-CoV-2, respectively. BD-368-2 also displayed strong therapeutic and prophylactic efficacy in SARS-CoV-2-infected hACE2-transgenic mice. Additionally, the 3.8? Cryo-EM structure of a neutralizing antibody in complex with the spike-ectodomain trimer revealed the antibodys epitope overlaps with the ACE2 binding site. Moreover, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies could be directly selected based on similarities of their predicted CDR3H structures to those of SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies. Altogether, we showed that human neutralizing antibodies could be efficiently discovered by high-throughput single B-cell sequencing in response to pandemic infectious diseases.","output":"Potent neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 identified by high-throughput single-cell sequencing of convalescent patients B cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The virus-specific RNAs in feline calicivirus (FCV) infected cells were examined to determine the number and forms of RNAs that are synthesized during the infection process. Northern blots of poly(A)+ RNA from 5-h infected cells probed with a cDNA clone derived from the 3' end of the FCV genome (pCV3) revealed four FCV-specific RNAs that were approximately 8.2 (genomic RNA), 4.8, 4.2 and 2.4 kb in length. Northern blots of poly(A)+ RNA purified from infected cells hourly after infection and probed with pCV3 demonstrated that transcription of all FCV-specific RNAs are detectable at 2 to 3 h post-infection (PI) and that these RNAs reached steady state levels at approximately 4 h PI. The levels of the FCV RNAs then remained relatively constant through 7 h PI, the last time tested, with the exception of the 4.8 and 4.2 kb transcripts which showed a marked increase between 6 and 7 hours PI. Northern blots of dsRNA which had been LiCl-fractionated from pooled total cellular RNA isolated from 5-h and 7-h FCV infected cells, showed two double-stranded RNAs corresponding to the 8.2 kb genomic RNA and the 2.4 kb subgenomic RNA. Preliminary mapping by Northern blotting using cDNA probes derived from varying locations within the FCV genome was done to determine the approximate regions from which the subgenomic RNAs are derived.

However, to the best of our knowledge, this has not been examined among minorities in Israel during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study, therefore, explores stress among the Arab minority in Israel during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak, and its association with the population's perceived COVID-19 threat, trust in the healthcare system, adherence to preventative guidelines, and perceived discrimination.The study analyzed a cross-sectional online survey of 626 Israeli Arabs. Most participants (65%) reported moderate levels of stress, and 10% reported severe levels. The Bedouin population reported significantly higher levels of stress compared to other minority groups. The participants also reported a high degree of perceived threat, a moderate-to-high level of discrimination, a moderate level of trust in the healthcare system, and very high adherence to guidelines.Hierarchical regression analysis showed that age, religion, trust in the healthcare system, perceived threat, and adherence to guidelines were all significant predictors of stress [F(11,600), p < .001]. The model explained 24% of the variance in stress. Structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed that the participants' perceived threat and trust mediated the association between their perceived discrimination and stress [indirect effect = 0.13, SE = 0.03 CI = (0.08, 0.18)], whereby discrimination was negatively associated with trust (? = -0.52), which, in turn, was negatively associated with stress (? = -0.10). Furthermore, discrimination was positively associated with perceived threat (? = 0.21), which, in turn, was positively associated with stress (? = 0.35). Discrimination is an important social determinant of health - especially during health emergencies when trust in healthcare systems and perceived threats are crucial. As such, our findings could assist policymakers in developing fair policies that are tailored to various population groups and that may reduce stress levels among minorities, thereby improving both their mental and physical health.","output":"Stress and perceived discrimination among the Arab population in Israel: the mediation role of the perceived COVID-19 threat and trust in the healthcare system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health maintenance and disease prevention strategies become increasingly prioritized with increasing health and economic burden of chronic, lifestyle-related diseases. A key element in these strategies is the empowerment of individuals to control their health. Self-measurement plays an essential role in achieving such empowerment. Digital measurements have the advantage of being measured non-invasively, passively, continuously, and in a real-world context. An important question is whether such measurement can sensitively measure subtle disbalances in the progression toward disease, as well as the subtle effects of, for example, nutritional improvement. The concept of resilience biomarkers, defined as the dynamic evaluation of the biological response to an external challenge, has been identified as a viable strategy to measure these subtle effects. In this review, we explore the potential of integrating this concept with digital physiological measurements to come to digital resilience biomarkers. Additionally, we discuss the potential of wearable, non-invasive, and continuous measurement of molecular biomarkers. These types of innovative measurements may, in the future, also serve as a digital resilience biomarker to provide even more insight into the personal biological dynamics of an individual. Altogether, digital resilience biomarkers are envisioned to allow for the measurement of subtle effects of health maintenance and disease prevention strategies in a real-world context and thereby give personalized feedback to improve health.","output":"Digital Resilience Biomarkers for Personalized Health Maintenance and Disease Prevention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a global pandemic Although the main clinical manifestations of the COVID-19 infection are confined to the respiratory system, there is evidence suggesting the COVID-19 potential to develop central nervous system complications As there are limited reports of encephalitis associated with COVID-19 in the literature, in this systematic review, we will discuss the characteristics of encephalitis in patients with COVID-19 Material and methods PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane all from December 1, 2019, to May 25, 2020, were searched for related published articles The keywords (in the title/abstract) COVID-19 OR novel Coronavirus OR SARS-CoV-2 AND encephalitis OR meningoencephalitis OR encephalopathy OR neurological complications were used We included all the case reports, case series, and letters to the editors Outcomes Through the search strategy, we identified nine related articles about encephalitis associated with COV-ID-19 Based on our results, although encephalitis is mainly presented in patients with severe COVID-19, it could occur in patients without respiratory symptoms and it might precede the typical features of COVID-19 Additionally, we did not find any exclusive age group or comorbidities predisposed the patients to encephalitis development Conclusion An increasing number of reports of COVID-19 patients with encephalitis raises the concern that SARS-CoV-2 is a neuropathogen that could target the brain regardless of respiratory symptoms","output":"Encephalitis as a rare manifestation of novel covid-19 disease, a para-infection or post-infection complication: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chromatin conformation regulates gene expression and thus constant remodeling of chromatin structure is essential to guarantee proper cell function.

The time-varying instantaneous reproductive number is useful for monitoring the real time dynamics of a disease to inform policy making for disease control. Local estimation of this metric, for instance at a county or city level, allows for more targeted interventions to curb transmission. However, simultaneous estimation of local reproductive numbers must account for potential sources of heterogeneity in these time-varying quantities - a key element of which is human mobility. We develop a statistical method that incorporates human mobility between multiple regions for estimating region-specific instantaneous reproductive numbers. The model also can account for exogenous cases imported from outside of the regions of interest. We propose two approaches to estimate the reproductive numbers, with mobility data used to adjust incidence in the first approach and to inform a formal priori distribution in the second (Bayesian) approach. Through a simulation study, we show that region-specific reproductive numbers can be well estimated if human mobility is reasonably well approximated by available data. We use this approach to estimate the instantaneous reproductive numbers of COVID-19 for 14 counties in Massachusetts using CDC case report data and the human mobility data collected by SafeGraph. We found that, accounting for mobility, our method produces estimates of reproductive numbers that are distinct across counties. In contrast, independent estimation of county-level reproductive numbers tends to produce similar values, as trends in county case-counts for the state are fairly concordant. These approaches can also be used to estimate any heterogeneity in transmission, for instance, age-dependent instantaneous reproductive number estimates. As people are more mobile and interact frequently in ways that permit transmission, it is important to account for this in the estimation of the reproductive number. Author summaryTo control the spreading of an infectious disease, it is very important to understand the real-time infectiousness of the pathogen that causes the disease. An existing metric called instantaneous reproductive number is often used to quantify the average number of secondary cases generated by individuals who are infectious at a certain time point, assuming no changes to current conditions. In practice, we might be interested in using the metric to describe the infectiousness in multiple regions. However, this is challenging when there are visitors traveling between these regions, since this could lead to a misclassification of where an individual is actually infected and create biased estimates for the instantaneous reproductive numbers. We developed a method that takes account of human mobility to estimate the instantaneous reproductive numbers for multiple regions simultaneously, which could reveal the heterogeneity of the metric. This method aims to provide helpful information on region-specific infectiousness for disease control measures that focus on the region with higher pathogen infectiousness. This approach is also applicable for estimating the reproductive number in the presence of other sources of heterogeneity, including by age.","output":"Estimation of heterogeneous instantaneous reproduction numbers with application to characterize SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Massachusetts counties"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Prothrombin Complex Concentrates (PCC) are prescribed for emergent warfarin reversal (EWR). The comparative effectiveness and safety among PCC products are not fully understood. METHODS Patients in an academic level one trauma center who received PCC3 or PCC4 for EWR were identified. Patient characteristics, PCC dose and time of dose, pre- and post-INR and time of measurement, fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K doses, and patient outcomes were collected. Patients whose pre-PCC International Normalized Ratio (INR) was > 6 h before PCC dose or the pre-post PCC INR was > 12 h were excluded. The primary outcome was achieving an INR  1.5 post PCC. Secondary outcomes were the change in INR over time, post PCC INR, thromboembolic events (TE), and death during hospital stay. Logistic regression modelled the primary outcome with and without a propensity score adjustment accounting for age, sex, actual body weight, dose, initial INR value, and time between INR measurements. Data are reported as median (IQR) or n (%) with p < 0.05 considered significant. RESULTS Eighty patients were included (PCC3 = 57, PCC4 = 23). More PCC4 patients achieved goal INR (87.0% vs. 31.6%, odds ratio (OR) = 14.4, 95% CI: 3.80-54.93, p < 0.001). This result remained true after adjusting for possible confounders (AOR = 10.7, 95% CI: 2.17-51.24, p < 0.001). The post-PCC INR was lower in the PCC4 group (1.3 (1.3-1.5) vs. 1.7 (1.5-2.0)).

From 1998 to 2018, more than 630 cases of NiV human infections were reported. NiV is transmitted by zoonotic (from bats to humans, or from bats to pigs, and then to humans) as well as human-to-human routes. Deforestation and urbanization of some areas have contributed to greater overlap between human and bat habitats resulting in NiV outbreaks. Common symptoms of NiV infection in humans are similar to that of influenza such as fever and muscle pain and in some cases, the inflammation of the brain occurs leading to encephalitis.

Medical physicists (MPs) are key healthcare professionals in maintaining safe and effective RT. This study reports on MPs experience during the first pandemic peak and explores the consequences on their work. METHODS: A 39-question survey on changes in departmental and clinical practice and on the impact for the future was sent to the global MP community. A total of 433 responses were analysed by professional role and by country clustered on the daily infection numbers. RESULTS: The impact of COVID-19 was bigger in countries with high daily infection rate. The majority of MPs worked in alternation at home/on-site. Among practice changes, implementation and/or increased use of hypofractionation was the most common (47% of the respondents). Sixteen percent of respondents modified patient-specific quality assurance (QA), 21% reduced machine QA, and 25% moved machine QA to weekends/evenings. The perception of trust in leadership and team unity was reversed between management MPs (towards increased trust and unity) and clinical MPs (towards a decrease). Changes such as home-working and increased use of hypofractionation were welcomed. However, some MPs were concerned about pressure to keep negative changes (e.g. weekend work). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 affected MPs through changes in practice and QA procedures but also in terms of trust in leadership and team unity.

We aimed to determine whether, despite this, a decline in acute stroke presentations, imaging and intervention occurred during the pandemic at a busy stroke centre. METHODS: The number of 'code stroke' activations, multimodal CTs and endovascular clot retrievals (ECRs) performed during the pandemic period (3/1/2020-5/10/2020) at a large comprehensive stroke centre was compared against the pre-pandemic period (3/1/2019-1/31/2019) using Z-statistics. Year-on-year comparison of the number of patients with large vessel occlusions (LVOs) and ECRs performed per month was also made. RESULTS: The number of 'code stroke' activations and patients undergoing multimodal CT per month decreased significantly (P < 0.0025) following lockdown on 29th March. The number of ECRs also decreased (P = 0.165). The nadir in the weekly number of CTs coincided with lockdown and the peak of new COVID-19 cases. The number of patients with LVOs and ECRs increased by 15% and 14%, respectively, in March but decreased by 55% and 48%, respectively, in April. CONCLUSIONS: The significant decrease in volume of 'code stroke' activations and acute stroke imaging following lockdown was accompanied by a concomitant decrease in patients with LVOs and ECRs. The decrease in imaging was therefore not driven purely by patients with mild strokes and stroke mimics, but also included those with severe strokes. Since Australia had a low prevalence of COVID-19, this observed decrease cannot be attributed to hospital congestion and is instead likely driven by patient fear.","output":"Where have our patients gone?

However, there is still little experience with this technique for the treatment of colorectal cancer. METHODS Sixty-eight patients with SILS resections for colon (n = 25) or rectal cancer (n = 43) were compared to a group of conventionally operated patients who were matched for surgical procedure, tumor stage and tumor location, and the use of preoperative radiochemotherapy. RESULTS Both groups were comparable for lymph node harvest, specimen length, and the duration of surgery. No significant differences were observed for the number of positive circumferential resection margins, or the distance of the tumor to both the aboral or lateral resection margin, but two positive resection margins were only present after SILS and not after conventional surgery. Hospitalization tended to be shorter after SILS (p = 0.097). Overall, morbidity was equivalent between the two groups, with a difference for colon cancer where it was significantly lower after SILS as compared to open surgery (p = 0.025) mainly due to a lower rate of wound complications. CONCLUSION SILS might be an acceptable alternative to open surgery for the treatment of colon cancer. For rectal cancer, no apparent benefit could be documented.

Both BA and SC interventions were manualized, consisting of eight individual sessions plus a follow-up. RESULTS: 116 participants entered counseling, including 87 assigned to BA and 29 to SC. Of these, 79 completed counseling or found a job by session eight. By follow-up, 51%of BA versus 41%of SC participants had found jobs, a non-significant difference either clinically or statistically. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple issues contributed to difficulty in employment, including gaps in resumes, loss of contact with former colleagues, and uncertainty about career direction. Ongoing barriers included substance use, housing instability, ambivalence about forfeiting government benefits, as well as inadequately treated depression. Success in employment for about half of participants is, in this context, a reasonable outcome.","output":"Comparison of counseling methods to promote employment for HIV+ ADULTS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background While the leading symptoms during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are acute and the majority of patients fully recover, a significant fraction of patients now increasingly experience long-term health consequences However, most data available focus on health-related events after severe infection and hospitalisation We present a longitudinal, prospective analysis of health consequences in patients who initially presented with no or minor symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection Hence, we focus on mild COVID-19 in non-hospitalised patients Methods 958 Patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were observed from April 6th to December 2nd 2020 for long-term symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies We identified anosmia, ageusia, fatigue or shortness of breath as most common, persisting symptoms at month 4 and 7 and summarised presence of such long-term health consequences as post-COVID syndrome (PCS) Predictors of long-term symptoms were assessed using an uni- and multivariable logistic regression model Findings We observed 442 and 353 patients over four and seven months after symptom onset, respectively Four months post SARS-CoV-2 infection, 8?6% (38/442) of patients presented with shortness of breath, 12?4% (55/442) with anosmia, 11?1% (49/442) with ageusia and 9?7% (43/442) with fatigue At least one of these characteristic symptoms was present in 27?8% (123/442) and 34?8% (123/353) at month 4 and 7 post-infection, respectively A lower baseline level of SARS-CoV-2 IgG, anosmia and diarrhoea during acute COVID-19 were associated with higher risk to develop long-term symptoms Interpretation The on-going presence of either shortness of breath, anosmia, ageusia or fatigue as long-lasting symptoms even in non-hospitalised patients was observed at four and seven months post-infection and summarised as post-COVID syndrome (PCS) The continued assessment of patients with PCS will become a major task to define and mitigate the socioeconomic and medical long-term effects of COVID-19 Funding COVIM:?NaFoUniMedCovid19(FKZ: 01KX2021)","output":"Post-COVID syndrome in non-hospitalised patients with COVID-19: a longitudinal prospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Child maltreatment and consequently child protection are highly relevant and current issues in our society. Medical institutions are widely regarded as places of healing, care and support. But they also hold risk factors to promote child maltreatment. Efforts have to be taken in order to offer help to victims by medical institutions and to reduce risk factors for child maltreatment. Therefore, health professionals in the field of child protection must be trained and sensitized for these two purposes. The Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry / Psychotherapy at the University Hospital of Ulm in Germany is developing E-Learning courses directed to health professionals in order to create flexible advanced training courses for dealing with child abuse, and to increase competences in child protection. Due to their specific role in (institutional) child protection, three courses and their evaluation will be presented in this article. The aim of the studies is to examine if those online-courses are increasing knowledge and skills in child protection and how satisfied participants are with course quality. METHODS: Randomised Controlled Trials (RCT) were conducted with one wait-list control group and one group participating in the course (= intervention group). The RCTs took place from October 2016 to March 2017 for two courses, and from May 2017 to September 2017 for the other course. Data were analysed with mixed design ANOVA. For evaluation of user satisfaction, descriptive statistics are reported. RESULTS: For all three courses, knowledge and practical capacities on the topic of the intervention group raised significantly in comparison to the values of the control group. Furthermore, participants of the course for managers felt better prepared to meet their responsibilities in regard to institutional child protection and came up with ideas on how to implement safeguarding standards in their institution. Overall, participants were very satisfied with the structure and the content of the courses. CONCLUSIONS: The article shows that the online-courses are an effective and well-accepted approach to train professionals in topics regarding (institutional) child protection by contributing to the participants abilities to create medical facilities into a place of competence and protection.","output":"Development and randomized controlled trial evaluation of E-learning trainings for professionals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Thanks to a simplified special approval process that was valid until October 1st, 2020, a large number of particle-filtering half masks have come onto the German market.

We have examined 15 particle-filtering half masks with different specifications for their filter performance METHOD: The masks were clamped in a jig in an airtight test box. Radioactive particles with a size of 0.6  0.4 m were nebulized into the box and sucked into a filter through the port of the jig and an unfiltered reference port using an artificial lung. The activity deposited on the filter was measured by means of a gamma camera. The filter performance was calculated from this.

Historically, public health issues have been managed within each county, with very little sharing of information among counties. The 1999 West Nile virus (WNV) outbreak in the Northeast caused public health officials in Atlanta to recognize the potential for the disease to spread to Georgia and the need to develop a coordinated, multi-jurisdictional response plan. This plan would need to address a new disease with little scientific data to predict how it might behave in a new environment and would also require closely coordinated communication among the local/state public health entities and elected officials. In early 2000, staff from the five health districts in the metro Atlanta area and the state health department voluntarily convened the Metro Atlanta Surveillance Task Force (MASTF) to create the Metro Atlanta West Nile Virus Response Plan. This plan utilizes a coordinated effort encompassing public education, surveillance, and mosquito control. With this plan in place, when the first human case of WNV was detected in Atlanta, the public heard consistent health messages about preventive measures to lower their risk of illness and the metro counties were able to carry out a successful uniform approach to mosquito control. This plan has received recognition by the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO) as a 2004 Model Practice, demonstrating exemplary and replicable qualities in response to a local public health need. Since the early days of the emergence of WNV in the metro Atlanta area, MASTF has continued to be a viable, evolving entity, managing and anticipating health issues.

The aim of this study was to evaluatethe diagnostic yield and the proportionality of this pre-procedural screeningprotocol. METHODS: In this mono-centre, prospective, cross-sectional study, all patients admitted to the hospital between 22nd April 2020 until 14th May 2020 for semi-urgent surgery, haematological or oncological treatment, or electrophysiological investigationunderwent a COVID-19 screening 2 days before their procedure.

Study Design and Methods Conversations on Twitter containing references to LSIs (e.g., ECMO) or ACP (e.g., DNR/DNI) were collected from January 2019 to May 2021. User account metadata was used to predict user demographic information and classify users as either organizations, individuals, clinicians, or influencers. We compared the number of impressions across these user categories and analyzed the content of tweets using natural language processing models to identify topics of discussion and associated emotional sentiment. Results There were 202,585 unique tweets about LSIs and 67,162 unique tweets about ACP. Users who were younger, men, or influencers were more likely to discuss LSIs online. Tweets about LSIs were associated with more positive emotional sentiment scores than tweets about ACP (LSIs: 0.3, ACP: -0.2; P < 0.001). Among tweets about ACP, most contained personal experiences related to the death of loved ones (27%) or discussed discrimination through DNR orders directed at the elderly and disabled (19%). Personal experiences had the greatest retweet-to-tweet-ratio (4.7), indicating high levels of user engagement. Tweets about discrimination contained the most negative net sentiment score (-0.5). Interpretation The observed increase in tweets regarding LSIs and ACP suggests that Twitter was consistently utilized to discuss treatment modalities and preferences related to intensive care during the pandemic. Future interventions to increase online engagement with ACP may consider leveraging influencers and personal stories. Finally, we identified DNR-related discrimination as a commonly held public fear, which should be further explored as a barrier to ACP completion and can be proactively addressed by clinicians during bedside goals-of-care discussions.","output":"Perceptions of Life Support and Advance Care Planning During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Global Study of Twitter Users"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is a surrogate marker of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) that contribute to immunothrombosis.

Once administered and internalized by host cells, the mRNA transcripts are translated directly in the cytoplasm of the cell. The resulting antigens are presented to the immune system cells to stimulate an immune response. Dendritic cells (DCs) can be utilized as a carrier by delivering tumor-associated antigen mRNAs or total tumor RNA to their cytoplasm; then, the mRNA-loaded DCs can be delivered to the host to elicit a specific immune response.

The results showed that the HRVUST of LnSDNN, LnRMSSD, and LnSDNN:LnRMSSD ratio showed trivial to small effect sizes (ES) (-0.00~0.49), very large and nearly perfect interclass correlation coefficients (ICC) (0.74~0.95), and relatively small values of bias (RSA: 0.01~-0.12; YYIR1: -0.01~-0.16) to the HRVcriterion in both exercise protocols. In addition, the HRVUST of LnLF, LnHF, and LnLF:LnHF showed trivial to small ES (-0.04~-0.54), small to large ICC (-0.02~0.68), and relatively small values of bias (RSA: -0.02~0.65; YYIR1: 0.03~-0.23) to the HRVcriterion in both exercise protocols. Lastly, the 1-min LnSDNN:LnRMSSD ratio was significantly correlated to the 5-min LnLF:LnHF ratio with moderate~high level (r = 0.43~0.72; p < 0.05) during 30-min post-exercise recovery. The post-exercise 1-min HRV assessment in LnSDNN, LnRMSSD, and LnSDNN:LnRMSSD ratio was acceptable and accurate in the RSA and YYIR1 tests, compared to the 5-min time segment of measurement. The moderate to high correlation coefficient of the HRVUST LnSDNN:LnRMSSD ratio to the HRVcriterion LnLF:LnHF ratio indicated the capacity to facilitate the post-exercise shortening duration of HRV measurement after maximal anaerobic or aerobic shuttle running. Using ultra-short-term record of LnSDNN:LnRMSSD ratio as a surrogate for standard measure of LnLF:LnHF ratio after short-term bouts of maximal intensity field-based shuttle running is warranted.","output":"Post-Exercise Recovery of Ultra-Short-Term Heart Rate Variability after Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test and Repeated Sprint Ability Test."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sikh healthcare professionals make up a small but significant proportion of the workforce in the United Kingdom.

These types of vaccines are well-established, proven interventions with multiple safe and efficacious commercial examples. Many vaccine candidates of this type for SARS-CoV-2 rely on sequences containing the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which mediates viral entry to cells via ACE2. Here we report an engineered sequence variant of RBD that exhibits high-yield manufacturability, high-affinity binding to ACE2, and enhanced immunogenicity after a single dose in mice compared to the Wuhan-Hu-1 variant used in current vaccines. Antibodies raised against the engineered protein exhibited heterotypic binding to the RBD from two recently reported SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (501Y.V1/V2).

Publicly available, county-level time series data on mobility are derived from individual GPS-devices, providing a variety of indices of social distancing behavior per day. Such indices allow a fine-grained approach to modeling public behavior during the pandemic. Previous studies of social distancing and policy have not accounted for the occurrence of pre-policy social distancing and other dynamics reflected in the long-term trajectories of public mobility data. OBJECTIVE: We propose a differential equation state-space model of county-level social distancing that accounts for distancing behavior leading up to the first official policies, equilibrium dynamics reflected in the long-term trajectories of mobility, and the specific impacts of four kinds of policy. The model is fit to each US county individually, producing a nation-wide data set of novel, estimated mobility indices. METHODS: A differential equation model was fit to three indicators of mobility for each of N=3054 counties, with T=100 occasions per county of: distance traveled, visitations to key sites, and the log number of interpersonal encounters. The indicators were highly correlated and assumed to share common underlying latent trajectory, dynamics, and responses to policy. Maximum likelihood estimation with the Kalman-Bucy filter was used to estimate the model parameters. Bivariate distributional plots and descriptive statistics were used to examine the resulting county-level parameter estimates. The association of chronology with policy impact was also considered. RESULTS: Mobility dynamics show moderate correlations with two census covariates: population density (Spearman's r ranging from .11 to .31) and median household income (Spearman's r ranging from -.03 to .39). Stay-at-home order effects were negatively correlated with both (r=-.37 and r=-.38 respectively) while the effects of the ban on all gatherings were positively correlated with both (r=.51, r=.39). Chronological ordering of policies was a moderate to strong determinant of their effect per county (Spearman's r ranging from -.12 to -.56), with earlier policies accounting for most of the change in mobility, and later policies having little or no additional effect. CONCLUSIONS: Chronological ordering, population density, and median household income were all associated with policy impact. The stay-at-home order and the ban on gatherings had the largest impacts on mobility on average. The model is implemented in a graphical online app for exploring county-level statistics and running counterfactual simulations.

Protein S binds to angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2, ACE2, of the host cell, followed by proteolysis of the spike protein, drastic protein conformational change with exposure of the fusion peptide of the virus, and entry of the virion into the host cell. The structural elements that govern conformational plasticity of the spike protein are largely unknown. Here, we present a methodology that relies upon graph and centrality analyses, augmented by bioinformatics, to identify and characterize large H-bond clusters in protein structures. We apply this methodology to protein S ectodomain and find that, in the closed conformation, the three protomers of protein S bring the same contribution to an extensive central network of H-bonds, and contribute symmetrically to a relatively large H-bond cluster at the receptor binding domain, and to a cluster near a protease cleavage site. Markedly different H-bonding at these three clusters in open and pre-fusion conformations suggest dynamic H-bond clusters could facilitate structural plasticity and selection of a protein S protomer for binding to the host receptor, and proteolytic cleavage.

Omicron VOC is the most divergent variant identified so far and has generated immediate concern for its potential capability to increase SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and, more worryingly, to escape therapeutic and vaccine-induced antibodies. Nevertheless, a clear definition of the Omicron VOC mutational spectrum is still missing. Herein, we provide a comprehensive definition and functional characterization (in terms of infectivity and/or antigenicity) of mutations characterizing the Omicron VOC. In particular, 887,475 SARS-CoV-2 Omicron VOC whole-genome sequences were retrieved from the GISAID database and used to precisely define its specific patterns of mutations across the different viral proteins. In addition, the functional characterization of Omicron VOC spike mutations was finely discussed according to published manuscripts. Lastly, residues characterizing the Omicron VOC and the previous four VOCs (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta) were mapped on the three-dimensional structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to assess their localization in the different spike domains. Overall, our study will assist with deciphering the Omicron VOC mutational profile and will shed more light on its clinical implications. This is critical considering that Omicron VOC is currently the predominant variant worldwide. IMPORTANCE The Omicron variant of concern (VOC) has a peculiar spectrum of mutations characterized by the acquisition of mutations or deletions rarely detected in previously identified variants, particularly in the spike glycoprotein. Such mutations, mostly residing in the receptor-binding domain, could play a pivotal role in enhancing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infectivity (by increasing binding affinity for ACE2), jeopardizing spike recognition by therapeutic and vaccine-induced antibodies and causing diagnostic assay failure.

METHODS: Our multiple case study approach included non-ICU units from 4 Veterans Health Administration settings. Guided by the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety, we conducted focus groups and interviews to capture barriers and facilitators to daily CHG bathing. We measured compliance using observations and skin CHG concentrations. RESULTS: Barriers to daily CHG include time, concern of increasing antibiotic resistance, workflow and product concerns. Facilitators include engagement of champions and unit shared responsibility. We found shortfalls in patient education, hand hygiene and CHG use on tubes and drains. CHG skin concentration levels were highest among patients from spinal cord injury units. These units applied antiseptic using 2% CHG impregnated wipes vs 4% CHG solution/soap.

DESIGN: Explorative longitudinal baseline-, pre- and during lockdown survey study. SETTING: The Netherlands, on-line between January 2019 and May 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Community sample of 120 monthly to daily cannabis users and reference group of 63 non-using controls. MEASUREMENTS: Change in cannabis use and CUD symptom severity from baseline to pre- to post-lockdown. Change in cannabis use motives, mental health, quality of social relationships and job status from pre- to post-lockdown. FINDINGS: In cannabis users, lockdown related to increased cannabis use [B = 1.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.26-3.66, P = 0.024], but not CUD symptom severity. Cannabis users experienced 30% job loss and increased loneliness [P < 0.001, Bayes factor (BF)10 > 100], while contact with partners (P = 0.005, BF10 = 8.21) and families improved (P < 0.001, BF10 = 19.73), with no differences between cannabis users and control.

The survey included 55 open and closed questions and required 5 minutes to complete. We publicised the survey using social media. ResultsWe received 96 responses, including 66 currently pregnant women and 22 women who were pregnant during the pandemic. The response rate was 70.1% of survey views. We found mixed experiences of the impact of the pandemic on antenatal and perinatal care, notably with some women feeling visiting restrictions were insufficient and others feeling they were too strict. Twenty-nine women received no information about COVID-19, and 6 women found it very difficult to find information. Thirty-nine women would have liked to have more information about breastfeeding after a pregnancy affected by COVID-19, and 37 women wanted more information about antibody persistence and transfer.

Whilst some studies have analyzed mHealth apps from different angles, including security, there is relatively little evidence for data privacy issues that may exist in mHealth apps used for mental health services, whose recipients can be particularly vulnerable. This paper reports an empirical study aimed at systematically identifying and understanding data privacy incorporated in mental health apps. We analyzed 27 top-ranked mental health apps from Google Play Store. Our methodology enabled us to perform an in-depth privacy analysis of the apps, covering static and dynamic analysis, data sharing behaviour, server-side tests, privacy impact assessment requests, and privacy policy evaluation. Furthermore, we mapped the findings to the LINDDUN threat taxonomy, describing how threats manifest on the studied apps. The findings reveal important data privacy issues such as unnecessary permissions, insecure cryptography implementations, and leaks of personal data and credentials in logs and web requests. There is also a high risk of user profiling as the apps' development do not provide foolproof mechanisms against linkability, detectability and identifiability.

The objective of this study was to determine the incidence of postoperative COVID-19 infection following nonelective hip and knee surgery during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in New Jersey during this time. A retrospective cohort of 149 patients who underwent nonelective hip and knee surgery from March 27, 2020, through May 25, 2020, at 2 institutions was identified. The cohort was divided into hip fracture and non-fracture patients to compare the postoperative experience of these patient populations. The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative COVID-19 infection diagnosed via severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 nasopharyngeal real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Secondary outcomes included length of stay, discharge disposition, postoperative complications, and mortality rate. A total of 149 patients underwent nonelective hip and knee surgeries, including 76 hip fracture cases and 73 nonelective hip and knee arthroplasty cases.

Although the debate on the nature and conditions of solidarity has been revitalized, there remains a large variety in how to conceptualize solidarity. In contrast to other approaches, we do not conceive solidarity as normative concept, but as descriptiveCanalytical one. Therefore, we provide a theory-based definition that is prone to capture the empirical dimensions of solidarity. Accounting for the dynamic and interactive character of solidarity as subject to permanent societal and political renegotiation, we conceptualize solidarity from a discourse perspective and follow a multilevel design breaking down the understandings of solidarity on different levels. This approach contributes to the research of solidarity that is interested to capturing the real world dimensions of solidarity.

However, it is unclear whether the association between hepatic dysfunction and lactate clearance can act as a prognostic marker of clinical outcomes in patients with septic shock. We aimed to evaluate the association between lactate clearance and mortality in two cohorts of septic shock patient who had hepatic dysfunction based on their total serum bilirubin levels (TBIL). Lactate clearance at 24 h after the onset of septic shock was analyzed using two cohorts, sub-categorized into two groups based on TBIL: < 2 mg/dL and  2 mg/dL. In the derivation cohort, lactate clearance was lower in non-survivors than in survivors with TBIL  2 mg/dL, while there was no significant difference in lactate clearance between non-survivors and survivors with TBIL < 2 mg/dL. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that increased lactate clearance was significantly associated with decreased 28-day mortality in the TBIL  2 mg/dL group (10% lactate clearance, adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.80-0.97, P = 0.0075), Creatinine level  2 mg/dL group (adjusted OR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.81-0.95, P = 0.00069) and APACHE II score  35 group (adjusted OR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.87-0.98, P = 0.013). In the validation cohort, lactate clearance was lower in non-survivors than in survivors with TBIL  2 mg/dL, while no significant difference in lactate clearance was observed between non-survivors and survivors with TBIL < 2 mg/dL. Increased lactate clearance was significantly associated with decreased 28-day mortality in the TBIL  2 mg/dL group (10% lactate clearance, adjusted OR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.83-0.96, P = 0.0038) and the association was just about significant in APACHE II score  35 group (adjusted OR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.74-1.00, P = 0.051).

DESIGN A scoping review was conducted based on the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews and using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. Two independent reviewers performed the screening and data extraction. DATA SOURCES Medline, Embase, APA PsycINFO, Cochrane CENTRAL, Scopus, Google Scholar, Google, ProQuest Theses and Dissertations Database, APA PsycExtra and Opengrey.eu were searched in May 2020. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Studies were included if they investigated the effects of viewing at least one visual artwork on at least one stress outcome measure. Studies involving active engagement with art, review papers or qualitative studies were excluded. There were no limits in terms of year of publication, contexts or population types; however, only studies published in the English language were considered. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Information extracted from manuscripts included: study methodologies, population and setting characteristics, details of the artwork interventions and key findings. RESULTS 14 primary studies were identified, with heterogeneous study designs, methodologies and artwork interventions. Many studies lacked important methodological details and only four studies were randomised controlled trials. 13 of the 14 studies on self-reported stress reported reductions after viewing artworks, and all of the four studies that examined systolic blood pressure reported reductions. Fewer studies examined heart rate, heart rate variability, cortisol, respiration or other physiological outcomes. CONCLUSIONS There is promising evidence for effects of viewing artwork on reducing stress. Moderating factors may include setting, individual characteristics, artwork content and viewing instructions.

However, as far as we know, there is no effective marker to predict the virus discharge in stool and initial gastrointestinal involvement of COVID-19 patients. Aims: We aimed to investigate the likely biomarker predicting virus discharge in stool and initial gastrointestinal involvement of COVID-19, which may assist the clinicians in better preventing COVID-19 spread. Methods: The patients complained of gastrointestinal symptoms, including vomiting, diarrhea, with or without respiratory symptoms, attending the Sixth People's Hospital of Wenzhou, and the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, were screened by qRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. The confirmed COVID-19 patients, without any history of intaking contaminated food or water, were all enrolled to investigate the association between circulating lymphocyte count and virus discharge, initial gastrointestinal involvement. Results: Seventy-six COVID-19 patients were included in the final analysis (mean age of 44.5 years, male 44.7%), with 24 (31.5%) complained of initial gastrointestinal symptoms. Significantly lower circulating lymphocyte count was found in the patients with positive results of qRT-PCR on stool (p = 0.012). Patients were divided into tertile groups by circulating lymphocyte count: lymphocyte 0.88*10^(9)/l ( n = 25 ), 0.88*10^(9)/l -1.2*10^(9)/l ( n = 28 ), and >1.2*10^(9)/l ( n = 23 ), respectively. When circulating lymphocyte count increased from 1st tertile to the 2nd and 3rd tertiles, the risk of initial gastrointestinal symptoms decreased by nearly 75% (OR = 0.25, 95% CI: 0.07, 0.98, p = 0.047), 83% (OR = 0.17, 95% CI: 0.05, 0.63, p = 0.008), after adjusting for likely confounders.

Consequently, the data will be analyzed according to some pragmatic theories like politeness, implicature, and pragmatic metaphor. The questions that the paper tries to answer are: (1) Does Trump use a direct bully or indirect one? (2) What are the polite strategies that Trump tries to use in order to minimize the effect of bullying? (3) Are there any implied meanings in Trumps tweeters that he wants to convey?

Current devices are typically reusable and require daily, or often more frequent, cleaning to prevent risk of infection by acting as reservoirs of potentially pathogenic organisms. In response, a daily disposable OPEP device, the UL-OPEP, was developed to mitigate the risk of contamination and eliminate the burdensome need for cleaning devices. METHODS: A convenience sample of 36 participants, all current OPEP device users, was recruited from a paediatric CF service. For one month, participants replaced their current OPEP device with a novel daily disposable device. Assessment included pre- and post-intervention lung function by spirometry, as well as Lung Clearance Index. Quality of life was assessed using the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire C Revised, while user experience was evaluated with a post-study survey. RESULTS: 31 participants completed the study: 18 males; median age 10 years, range 4C16 years. Lung function (mean difference  SD, %FEV1 = 1.69  11.93; %FVC = 0.58  10.04; FEV1: FVC = 0.01  0.09), LCI (mean difference  SD, 0.08  1.13), six-minute walk test, and CFQ-R were unchanged post-intervention.

Today, the tourism industry is developing rapidly, despite a number of problems caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, both in the territory of Ukraine and abroad. Tourism remains an important industry, influencing the economy of countries. Therefore, for the further development of this sector, it is important to pay attention to improving the quality of services to maximize the satisfaction of the needs of tourists, especially during their leisure time. The quality factor of the level of tourist product provided under modern conditions is key for the functioning of the tourism sector. Now an important and integral part of the tourism business around the world is tourism animation. During leisure, tourists seek to satisfy a number of their own needs, namely: spiritual, physical, communication, self-realization, etc. In addition, they have the opportunity to analyze their own inner being or characterize the people who will be around at this time. The purpose of the leisure industry is to create all the necessary (safe) conditions for entertainment. The social component of animation activity is the creation and development of modern needs in tourists. In addition, an animation tourism program is directed towards forming and obtaining new useful skills for its participants. To maximize satisfaction of the requirements of vacationers, regardless of their nationality, age, economic prosperity, health status, animation programs must change in terms of content, time or activity during the tourist season. Usually, they depend on the size of the hotel, its geographical location, focus, specifics, etc. It is noted that today the domestic tourist market needs animation specialists.

Although the literature traditionally describes the economic, social, and cultural impacts of tourism, there is a gap related to the effects of tourism on residents' health. The methodology involves applying the limited-information maximum likelihood instrumental variable approach. The results demonstrate that tourism arrivals negatively influence residents health in the short term, yet have positive impacts on long-term health outcomes. The study contributes to the theory and practice by offering a new approach to physical health outcomes of tourism, demonstrating the superiority of long-term positive impacts of tourism over short-term negative outcomes, and emphasizing the importance of evaluating the health impacts of tourism for destination marketing and management.","output":"Health outcomes of tourism development: A longitudinal study of the impact of tourism arrivals on residents health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: To control the COVID-19 pandemic, governments need to ensure a successful large-scale administration of COVID-19 vaccines when safe and efficacious vaccines become available. Vaccine acceptance could be a critical factor influencing vaccine uptake. Health information has been associated with vaccine acceptance. For college students who are embracing a digital era and being exposed to multimedia, the sources of COVID-19 vaccine information and their trust in these sources may play an important role in shaping their acceptance of vaccine uptake. Methods: In September 2020, we conducted an online survey among 1062 college students in South Carolina to understand their perceptions and attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination. Descriptive analysis and linear regression analysis were used to investigate vaccine information sources among college students and examine how COVID-19 vaccine acceptance was associated with information source and trust level in each source. Results: The top three sources of COVID-19 vaccine information were health agencies (57.7%), mass media (49.5%), and personal social networks (40.5%). About 83.1% of the participants largely or always trusted scientists, 73.9% trusted healthcare providers, and 70.2% trusted health agencies. After controlling for key demographics, vaccine acceptance was positively associated with scientists as information sources but negatively associated with pharmaceutical companies as sources. Higher trust levels in mass media, health agencies, scientists, and pharmaceutical companies was significantly associated with higher COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. However, trust in social media was negatively associated with vaccine acceptance. Discussion: College students use multiple sources to learn about upcoming COVID-19 vaccines including health agencies, personal networks, and social media. The level of trust in these information sources play a critical role in predicting vaccine acceptance. Trust in health authorities and scientists rather than social media is related to higher level vaccine acceptance. Our findings echo the call for restoring trust in government, healthcare system, scientists, and pharmaceutical industries in the COVID-19 era and highlight the urgency to dispel misinformation in social media. Effective strategies are needed to disseminate accurate information about COVID-19 vaccine from health authorities and scientific research to improve vaccine communication to the public and promote COVID-19 vaccine uptake.","output":"Vaccine acceptance among college students in South Carolina: Do information sources and trust in information make a difference?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the closure of schools due to the global confinement resulting from the COVID-19 crisis, family-school cooperation has become a priority in most educational stages, but especially in Early Childhood Education and Care.

We aimed to measure the prevalence of household and hospital-based food insecurity, and to explore the associations with caregiver distress in an academic pediatric hospital setting. METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional survey of caregivers of children admitted to the general pediatric ward of an academic pediatric hospital in Toronto, Ontario, from April to October 2020. We measured household food insecurity using the 18-item Household Food Security Survey Module, and included 3 adapted questions about hospital-based food insecurity. We measured caregiver distress with the Distress Thermometer for Parents. We used descriptive statistics to assess the proportion of respondents with food insecurity, and linear regression models to explore the relation of household (adult and child) and hospital-based food insecurity with caregiver distress. We used thematic analysis to explore caregivers' feedback. RESULTS We contacted 851 caregivers, and 775 (91.1%) provided consent to participate. Overall, 430 (50.5%) caregivers completed at least part of the survey. Caregivers described a high prevalence of household (34.2%) and hospital-based (38.1%) food insecurity. Adult ( = 0.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.07-0.36), child ( = 0.38, 95% CI 0.10-0.66) and hospital-based ( = 0.56, 95% CI 0.30-0.83) food insecurity were significantly associated with caregiver distress, independent of covariates. We identified financial burden, emotional and practical barriers, stress obtaining food and advocacy for food as important themes in caregiver feedback. INTERPRETATION Both household and hospital-based food insecurity were highly prevalent among caregivers. To reduce caregiver distress, hospitals need to consider reducing barriers for caregivers in obtaining food for themselves during their child's admission.","output":"Food insecurity during COVID-19 in a Canadian academic pediatric hospital: a cross-sectional survey."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Postinfection complications of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are still unknown, and one of the long-term concerns in infected people are brain pathologies.

Additionally, to analyze how external threats can contribute to spread the disease in Indigenous Lands (IL). Methods: The Brazilian Amazon is home to nearly half a million Indigenous persons, representing more than 170 ethnic groups. As a pioneer in heading Indigenous community-based surveillance (I-CBS) in Brazil, the Coordination of the Indigenous Organizations of the Brazilian Amazon (COIAB) started to monitor Indigenous COVID-19 cases in March of 2020. Brazil's Ministry of Health (MOH) was the main source of data regarding non-Indigenous cases and deaths; to contrast the government's tally, we used the information collected by I-CBS covering 25 Special Indigenous Sanitary Districts (DSEI) in the Brazilian Amazon. The incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 were calculated using the total number of new cases and deaths accumulated between the 9th and 40th epidemiological weeks. We studied (a) the availability of health care facilities to attend to Indigenous Peoples; (b) illegal mines, land grabbing, and deforestation to perform a geospatial analysis to assess how external threats affect Indigenous incidence and mortality rates. We used the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with Poisson regression to show the results. Results: MOH registered 22,127 cases and 330 deaths, while COIAB's survey recorded 25,356 confirmed cases and 670 deaths, indicating an under-reporting of 14 and 103%, respectively. Likewise, the incidence and mortality rates were 136 and 110% higher among Indigenous when compared with the national average. In terms of mortality, the most critical DSEIs were Alto Rio Solim?es, Cuiab, Xavante, Vilhena and Kaiap do Par. The GLM model reveals a direct correlation between deforestation, land grabbing and mining, and the incidence of cases among the Indigenous. Conclusion: Through this investigation it was possible to verify that not only the incidence and mortality rates due to COVID-19 among Indigenous Peoples are higher than those observed in the general population, but also that the data presented by the federal government are underreported. Additionally, it was evident that the presence of illegal economic activities increased the risk of spreading COVID-19 in ILs.","output":"Under-Reporting of COVID-19 Cases Among Indigenous Peoples in Brazil: A New Expression of Old Inequalities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The disruptions to international mobility dynamics caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have affected refugees particularly severely.

Due to a lack of effective therapy or vaccine, urgent and concerted efforts are needed to identify therapeutic targets and medications. COVID-19 main protease represents a major target for drug treatment to inhibit viral function. The present study sought to evaluate medicinal plant compounds as potential inhibitors of the COVID-19 main protease using molecular docking and molecular dynamic analysis. The PDB files of COVID-19 main protease and some medicinal plant compounds were retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org) and Pubchem server, respectively. The Gromacs software was used for simulation studies, and molecular docking analysis was done using Autodock 4.2. The COVID-19 main protease simulation, compared with some phytochemicals docked to the COVID-19 main protease, were analyzed. Glabridin, catechin, and fisetin had the greatest tendency to interact with the COVID-19 main protease by hydrogen and hydrophobic interactions. Docking of these phytochemicals to COVID-19 main protease led to an increase in the radius of gyration (Rg), decrease in the Root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), and induced variation in COVID-19 main protease secondary structure. The high tendency interaction of glabridin, catechin, and fisetin to COVID-19 main protease induced conformational changes on this enzyme. These interactions can lead to enzyme inhibition.

Concomitant ligation of the vessels is not a standard procedure due to an expected risk of stapler dysfunction and the development of arteriovenous fistulas (AVF). Using the EndoGIA stapler 45/2.5 mm, we compared en bloc ligation with individual ligation during LN and nephroureterectomy (LNU) with a special focus on the development of AVF and technique safety. METHODS This was a retrospective study of all patients undergoing LN or LNU at the Department of Urology, Roskilde Hospital, Denmark, between January 2010 and April 2014. The follow-up period was minimum six months. RESULTS A total of 228 patients underwent LN and 56 patients underwent LNU. In the LN group, 77 patients underwent en bloc ligation. The mean surgical time was significantly reduced to 89 minutes in the en bloc group compared to 109 minutes in the conventional group (p = 0.0001). The difference remained significant with multivariate analysis. In the LNU group, seven patients underwent en bloc ligation. There was no significant difference between conventional ligation and en bloc ligation with respect to surgical time in either the univariate or the multivariate analyses. None of the patients needed blood transfusion. With a mean follow-up of 13.5 months, no AVF were found.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of the immune checkpoint inhibitors atezolizumab (programmed cell death ligand 1 inhibitor) and nivolumab (programmed cell death 1 inhibitor) and the chemotherapy drug docetaxel in patients with advanced NSCLC resistant to platinum-based chemotherapy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This comparative effectiveness study compared patients aged 18 years or older with advanced NSCLC who initiated atezolizumab, docetaxel, or nivolumab and who had previously been exposed to platinum-based chemotherapy using nationally representative real-world data from more than 280 US cancer clinics. Patients were followed-up from May 2011 to March 2020. Data analysis was performed between April and June 2021. Comparisons of interest were between atezolizumab vs docetaxel and atezolizumab vs nivolumab. EXPOSURES: Initiation of atezolizumab, nivolumab, or docetaxel monotherapy. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The main outcome was overall survival (OS). RESULTS: A total of 3336 patients (mean [SD] age, 67.1 [9.49] years; 1820 [54.6%] men and 1516 [45.4%] women) were assessed in the main analysis, including 206 patients receiving atezolizumab, 500 receiving docetaxel, and 2630 receiving nivolumab. Patients receiving atezolizumab were older than those treated with docetaxel (mean age [SD], 68.3 [9.4] years vs 65.6 [9.5] years), and were more likely to have been treated in an academic setting (39 patients [18.9%]) than those receiving docetaxel (49 patients [9.8%]) and nivolumab (128 patients [4.9%]). After adjustment for baseline characteristics, atezolizumab was associated with a significantly longer OS compared with docetaxel (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.79; 95% CI, 0.64-0.97). No significant difference in OS was observed between atezolizumab and nivolumab (aHR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.89-1.28). These findings were consistent across all patient subgroups tested, and robust to plausible deviations from random missingness for Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status in real-world data (eg, the tipping point for loss of a significantly beneficial effect for atezolizumab vs docetaxel was achieved if patients in the docetaxel group missing baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status had a mean performance status of 1.43 higher than expected).

Public and private decision-making surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic must contend with uncertainty about the probability of infection during activities involving groups of people, in order to decide whether that activity is worth undertaking. We propose a model of SARS-CoV-2 infection probability that can produce estimates of relative risk of infection for diverse activities, so long as those activities meet a list of assumptions, including that they do not last longer than one day (e.g., sporting events, flights, concerts), and that the probability of infection among possible routes of infection (i.e., droplet, aerosol, fomite, and direct contact) are independent. We show how the model can be used to inform decisions facing governments and industry, such as opening stadiums or flying on airplanes; in particular, it allows for estimating the ranking of the constituent components of activities (e.g., going through a turnstile, sitting in ones seat) by their relative risk of infection, even when the probability of infection is unknown or uncertain. We prove that the model is a good approximation of a more refined model in which we assume infections come from a series of independent risks. A linearity assumption governing several potentially modifiable risks factorssuch as duration of the activity, density of participants, and infectiousness of the attendeesmakes interpreting and using the model straightforward, and we argue that it does so without significantly diminishing the reliability of the model.","output":"Modeling the relative risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection to inform risk-cost-benefit analyses of activities during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The Covid-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented stress to students and educational institutions across the world.

After evaluating descriptive data on mental health and stressors by students demographic characteristics, we estimated the associations between Covid-19 stressors (including work reductions, health, distanced learning difficulties and social isolation) and mental health symptoms and severity controlling for students pre-pandemic mental health, psychosocial resources, and demographic characteristics. RESULTS: We found that the prevalence of moderate-severe anxiety increased from 18.1% before the pandemic to 25.3% within four months after the pandemic began; and the prevalence of moderate-severe depression increased from 21.5% to 31.7%. White, female and sexual/gender minority (SGM) students were at highest risk of increases in anxiety symptoms. Non-Hispanic (NH) Black, female, and SGM students were at highest risk of increases in depression symptoms. General difficulties associated with distanced learning and social isolation contributed to the increases in both depression and anxiety symptoms.

Preventive and early intervention strategies in infancy are critical for improving outcomes over the lifespan with significant cost savings. However, the impact of prevention and early intervention efforts is dependent upon our ability to identify infants most appropriate for such interventions. Because there may be significant overlap between prodromal symptoms across neurodevelopmental disorders and child psychopathology more broadly which may wax and wane across development, we contend that the impact of prevention and early intervention efforts will be heightened by identifying early indicators that may overlap across ASD and other commonly co-occurring disorders. This paper summarizes the existing literature on infant symptoms and identification of ASD to demonstrate the ways in which a transdiagnostic perspective could expand the impact of early identification and intervention research and clinical efforts, and to outline suggestions for future empirical research programs addressing current gaps in the identification-to-treatment pipeline. We propose four recommendations for future research that are both grounded in developmental and clinical science and that are scalable for early intervention systems: (1) development of fine-grained, norm-referenced measures of ASD-relevant transdiagnostic behavioral domains; (2) identification of shared and distinct mechanisms influencing the transition from risk to disorder; (3) determination of key cross-cutting treatment strategies (both novel and extracted from existing approaches) effective in targeting specific domains across disorders; and (4) integration of identified measures and treatments into existing service systems.","output":"Future Directions for Infant Identification and Intervention for Autism Spectrum Disorder from a Transdiagnostic Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Social determinants of evolving covid-19 pandemic have not been well studied. To determine trends in transition of this epidemic in India we performed a study in states at various levels of human development index (HDI). Methods: We used publicly available data sources to track progress of covid-19 epidemic in India in different states and territories where it was reported in significant numbers. The states (n=20) were classified into tertiles of HDI and weekly trends in cases and deaths plotted from 15 March to 2 May 2020. To assess association of HDI with state-level covid-19 burden we performed Pearson correlation. Logarithmic trends were evaluated for calculation of projections. A microlevel study was performed in select urban agglomerations for identification of socioeconomic status (SES) differentials. Results: There is wide regional variation in covid-19 cases and deaths in India from mid-March to early-May 2020. High absolute numbers have been reported from states of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Tamilnadu. Growth rate in cases and deaths is slow in high HDI states while it has increased rapidly in middle and lower HDI states. In mid-March 2020 there was a strong positive correlation of state-level HDI with weekly covid-19 cases (r= 0.37, 0.40) as well as deaths (r= 0.31, 0.42). This declined by early-May for cases (r= 0.04, 0.06) as well as deaths (r= -0.005, 0.001) with significant negative logarithmic trend (cases R squared= 0.92; deaths R squared= 0.84). These trends indicate increasing cases and deaths in low HDI states. Projection reveals that this trend is likely to continue to early-June 2020. Microlevel evaluation shows that urban agglomerations are major focus of the disease in India and it has transited from middle SES to low SES locations. Conclusion: There is wide variability in burden of covid-19 in India. Slow growth and flattening of curve is observed in high-HDI states while disease is increasing in mid and lower HDI states. Projections reveal that lower HDI states would achieve parity with high HDI states by early-June 2020.

Stocks with the highest algorithmic trading (AT) experienced lower liquidity reduction compared to stocks with the lowest AT activity. High AT stocks did not experience greater reduction in either competition for liquidity provision or price improvements than low AT stocks.

The COVID-19 outbreak and the lockdown produced as a consequence of it have contributed to escalating this problem. Many national organisms reported an increase in the data on domestic violence during confinement. Bystander intervention often constitutes one of the most effective mechanisms of attention. The problem is that bystanders do not always dare to intervene. This article aims to provide knowledge on the reasons for this lack of intervention and its connection to domestic violence, while presenting measures to encourage intervention and victim support, offering protection to those most in need during this pandemic. The research was conducted through questionnaires distributed online among social entities in charge of providing care to women suffering from domestic violence during the lockdown. The results have shown that most of these entities have had to intervene in providing support to women during the lockdown. In conclusion, the case of the Unitary Platform Against Gender Violence and the entities, which are members of the platform, acted in situations of domestic violence produced during confinement, based on the mutual support provided by being a group of entities that have the support of the Platform. ? 2021 by the authors.

At the same time, school closures forced children to rearrange their lives and learning processes: in Italy, schools and nurseries were closed for four months, and the incidence and quality of distance learning activities was heterogeneous across education levels and among schools. Using real-time survey data on families with under-16 children collected in April 2020, which include information on parents' market and household work, and their perception of their children's wellbeing, we estimate how the lockdown has affected children's use of time, their emotional status and their home learning, and whether the reallocation of intrahousehold responsibilities during the lockdown played a role in this process. Changes in the parental division of household tasks and childcare, mostly induced by the labor market restrictions imposed during the lockdown, point to a greater involvement of fathers in childcare and homeschooling activities. This positive variation in fathers' involvement is accompanied by an increase in children's emotional wellbeing and by a reduction in TV and passive screen time. On the other hand, the quality of children's home learning does not appear to depend on which parent is overseeing their work, but rather on the type of distance learning activities proposed by their teachers.","output":"Fathers matter: Intrahousehold responsibilities and children's wellbeing during the COVID-19 lockdown in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of a pandemic scale respiratory illness (COVID-19: coronavirus disease 2019) and the lack of the world's readiness to prevent its spread resulted in an unprecedented rise of biomedical diagnostic industries, as they took lead to provide efficient diagnostic solutions for COVID-19.

The declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic may have resulted in treatment delays and corresponding increases in severity of disease. This study compared cholecystitis admissions and disease severity pre- and postdeclaration of pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of adult acute cholecystitis admissions (January 1,2020-May 31, 2020). Corresponding time periods in 2018 and 2019 comprised the historical control. Difference-in-differences analysis compared biweekly cholecystitis admissions pre- and postdeclaration in 2020 to the historical control. Odds of increased severity of disease presentation were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Cholecystitis admissions decreased 48.7% from 5.2 to 2.67 cases (RR 0.51 [0.28,0.96], P = 0.04) following pandemic declaration when comparing 2020 to historical control (P = 0.02). After stratifying by severity, only Tokyo I admissions declined significantly postdeclaration (RR 0.42 [0.18,0.97]), when compared to historical control (P = 0.02). There was no change in odds of presenting with severe disease after the pandemic declaration (aOR 1.00 [95% CI 0.30, 3.38] P < 0.99) despite significantly longer lengths of symptoms reported in mild cases. CONCLUSIONS: Postpandemic declaration we experienced a significant decrease in cholecystitis admissions without corresponding increases in disease severity. The pandemic impacted healthcare-seeking behaviors, with fewer mild presentations. Given that the pandemic did not increase odds of presenting with increased severity of disease, our data suggests that not all mild cases of cholecystitis progress to worsening disease and some may resolve without medical or surgical intervention.","output":"COVID-19 Pandemic and the Cholecystitis Experience at a Major Urban Safety-Net Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in Alaska Native children from the Yukon Kuskokwim (YK) Delta is associated with a hospitalization rate five times higher than that reported for the general US child population.

Symptomatic patients presenting at the Emergency Departments 2. Asymptomatic patients screened upon hospitalization and 3. Health-care workers (HCW) following SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated. To estimate the association between Ct value, Ag-RDT and the number of days since SARS-CoV-2 exposure or symptomatic COVID-19, a mixed model was applied. Results: A total of 5172 samples were obtained from 4595 individuals, with Ag-RDT and qRT-PCR results. Of these, 485 samples were positive by qRT-PCR. The PPA of Ag-RDT was greater for lower Ct values, reaching 93% in cases where Ct value was lower than 25 and 85% where Ct value was lower than 30. PPA was similar between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. The NPV and PPV were 96.8% and 99.1%, respectively.

We measured the prevalence and risk factors of different forms of violence against women and girls in South Sudan, which has suffered decades of conflict, most recently in 2013. METHODS: A population-based survey was conducted among women aged 15C64 in three conflict-affected sites in South Sudan: Juba, Rumbek, and the Protection of Civilian Sites (PoCs) in Juba between 2015 and 2016. FINDINGS: A total of 2,244 women between the ages of 15C64 were interviewed. Fifty percent (in the Juba PoCs) to 65% (in Juba and Rumbek) of all female respondents experienced either physical or sexual violence from a partner or non-partner in the course of their lifetimes. Approximately 35% of respondents have experienced rape, attempted rape or other forms of sexual violence by a non-partner during their lifetime. For ever-partnered women, lifetime prevalence of physical and/or sexual partner violence ranged between 54% in the Juba PoCs and 73% in Rumbek. Restrictive marital practices and gender norms, and experiences of conflict were major drivers of both partner and non-partner violence. CONCLUSION: Women and girls in South Sudan suffer among the highest levels of physical and sexual violence in the world. Although the prevalence of sexual assault by non-partners is four times the global average, women are still at greatest risk of physical and sexual assault from intimate partners. Conflict-related and intimate partner violence reinforce each other and are upheld by restrictive gender norms and marital practices.

In this study, a comprehensive investigation on the adsorption behaviour of nonionic and anionic individual surfactants; namely, alkyl polyglucoside (APG) and alkyl ether carboxylate (AEC) was performed using static adsorption experiments, isotherm modelling using (Langmuir, Freundlich, Sips, and Temkin models), adsorption simulation using a state-of-the-art method, binary mixture prediction using the modified extended Langmuir model (MEL), and artificial neural network (ANN) prediction. Static adsorption experiments revealed higher adsorption capacity of APG as compared to AEC, with sips being the most fitted model with R(2) (0.9915 and 0.9926, for APG and AEC respectively). It was indicated that both monolayer and multilayer adsorption took place in a heterogeneous adsorption system with non-uniform surfactant molecules distribution, which was in remarkable agreement with the simulation results. The (APG/AEC) binary mixture prediction depicted contradictory results to the experimental individual behaviour, showing that AEC had more affinity to adsorb in competition with APG for the adsorption sites on the rock surface. The adopted ANN model showed good agreement with the experimental data and the simulated adsorption values for APG and AEC showed a decreasing trend as temperature increases. Simulating the impact of binary surfactant adsorption can provide a tremendous advantage of demonstrating the binary system behaviour with less experimental data. The utilization of ANN for such prediction procedure can minimize the experimental time, operating cost and give feasible predictions compared to other computational methods.

However, there is a need to identify best practices in the use of digital technologies to effectively reach, support, and manage care for patients living with SMDs. In this review, we summarize recent studies using digital technology to manage symptoms and support clinical care for this patient population and discuss new opportunities to advance digital psychiatry research and practice in LMICs. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies evaluating digital interventions for clinical populations living with SMDs in LMICs are limited. Yet, across recent articles surveyed, digital technology appears to yield diverse benefits for this at-risk patient population. These benefits include improved medication adherence, appointment adherence, reduced instances of relapse, and fewer re-hospitalizations. SUMMARY: Continued rigorous research evaluating effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of digital technologies in reaching, treating, and managing symptoms and supporting clinical care for patients with SMDs in LMICs is vital. The urgency for remote approaches for delivering specialized psychiatric care is particularly pronounced because of the immediate and long-term impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on access to in-person services.

Within 10 days of identification of the first healthcare worker infection, both hospitals had closed, and all patients were discharged or decanted to other facilities within the state. The entire hospital staff (approximately 1300 people) and their households (approximately 3000-4000 people) were furloughed for 14 days to halt the spread of infection. During the furlough period, a decommissioning, terminal clean and recommissioning process was undertaken alongside recovery and reorientation of the workforce to personal protective equipment. Within 4 days of closure, an Australian Defence Force and Australian Medical Assistance Team team opened the prioritised emergency department to provide emergency care for the local community, supported by modified diagnostic services. The decommissioning and cleaning rolled on over the ensuing month, in a predetermined priority order. As staff returned from quarantine, they recommissioned their clinical areas.

However, the negative effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescents mental health might be moderated by their existing psychological resources. The present study sought to investigate whether the relationship between adolescents perceived stress of the COVID-19 pandemic and their depression symptoms was alleviated by their character strengths. A total of 617 adolescents were recruited and completed the online survey during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results indicated that adolescents perceived stress of the COVID-19 pandemic was significantly positively correlated with their depression symptoms. Character strengths were significantly negatively correlated with adolescents perceived stress of the COVID-19 pandemic and their depression symptoms. Moreover, the moderating effect of character strengths on the relationship between adolescents perceived stress of the COVID-19 pandemic and their depression symptoms was significant. Therefore, adolescents character strengths as a protective factor could buffer the effect of perceived stress of the COVID-19 pandemic on their depression symptoms and contribute to maintaining their mental health.","output":"Perceived Stress of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Adolescents Depression Symptoms: The Moderating Role of Character Strengths"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The search for inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 viral replication depends on an in-depth knowledge of the different stages of the viral cycle. The macro-molecular level focuses on the interactions between the virus and the infected cell, while the micro-molecular level focuses on the different biochemical reactions leading to the production of new viruses. Here, a hybrid approach for modeling the SARS-CoV-2 viral replication in the micro- and macro-molecular levels is presented. The proposed approach combines ontology engineering and DEVS modeling. Biological knowledge at the micro-level of the viral system is capitalized by ontological models, while the dynamic behavior of SARS-CoV-2 molecular mechanisms are modeled by DEVS models. The proposed DEVS approach uses ontological concepts and SWRL rules to compute the main functions and behaviour of the molecular components involved in the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle. We illustrate the proposed approach through the simulation of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins production by cellular ribosomes. ? 2021 Society for Modeling & Simulation International (SCS).","output":"Combining devs and semantic technologies for modeling the Sars-Cov-2 replication machinery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic heart failure (CHF) leads to an excess of urgent ambulatory visits, recurrent hospital admissions, morbidity, and mortality regardless of medical and non-medical management of the disease. This excess of risk may be attributable, at least in part, to comorbid conditions influencing the development and progression of CHF. In this perspective, the authors examined and described the most common endocrine disorders observed in patients with CHF, particularly in individuals with reduced ejection fraction, aiming to qualify the risks, quantify the epidemiological burden and discuss about the potential role of endocrine treatment. Thyroid dysfunction is commonly observed in patients with CHF, and sometimes it could be the consequence of certain medications (e.g., amiodarone). Male and female hypogonadism may also coexist in this clinical context, contributing to deteriorating the prognosis of these patients. Furthermore, growth hormone deficiency may affect the development of adult myocardium and predispose to CHF. Limited recommendation suggests to screen endocrine disorders in CHF patients, but it could be interesting to evaluate possible endocrine dysfunction in this setting, especially when a high suspicion coexists. Data referring to long-term safety and effectiveness of endocrine treatments in patients with CHF are limited, and their impact on several hard endpoints (such as hospital admission, all-cause, and cardiovascular mortality) are still poorly understood.","output":"Endocrine system dysfunction and chronic heart failure: a clinical perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cruise tourism is becoming increasingly popular worldwide. However, the health and safety of thousands of cruise tourists have been put in jeopardy due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The refusal of cruise ships calling has been the most significant reason behind the health hazards faced by passengers. Moreover, some coastal States have decided to close their borders, leaving passengers to their own fate in the case of a COVID-19 outbreak on board. Situation analysis contributes to demonstrating obstacles encountered in public health governance on cruise tourism. Information is collected from official websites of governments and international organizations to investigate the reasons behind the non-compliance of these countries with the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005). Academic literatures showcase different views on the necessity of revising the IHR (2005). Statistical analysis is used to assess core capacities required by the IHR (2005) of the coastal States. Coastal States reserve their rights to refuse foreign cruise ships to enter ports and to prevent the persons aboard from embarking or disembarking so long as conditions under Article 43 are met. However, some foreign cruise ships were directly refused to call by various coastal States without scientific evidence. This practice stems largely from the high risk of COVID-19 outbreaks in cruise ships and the resulting burden from the cruise pandemic response. Compared with improving IHR (2005), especially its dispute settlement mechanism, helping coastal States to boost their core capacities is more conducive to solving the problem of cruise public health governance. The improvement of core capacities can be carried out from the aspects of surveillance of cruise ships and risk assessment, medical examinations on cruise travelers, cruise design and cruise tourism management.

However, in the natural environment, the biodegradation of plastics is usually slow or incomplete due to unfavorable conditions and leads to faster micro-bioplastic formation. Many analytical methods were developed to determine microplastics, but micro-bioplastics are still overlooked. This work presents a simple method for determining poly-3-hydroxybutyrate and polylactic acid micro-bioplastics in soil based on the thermogravimetryCmass spectrometry analysis of low molecular gases evolved during pyrolysis. For the method development, model soils containing different soil organic carbon contents were spiked with micro-bioplastics. Specific gaseous pyrolysis products of the analytes were identified, while the ratio of their amounts appeared to be constant above the level of detection of the suggested method. The constant ratio was explained as a lower soil influence on the evolution of the gaseous product, and it was suggested as an additional identification parameter. The advantages of the presented method are no sample pretreatment, presumably no need for an internal standard, low temperature needed for the transfer of gaseous products and the possibility of using its principles with other, cheaper detectors. The method can find application in the verification of biodegradation tests and in the monitoring of soils after the application of biodegradable products.","output":"A Simple Method for Quantification of Polyhydroxybutyrate and Polylactic Acid Micro-Bioplastics in Soils by Evolved Gas Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: This is the 38th Annual Report of the American Association of Poison Control Centers' (AAPCC) National Poison Data System (NPDS). As of 1 January, 2020, all 55 of the nation's poison centers (PCs) uploaded case data automatically to NPDS. The upload interval was 6.15 [4.60, 8.62] (median [25%, 75%]) minutes, effectuating a near real-time national exposure and information database and surveillance system. METHODS: We analyzed the case data tabulating specific indices from NPDS. The methodology was similar to that of previous years. Where changes were introduced, the differences are identified. Cases with medical outcomes of death were evaluated by a team of medical and clinical toxicologist reviewers using an ordinal scale of 1-6 to assess the Relative Contribution to Fatality (RCF) of the exposure. RESULTS: In 2020, 3,316,738 closed encounters were logged by NPDS: 2,128,198 human exposures, 66,745 animal exposures, 1,116,568 information requests, and 5,160 human confirmed nonexposures. Total encounters showed a 28.9% increase from 2019, while health care facility (HCF) human exposure cases decreased by 10.6%. While all information requests increased by 218.0%, medication identification (Drug ID) requests decreased by 31.5%, and human exposure cases decreased by 0.928%. Medical Information requests showed a 32.6-fold increase, reflecting COVID-19 pandemic calls to PCs. Human exposures with less serious outcomes have decreased 1.90% per year since 2008, while those with more serious outcomes (moderate, major or death) have increased 4.59% per year since 2000.Consistent with the previous year, the top 5 substance classes most frequently involved in all human exposures were analgesics (10.3%), household cleaning substances (8.37%), cosmetics/personal care products (6.53%), antidepressants (5.30%), and sedatives/hypnotics/antipsychotics (4.92%). As a class, antidepressant exposures increased most rapidly, by 1,793 cases/year (5.84%/year) over the past 10 years for cases with more serious outcomes.The top 5 most common exposures in children age 5 years or less were cosmetics/personal care products (11.8%), household cleaning substances (11.3%), analgesics (7.57%), foreign bodies/toys/miscellaneous (6.71%), and dietary supplements/herbals/homeopathic (6.44%). Drug identification requests comprised 2.89% of all information contacts. NPDS documented 4,488 human exposures resulting in death; 3,869 (86.2%) of these were judged as related (RCF of 1-Undoubtedly responsible, 2-Probably responsible, or 3-Contributory). CONCLUSIONS: These data support the continued value of PC expertise and need for specialized medical toxicology information to manage more serious exposures. Unintentional and intentional exposures continue to be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the US. The near real-time status of NPDS represents a national public health resource to collect and monitor US exposure cases and information contacts. The continuing mission of NPDS is to provide a nationwide infrastructure for surveillance for all types of exposures (e.g., foreign body, infectious, venomous, chemical agent, or commercial product), and the identification and tracking of significant public health events. NPDS is a model system for the near real-time surveillance of national and global public health.","output":"2020 Annual Report of the American Association of Poison Control Centers' National Poison Data System (NPDS): 38th Annual Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In January 2021, a total of 57 infectious diseases were reported globally, affecting 225 countries and regions.

This study applied a cross-sectional design with data collected from 128 older adults in June 2020, who were trained as volunteers in a volunteer program that began before COVID-19. The study found that older adults continued to actively contribute to their communities by engaging in volunteering during COVID-19. The specific type of volunteering activities was linked to few depressive and anxiety symptoms. Older adults with increased self-esteem prior to COVID-19 were more likely to participate in volunteering activities related to COVID-19.

They were initially characterised as inhibitors of lysosomal cysteine proteases, however, in recent years some alternative functions for cystatins have been proposed. Cystatins possessing inhibitory function are members of three families, family I (stefins), family II (cystatins) and family III (kininogens). Stefin A is often linked to neoplastic changes in epithelium while another family I cystatin, stefin B is supposed to have a specific role in neuredegenerative diseases. Cystatin C, a typical type II cystatin, is expressed in a variety of human tissues and cells. On the other hand, expression of other type II cystatins is more specific. Cystatin F is an endo/lysosome targeted protease inhibitor, selectively expressed in immune cells, suggesting its role in processes related to immune response. Our recent work points on its role in regulation of dendritic cell maturation and in natural killer cells functional inactivation that may enhance tumor survival. Cystatin E/M expression is mainly restricted to the epithelia of the skin which emphasizes its prominent role in cutaneous biology. Here, we review the current knowledge on type I (stefins A and B) and type II cystatins (cystatins C, F and E/M) in pathologies, with particular emphasis on their suppressive vs. promotional function in the tumorigenesis and metastasis. We proposed that an imbalance between cathepsins and cystatins may attenuate immune cell functions and facilitate tumor cell invasion.","output":"Cystatins in Immune System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] We have developed dissipative particle dynamics models for pure dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC), and dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) as well as their binary and ternary mixed membranes, as coronavirus model membranes. The stabilities of pure and mixed membranes, surrounded by aqueous solutions containing up to 70 mol % ethanol (alcoholic disinfectants), have been investigated at room temperature. We found that aqueous solutions containing 5C10 mol % ethanol already have a significant weakening effect on the pure and mixed membranes. The magnitude of the effect depends on the membrane composition and the ethanol concentration. Ethanol permeabilizes the membrane, causing its lateral swelling and thickness shrinking and reducing the orientational order of the hydrocarbon tail of the bilayer. The free energy barrier for the permeation of ethanol in the bilayers is considerably reduced by the ethanol uptake. The rupture-critical ethanol concentrations causing the membrane failure are 20.7, 27.5, and 31.7 mol % in the aqueous phase surrounding pure DMPC, DOPC, and DPPC membranes, respectively. Characterizing the failure of lipid membranes by a machine-learning neural network framework, we found that all mixed binary and/or ternary membranes disrupt when immersed in an aqueous solution containing a rupture-critical ethanol concentration, ranging from 20.7 to 31.7 mol %, depending on the composition of the membrane; the DPPC-rich membranes are more intact, while the DMPC-rich membranes are least intact. Due to the tight packing of long, saturated hydrocarbon tails in DPPC, increasing the DPPC content of the mixed membrane increases its stability against the disinfectant. At high DPPC concentrations, where the DOPC and DMPC molecules are confined between the DPPC lipids, the ordered hydrocarbon tails of DPPC also induce order in the DOPC and DMPC molecules and, hence, stabilize the membrane more. Our simulations on pure and mixed membranes of a diversity of compositions reveal that a maximum ethanol concentration of 32 mol % (55 wt %) in the alcohol-based disinfectants is enough to disintegrate any membrane composed of these three lipids.","output":"How Ethanolic Disinfectants Disintegrate Coronavirus Model Membranes: A Dissipative Particle Dynamics Simulation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Containing the COVID-19 pandemic is dependent on compliance with public health recommendations and mandates which is lower in younger compared to older adults. Furthermore, younger adults have demonstrated lower uptake of COVID-19 vaccines. The aim of this study was to assess preferences for COVID-19 related preventive health measures and vaccination and to explore their association with COVID-19 vaccine acceptability. Canadians aged 18-39 years were invited to participate in a web-based survey in August 2021. We used the Best-Worst-Scale (BWS) methodology to collect and analyze preference data and multivariable binary logistic regression to estimate associations with vaccine acceptability. Based on 266 complete responses, we found strong preferences for physical distancing and wearing face masks, as compared to general hygiene and respiratory etiquette. High vaccine accessibility independent of the location, receiving successive doses of the same vaccine brand and higher vaccine uptake of people in younger adults' social circle were highly preferred. Higher preferences for mandates requiring proof of vaccination and altruistic motives for vaccination were associated with vaccine acceptability. As the COVID-19 pandemic waxes and wanes, studies using larger, nationally representative samples are needed to replicate and validate these results to assess preferences for health behaviors corresponding to the latest recommendations. The use of this methodology could provide public health authorities with a unique opportunity to develop targeted, preference-based messaging that aligns with the latest guidelines to effectively encourage compliance and COVID-19 vaccine uptake.","output":"Using Best-Worst Scaling to investigate younger adult Canadians' preferences for COVID-19 vaccination and public health measures: an observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"What is COVID-19's impact on development?

PATIENTS AND METHODS The patients were enrolled into the study having poor pulmonary function (forced expiratory volume in 1 s <1.5 L) and undergoing radical resection of pulmonary carcinoma requiring at least 2 h of OLV. Patients were respectively allocated to VCV group and PCV group. The intraoperative data, arterial, and mixed venous blood gases were obtained at baseline, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 min after OLV and end of surgery. The postoperative data had been recorded and arterial gas measurements were performed at 6, 12 and 24 h after surgery in Intensive Care Unit. RESULTS Comparison of the VCV group and PCV group, PaO2 and P(A-a)O2 were higher and dead space to tidal volume was lower in the PCV group (P < 0.05) after the point of OLV +60, Ppeak was higher in the VCV group (P < 0.05). There were significant advantages in PCV groups with regard to the PaO2 of three points in postoperation, the duration of postoperative ventilation duration, intensive care duration of stay and the days stay in hospital after surgery.

Sintering parameters affect phase composition, grain growth and porosity of the material which, in turn, influence both mechanical and optical properties. Discrepancies of + /- 5% are common between actual and displayed firing temperatures depending on sintering furnace brand and condition. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate how such sintering temperature deviations in dental furnaces compared to the recommended firing protocols affected certain material properties of different yttria-stabilized zirconia materials. METHODS Disc-shaped specimens were made from four different translucent and high translucent YSZ-powders and analysed regarding crystal structure; unit cell volume for the c, t, and t' -phases along with the tetragonality for the t and t' phases. Biaxial flexure strength and the spectral transmittance through the ceramic specimens were also measured. RESULTS Deviations of 5% from the sintering temperature recommended for YSZ materials with different yttria content influenced material properties such as light transmittance, flexural strength, crystal phase fractions, tetragonality, and grain growth. Too low temperature resulted in decreased strength for some of the translucent zirconia materials, while others where less affected. Light transmittance varied depending on several factors such as grain size, crystal phase fractions and binder content in the start material prior to pre-sintering.

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is an infectious disease that has led to a worldwide public health emergency. More than 30,000 cases were confirmed in Brazil, especially in the States of S?o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Cear. The capital of the Cear State is the one with the highest incidence of COVID-19 in Brazil. Estimating the prevalence of the disease and its associated factors is important to offer adequate health care. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study with secondary data of people notified with flu-like syndrome and COVID-19 test results. METHODS: 19,967 cases of flu-like syndrome were analysed according to the result of the COVID-19 test. Predictive variables were as follows: age range, sex, women in puerperium, presence or absence of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, haematological illness, immunodeficiencies, neurological diseases, obesity, renal diseases and Down syndrome. Robust Poisson regression models estimated the prevalence ratios of COVID-19. The research was reported via STROBE guidelines for cross-sectional studies. RESULTS: The prevalence of COVID-19 in the population was 10.37%. In the final model, the following variables were associated with COVID-19: aged people, male sex, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. CONCLUSION: Among the flu-like syndrome cases, COVID-19 prevalence was high. In the Cear State, clinical factors such as aged people, male sex, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes can enhance the prevalence of COVID-19 by up to 2.57 times. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The identification of factors that are associated with the enhanced prevalence of COVID-19 facilitates early diagnosis, and adequate and prompt treatment. This knowledge may avoid an unfavourable prognosis of the disease.","output":"COVID-19 in a state of Brazilian Northeast: Prevalence and associated factors in people with flu-like syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bu yaz? feminizm, topyalar, insan sonras? ve toplumsal cinsiyet sonras? bir ?zne arayna ili?kin d?nsel bir patikan?n izini srmeye ?alyor.

There have been recommendations to discontinue these medications, which are essential in the treatment of several chronic disease conditions, while, in the absence of clinical evidence, professional societies have advocated their continued use. Objective To study the association between use of ACEIs/ARBs with the likelihood of testing positive for COVID-19 and to study outcome data in subsets of patients taking ACEIs/ARBs who tested positive with severity of clinical outcomes of COVID-19 (eg, hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and requirement for mechanical ventilation). Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort study with overlap propensity score weighting was conducted at the Cleveland Clinic Health System in Ohio and Florida. All patients tested for COVID-19 between March 8 and April 12, 2020, were included. Exposures History of taking ACEIs or ARBs at the time of COVID-19 testing. Main Outcomes and Measures Results of COVID-19 testing in the entire cohort, number of patients requiring hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions, and mechanical ventilation among those who tested positive. Results A total of 18 472 patients tested for COVID-19. The mean (SD) age was 49 (21) years, 7384 (40%) were male, and 12 725 (69%) were white. Of 18 472 patients who underwent COVID-19 testing, 2285 (12.4%) were taking either ACEIs or ARBs. A positive COVID-19 test result was observed in 1735 of 18 472 patients (9.4%). Among patients who tested positive, 421 (24.3%) were admitted to the hospital, 161 (9.3%) were admitted to an intensive care unit, and 111 (6.4%) required mechanical ventilation. Overlap propensity score weighting showed no significant association of ACEI and/or ARB use with COVID-19 test positivity (overlap propensity score-weighted odds ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.81-1.15). Conclusions and Relevance This study found no association between ACEI or ARB use and COVID-19 test positivity.

Whilst myocardial involvement in hospitalized patients has been extensively described in literature, no data are currently available for non-hospitalized individuals. Present study aimed to explore prevalence and impact on patients management of myocardial damage detected with CMR, in a cohort of consecutive non-hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infection patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a single centre prospective observational study on 31 consecutive patients with previous COVID-19 who underwent CMR between October 2020 and June 2021 without requiring hospital admission. Myocarditis was defined by CMR according to the revised Lake Louise Criteria (LLC), if at least one criterion was positive: T2-based marker for myocardial oedema and T1-based marker for associated myocardial injury. Our patients cohort included 31 individuals with a mean age of 42.5  17.4 years (20 males; 64.5%) with mean follow-up time of 365.8  89 days between first positive PCR and last clinical evaluation. CMR evidence of cardiac involvement was observed in six patients (19.3%)including two acute (of which one with pericardial inflammation), one subacute and three healed myocarditis. CMR abnormalities were associated with a higher percentage of palpitations (83% vs. 24%, P = 0.013) and chest pain (66% vs. 16%, P = 0.026) during the active phase of COVID-19. In all CMR positive cases, a tailored therapeutic approach was established consisting with the administration of cardioactive therapy with beta-blockers. All cases were uneventful during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed a 19.3% prevalence of unexpected/subclinical myocardial involvement in a cohort of 31 consecutive non-hospitalized patients with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Subgenomic mRNA transcription and genome replication are directed by the viral replicase, which is expressed in the form of two polyproteins and subsequently processed into smaller nonstructural proteins (nsps).

Since the relationship of poor housing conditions with incidence and mortality of COVID-19 is unknown, we investigated the association between poor housing condition and COVID-19 incidence and mortality in US counties. METHODS: We conducted cross-sectional analysis of county-level data from the US Centers for Disease Control, US Census Bureau and John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center for 3135 US counties. The exposure of interest was percentage of households with poor housing conditions (one or greater of: overcrowding, high housing cost, incomplete kitchen facilities, or incomplete plumbing facilities). Outcomes were incidence rate ratios (IRR) and mortality rate ratios (MRR) of COVID-19 across US counties through 4/21/2020. Multilevel generalized linear modeling (with total population of each county as a denominator) was utilized to estimate relative risk of incidence and mortality related to poor housing conditions with adjustment for population density and county characteristics including demographics, income, education, prevalence of medical comorbidities, access to healthcare insurance and emergency rooms, and state-level COVID-19 test density. We report incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and mortality ratios (MRRs) for a 5% increase in prevalence in households with poor housing conditions. RESULTS: Across 3135 US counties, the mean percentage of households with poor housing conditions was 14.2% (range 2.7% to 60.2%). On April 21(st), the mean (SD) number of cases and deaths of COVID-19 were 255.68 (2877.03) cases and 13.90 (272.22) deaths per county, respectively.

Based on 3,513 valid questionnaires on the long-term care and protection needs of Chinese residents, this paper uses a logit regression model to analyze the factors influencing the willingness of the elderly to choose nursing care. The results show that intergenerational family support for the elderly is a significant psychological driver on the willingness of the elderly to choose nursing care. Compared with the elderly living with family, empty nesters or older people living alone are more inclined to select nursing care when they have difficulties taking care of themselves. The physical health of the elderly affects their willingness to choose nursing care, and elderly individuals with more hospitalizations are less likely to select nursing care. In addition, elderly females who are relatively young, have a high level of education, have a high income, have a nursing home near the residence, and are already covered by medical insurance are more willing to choose nursing care.

METHODS: This is a descriptive analysis of the responses from Brazilian vascular surgeons to the cross-sectional anonymous Society for Vascular Surgery Wellness Task Force Pandemic Practice, Anxiety, Coping, and Support Survey for Vascular Surgeons disseminated 14-24 April 2020. Survey dissemination in Brazil occurred mainly via the Brazilian Society of Angiology and Vascular Surgery (SBACV) and social media. The survey evaluated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on vascular surgeons' lives by assessing COVID-19-related stressors, anxiety using theGeneral Anxiety Disorder (GAD)-7 scale, and coping strategies using the Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (Brief-COPE) inventory. RESULTS: A total of 452 responses were recorded from Brazil, with 335 (74%) respondents completing the entire survey. The majority of respondents were males (N = 301, 67%) and practiced in an urban hospitals. The majority of respondents considered themselves at high risk to be infected with COVID-19 (N = 251, 55.8%), and just over half the respondents noted that they had adequate PPE at their primary hospital (N = 171, 54%). One hundred and nine (35%) surgeons confirmed that their hospitals followed professional surgical society guidelines for prioritizing surgeries during the pandemic. At the time of the survey, only 33 (10%) surgeons stated they have pre-operative testing of patients for COVID-19 available at their hospital. Academic vascular surgeons reported being redeployed more often to help with other non-vascular duties compared to community-based or solo practitioners (43% vs. 30% vs. 21% respectively, P = .01). Severe anxiety due to pandemic-related financial concerns was similar in those surgeons practicing solo compared to those in community- or academic-based/group practice (46% vs. 38% vs. 22%; P = .54). The respondents reported their anxiety levels as mild based on the stressors investigated instead of moderate-severe (54% vs. 46%; P = .04). Social media was utilized heavily during the pandemic, with video gatherings being the most commonly used tool (76%). Self-distraction (60%) and situational acceptance (81%) were the most frequently reported coping mechanisms used among Brazilian vascular surgeons.

A cross-sectional survey among Malaysian Hajj and Umrah pilgrims in 2018. The uptake of the recommended vaccines was surveyed through an anonymous self-administered questionnaire to pilgrims attending a pre-departure Hajj/Umrah orientation course. Descriptive statistics were used for elaborating the demographic characteristics and vaccines uptake of the respondents. Multiple logistic regression was used for predicting the factors associated with the vaccines' uptake. A total of 1,274 pilgrims participated in the study with a mean age (standard deviation) of 42.42 (15.6). A total of 833 (65.4%) participants were females and 232 of the participants (18.2%) had at least more than one chronic disease. The uptake of influenza and pneumococcal vaccines were 28.6% (364/1,274) and 25.4% (324/1,274), respectively. Among the 527 pilgrims who were at increased risk of infections, 168 (31.9%) and 184 (34.9%) received influenza and pneumococcal vaccines, respectively. Gender, marital status and occupation were the common predictors associated with vaccines uptake. The vaccination uptake among Malaysian Hajj and Umrah pilgrims is low and declining from previous years.

Although large-scale studies have ruled out this concern, it is common experience that patients with COVID-19 taking ACE inhibitors or ARBs are at increased risk of death. The aim of this study was to investigate the reasons for this apparently high mortality rate. METHODS: During the first wave of the pandemic, we conducted a field study of 427 consecutive patients with COVID-19 upon their admission to the emergency department of a hospital in one of the most severely hit cities in northern Italy, and 30 days later. The disease was defined as being mild, moderate or severe on the basis of clinical, laboratory and imaging data, and a multivariate model was used to analyse the determinants of mortality. RESULTS: Within 30 days of admission, 31.6% of the patients treated with ACE inhibitors or ARBs and 15.2% of those not treated with these drugs had died. Multivariate analysis showed that the determinants of mortality were age (p = 0.0001), hypertension (p = 0.0120) and diabetes (p = 0.0129), whereas ACE inhibitors or ARBs had no effect on mortality. There was no significant difference between the patients treated with ACE inhibitors and those treated with ARBs. CONCLUSION: The apparently increased mortality of patients with COVID-19 receiving long-term treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs is not due to the drugs themselves, but to the conditions associated with their use.","output":"Mortality in Patients with COVID-19 on Renin Angiotensin System Inhibitor Long-Term Treatment: An Observational Study Showing that Things Are Not Always as They Seem"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Development of the STEM curriculum played a key role in economic development because it enabled the production of well-qualified production from schools.

As the COVID-19 pandemic brought our social lives to an abrupt pause in March, 2020, older adults were encouraged to remain isolated from friends and family. Social distancing guidelines led many older people to decrease social interactions with others. Using a community-based longitudinal study of women age 60+, we examined how changes in feelings of social connections with others influenced loneliness in October 2020 relative to prior to the pandemic (in September 2018). Our previous research has shown that psychological resilience decreases the negative consequences of major life stressors in later life. We hypothesized that women with high social consequences of the pandemic would experience increased loneliness, but resilience would buffer these effects. In line with our hypotheses, results showed that those who reported significant declines in social connectedness with others during the pandemic (i.e., high social consequences) experienced significant increases in loneliness (beta=0.125; p<0.001). Resilience, alternatively, was significantly associated with decreased loneliness (beta=-0.05; p<0.05), and buffered the social consequences of the pandemic. That is, as resilience increased, the social consequences of COVID-19 significantly declined (p<0.01), and resilience attenuated the negative consequences of high levels of social consequences of COVID-19 on loneliness, while those with high social consequences and low resilience experienced significant increases in loneliness in association with the pandemic.

Methods Forty-seven inpatients with confirmed COVID-19 had blood samples drawn on admission for assessing serum biomarkers of CNS injury by Single molecule array (Simoa), NfL and GFAp. Concentrations of NfL and GFAp were analyzed in relation to symptoms, clinical signs, inflammatory biomarkers and clinical outcomes. We used multivariate linear models to test for differences in biomarker concentrations in the subgroups, accounting for confounding effects. Results In total, 21 % (n=10) of the patients were admitted to an intensive care unit, whereas the overall mortality rate was 13 % (n=6). Non-survivors had higher serum concentrations of NfL (p<0.001) than patients who were discharged alive both in adjusted analyses (p=2.6 x 10-7) and unadjusted analyses (p=0.001). The concentrations of NfL in non-survivors increased over repeated measurements whereas the concentrations in survivors were stable. Significantly higher concentrations of NfL were found in patients reporting fatigue, while reduced concentrations were found in patients experiencing cough, myalgia and joint pain. The GFAp concentration was also significantly higher in non-survivors than survivors (p=0.02).

The design of optimal coronavirus vaccines therefore remains a priority. Such vaccines present major challenges: coronavirus immunity often wanes rapidly, individuals needing to be protected include the elderly, and vaccines may exacerbate rather than prevent coronavirus lung immunopathology. To address these issues, we compared in a murine model a range of recombinant spike protein or inactivated whole-virus vaccine candidates alone or adjuvanted with either alum, CpG, or Advax, a new delta inulin-based polysaccharide adjuvant. While all vaccines protected against lethal infection, addition of adjuvant significantly increased serum neutralizing-antibody titers and reduced lung virus titers on day 3 postchallenge. Whereas unadjuvanted or alum-formulated vaccines were associated with significantly increased lung eosinophilic immunopathology on day 6 postchallenge, this was not seen in mice immunized with vaccines formulated with delta inulin adjuvant. Protection against eosinophilic immunopathology by vaccines containing delta inulin adjuvants correlated better with enhanced T-cell gamma interferon (IFN-) recall responses rather than reduced interleukin-4 (IL-4) responses, suggesting that immunopathology predominantly reflects an inadequate vaccine-induced Th1 response. This study highlights the critical importance for development of effective and safe coronavirus vaccines of selection of adjuvants based on the ability to induce durable IFN- responses. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (MERS-CoV) cause high case fatality rates and remain major human public health threats, creating a need for effective vaccines. While coronavirus antigens that induce protective neutralizing antibodies have been identified, coronavirus vaccines present a unique problem in that immunized individuals when infected by virus can develop lung eosinophilic pathology, a problem that is further exacerbated by the formulation of SARS-CoV vaccines with alum adjuvants. This study shows that formulation of SARS-CoV spike protein or inactivated whole-virus vaccines with novel delta inulin-based polysaccharide adjuvants enhances neutralizing-antibody titers and protection against clinical disease but at the same time also protects against development of lung eosinophilic immunopathology. It also shows that immunity achieved with delta inulin adjuvants is long-lived, thereby overcoming the natural tendency for rapidly waning coronavirus immunity. Thus, delta inulin adjuvants may offer a unique ability to develop safer and more effective coronavirus vaccines.","output":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus vaccines formulated with delta inulin adjuvants provide enhanced protection while ameliorating lung eosinophilic immunopathology."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The covid-19 pandemic case has changed the structure of life in all aspects throughout the world The field of man-made environment or architecture is no exception The interior arrangement of a building, as part of the man-made environment, is also affected The interior design of a building today seems to be obliged to participate in following the standards of new health-protocols in the new normal era What about the interior of the building that has already been utilized?

Identification of clinical phenotypes may facilitate tailored therapy and improve outcomes. The purpose of this study is to identify specific clinical phenotypes across COVID-19 patients and compare admission characteristics and outcomes. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of COVID-19 patients from March 7, 2020 to August 25, 2020 at 14 U.S. hospitals. Ensemble clustering was performed on 33 variables collected within 72 hours of admission. Principal component analysis was performed to visualize variable contributions to clustering. Multinomial regression models were fit to compare patient comorbidities across phenotypes. Multivariable models were fit to estimate associations between phenotype and in-hospital complications and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: The database included 1,022 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Three clinical phenotypes were identified (I, II, III), with 236 [23.1%] patients in phenotype I, 613 [60%] patients in phenotype II, and 173 [16.9%] patients in phenotype III. Patients with respiratory comorbidities were most commonly phenotype III (p = 0.002), while patients with hematologic, renal, and cardiac (all p<0.001) comorbidities were most commonly phenotype I. Adjusted odds of respiratory, renal, hepatic, metabolic (all p<0.001), and hematological (p = 0.02) complications were highest for phenotype I.

To improve the noise robustness, we try to integrate CNNs with wavelet by replacing the common down-sampling (max-pooling, strided-convolution, and average pooling) with discrete wavelet transform (DWT). We firstly propose general DWT and inverse DWT (IDWT) layers applicable to various orthogonal and biorthogonal discrete wavelets like Haar, Daubechies, and Cohen, etc., and then design wavelet integrated CNNs (WaveCNets) by integrating DWT into the commonly used CNNs (VGG, ResNets, and DenseNet). During the down-sampling, WaveCNets apply DWT to decompose the feature maps into the low-frequency and high-frequency components. Containing the main information including the basic object structures, the low-frequency component is transmitted into the following layers to generate robust high-level features. The high-frequency components are dropped to remove most of the data noises. The experimental results show that %wavelet accelerates the CNN training, and WaveCNets achieve higher accuracy on ImageNet than various vanilla CNNs. We have also tested the performance of WaveCNets on the noisy version of ImageNet, ImageNet-C and six adversarial attacks, the results suggest that the proposed DWT/IDWT layers could provide better noise-robustness and adversarial robustness. When applying WaveCNets as backbones, the performance of object detectors (i.e., faster R-CNN and RetinaNet) on COCO detection dataset are consistently improved. We believe that suppression of aliasing effect, i.e. separation of low frequency and high frequency information, is the main advantages of our approach.

To counter these outcomes, many countries, including France, put in place strict lockdown measures, requiring the temporary closure of all but essential places and causing an unprecedented disruption of daily life. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to explore potential changes in dietary intake, physical activity, body weight, and food supply during the COVID-19 lockdown and how these differed according to individual characteristics. METHODS: The analyses included 37,252 adults from the French web-based NutriNet-Sant cohort who completed lockdown-specific questionnaires in April-May 2020. Nutrition-related changes and their sociodemographic, lifestyle, and health-status correlates were investigated using multivariable logistic regression models. Clusters of participants were defined using an ascending hierarchical classification of change profiles derived from multiple correspondence analyses. RESULTS: During the lockdown, trends of unfavorable changes were observed: decreased physical activity (reported by 53% of the participants), increased sedentary time (reported by 63%), increased snacking, decreased consumption of fresh food (especially fruit and fish), and increased consumption of sweets, cookies, and cakes. Yet, the opposite trends were also observed: increased home cooking (reported by 40%) and increased physical activity (reported by 19%). Additionally, 35% of the participants gained weight (mean weight gain in these individuals, 1.8 kg  SD 1.3 kg) and 23% lost weight (2 kg  SD 1.4 kg weight loss). All of these trends displayed associations with various individual characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that nutrition-related changes occurred during the lockdown in both unfavorable and favorable directions. The observed unfavorable changes should be considered in the event of a future lockdown, and should also be monitored to prevent an increase in the nutrition-related burden of disease, should these diet/physical activity changes be maintained in the long run. Understanding the favorable changes may help extend them on a broader scale.

This article examines the factors at play in the United States decision to bring the challenge. At the level of policy, the United States case reflects India's graduation from the protections afforded developing nations export-contingent subsidies under the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. A closer examination, however, shows that India ramped up its export-contingent subsidies just as the SCM Agreement required it to wind those subsidies down. Moreover, the expanded Indian subsidies led to increased import competition with the politically influential metals and pharmaceutical sectors in the United States, which pushed the US challenge. We reflect on the larger implications of the challenge for the future of trade rules on industrial policy.

In the current work, monocytes, obtained by adherence or by a novel negative selection procedure using specific monoclonal antibodies to lymphocyte surface antigens, supported poliovirus replication. However, total virus yield was low and infectious centers assays revealed that a minority (6%) of monocytes become productively infected. Viral yield from monocytes was lower than from the heterogeneous mononuclear cells; however, when uninfected lymphocytes were added back to infected monocytes, the higher viral yield was restored. The purity of the cells did not significantly affect the number of cells infected. These results suggest that more poliovirus is produced per cell from activated rather than unactivated monocytes. Furthermore, poliovirus replication in monocytes may reflect genuine in vivo replication and comprise a system in which to determine molecular mediators of poliovirus tissue tropism.","output":"Low levels of poliovirus replication in primary human monocytes: possible interactions with lymphocytes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To report our preliminary experience with the use of stent retrievers to cause vasodilation in patients with delayed cerebral vasospasm secondary to subarachnoid hemorrhage. METHODS Four patients from two different high volume neurointerventional centers developed cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage. In addition to standard techniques for the treatment of cerebral vasospasm, we used commercially available stent retrievers (Solitaire and Capture stent retrievers) to treat the vasospastic segment including M2, M1, A2, and A1. We evaluated the safety of this technique, degree of vasodilation, and longevity of the effect. RESULTS Stent retrievers can be used to safely achieve cerebral vasodilation in the setting of delayed cerebral vasospasm. The effect is long-lasting (>24 hours) and, in our initial experience, carries a low morbidity. We have not experienced any complications using this technique although we have noted that the radial force was not sufficient to cause vasodilation in some instances. The vasospasm did not return in the vessel segments treated with stent angioplasty in any of these cases. In two of our cases stent angioplasty resulted in the reversal of focal neurological symptoms.

By profiling isogenic cells, CD44 on tumor cells was identified as a negative regulator of in-cell killing via inhibiting CIC formation. CD44 functions to antagonize NK cell internalization by reducing N-cadherin-mediated intercellular adhesion and by enhancing Rho GTPase-regulated cellular stiffness as well. Remarkably, antibody-mediated blockade of CD44 signaling potentiated the suppressive effects of NK cells on tumor growth associated with increased heterotypic CIC formation.

The relationship between sociodemographic factors, personal values (Personal Values List), the total score of life satisfaction (Satisfaction with Life Scale) and the willingness to donate a kidney to another human was assessed using a logistic regression model. Results: The most frequently chosen personal values were: good health; physical and mental fitness; love and friendship; knowledge and wisdom. The most frequently chosen symbols of happiness were: good health, successful family life, being needed by others. The median satisfaction with life for the entire group was 20 [16; 24]. Voluntary donation of a kidney to another human being i.e., family, friends, strangers were more often declared by women (OR = 1.21; Cl95%: 1.03?1.42), for whom the most important symbol of happiness was a life full of adventures, travels (OR = 1.39; Cl95%: 1.06?1.82) and the most important personal value was goodness and tenderness (OR = 1.21; Cl95%: 1.05?1.40).

Methods: We examined the population-adjusted incidence of specialty vape shops in relation to youth race/ethnicity, neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES), and air quality (nitrogen dioxide [NO(2)]) at the census tract level across the conterminous United States for 2018. Results: We did not find disparity in vape shop incidence related to minority youth race/ethnicity. Vape shop incidence was significantly negatively associated with all the youth race/ethnicities examined. The two lowest SES quintiles had nearly double the rate of specialty vape shop incidence compared with the highest SES quintile. Specialty vape shop incidence increased with NO(2) concentration, with more vape shops in poor air quality neighborhoods. Conclusions: Specialty vape shops are disproportionately present in neighborhoods with poor air quality and where socially disadvantaged youth live. The increased incidence of vape shops in poor air quality neighborhoods, particularly in an urban context with increased traffic emissions, further points to potentially disproportionate impacts on disadvantaged populations due to cumulative social and environmental risks. This raises environmental justice and health equity concerns.

The virus carrying capacity and the decay characteristics of indoor pathogen droplets are studied in this research. Additionally, the effects of air temperature and relative humidity on the virus survival in the air or on surfaces are investigated. The removal efficiency of infectious droplet nuclei by air-conditioning filter was then determined. Thus, the transmission risk during the operation of centralized air-conditioning system is evaluated. The results show that the indoor temperature and humidity are controlled in the range of 20-25 and 40%-70% by central air-conditioning during the epidemic period, which not only benefits the health and comfort of residents, but also weakens the vitality of the virus. The larger the droplet size, the longer the viruses survive. Since the filter efficiency of air-conditioning filter increases with the increase of particle size, increasing the number of air changes of the circulating air volume can accelerate the removal of potential pathogen particles.

Probability of contracting this highly contagious infection is similar across age groups but disease severity and fatality among aged patients with or without comorbidities are reportedly higher. Previous studies suggest that age associated transcriptional changes in lung and immune system results in a proinflammatory state and increased susceptibility to infectious lung diseases. Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 infection could augment ageing-related gene expression alterations resulting in severe outcomes in elderly patients. To identify genes that can potentially increase covid-19 disease severity in ageing people, we compared age associated gene expression changes with disease-associated expression changes in lung/BALF and whole blood obtained from publicly available data. We observed (i) a significant overlap of gene expression profiles of patients' BALF and blood with lung and blood of the healthy group, respectively; (ii) a more pronounced overlap in blood compared to lung; and (iii) a similar overlap between host genes interacting with SARS-CoV-2 and ageing blood transcriptome. Pathway enrichment analysis of overlapping gene sets suggest that infection alters expression of genes already dysregulated in the elderly, which together may lead to poor prognosis. eQTLs in these genes may also confer poor outcome in young patients worsening with age and comorbidities. Further, the pronounced overlap observed in blood may explain clinical symptoms including blood clots, strokes, heart attack, multi-organ failure etc. in severe cases.

By recognizing and attaching to human cells, these spike proteins spearhead the process of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection in the body. Thus, understanding their architecture and mechanics is critical to pinpointing the vulnerabilities of this coronavirus and guiding therapeutic development. To that end, here we present a review of the latest discoveries in the spike proteins structure and function alongside a physical model of the spike protein, highlighting features of clinical interest in antibody, small\\\\molecule drug, and vaccine development. The spike protein is comprised of two functional domains. The outer S1 domain includes the receptor binding domain, which recognizes and binds to an angiotensin\\\\converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the surface of a lung, heart, kidney, or intestinal cell. Then, facilitated by the highly flexible inner S2 domain, the spike protein folds in on itself and fuses the viral envelope with the plasma membrane of the human cell. In doing so, the spike protein opens the doors for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 to release its viral genome inside the cell. Because spike proteins are glycoproteins, meaning their ectodomain is covered with sugar chains, the virus can evade the detection of the immune system and spread quickly throughout vital organs The spike protein's position on the outer surface of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 and its critical role in the virus's function makes it one of the most promising targets for a coronavirus therapeutic. One novel approach to targeting spike proteins is the design of Anti\\\\S1 antibodies, which disarm the virus's ability to bind to the cell by attaching to the S1 subunit. The current challenge to antibody development is the flexibility of the S1 domain, which makes fusion highly effective. Further research is needed to stabilize the spike protein and maximize the efficacy of antibodies in inhibiting the virus's function. Another intriguing approach to coronavirus therapeutics is small\\\\molecule drug development. When linoleic acid (LA), an essential fatty acid molecule that maintains lung cell membranes, nestles into a newly discovered druggable pocket of the spike protein, the spike protein is locked into a less flexible, less infectious form. This new pocket is a putative binding site for even more potent small\\\\molecule inhibitors, which may be able to trap the spike protein in a completely non\\\\infectious form. With each new discovery surrounding the structure of the spike proteins at the heart of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, we advance one step closer to developing novel therapeutics that trap SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 in a virtually non\\\\infectious state.","output":"SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 Spike Proteins: A Key Target for COVID\\\\19 Therapeutics Development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the Overview: On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at home to disrupt the spread of COVID-19 [coronavirus disease 2019] among the population The impact of COVID-19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known Reported illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that may result in death Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with serious underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are at higher risk of hospitalization and serious complications Transmission is most likely when people are in close contact with an infected person, even if that person does not have any symptoms or has not yet developed symptoms COVID-19 (Disease);Public health;Epidemics","output":"COVID-19 Industry Guidance: Life Sciences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To identify factors that contribute to the increased susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 in obese children and adolescents, and its health consequences. SOURCES: Studies published between 2000 and 2020 in the PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, SciELO, and Cochrane databases. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: Obesity is a highly prevalent comorbidity in severe cases of COVID-19 in children and adolescents; social isolation may lead to increase fat accumulation. Excessive adipose tissue, deficit in lean mass, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, high levels of proinflammatory cytokines, and low intake of essential nutrients are factors that compromise the functioning of organs and systems in obese individuals. These factors are associated with damage to immune, cardiovascular, respiratory, and urinary systems, along with modification of the intestinal microbiota (dysbiosis). In severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, these organic changes from obesity may increase the need for ventilatory assistance, risk of thromboembolism, reduced glomerular filtration rate, changes in the innate and adaptive immune response, and perpetuation of the chronic inflammatory response. CONCLUSIONS: The need for social isolation can have the effect of causing or worsening obesity and its comorbidities, and pediatricians need to be aware of this issue. Facing children with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, health professionals should 1) diagnose excess weight; 2) advise on health care in times of isolation; 3) screen for comorbidities, ensuring that treatment is not interrupted; 4) measure levels of immunonutrients; 5) guide the family in understanding the specifics of the situation; and 6) refer to units qualified to care for obese children and adolescents when necessary.","output":"COVID-19 and obesity in childhood and adolescence: A clinical review()()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection caused by a novel coronavirus began in December 2019 in Wuhan in central China that affect the children and adult and causes respiratory disease.

RESULTS: The mean age of the 53 patients who enrolled in this study were 14.06  4.12 years (range 1-18 years). Majority (75.5%) of them were adolescent. Running nose and fever were the most common symptoms. Forty-four (83%) patients had normal CT with no ground glass opacity (GGO) or consolidation, only 9 patients showed lung opacities; 5 cases showed consolidation, 2 cases with GGO, while consolidation with GGO was noted in another 2 patients. Among these 9 patient, six (66.7%) of them show unilateral lung opacities with peripheral distribution of these opacities in eight (88.9%) patients. The most frequently affected lobes were right and left lower lung lobes that were noted in 6 out of 9 patients with lung opacities (66.7%) in each lobe. Bronchitis was predominant in 23 (43.4%) cases. CONCLUSIONS: RT-PCR is a gold slandered test in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in children with upper respiratory tract symptoms as Chest CT cannot standalone as a diagnostic tool owing to high prevalence of normal chest CT in these patients. However, in case of lung affection, the presence of unilateral, peripheral consolidation with lower lobe predominance, in addition to bronchial wall thickening should be considered as a hallmark of chest CT in diagnosis of pediatric patients with COVID-19 with upper respiratory symptoms.","output":"Chest CT features of COVID-19 pediatric patients presented with upper respiratory symptoms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Patients with cancer are at risk for poor COVID-19 outcomes. We aimed to identify cancer-related risk factors for poor COVID-19 outcomes. Patients and Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the University of California Health COVID Research Data Set. This database includes prospectively-collected, electronic health data of patients who underwent testing for SARS-CoV-2 at seventeen California medical centers. We identified adult patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 between February 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, and selected a cohort of patients with cancer using diagnostic codes. We obtained demographic, comorbidity, laboratory, cancer type, and antineoplastic therapy data. The primary outcome was hospitalization within 30 days after first positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Secondary outcomes were SARS-CoV-2 positivity and composite endpoint for severe COVID-19 (intensive care, mechanical ventilation, or death within 30 days after first positive test). We used multivariable logistic regression to identify cancer-related factors associated with outcomes. Results: We identified 409,462 patients undergoing SARS-CoV-2 testing. Of 49,918 patients with cancer, 1,781 (3.6%) tested positive. Patients with cancer were less likely to test positive (OR 0.69, 95%CI 0.66-0.73, P<0.001). BCR-ABL-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis) (OR 2.51, 95%CI 1.29-4.89, P=0.007); venetoclax (OR 3.63, 95%CI 1.02-12.92, P=0.046); methotrexate (OR 3.65, 95%CI 1.17-11.37, P=0.026); Asian race (OR 1.92, 95%CI 1.23-2.98, P=0.004); and Hispanic/Latino ethnicity (OR 1.96, 95%CI 1.41-2.73, P<0.001) were associated with increased hospitalization risk. Among 388 hospitalized patients with cancer and COVID-19, cancer type and therapy type were not associated with severe COVID-19. Conclusions: In this large, diverse cohort of Californians, cancer was not a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Patients with BCR/ABL-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm and patients receiving methotrexate or venetoclax may be at an increased risk of hospitalization following SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We simulated possible future poliovirus vaccine routine immunization policies for countries stratified by World Bank Income Levels and estimated the expected costs and cases using an updated integrated dynamic poliovirus transmission, stochastic risk, and economic model. We consider two reference cases scenarios: one that achieves the eradication of all wild polioviruses (WPVs) by 2023 and one in which serotype 1 WPV (WPV1) transmission continues. The results show that the addition of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) to routine immunization in all countries substantially increased the expected costs of the polio endgame, without substantially increasing its expected health or economic benefits. Adding a second dose of IPV to the routine immunization schedules of countries that currently include a single IPV dose further increases costs and does not appear economically justified in the reference case that does not stop WPV transmission. For the reference case that includes all WPV eradication, adding a second IPV dose at the time of successful oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) cessation represents a cost-effective option. The risks and costs of needing to restart OPV use change the economics of the polio endgame, although the time horizon used for modeling impacts the overall economic results.

AIMS: The present study sought to examine the perceived impact of social lockdown on sexual fantasy and solitary sexual behavior among UK young adults in various living situations. METHODS: A convenience sample of 565 adults aged 18-32 and living in the UK completed anonymous, web-based, study-specific questionnaires between May 14 and 18, 2020, 7 weeks after social lockdown was initiated. Mixed-method analyses were conducted. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The study presents qualitative and quantitative data. Criterion variables were measured dichotomously as increases (vs no change) in sexual fantasy and increases (vs no change) in pornography consumption. Predictor variables were living arrangement, relationship status, and postlockdown changes in masturbation and pornography consumption. RESULTS: Of all, 34.3% engaged in more sexual fantasizing during lockdown; women were more likely than men to report this increase. Living context and relationship status were predictors of increased fantasizing. Of all, 30.44% reported an increase in at least one solitary sexual practice. This increase was associated with an increase in sexual fantasizing and also with increased pornography consumption. Nineteen percent of participants reported an increase in pornography use, with men being more likely than women to report this increase. Participants mostly attributed their increases to boredom, increased free time, and replacing partnered sex. CONCLUSION: Shifts in sexual fantasizing and solitary sexual practices were predicted by living arrangements, relationship status, and gender. The present findings suggest that the assessment of sexual fantasy and solitary sexual activities may benefit patients presenting with pandemic-related stress. Although mostly exploratory, significant changes in sexual fantasy and solitary sexual practices were observed.

Cattle and especially calves have been identified as one of the most common reservoirs of this protist. However, little is known about the genetics of Cryptosporidium in calves in some regions of France. The aim of this study was to detect and isolate Cryptosporidium spp. in faecal samples from naturally infected pre-weaned calves (45 days-old) in France. A total of 35 diarrhoeic pre-weaned calf faecal samples were collected from 26 dairy cattle farms in six departments (French administrative provinces). Cryptosporidium presence was established by microscopically screening samples for oocystes with an immunofluorescent (DFA) staining method. DFA-positive samples were then analysed by PCR-RFLP and 18S rRNA gene sequencing to determine species. Cryptosporidium parvum-positive samples were subtyped via nested PCR analysis of a partial fragment of the 60 kDa glycoprotein (gp60) gene product. Data were then integrated into phylogenetic tree analysis. DFA revealed the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts in 31 out of 35 (88%) samples. Combined with 18S rRNA gene analysis results, C. parvum was detected in 30 samples. Subtyping analysis in 27/30 samples (90%) of the C. parvum isolates revealed two zoonotic subtype families, IIa (24/27) and IId (3/27). Four subtypes were recognised within the subtype family IIa, including the hypertransmissible IIaA15G2R1 subtype that is the most frequently reported worldwide (21/27), IIaA17G3R1 (1/27), IIaA17G1R1 (1/27), and IIaA19G1R1 (1/27). Two subtypes were recognised within the IId subtype family including IIdA22G1 (2/27) and IIdA27G1 (1/27). These findings illustrate the high occurrence of Cryptosporidium in calves in dairy herds and increase the diversity of molecularly characterised C. parvum isolates with the first description of IIaA17G3R1, IIaA19G1R1, and IId subtypes in France. The presence of zoonotic C. parvum subtype families (IIa, IId) in this study suggests that pre-weaned calves are likely to be a significant reservoir of zoonotic C. parvum, and highlights the importance of animal to human cryptosporidiosis transmission risk.

The Guidelines contain recommendations for the treatment of inguinal hernia from diagnosis till aftercare. The guidelines expired January 1, 2012. To keep them updated, a revision of the guidelines was planned including new level 1 evidence. METHODS The original Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine ranking was used. All relevant level 1A and level 1B literature from May 2008 to June 2010 was searched (Medline and Cochrane) by the Working Group members. All chapters were attributed to the two responsible authors in the initial guidelines document. One new chapter on fixation techniques was added. The quality was assessed by the Working Group members during a 2-day meeting and the data were analysed, especially with respect to any change in the level and/or text of any of the conclusions or recommendations of the initial guidelines. In the end, all relevant references published until January 1, 2013 were included. The final text was approved by all Working Group members. RESULTS For the following topics, the conclusions and/or recommendations have been changed: indications for treatment, treatment of inguinal hernia, day surgery, antibiotic prophylaxis, training, postoperative pain control and chronic pain. The addendum contains all current level 1 conclusions, Grade A recommendations and new Grade B recommendations based on new level 1 evidence (with the changes in bold).

DESIGN: Multicenter case-controlled study. SETTING: Two ICUs in The Netherlands and one in Switzerland. PATIENTS: Thirty-four critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients were compared with 33 healthy volunteers. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The microcirculatory parameters quantified included total vessel density (mm  mm-2), functional capillary density (mm  mm-2), proportion of perfused vessels (%), capillary hematocrit (%), the ratio of capillary hematocrit to systemic hematocrit, and capillary RBC velocity (m  s-1). The number of leukocytes in capillary-postcapillary venule units per 4-second image sequence (4 s-1) and capillary RBC microaggregates (4 s-1) was measured. In comparison with healthy volunteers, the microcirculation of coronavirus disease 2019 patients showed increases in total vessel density (22.8  sd 5.1 vs 19.9  3.3; p < 0.0001) and functional capillary density (22.2  4.8 vs 18.8  3.1; p < 0.002), proportion of perfused vessel (97.6  2.1 vs 94.6  6.5; p < 0.01), RBC velocity (362  48 vs 306  53; p < 0.0001), capillary hematocrit (5.3  1.3 vs 4.7  0.8; p < 0.01), and capillary-hematocrit-to-systemic-hematocrit ratio (0.18  0.0 vs 0.11  0.0; p < 0.0001).

SARS-CoV-2 RNA is detected in respiratory samples but also in blood, stool and urine. Severe COVID-19 is characterized by a dysregulated host response to this virus. We studied whether viral RNAemia or viral RNA load in plasma is associated with severe COVID-19 and also to this dysregulated response. METHODS: A total of 250 patients with COVID-19 were recruited (50 outpatients, 100 hospitalized ward patients and 100 critically ill). Viral RNA detection and quantification in plasma was performed using droplet digital PCR, targeting the N1 and N2 regions of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein gene. The association between SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and viral RNA load in plasma with severity was evaluated by multivariate logistic regression. Correlations between viral RNA load and biomarkers evidencing dysregulation of host response were evaluated by calculating the Spearman correlation coefficients. RESULTS: The frequency of viral RNAemia was higher in the critically ill patients (78%) compared to ward patients (27%) and outpatients (2%) (p < 0.001). Critical patients had higher viral RNA loads in plasma than non-critically ill patients, with non-survivors showing the highest values. When outpatients and ward patients were compared, viral RNAemia did not show significant associations in the multivariate analysis. In contrast, when ward patients were compared with ICU patients, both viral RNAemia and viral RNA load in plasma were associated with critical illness (OR [CI 95%], p): RNAemia (3.92 [1.183C12.968], 0.025), viral RNA load (N1) (1.962 [1.244C3.096], 0.004); viral RNA load (N2) (2.229 [1.382C3.595], 0.001). Viral RNA load in plasma correlated with higher levels of chemokines (CXCL10, CCL2), biomarkers indicative of a systemic inflammatory response (IL-6, CRP, ferritin), activation of NK cells (IL-15), endothelial dysfunction (VCAM-1, angiopoietin-2, ICAM-1), coagulation activation (D-Dimer and INR), tissue damage (LDH, GPT), neutrophil response (neutrophils counts, myeloperoxidase, GM-CSF) and immunodepression (PD-L1, IL-10, lymphopenia and monocytopenia). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and viral RNA load in plasma are associated with critical illness in COVID-19.

Prior modeling suggested that before the COVID-19 pandemic, plans to stop the transmission of serotype 1 wild poliovirus (WPV1) and persistent serotype 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) did not appear on track to succeed. METHODS: We updated an existing poliovirus transmission and Sabin-strain oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) evolution model for Pakistan and Afghanistan to characterize the impacts of immunization disruptions and restrictions on human interactions (i.e., population mixing) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also consider different options for responding to outbreaks and for preventive supplementary immunization activities (SIAs). RESULTS: The modeling suggests that with some resumption of activities in the fall of 2020 to respond to cVDPV2 outbreaks and full resumption on January 1, 2021 of all polio immunization activities to pre-COVID-19 levels, Pakistan and Afghanistan would remain off-track for stopping all transmission through 2023 without improvements in quality. CONCLUSIONS: Using trivalent OPV (tOPV) for SIAs instead of serotype 2 monovalent OPV (mOPV2) offers substantial benefits for ending the transmission of both WPV1 and cVDPV2, because tOPV increases population immunity for both serotypes 1 and 2 while requiring fewer SIA rounds, when effectively delivered in transmission areas.","output":"Updated characterization of poliovirus transmission in Pakistan and Afghanistan and the impacts of different outbreak response vaccine options"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose Prior to the COVID-19 (C19) pandemic, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was an unusual indication for lung transplant (LT);thus, short- and long-term outcomes data are lacking.

Methods We conducted a chart review of LT recipients (LTRs) transplanted for C19 ARDS between 8/1/21 and 7/31/21. Descriptive statistics were used. Results Most LTRs were male (82%, n=9). The median age at LT, body mass index, and lung allocation score were 47 (43, 54) years, 28.9 (26, 30) kg/m2, and 84.5 (60, 88), respectively. The median interval from initial hospitalization to listing and listing to LT was 119 (97, 124) and 5 (4, 11) days, respectively. Pretransplant COVID-related morbidities included venous thromboembolism (55%, n=6), hemorrhage requiring transfusion (36%, n=4), pneumothorax (55%, n=6), bacterial pneumonia (82%, n=9), bacteremia (45%, n=5), fungemia (36%, n=4), renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT;9%, n=1), cerebrovascular event (9%, n=1), and musculoskeletal weakness (100%, n=11). Most patients required mechanical ventilation (91%, n=10), and 55% (n=6) were intubated at the time of LT. Furthermore, most patients required ECMO support (73%, n=8) and 36% (n=4) were on ECMO at the time of LT. Intraoperatively, 64% (n=7) of patients required cardiopulmonary bypass, 73% (n=8) had severe intrathoracic adhesions, 73% (n=8) had delayed chest closure, and 18% (n=2) had an unexpected return to the operating room. Prevalence of primary graft dysfunction grade 2 or 3 at 72 hours was high (91%, n=10), median duration of mechanical ventilation after LT was 10 (6, 19) days, but no one required ECMO rescue. To date, 10 (91%) LTRs have been discharged, and 2 (20%) have been readmitted within 30 days;the median post-LT hospital stay was 18 (14, 24) days;all discharged LTRs required acute rehabilitation for a median of 17.5 (14, 23) days.

Thanks to the rapid work of Chinese scientists, the pathogen now called SARS-CoV-2 has been identified and its whole genome has been deposited in public databases by early January 2020. The availability of the genome has allowed researchers to develop Reverse Transcription - Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assays, which are now the gold-standard for molecular diagnosis of the respiratory syndrome COVID19. Because of the rising number of cases and rapid spreading, the world has been facing a shortage of RT-PCR supplies, especially the ones involved in RNA extraction. This has been a major bottleneck to increase testing capacity in many countries that do not significantly manufacture these supplies (Brazil included). Additionally, RT-PCR scalability is highly dependent on equipment that usually perform testing of 96 samples at a time. In this work, we describe a cost-effective molecular NGS-based test for diagnosis of COVID19, which uses a single-step RNA extraction and presents high scalability and accuracy when compared to the gold-standard RT-PCR. A single run of the NGS-based test using the Illumina NextSeq 550 mid-end sequencing equipment is able to multiplex 1,536 patient samples, providing individual semi-qualitative results (detected, not detected). Detected results are provided with fragments per million (FPM) values, which was demonstrated to correlate with RT-PCR Cycle Threshold (CT) values. Besides, usage of the high-end Illumina Novaseq platform may yield diagnostic for up to 6,144 samples in a single run. Performance results when compared with RT-PCR show general accuracy of 96% (or 98% when only samples with CT values for gene N lower than 30 are considered). We have also developed an online platform, called VarsVID, a Varstation feature, to help test executors to easily scale testing numbers. Sample registering, wet-lab worksheets, sample sheet for sequencing and results display are all features provided by VarsVID on Varstation.

Further, to study the interaction mechanism and conformational dynamics of protein-ligand complexes, Molecular dynamic simulation and MM/PBSA binding free calculations were performed. Our results showed that both Lymecycline and Mizolastine bind in the active site. And exhibited good binding affinities towards target protein.

By calibrating the parameters of the EDM to the reported data in Hubei Province of China, we also attempt to forecast the evolution of the outbreak. We compare the EDM applied to WR and the Gompertz model, which is based on exponential decay and is often used to estimate cumulative events. Specifically, we assess the performance of each model to short-term forecast of the epidemic, and to predict the final epidemic size. Based on the official counts for confirmed cases, the model applied to data from February 27 until the 17th of March estimate that the cumulative number of infected could reach 131,280 (with a credibility interval 71,415-263,501) by April 25 (credibility interval April 12 to May 3). With the data available until the 24st of March the peak date should be reached on May 3 (April 23 to May 23) with 197,179 cumulative infections expected (130,033-315,269); with data available until the 31st of March the peak should be reached on May 4 (April 25 to May 18) with 202,210 cumulative infections expected (155.235-270,737); with data available until the 07st of April the peak should be reached on May 3 (April 26 to May 11) with 191,586 (160,861-232,023) cumulative infections expected.

The findings indicated that S2 subunit (heptad-repeat 1 (HR1), central helix (CH), and connector domain (CD) domains) showed low variability, low fluctuations in MD, and displayed a trimer cavity. By contrast, the receptor binding domain (RBD) domain, which is typically targeted in drug discovery programs, exhibits more sequence variability and flexibility. Interpretations from MD simulations suggest that the monomer form of spike protein is in constant motion showing transitions between an up and down state. In addition, the trimer cavity may function as a bouncing spring that may facilitate the homotrimer spike protein interactions with the ACE2 receptor. The feasibility of the trimer cavity as a potential drug target was examined by structure based virtual screening.

To make mental health diagnoses and monitoring more objective, different solutions have been proposed such as digital phenotyping of mental health (DPMH), which can expand the ability to identify and monitor health conditions based on the interactions of people with digital technologies. OBJECTIVE: This article aims to identify and characterize the sensing applications and public data sets for DPMH from a technical perspective. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of scientific literature and data sets. We searched 8 digital libraries and 20 data set repositories to find results that met the selection criteria. We conducted a data extraction process from the selected articles and data sets. For this purpose, a form was designed to extract relevant information, thus enabling us to answer the research questions and identify open issues and research trends. RESULTS: A total of 31 sensing apps and 8 data sets were identified and reviewed. Sensing apps explore different context data sources (eg, positioning, inertial, ambient) to support DPMH studies. These apps are designed to analyze and process collected data to classify (n=11) and predict (n=6) mental states/disorders, and also to investigate existing correlations between context data and mental states/disorders (n=6). Moreover, general-purpose sensing apps are developed to focus only on contextual data collection (n=9). The reviewed data sets contain context data that model different aspects of human behavior, such as sociability, mood, physical activity, sleep, with some also being multimodal. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review provides in-depth analysis regarding solutions for DPMH. Results show growth in proposals for DPMH sensing apps in recent years, as opposed to a scarcity of public data sets. The review shows that there are features that can be measured on smart devices that can act as proxies for mental status and well-being; however, it should be noted that the combined evidence for high-quality features for mental states remains limited.

There is a higher incidence in some regions and countries, especially where close association exists between growing numbers of cattle (the major source of Mycobacterium bovis) and people, many suffering from poverty, and where dairy products are consumed unpasteurised. More attention needs to be focused on possible increased zTB incidence resulting from growth in dairy production globally and increased demand in low income countries in particular. Evidence of new zoonotic mycobacterial strains in South Asia and Africa (e.g. M. orygis), warrants urgent assessment of prevalence, potential drivers and risk in order to develop appropriate interventions. Control of M. bovis infection in cattle through detect and cull policies remain the mainstay of reducing zTB risk, whilst in certain circumstances animal vaccination is proving beneficial. New point of care diagnostics will help to detect animal infections and human cases. Given the high burden of human tuberculosis (caused by M. tuberculosis) in endemic areas, animals are affected by reverse zoonosis, including multi-drug resistant strains.

The INJECT study prospectively evaluated ocriplasmin in the setting of clinical practice. METHODS: INJECT was a Phase 4, multicenter, prospective observational study. Patients were followed up for 12 months. Assessments included nonsurgical VMT resolution, nonsurgical MH closure, best-corrected visual acuity, occurrence of vitrectomy, and adverse events. RESULTS: The efficacy population (N = 395) received an ocriplasmin injection and had optical coherence tomographyCconfirmed VMT at baseline. At Day 28, the rate of nonsurgical VMT resolution was 40.7% in the overall group, and the rate of nonsurgical MH closure was 36.0% in the VMT with MH group. At Month 12, the rate of 2-line best-corrected visual acuity gain (irrespective of vitrectomy) was 36.8% in the overall group and 59.6% in the VMT with MH group. The percentage of patients who underwent vitrectomy in the study eye was 29.1% in the overall group and 55.6% in the VMT with MH group. Photopsia (9.8%) and vitreous floaters (6.8%) were the most frequent adverse events. CONCLUSION: The INJECT study showed that ocriplasmin is effective in a clinical setting in patients with VMT, with or without MH.

Associations between pre-infection prescription for glucose-lowering drugs and COVID-19-related mortality in people with type 2 diabetes have been postulated but only investigated in small studies and limited to a few agents. We investigated whether there are associations between prescription of different classes of glucose-lowering drugs and risk of COVID-19-related mortality in people with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: This was a nationwide observational cohort study done with data from the National Diabetes Audit for people with type 2 diabetes and registered with a general practice in England since 2003. Cox regression was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of COVID-19-related mortality in people prescribed each class of glucose-lowering drug, with covariate adjustment with a propensity score to address confounding by demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical factors. FINDINGS: Among the 2 851 465 people with type 2 diabetes included in our analyses, 13 479 (05%) COVID-19-related deaths occurred during the study period (Feb 16 to Aug 31, 2020), corresponding to a rate of 89 per 1000 person-years (95% CI 87C90). The adjusted HR associated with recorded versus no recorded prescription was 077 (95% CI 073C081) for metformin and 142 (135C149) for insulin. Adjusted HRs for prescription of other individual classes of glucose-lowering treatment were as follows: 075 (048C117) for meglitinides, 082 (074C091) for SGLT2 inhibitors, 094 (082C107) for thiazolidinediones, 094 (089C099) for sulfonylureas, 094 (083C107) for GLP-1 receptor agonists, 107 (101C113) for DPP-4 inhibitors, and 126 (076C209) for -glucosidase inhibitors. INTERPRETATION: Our results provide evidence of associations between prescription of some glucose-lowering drugs and COVID-19-related mortality, although the differences in risk are small and these findings are likely to be due to confounding by indication, in view of the use of different drug classes at different stages of type 2 diabetes disease progression. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is no clear indication to change prescribing of glucose-lowering drugs in people with type 2 diabetes.

STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, PATIENTS, INTERVENTIONS: We included studies of COVID-19 vaccines after complete vaccination in immunocompromised patients until 31 August 2021. Studies with <10 patients, safety data only and case series of breakthrough infections were excluded. METHODS: Risk of bias was assessed via the tool developed by the National Institutes of Health on interventional and observational studies. Immunogenicity was assessed through non-response rate defined as no anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibodies, efficacy and effectiveness by the relative reduction in risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19. We collected factors associated with the risk of non-response. We presented collected data by immunosuppression type. RESULTS: We screened 5917 results, included 162 studies. There were 157 on immunogenicity in 25 209 participants, including 7835 cancer or haematological malignancy patients (31.1%), 6302 patients on dialysis (25.0%), 5974 solid organ transplant recipients (23.7%) and 4680 immune-mediated disease patients (18.6%). Proportion of non-responders seemed higher among solid organ transplant recipients (range 18C100%) and patients with haematological malignancy (range 14C61%), and lower in patients with cancer (range 2C36%) and patients on dialysis (range 2C30%).

In 2009, it translated its contingency plan to respond to the unfolding influenza pandemic. However, little is known of how Malawi translated its national influenza plan into response actions, or the success of these responses. Objective: To investigate how Malawi translated its preparedness plan and so broaden our understanding of the outcomes of the responses. Methods: We draw on data from 22 in-depth interviews with government policymakers and people working at a policy level in various non-governmental organisations, conducted to assess the level of preparedness and the challenges of translating this. Results: Through a number of public health initiatives, authorities developed communication strategies, strengthened influenza surveillance activities and updated overall goals in pandemic training and education. However, without influenza drills, exercises and simulations to test the plan, activating the pandemic plan, including coordinating and deploying generic infection control measures, was problematic. Responses during the pandemic were at times weak and clumsy and failed to mirror the activities and processes highlighted in the preparedness plan. Conclusions: Participants stressed that in order to achieve a coordinated and successful response to mitigate and prevent the further transmission of pandemic influenza, good preparation was critical. The key elements which they identified as relevant for a rapid response included effective communications, robust evidence-based decision-making, strong and reliable surveillance systems and flexible public health responses. To effectively articulate a viable trajectory of pandemic responses, the potential value of simulation exercises could be given more consideration as a mean of sustaining good levels of preparedness and responses against future pandemics.

Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is a life-threatening complication that can occur during VOC and prolong hospitalization and is one of the main causes of death in SCD patients. The PRESEV score, established by team members and colleagues, assesses the risk of developing ACS (Bartolucci et al., 2016). In addition, the score has been validated by an international multicenter study, involving 13 centers, distributed in five different countries (PRESEV 2 - ASH 2020). Throughout the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, VOC management for SCD patients was a major concern. Our sickle cell referral center set up a hotline to monitor patients suffering from VOC daily, and organized the deployment of home-care services when required. The success of this system during the first wave of the pandemic led to the establishment of DREPADOM, a home-care and hospitalization protocol for VOC management in patients who are at a low risk of developing ACS, as standard care. DESCRIPTION OF SETTING Patients eligible for DREPADOM are patients that arrive at the ER for a VOC with a low PRESEV score, meaning low risk of developing ACS; or patients that are discharged early following hospitalization for VOC. After physical examination and calculation of the PRESEV score, DREPADOM home hospitalization is systematically offered to patients arriving to the ER with a PRESEV score  5. If the patient agrees, the DREPADOM nurse coordinator then acts as a link between the pharmacist, the oxygen supplier, the homecare provider, and the DREPADOM medical platform to activate the home hospitalization protocol. This entails the delivery of oxygen supply at the patient's house, dispatch of a medical prescription of opioids and parenteral treatments, twice/thrice-daily visits from homecare nurses, and an on-call SCD expert. DREPADOM relies on a system of daily telephone calls with three levels of expertise and warning and a decision-making algorithm. This is supervised by SCD experts, who arbitrate according to the evolution of the situation (stopping the follow-up, continuing the follow-up as an outpatient, hospitalization) (Fig.1). Furthermore, nurses enter patient vitals in real-time during their daily visits on a dedicated online platform (Link4Life) that contains an integrated automatic alert system. Additionally, a daily phone update between the DREPADOM coordination and the homecare provider's coordination concerning status and evolution of the patient's global condition takes place. RESULTS Over a 6-month period, 39 patients were included in the DREPADOM home hospitalization protocol, 3 of which were included multiple times for a total of 42 inclusions. Mean age was 40 years old [9], sex ratio was 14/25 (male/female), ER vs early discharge ratio was 21/22, and mean homecare follow-up was 3 days (1) for both, patients arriving from the ER and early discharge patients. Throughout the third wave of the pandemic, when hospital saturation was a major concern, patients with PRESEV scores 5  11 were also offered DREPADOM. Three patients were hospitalized (7%): one for an ACS, who was included during the 3 rd wave of the pandemic with a PRESEV score of 8; one for pyelonephritis unrelated to the VOC; and one for difficulties with venous access. No death was reported. PERSPECTIVES Preliminary satisfaction surveys show a great enthusiasm for DREPADOM, partly due to the high standard of care received, but also due to the shorter length of hospitalization. In fact, median hospital stay for VOC is 4 [3-7] days (Bartolucci, 2016) whereas median homecare follow-up was 3 [1-6] days.

There are two distinct impacts with regards to antimicrobial and anti-parasitic properties of propolis, on the pathogens and on the host. With regards to the pathogens, propolis acts by disrupting the ability of the pathogens to invade the host cells by forming a physical barrier and inhibiting enzymes and proteins needed for invasion into the host cells. Propolis also inhibits the replication process of the pathogens. Moreover, propolis inhibits the metabolic processes of the pathogens by disrupting cellular organelles and components responsible for energy production. With regard to the host, propolis functions as an immunomodulator. It upregulates the innate immunity and modulates the inflammatory signaling pathways. Propolis also helps maintain the hosts cellular antioxidant status.

We present the case of a patient with lower limb weakness and raised creatinine kinase with atypical pneumonia caused by Legionella pneumophila. CASE REPORT - CASE DESCRIPTION: A 76-year-old Caucasian man, who was previously fit and independent and walked 3 miles every day presented with a 1-week history of progressive leg weakness, and inability to mobilize. He had a fall and was on the floor for 2 hours. He had a background history of hypercholesterolemia and was on atorvastatin for 15 years. On his vital observation, he was found tachypnoeic, tachycardic, and hypoxic. He had a right upper lobe crackle but he didnt have respiratory symptoms. His muscle power in his leg was 3/5 with carpet burns on knees and elbow. Initial investigation showed raised inflammatory marker CRP 412mg/L, AKI stage 1, and CK 43400 IU/L. His CXR showed dense right upper lobe consolidation. Legionella urinary antigen was positive. Myositis myoblot, ANA, ANCA negative. COVID-19 swab negative. Treated with IV antibiotic, supplemental oxygen, and IV fluid. Transferred to ITU due to worsening of hypoxia and kidney function. Interestingly, the CK level had improved significantly within 48 hours along with clinical improvement in his symptoms. There was no role of steroid or immunosuppressant due to his significant clinical improvement. On day 7 he was off oxygen, kidney function improved, had physiotherapy, and transferred to ward and on day 10 he was ambulant and discharged home. CASE REPORT - DISCUSSION: To date, very few case reports of myositis in a patient with atypical pneumonia have been reported. The mechanism underlying acute myositis in atypical pneumonia is still unknown. The present analysis points out that the organism underlying atypical bacterial pneumonia may occasionally invade the muscle tissue thereby inducing both myositis and secondary kidney damage. CASE REPORT - KEY LEARNING POINTS: We should be aware of this rare complication of atypical pneumonia and the resolution of symptoms that occur with the treatment of pneumonia. This would avoid unnecessary investigation and use of steroid.","output":"P14 A case of myositis in patient with atypical bacterial pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"NHS England and NHS Improvement launched the professional nurse advocate (PNA) programme in March, towards the end of the third wave of COVID-19.

In this study, we investigated whether these peptidases are similarly dysregulated in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Fifty-six hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 32 healthy controls were included. Enzymatic activities of DPP4, FAP, PREP and PRCP were measured in samples collected shortly after hospital admission and in longitudinal follow-up samples. RESULTS: Compared to healthy controls, both DPP4 and FAP activities were significantly lower in COVID-19 patients at hospital admission and FAP activity further decreased significantly in the first week of hospitalization. While PRCP activity remained unchanged, PREP activity was significantly increased in COVID-19 patients at hospitalization and further increased during hospital stay and stayed elevated until the day of discharge. CONCLUSION: The changes in activities of proline-selective peptidases in plasma are very similar in COVID-19 and septic shock patients. The pronounced decrease in FAP activity deserves further investigation, both from a pathophysiological viewpoint and as its utility as a part of a biomarker panel.","output":"Proline-specific peptidase activities (DPP4, PRCP, FAP and PREP) in plasma of hospitalized COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interferon (IFN)- and IFN- are critical mediators of host defense against microbial challenges, directly interfering with viral infection and influencing both the innate and adaptive immune responses.

BTD recycles the vitamin biotin, a coenzyme essential for the function of four biotin-dependent carboxylases, including propionyl-CoA carboxylase, 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase, pyruvate carboxylase, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Due to deficient activities of the carboxylases, BTD deficiency is also recognized as late-onset multiple carboxylase deficiency and is associated with secondary alterations in the metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates, and fatty acids.

Newborn screening (NBS) of BTD deficiency is performed in most countries and is able to detect both variants. Moreover, mild metabolic alterations related to carboxylase deficiency in profound BTD deficiency could result and possibly be revealed in the metabolic profile by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) NBS. Here, we report the case of a newborn female infant with an initial suspected BTD deficiency at the NBS test, finally confirmed as a partial variant by molecular testing.

Saliva and oropharyngeal swabs were collected. SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids in saliva were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Additionally, a questionnaire survey on various oral symptoms such as dry mouth and amblygeustia was also carried out on COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: ACE2 expression was present at detectable levels in the salivary glands.

We collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from 86 patients with SARS-CoV-2-induced respiratory failure and 252 patients with known or suspected pneumonia from other pathogens and subjected them to flow cytometry and bulk transcriptomic profiling.

Four different types of psychological trauma were increasingly observed, based on digital communication with people affected and reports from the news and social media. These 4 types of psychological trauma were social withdrawal, hysteria, individual violence, and collective violence. On the basis of the described psychological consequences of the pandemic, it can be assumed that both the individual and collective reactions must be considered to reduce harm of the coronavirus pandemic.

Subsequently, it is possible to derive from this the daily, weekly, and other road traffic intensity information. This survey represents the basis for the calculation of the annual average daily traffic volume and the basic characteristics of traffic flow. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused extensive economic and social damage around the world. These damages have also affected traffic. Changes in traffic behavior have mainly affected the reduction in traffic intensity on road networks. Thanks to the reduction in the demand for transport, there has also been a significant reduction in traffic delays, fuel consumption and emissions. An examination of changes in traffic intensity took place at a selected intersection in 2019, 2020 and 2021.

However, this approach can suffer from a series of methodological issues with respect to sampling biases and measurement error. To date, it has not been validated if social media sentiment can measure the day to day temporal dynamics of emotions aggregated at the macro level of a whole online community. We ran a large-scale survey at an online newspaper to gather daily self-reports of affective states from its users and compare these with aggregated results of sentiment analysis of user discussions on the same online platform. Additionally, we preregistered a replication of our study using Twitter text as a macroscope of emotions for the same community. For both platforms, we find strong correlations between text analysis results and levels of self-reported emotions, as well as between inter-day changes of both measurements. We further show that a combination of supervised and unsupervised text analysis methods is the most accurate approach to measure emotion aggregates. We illustrate the application of such social media macroscopes when studying the association between the number of new COVID-19 cases and emotions, showing that the strength of associations is comparable when using survey data as when using social media data. Our findings indicate that macro level dynamics of affective states of users of an online platform can be tracked with social media text, complementing surveys when self-reported data is not available or difficult to gather.","output":"Validating daily social media macroscopes of emotions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: (1) To develop a deep learning algorithm to identify major tissue structures of the optic nerve head (ONH) in 3D optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans; (2) to exploit such information to robustly differentiate among healthy, optic disc drusen (ODD), and papilledema ONHs. It was a cross-sectional comparative study with confirmed ODD (105 eyes), papilledema due to high intracranial pressure (51 eyes), and healthy controls (100 eyes). 3D scans of the ONHs were acquired using OCT, then processed to improve deep-tissue visibility. At first, a deep learning algorithm was developed using 984 B-scans (from 130 eyes) in order to identify: major neural/connective tissues, and ODD regions. The performance of our algorithm was assessed using the Dice coefficient (DC). In a 2nd step, a classification algorithm (random forest) was designed using 150 OCT volumes to perform 3-class classifications (1: ODD, 2: papilledema, 3: healthy) strictly from their drusen and prelamina swelling scores (derived from the segmentations). To assess performance, we reported the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) for each class. Our segmentation algorithm was able to isolate neural and connective tissues, and ODD regions whenever present. This was confirmed by an average DC of 0.93$\\\\pm$0.03 on the test set, corresponding to good performance.

This study examined the moderating effect of possible avoidant personality disorder (APD) on association between bullying victimization and depressive symptoms in university freshmen. METHODS: A total of 1,453 freshmen were recruited from a comprehensive university in Wuhan, China, and administered a self-report questionnaire. The APD subscale of Personality Diagnostic QuestionnaireCVersion 4 and Beck Depression Inventory were used to measure the presence of possible APD and depressive symptoms, respectively. The moderating effect of possible APD was examined by testing the statistical significance of the interaction between victimization and possible APD in multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 24.8%. In multiple logistic regression analysis, the interaction between bullying victimization and possible APD was significantly associated with depressive symptoms (OR: 1.80, P = 0.029). Subsequent subgroup analyses according to the status of possible APD showed that, the victimization-depression association was stronger among freshmen with possible APD (OR: 3.23, P < 0.001) than those without possible APD (OR: 1.82, P = 0.001).

Digital health technology, including body-worn devices, offers a solution using digital outcomes to measure and monitor disease status and provide outcomes meaningful to both patients and health care professionals. Remote monitoring of physical mobility is a prime example, because mobility is among the most advanced modalities that can be assessed digitally and remotely. Loss of mobility is also an important feature of many health conditions, providing a read-out of health as well as a target for intervention. Real-world, continuous digital measures of mobility (digital mobility outcomes or DMOs) provide an opportunity for novel insights into health care conditions complementing existing mobility measures. Accepted and approved DMOs are not yet widely available. The need for large collaborative efforts to tackle the critical steps to adoption is widely recognised. Mobilise-D is an example. It is a multidisciplinary consortium of 34 institutions from academia and industry funded through the European Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking. Members of Mobilise-D are collaborating to address the critical steps for DMOs to be adopted in clinical trials and ultimately health care.

OBJECTIVE To determine the periprocedural safety of CAS performed using a transradial approach relative to CAS performed using a transfemoral approach. METHODS Patients with 70% asymptomatic and 50% symptomatic carotid stenosis, 80 years of age and at standard or high risk for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) are eligible for the C2R. The primary endpoint was a composite of severe access-related complications. Comparisons were made using propensity-score matched logistic regression. RESULTS The mean age of the cohort was 67.6  8.2 years and 1906 (35.1%) were female. Indications for CAS included 4063 (74.9%) for primary atherosclerosis. A total of 2868 (52.8%) cases underwent CAS for asymptomatic disease. Transradial access was used in 213 (3.9%) patients. The transradial cohort had lower use of general anesthesia (1.5% vs. 6.3%, p = 0.007) and higher use of distal embolic protection (96.7% vs. 89.4%, p = 0.0004).

Secondly, the high mutation rates we are likely to encounter complicate the inference of a reliable alignment of genomes. To address these issues, we develop a model that explicitly models selection in overlapping reading frames. We then integrate this model into a statistical alignment framework, enabling us to estimate selection while explicitly dealing with the uncertainty of individual alignments. We show that in this way we obtain un-biased selection parameters for different genomic regions of interest, and can improve in accuracy compared to using a fixed alignment. RESULTS: We run a series of simulation studies to gauge how well we do in selection estimation, especially in comparison to the use of a fixed alignment. We show that the standard practice of using a ClustalW alignment can lead to considerable biases and that estimation accuracy increases substantially when explicitly integrating over the uncertainty in inferred alignments. We even manage to compete favourably for general evolutionary distances with an alignment produced by GenAl. We subsequently run our method on HIV2 and Hepatitis B sequences. CONCLUSION: We propose that marginalizing over all alignments, as opposed to using a fixed one, should be considered in any parametric inference from divergent sequence data for which the alignments are not known with certainty. Moreover, we discover in HIV2 that double coding regions appear to be under less stringent selection than single coding ones. Additionally, there appears to be evidence for differential selection, where one overlapping reading frame is under positive and the other under negative selection.","output":"Investigating selection on viruses: a statistical alignment approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Faroese people consider grindadrp, the hunting of pilot whales, as a part of their cultural heritage, but from the point of view of veterinary sciences and biology, the method of killing pilot whales is a form of a ritual slaughter performed on fully conscious animals that are aware of their circumstances.

Nonetheless, tuft cells have recently emerged as key orchestrators of the host response to diverse microbial infections in the gut and airway. While tuft cells are epithelial in origin, they exhibit functions akin to immune cells and mediate important interkingdom interactions between the host and helminths, protists, viruses, and bacteria. With broad intra- and intertissue heterogeneity, tuft cells sense and respond to microbes with exquisite specificity. Tuft cells can recognize helminth and protist infection, driving a type 2 immune response to promote parasite expulsion. Tuft cells also serve as the primary physiologic target of persistent murine norovirus (MNV) and promote immune evasion. Recently, tuft cells were also shown to be infected by rotavirus. Other viral infections, such as influenza A virus, can induce tuft cellCdependent tissue repair. In the context of coinfection, tuft cells promote neurotropic flavivirus replication by dampening antiviral adaptive immune responses. Commensal and pathogenic bacteria can regulate tuft cell abundance and function and, in turn, tuft cells are implicated in modulating bacterial infiltration and mucosal barrier integrity. However, the contribution of tuft cells to microbial sensing in humans and their resulting effector responses are poorly characterized.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of a national, prospective cohort study. All pregnant women admitted to hospital in the UK with symptomatic SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 from March 1, 2020 to October 31, 2021 were included. The severity of maternal infection (need for high flow or invasive ventilation, intensive care admission or died), pregnancy and perinatal outcomes, and the impact of timing of birth were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 4436 pregnant women, 13.9% (n = 616) had severe infection. Women with severe infection were more likely to be aged 30 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] aged 30C39 1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20C1.83), be overweight or obese (aOR 1.73, 95% CI 1.34C2.25 and aOR 2.52 95% CI 1.97C3.23, respectively), be of mixed ethnicity (aOR 1.93, 95% CI 1.17C3.21) or have gestational diabetes (aOR 1.43, 95% CI 1.09C1.87) compared with those with mild or moderate infection.

Contention and mitigation measures have focused on reducing peoples mass gathering. Such efforts have led to a drop in the economy. The application of a vaccine at a world level represents a grand challenge for humanity, and it is not likely to accomplish even within months. In the meantime, we still need tools to allow the people integration into their regular routines reducing the risk of infection. In this context, this paper presents a solution for crowd management. The aim is to monitor and manage crowd levels in interior places or point-of-interests (POI), particularly shopping centers or stores. The solution is based on a POI recommendation system that suggests the nearest safe options upon request of a particular POI to visit by the user. In this sense, it recommends places near the user location with the least estimated crowd. The recommendation algorithm uses a top-K approach and behavioral game theory to predict the users choice and estimate the crowd level for the requested POI. To evaluate the efficiency of this technological intervention in terms of the potential number of contacts of possible COVID-19 infections and the recommendation quality, we have developed an agent-based model (ABM). The adoption level of new technologies can be related to the end-user experience and trust in such technologies. As the end-user follows a recommendation that leads to uncrowded places, both the end-user experience and trust increased. We study and model this process using the OCEAN model of personality. The results from the studied scenarios showed that the proposed solution is widely adopted by the agents, as the trust factor increased from 0.5 (initial set value) to 0.76. In terms of crowd level, these are effectively managed and reduced on average by 40%. The mobility contacts were reduced by 40%, decreasing the risk of COVID-19 infection.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of identified SARS-CoV-2 variants, virus clades, and clade groups with disease severity and patient outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cross-sectional study, viral genome analysis of clinical specimens obtained from patients at the Cleveland Clinic infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the initial wave of infection (March 11 to April 22, 2020) was performed. Identified variants were matched with clinical outcomes. Data analysis was performed from April to July 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mortality, and laboratory outcomes were matched with SARS-CoV-2 variants. RESULTS: Specimens sent for viral genome sequencing originated from 302 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (median [interquartile range] age, 52.6 [22.8 to 82.5] years), of whom 126 (41.7%) were male, 195 (64.6%) were White, 91 (30.1%) required hospitalization, 35 (11.6%) needed ICU admission, and 17 (5.6%) died. From these specimens, 2531 variants (484 of which were unique) were identified. Six different SARS-CoV-2 clades initially circulated followed by a rapid reduction in clade diversity. Several variants were associated with lower hospitalization rate, and those containing 23403A>G (D614G Spike) were associated with increased survival when the patient was hospitalized (64 of 74 patients [86.5%] vs 10 of 17 patients [58.8%]; (2)(1) = 6.907; P = .009). Hospitalization and ICU admission were similar regardless of clade. Infection with Clade V variants demonstrated higher creatinine levels (median [interquartile range], 2.6 [?0.4 to 5.5] mg/dL vs 1.0 [0.2 to 2.2] mg/dL; mean creatinine difference, 2.9 mg/dL [95% CI, 0.8 to 5.0 mg/dL]; Kruskal-Wallis P = .005) and higher overall mortality rates (3 of 14 patients [21.4%] vs 17 of 302 patients [5.6%]; (2)(1) = 5.640; P = .02) compared with other variants. Infection by strains lacking the 23403A>G variant showed higher mortality in multivariable analysis (odds ratio [OR], 22.4; 95% CI, 0.6 to 5.6; P = .01). Increased variants of open reading frame (ORF) 3a were associated with decreased hospitalization frequency (OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2 to 0.96; P = .04), whereas increased variants of Spike (OR, 0.01; 95% CI, <0.01 to 0.3; P = .01) and ORF8 (OR, 0.03; 95% CI, <0.01 to 0.6; P = .03) were associated with increased survival. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Within weeks of SARS-CoV-2 circulation, a profound shift toward 23403A>G (D614G) specific genotypes occurred. Replaced clades were associated with worse clinical outcomes, including mortality. These findings help explain persistent hospitalization yet decreasing mortality as the pandemic progresses.

This study aimed to investigate the clinical significance of liver blood tests in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The analysis included clinical data of 23 patients with suspected COVID-19 and 66 patients with confirmed COVID-19 from January 25 to February 20, 2020. The relationship between liver blood test results, liver condition (HBsAb positive, HBcAb positive, and fatty liver disease), and duration of hospital stay among COVID-19 patients was analyzed. RESULTS: The median hospital stay of COVID-19 patients was 6 days. Serum albumin (Alb) level was lower in patients with COVID-19 confirmed on admission than in patients with suspected COVID-19 (40.08 g/L vs 42.50 g/L, P = .016), while the level of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was higher (23 U/L vs 18 U/L, P = .005). Abnormal results of liver blood tests in patients with COVID-19 included increased levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) (21.2%, 14 patients), AST (15.2%, 10 patients), and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) (22.7%, 15 patients). After 5-10 days of treatment, levels of Alb and AST in COVID-19 patients were significantly decreased (P < .001 and P = .027, respectively). Abnormal levels of Alb and AST in patients with COVID-19 were not associated with the liver condition (all P > .05). In addition, only levels of AST were positively correlated with the duration of hospital stay (r = .334, P = .007). CONCLUSION: Abnormal results of the liver blood test were found in COVID-19 patients.

In MOTTD columns, the flow channels are straight, parallel, cylindrical tubes arranged in a hexagonal compact array.

The model is based on Giddings' random-walk theory of non-equilibrium chromatography. It is calibrated for the unknown configuration factor, qs, related to the specific geometry of the stationary phase in MOTTD columns. qs values are found based on the best fit of the model to simulated dispersion data obtained by the lattice-Boltzmann method for modelling fluid flow and a random-walk particle-tracking technique to address advective-diffusive transport of the analytes. For the model calibration, simulations are performed for different ratios, , of the average inner diameter of the flow channels to their closest center-to-center distance under retained and non-retained conditions. The model is successfully validated (average relative errors below 10%) under both retained and non-retained conditions. For the same column format (4.6 mm i.d.  150 mm), external porosity, zone retention factor, and relative standard deviation of the distribution of the inner diameters of the flow channels, the derived model reveals the intrinsic advantage of MOTTD columns (center-to-center distance between flow channels of 5 m and  = 0.62) over a conventional column packed with 5 m 130 ?

The disease COVID-19 is now spread worldwide and has tremendous socio-economic consequences. The origin of the virus can be reconstructed through epidemiological studies and, even more so, from genome comparisons. How the evolution of the virus and the transition to humans might have happened is the subject of much speculation. It is considered certain that the virus is of animal origin and very likely passed from bats to humans in a zoonotic event. An intermediate host was postulated, but many SARS-like bat viruses have the ability to infect human cells directly, which has been shown experimentally by scientists in the Wuhan Institute of Virology using collected specimens containing virus material from horseshoe bats. The propagation of SARS-like bat viruses in cell culture allowed experiments aimed at increasing the infectivity of the virus and adaptation to human cells. This article summarizes the unique properties of SARS-CoV-2 and focusses on a specific sequence encoding the spike protein. Possible scenarios of virus evolution are discussed, with particular emphasis on the hypothesis that the virus could have emerged unintentionally through routine culture or gain-of-function experiments in a laboratory, where it was optimally adapted to human cells and caused cryptic infections among workers who finally spread the virus causing the pandemic.","output":"On the Origin of SARS-CoV-2: Did Cell Culture Experiments Lead to Increased Virulence of the Progenitor Virus for Humans?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic progressive neuromuscular disease characterized by loss of motor neurons, which is linked to mutation of the survival motor neuron-1 gene.

Currently, more than 50 countries have introduced some type of tax on SSBs. In March 2017, the Autonomous Region of Catalonia approved the introduction of a tiered excise tax on SSBs for public health reasons. To evaluate the effect of the Catalonian excise tax on the price and purchase of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and their possible substitutes, i.e., non-sugar-sweetened beverages (NSSBs) and bottled water, three and half years after its introduction, and 1 year after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We analysed purchase data on soft drinks, fruit drinks and water, sourced from the Ministry of Agriculture food-consumption panel, in a random sample of 12,500 households across Spain. We applied the synthetic control method to infer the causal impact of the intervention, based on a Bayesian structural time-series model which predicts the counterfactual response that would have occurred in Catalonia, had no intervention taken place. RESULTS: As compared to the predicted (counterfactual) response, per capita purchases of SSBs fell by 0.17 l three and a half years after implementing the SSB tax in Catalonia, a 16.7% decline (95% CI: ? 23.18, ? 8.74). The mean SSB price rose by 0.11 /L, an 11% increase (95% CI: 9.0, 14.1). Although there were no changes in mean NSSB prices, NSSB consumption rose by 0.19 l per capita, a 21.7% increase (95% CI: 18.25, 25.54). There were no variations in the price or consumption of bottled water. The effects were progressively greater over time, with SSB purchases decreasing by 10.4% at 1 year, 12.3% at 2 years, 15.3% at 3 years, and 16.7% at three and a half years of the taxs introduction. CONCLUSIONS: The Catalonian SSB excise tax had a sustained and progressive impact over time, with a fall in consumption of as much as 16.7% three and half years after its introduction. The observed NSSB substitution effect should be borne in mind when considering the application of this type of tax to the rest of Spain.

However, despite the widespread use of e-cigarettes, also known as 'vaping', little is known regarding the effects of vaping on ACE-2 expression and how this affects SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, the added effect of nicotine in the vapor is also unknown. Thus, we tested whether vaping induces ACE-2 expression in the mouse lung. BALB/c mice exposed to e-cigarette vapor (+/-nicotine) resulted in a significant increase in peribronchiolar inflammation and influx of immune cells into the airways. Vapor increased monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin 1beta, and KC levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in both sexes, which were further enhanced by nicotine (whereas increase in interleukin 6 was sex and nicotine independent). The reduction in basal inspiratory capacity with vapor exposure occurred independent of sex or nicotine. The increase in methacholine-induced airway hyper-responsiveness was independent of sex;however, in female mice it was only significant in the nicotine-exposed group. Lung ACE-2 expression was increased in male mice in a nicotine-dependent manner as compared with female mice. Collectively, while vaping (+/-nicotine) induced airway inflammation and impaired lung function, the induction of lung ACE-2 occurred to a significantly greater degree in males exposed to vapor containing nicotine as compared with females.

The framework is based on the Tactical Urbanism (TU) practices and involves the use of Mobile Urban Elements (MUE) in uncertain and potentially confusing conditions (e.g., the COVID\\\\19 context). The methodology includes the application of the Four\\\\Phase Model (problem and ideation;development;implementation, testing and assessment;final pro-posal) and a quantitative and qualitative assessment. The proposed assessment criteria were developed through an evaluation according to three aspects: (1) feasibility impact;(2) social impact;and (3) spatial impact. The methodology was applied to Furnish, an urban design project based on a ULL and prototyping, which was recently developed in five European cities. The empirical results, obtained using the impact analysis, indicate that the prototypes developed in the project are trans-ferable to other cities and generate social interaction in public spaces. The applied research showed that the Four\\\\Phase Model may be used as a new and improved iterative design process: the LOOP Scheme. The application of this assessment methodology to ULLs may provide valuable information for the future planning of urban interventions in public spaces. ? 2021 by the authors.

Although children are less commonly infected by SARS-CoV-2 than their adult counterparts, and their symptoms are generally milder, a severe type of COVID-19 cannot be precluded. MethodsAt first, demographic, clinical, laboratory measurement data, and outcomes for 26 COVID-19 infected children of less than 12 years of age, admitted to King Abdallah Hospital, Bisha, Saudi Arabia, were retrieved from the electronic medical records for the observational retrospective study. Later, electronic and manual database searches were carried out for pediatric severe COVID-19-related articles. The relevant data from 20 eligible studies and the present retrospective study were analyzed to assess the association of demographic characteristics and comorbidities with COVID-19 severity. ResultsIn the retrospective study, 5 (19%) of the children presented with severe symptoms admitted to PICU, 18 (69%) presented with cough, 5 (19%) with diarrhea, 7 (27%) with underlying comorbidities, 4 (15%) with respiratory illnesses, 3 (12%) with cardiovascular diseases and 2 (8%) were obese. None of the patient characteristics showed any significant association with COVID-19 severity. Of the 21 studies selected for meta-analyses, 14 studies were included in the analysis of the association between any comorbidity and disease severity, resulting in OR: 2.69, 95%CI: 1.38 - 5.26, P < 0.05, for analysis of the association between cardiovascular comorbidities and disease severity 14 studies were included giving OR: 4.06, 95%CI: 1.86 - 8.87, P < 0.05, for analysis of the association between respiratory comorbidity and disease severity 15 studies were included giving OR: 2.05, 95%CI: 1.54 - 2.74, P < 0.05, for analysis of the association between obesity and disease severity 10 studies were included, giving OR: 2.48, 95%CI: 1.16 - 5.32, P < 0.05, for analysis of the association between age <10 years old and diseases severity, 16 studies were included, giving OR: 0.80, 95%CI: 0.65 - 0.97, P < 0.05, and for analysis of the association between female gender and disease severity, 19 studies were included, giving OR: 0.83, 95%CI: 0.59 - 1.18, P > 0.05. ConclusionIt can be concluded that COVID-19 pediatric patients with underlying comorbidities, being cardiovascular, respiratory, or obesity, are at high risk of developing severe illness, and young age has a protective role against the disease severity.","output":"Clinical Determinants and Predictors for Prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 Infected Pediatric Patients in Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The resuscitation guidelines provided for the COVID-19 pandemic strongly recommended wearing personal protective equipment. The current study aimed to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of chest compressions and the level of fatigue while wearing two different types of mask (surgical vs. cloth). METHODS: A randomized, non-inferiority, simulation study was conducted. Participants were randomised into two groups: surgical mask group (n = 108) and cloth mask group (n = 108). The effectiveness (depth and rate) of chest compressions was measured within a 2-min continuous chest-compression-only CPR session. Data were collected through an AMBU CPR Software, a questionnaire, recording vital parameters, and using Borg-scale related to fatigue (before and after the simulation). For further analysis the 2-min session was segmented into 30-s intervals. RESULTS: Two hundred sixteen first-year health care students participated in our study. No significant difference was measured between the surgical mask and cloth mask groups in chest compression depth (44.49  10.03 mm vs. 45.77  10.77 mm), rate (113.34  17.76/min vs. 111.23  17.51/min), and the level of fatigue (5.72  1.69 vs. 5.56  1.67) (p > 0.05 in every cases). Significant decrease was found in chest compression depth between the first 30-s interval and the second, third, and fourth intervals (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The effectiveness of chest compressions (depth and rate) was non-inferior when wearing cloth mask compared to wearing surgical mask. However, the effectiveness of chest compressions decreased significantly in both groups during the 2-min chest-compression-only CPR session and did not reach the appropriate chest compression depth range recommended by the ERC.","output":"How effective are chest compressions when wearing mask?

For the prevention and treatment of COVID19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, it has become increasingly apparent that T cell responses are equally, if not more important than humoral responses in mediating recovery and immune-protection. One of the major challenges in developing T cell-based therapies for infectious and malignant diseases has been the identification of immunogenic epitopes that can elicit a meaningful T cell response. Traditionally, this has been achieved using sophisticated in silico methods to predict putative epitopes deduced from binding affinities and consensus data. Our studies find that, in contrast to current dogma, immunodominant SARS-CoV-2 peptides defined by such in silico methods often fail to elicit T cell responses recognizing naturally presented SARS-CoV-2 epitopes.","output":"In Silico Defined SARS-CoV2 Epitopes May Not Predict Immunogenicity to COVID19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Australia, the number of young people presenting to the emergency department with mental health concerns, in particular, suicidal behaviour (defined here as suicidal ideation, thoughts, intent and attempts) is increasing.

In this qualitative study, we conducted a series of focus groups with 55 young people aged 16C25 years, with a view to developing a framework for youth suicide prevention for Western Australia. The data were analysed using a general inductive analysis approach. We explored the experiences and perceptions of the care and management of 35 young people presenting to Western Australian hospital emergency departments. Participants described a range of negative experiences relating to the emergency department environment, staff attitudes and their treatment by staff. We argue that adapting ED practices and approaches to young people presenting with suicidal thoughts and behaviours based on these findings will result in lower rates of repeated presentations and admissions to hospital and lower rates of suicide attempts and deaths by suicide.","output":"They Told Me This Isnt a Hotel: Young Peoples Experiences and Perceptions of Care When Presenting to the Emergency Department with Suicide-Related Behaviour"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In times of a pandemic, not only infections but also conspiracy narratives spread among people. These have the potential to influence the course of the pandemic. Here we summarize and critically evaluate studies from the first year of the pandemic presenting findings on the association between COVID-19-related conspiracy belief and infection-preventive behavior and vaccination willingness. METHOD: A systematic literature search was conducted using the databases COVID-19 Data Portal, APA PsycArticles, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences, Scopus, and PubMed. After removing duplicates, studies meeting the previously defined inclusion and exclusion criteria were subjected to title and abstract screening and content reviewed and analyzed subsequently. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The systematic literature search yielded 17 studies meeting our pre-specified inclusion criteria. Twelve studies examined infection-preventive behavior (N = 16,485), and ten studies vaccination willingness (N = 20,210). In summary, belief in COVID-19-related conspiracy narratives was negatively associated with vaccination willingness and infection-preventive behavior. The results point to the importance of the content of the conspiracy narratives. Various explanatory approaches and possible moderator variables are discussed, referencing the state of research on conspiracy beliefs and health-related preventive behavior after the first year of the pandemic. We argue that future studies should strive for a consistent operationalization and use of the term conspiracy belief.

METHOD: Five cities (i.e., Shanghai, Suzhou, Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Hangzhou) with the largest number of H7N9 cases in mainland China from 2013 to 2017 were selected in this study. Data on laboratory-confirmed H7N9 human cases in those five cities were obtained from the Chinese National Influenza Centre. The detailed information of LPMs closure (i.e., area and duration) was obtained from the Ministry of Agriculture. We used a generalized linear model with a Poisson link to estimate the effect of LPMs closure, reported as relative risk reduction (RRR). We used classification and regression trees (CARTs) model to select and quantify the dominant factor of H7N9 infection. RESULTS: All five cities implemented the LPMs closure, and the risk of H7N9 infection decreased significantly after LPMs closure with RRR ranging from 0.80 to 0.93. Respectively, a long-term LPMs closure for 10C13 weeks elicited a sustained and highly significant risk reduction of H7N9 infection (RRR = 0.98). Short-time LPMs closure with 2 weeks in every epidemic did not reduce the risk of H7N9 infection (p > 0.05). Partially closed LPMs in some suburbs contributed only 35% for reduction rate (RRR = 0.35). Shenzhen implemented partial closure for first 3 epidemics (p > 0.05) and all closure in the latest 2 epidemic waves (RRR = 0.64). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that LPMs all closure in whole city can be a highly effective measure comparing with partial closure (i.e. only urban closure, suburb and rural remain open). Extend the duration of closure and consider permanently closing the LPMs will help improve the control effect. The effect of LPMs closure seems greater than that of meteorology on H7N9 transmission.","output":"Live poultry market closure and avian influenza A (H7N9) infection in cities of China, 2013C2017: an ecological study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dengue is the most important mosquito-borne viral pathogen globally, with approximately 100 million cases of acute dengue annually.

In this work it was aimed to assess ventilation conditions (carbon dioxide, CO(2)) and suspended particulate matter (PM(2.5), PM(10) and UFP) levels in 19 classrooms C including preschool, primary and secondary education C located in the metropolitan area of Ciudad Real, Central-Southern Spain, during the schools reopening (from September 30th until October 27th, 2020) after about 7 months of lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic. The classrooms that presented the worst indoor environmental conditions, according to the highest peak of concentration obtained, were particularly explored to identify the possible influencing factors and respective opportunities for improvement. Briefly, findings suggested that although ventilation promoted through opening windows and doors according to official recommendations is guaranteeing adequate ventilation conditions in most of the studied classrooms, thus minimizing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission, a total of 5 (26%) surveyed classrooms were found to exceed the recommended CO(2) concentration limit value (700 ppm). In general, preschool rooms were the educational environments that registered better ventilation conditions, while secondary classrooms exhibited the highest peak and average CO(2) concentrations. In turn, for PM(2.5), PM(10) and UFP, the concentrations assessed in preschools were, on average about 2-fold greater than the levels obtained in both primary and secondary classrooms. In fact, the indoor PM(2.5) and PM(10) concentrations substantially exceeded the recommended limits of 8hr-exposure, established by WHO, in 63% and 32% of the surveyed classrooms, respectively. Overall, it is expected that the findings presented in this study will assist the establishment of evidence-based measures (namely based on ensuring proper ventilation rates and air filtration) to mitigate preventable environmental harm in public school buildings, mainly at local and national levels.","output":"Assessment of CO(2) and aerosol (PM(2.5), PM(10), UFP) concentrations during the reopening of schools in the COVID-19 pandemic: The case of a metropolitan area in Central-Southern Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human-origin corona viruses have proved to be a possible source of acute respiratory tract disease in humans Their function in the upper respiratory aetiology of kids is not so sure At least 412 medical professionals were exposed to these diseases As of April 22For COVID-19, at least 96 physicians & 156 nursing staff in the whole of India positively identified As at least 826 hospital professionals who had interaction with infectious employees at least 20 hospitals were able to pass much of this virus to patients in the hospital had to avoid these transmissions, we developed an animatronics hand to sample a human Animation uses mechatronics to create machines that seem to move rather than mechanize Since the robot body would cost so much, we opted for a shadow hand instead ?
