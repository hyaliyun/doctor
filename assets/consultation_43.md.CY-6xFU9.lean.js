This article describes the effects in the medium term of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer registration in Europe, focusing on changes in cancer detection and treatment, possible reduction of CR resources and difficulties in the access to data sources. METHODS: A questionnaire was distributed in June 2020 to the directors of 108 CRs from 34 countries affiliated to the European Network of Cancer Registries, providing a 37% response rate. RESULTS: The results of the survey showed that cancer-screening programmes were mostly stopped or slowed down in the majority of regions covered by the respondent CRs. Cancer diagnostics and treatments were severely disrupted. The cancer registration process was also disrupted, due to changes in the work modalities for the personnel, as well as to the difficulties in accessing sources and/or receiving the notifications. In some CRs, staff was allocated to different activities related to controlling the pandemic. Several CRs reported that they were investigating the impact of COVID-19 on cancer care via dedicated studies.

It is still challenging to make a rapid and accurate diagnosis due to the various clinical manifestations and limitations in the diagnostic tools. METHOD: A 54-year-old man presented with intermittent productive cough and fever for 1 week. A chest X-ray demonstrated multiple consolidations in both lungs. Blood biochemistry indicated elevated immunoglobulin G levels. Including sputum cultures, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, influenza A and B virus were all negative. Computed tomography of the chest showed ground-glass opacities with a nodular pattern. The serum cryptococcal antigen test was positive; however, the cerebral spinal fluid was negative. The diagnosis of pulmonary cryptococcal infection was made. An initial bronchoscopy was performed unsuccessfully and the patient received intravenous fluconazole therapy for 2 weeks. Due to poor improvement of clinical condition, he then underwent a surgical lung biopsy. The pathology revealed several encapsulated yeast cells, diffuse pulmonary interstitial fibrosis, noncaseating granulomas surrounded by T lymphocytes and multinucleated giant cells with intracellular inclusions, confirming pulmonary yeast infection associated with hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Ultimately, fungal cultures of the pathology samples revealed Cryptococcus neoformans. Subsequently antifungal therapy combined with oral steroid treatment, his general condition improved. After a total of 6 months of antifungal therapy, the patient recovered completely.

Emergency departments (EDs), recognized as essential venues for HIV screening, may play a unique role in identifying undiagnosed HIV among PWID, who frequently present for complications of injection drug use (IDU). Our objective was to describe changes in HIV diagnoses among PWID detected by an ED HIV screening program and estimate the programs contribution to HIV diagnoses among PWID county-wide during the emergence of a regional HIV outbreak. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of electronically queried clinical records from an urban, safety-net EDs HIV screening program and publicly available HIV surveillance data for its surrounding county, Hamilton County, Ohio. Outcomes included the change in number of HIV diagnoses and the EDs contribution to case identification county-wide, overall and for PWID during 2014C2018. RESULTS: During 2014C2018, the annual number of HIV diagnoses made by the ED program increased from 20 to 42 overall, and from 1 to 18 for PWID. We estimated that the ED contributed 18% of HIV diagnoses in the county and 22% of diagnoses among PWID. CONCLUSIONS: The ED program contributed 1 in 5 new HIV diagnoses among PWID county-wide, further illustrating the importance of ED HIV screening programs in identifying undiagnosed HIV infections. In areas experiencing increasing IDU, HIV screening in EDs can provide an early indication of increasing HIV diagnoses among PWID and can substantially contribute to case-finding during an HIV outbreak.","output":"HIV detection by an emergency department HIV screening program during a regional outbreak among people who inject drugs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Healthcare workers are at elevated risk to develop symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in response to an outbreak of a highly infectious disease. The current study set-out to model the complex interrelations between PTSD symptoms during the peak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 outbreak in 291 Chinese healthcare workers and 291 matched control cases that were selected from the general population. For this purpose, we estimated regularized partial correlation networks. Within the network of healthcare workers, we observed a central role for avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event, physiological cue reactivity, anger/irritability, re-experiencing, and startle. We identified three clusters of closely interconnected PTSD symptoms in healthcare workers, consisting of (a) symptoms of re-experiencing and anxious arousal, (b) symptoms of avoidance and amnesia and (c) symptoms of emotional numbing and dysphoric arousal. Respectively, startle, avoidance of reminders and feeling detached emerged as bridging nodes in these communities. Although yielding highly similar network models, the PTSD symptom structure of healthcare workers showed several unique features compared to the matched control sample.

The working space required for traditional stapling devices limits their use in pediatric video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) lung lobectomy. The use of Hem-o-lok clips (Teleflex Medical Inc. Research Triangle Park, NC) has been described for a number of applications in minimally invasive surgery and may provide an alternative to traditional stapling devices for bronchial closure. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-four New Zealand White rabbits were used in the study. The hilus of each cranial lung lobe was sealed with the Endo GIA (Covidien Inc, Mansfield, MA) stapler or 2 Hem-o-lok clips and the lung lobe was removed. Lung inflation to leakage point was induced by incrementally increasing tidal volume. Side of leakage, volume at leakage, and airway pressure before leakage were recorded. RESULTS Fourteen rabbits were included in the data analysis. Leakage of air was first observed at the Hem-o-lok closure site in five rabbits and from the Endo GIA site in three rabbits. In the remaining six, both resection sites leaked simultaneously. The mean pressure before failure was 16.39  7.35 mm Hg for the Hem-o-lok clips, 17.98  11.12 mm Hg for the Endo GIA stapler, and 16.95  3.48 mm Hg for the simultaneous failures. No statistical differences were detected in airways pressures before leakage between hilar closure devices. CONCLUSIONS Despite advances in VATS, options for bronchial closure in pediatric patients undergoing VATS lung lobectomy remain limited.

At the time of presentation and enrollment, patients were asked about the presence of OD, fever, cough, shortness of breath, headache, rhinorrhea and sore throat. The severity of OD was assessed on an 11-point scale from 0 (none) to 10 (anosmia). Patients were either hospitalized or sent home for outpatient care based on standardized criteria. Results: Of 203 patients, who presented at a mean of 6 days into the COVID-19 disease course, 25 patients (12.3%) had new OD and 138 patients (68.0%) were admitted for their COVID-19. Patients admitted for COVID-19 had a higher prevalence of all symptoms assessed, including OD (p<0.05 in all cases), and OD identified admitted patients with 84.0% sensitivity and 34.3% specificity. On univariate logistic regression, hospitalization was associated with OD (odds ratio [OR] = 2.47, 95%CI: 1.085-6.911, p=0.049).

While the limited literature available is mixed regarding the severity of COVID-19 in patients receiving rituximab, there is minimal literature regarding persistent and relapsing COVID-19 in this patient population. This is a case series of patients with persistent COVID-19 who previously received rituximab. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of 5 patients admitted between 1/1/2021 and 5/1/2021 to our institution with confirmed COVID-19 and receipt of rituximab for any indication within the previous 12 months. Information regarding hospital readmissions, time course of positive infection, medical management, disease severity, and discharge disposition were collected. RESULTS: Five patients, median age of 46, currently or recently on rituximab therapy were admitted a median of 2 times due to persistent, severe COVID-19 (Table 1). Patients received their initial COVID-19 diagnosis a median of 34 days (8-102 days) since their last rituximab administration and had documented SARS-CoV-2 infection a median of 66 days (19-195 days; Figure 1).

RESULTS Eighty-five patients (93.4%) were fit for surgery, while five patients (5.5%) were temporarily excluded through 'telephone triage'; another two patients were excluded at in-hospital triage. A total of 71 out of 85 patients (83.5%) were diagnosed with invasive cancer, most of whom were undergoing breast-conserving surgery (61 out of 85 patients, 71.8%).

A total of 966 cases were reported, with death reported in 188 cases, suggesting an overall case fatality rate (CFR) of 19.5%. Of 70 cases for which the gender was reported, 47 (67.1%) were male. Most of the cases were reported from China, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia, with reports from other countries, including imported cases in Europe and North America. CONCLUSIONS: Internet-based reporting systems such as ProMED are useful to gather information and synthesize knowledge on emerging infections. Although certain areas need to be improved, ProMED provided useful information about coronaviruses especially during outbreaks.","output":"Coronavirus infections reported by ProMED, February 2000CJanuary 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increased inflammatory cytokines [such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#945;) and interleukin-6 (IL-6)] are observed in COVID-19 patients, especially in the severe group.

Sensitive tests that effectively predict the disease outcome are essentially required to guide proper intervention. Objectives: To evaluate the prognostic ability of serial procalcitonin (PCT) measurement to predict the outcome of COVID-19 patients, using PCT clearance (PCT-c) as a tool to reflect its dynamic changes. Methods: A prospective observational study of inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 at the Quarantine Hospitals of Ain-Shams University, Cairo, Egypt. During the first five days of hospitalization, serial PCT and PCT-c values were obtained and compared between survivors and non-survivors. Patients were followed up to hospital discharge or in-hospital mortality. Results: Compared to survivors, serial PCT levels of non-survivors were significantly higher (p<0.001) and progressively increased during follow-up, in contrast, PCT-c values were significantly lower (p<0.01) and progressively decreased. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that by using the initial PCT value alone, at a cut off value of 0.80 ng/ml, the area under the curve for predicting in-hospital mortality was 0.81 with 61.1% sensitivity and 87.3% accuracy. Serial measurements showed better predictive performance and the combined prediction value was better than the single prediction by the initial PCT. Conclusions: Serial PCT measurement could be a useful laboratory tool to predict the prognosis and outcome of COVID-19 patients.

HKU1 virus uses its S1 subunit C-terminal domain (CTD) and not the N-terminal domain like other lineage A -CoVs to bind to its yet unknown human receptor. Here we present the crystal structure of HKU1 CTD at 1.9 ? resolution. The structure consists of three subdomains: core, insertion and subdomain-1 (SD-1). While the structure of the core and SD-1 subdomains of HKU1 are highly similar to those of other -CoVs, the insertion subdomain adopts a novel fold, which is largely invisible in the cryo-EM structure of the HKU1 S trimer. We identify five residues in the insertion subdomain that are critical for binding of neutralizing antibodies and two residues essential for receptor binding.

One contributing factor is limited exposure to clinical research among trainees. We describe implementation and results of a virtual clinical research training program for Zambian clinical oncology fellows developed jointly by the Cancer Diseases Hospital in Zambia and the MD Anderson Cancer Center to address this need. METHODS The clinical research training program consisted of 14 weekly virtual lectures, development of research questions by Zambian clinical oncology fellows, assignment of faculty and peer mentors, longitudinal mentorship of research protocols, and anonymous precourse and postcourse surveys. The paired t-test was used to analyze the change in academic self-efficacy scores. RESULTS Fourteen Zambian clinical oncology fellows participated. Senior fellows were paired with research mentors, leading to the development of eight research protocols. A total of 70 meetings and 126 hours of mentorship occurred with a median of seven meetings and 15 hours per pairing. The precourse and postcourse survey response rates were 86% and 79%, respectively. There were statistically significant increases in nine of 12 academic self-efficacy domains. The largest gains were in ability to independently perform research (P < .001) and research mentorship (P = .02) with an average increase of 1.5 points on a five-point scale in both domains. CONCLUSION The Cancer Diseases Hospital MD Anderson Cancer Center clinical research training program for Zambian clinical oncology fellows led to increases in multiple academic self-efficacy domains among participants, formation of longitudinal mentorship groups with both faculty and peer mentors, and development of Zambian-led research protocols, demonstrating the feasibility of implementing a virtual model.

However, no data are available on its role in elderly patients. AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic role of LUS in elderly patients hospitalized for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia. METHODS: Consecutive elderly patients (age >65 years) hospitalized for COVID-19 were enrolled. Demographics, laboratory, comorbidity, and the clinical features of the patients were collected. All patients underwent LUS on admission to the ward. LUS characteristics have been analyzed. Uni- and multivariate analyses to evaluate predictors for in-hospital death were performed. RESULTS: Thirty-seven hospitalized elderly patients (19 men) with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection were consecutively enrolled. The median age was 82 years (interquartile range 74.5-93.5). Ultrasound alterations were found in all patients enrolled; inhomogeneous interstitial syndrome with spared areas (91.9%) and pleural alterations (100%) were the most frequent findings. At univariate analysis, LUS score (hazard ratio [HR] 1.168, 95% CI 1.049-1.301) and pleural effusions (HR 3.995, 95% CI 1.056-15.110) were associated with in-hospital death. At multivariate analysis, only LUS score (HR 1.168, 95% CI 1.049-1.301) was independelty associated with in-hospital death. The LUS score's best cutoff for distinguishing patients experiencing in-hospital death was 17 (at multivariate analysis LUS score &#8805;17, HR 4.827, 95% CI 1.452-16.040).

METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 117 confirmed patients with COVID-19 which conducted at a tertiary hospital in Daegu, South Korea. The primary outcome was defined as the severe and critical outcome (SCO), of which the composite outcomes of acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, intensive care unit care, and 28-day mortality. We analyzed what clinical features and glycemic control-related factors affect the prognosis of COVID-19 in the DM group. RESULTS: After exclusion, 110 participants were finally included. DM patients (n=29) was older, and showed higher blood pressure compared to non-DM patients. DM group showed higher levels of inflammation-related biomarkers and severity score, and highly progressed to SCO. After adjustment with other risk factors, DM increased the risk of SCO (odds ratio [OR], 10.771; P<0.001). Among the DM patients, SCO was more prevalent in elderly patients of &#8805;70 years old and age was an independent risk factor for SCO in patients with DM (OR, 1.175; P=0.014), while glycemic control was not.

Data on the relationship between public health restrictions, mobility, and pandemic growth has so far been conflicting. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the relationship between public health restriction tiers, mobility, and COVID-19 spread in five contiguous public health units (PHUs) in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: Weekly effective reproduction number (R(t)) was calculated based on daily cases in each of the five GTA public health units between March 1, 2020, and March 19, 2021. A global mobility index (GMI) for each PHU was calculated using Google Mobility data. Segmented regressions were used to assess changes in the behaviour of R(t) over time. We calculated Pearson correlation coefficients between GMI and R(t) for each PHU and mobility regression coefficients for each mobility variable, accounting for time lag of 0, 7, and 14 days. RESULTS: In all PHUs except Toronto, the most rapid decline in R(t) occurred in the first two weeks of the first province-wide lockdown, and this was followed by a slight trend to increased R(t) as restrictions decreased. This trend reversed in all PHUs between September 6(th) and October 10(th) after which R(t) decreased slightly over time without respect to public health restriction tier. GMI began to increase in the first wave even before restrictions were decreased. This secular trend to increased mobility continued into the summer, driven by increased mobility to recreational spaces. The decline in GMI as restrictions were reintroduced coincides with decreasing mobility to parks after September. During the first wave, the correlation coefficients between global mobility and R(t) were significant (p<0.01) in all PHUs 14 days after lockdown, indicating moderate to high correlation between decreased mobility and decreased viral reproduction rates, and reflecting that the incubation period brings in a time-lag effect of human mobility on R(t). In the second wave, this relationship was attenuated, and was only significant in Toronto and Durham at 14 days after lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: The association between mobility and COVID-19 spread was stronger in the first wave than the second wave. Public health restriction tiers did not alter the existing secular trend toward decreasing R(t) over time.","output":"Quantifying The Relationship Between Lockdowns, Mobility, and Effective Reproduction Number (Rt) During The COVID-19 Pandemic in The Greater Toronto Area"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To describe a maneuver to facilitate percutaneous arteriovenous fistula creation during venous arterialization procedures in patients with no-option critical limb ischemia. TECHNIQUE Following a failed arterial recanalization attempt, a balloon catheter is passed up to the tip of the guidewire. Venous access is gained distally, a 4-F sheath is antegradely passed, and a 4-mm GooseNeck snare is advanced through it. A fluoroscopic view that overlaps the snare and the inflated balloon is obtained. If the vein remains anterior with respect to the artery, a needle is inserted across the vein, passing through the snare loop and puncturing the intra-arterial balloon. A wire is inserted and placed inside the punctured balloon. The balloon is retrieved and the wire externalized through the femoral access. A catheter is advanced antegradely over this wire from the artery into the vein. If the vein remains posterior to the artery, a needle is inserted, puncturing the balloon and thereafter the vein (crossing through the snare). A wire is inserted, captured by the snare, and externalized through the vein sheath. A catheter is finally advanced over this wire from the vein into the artery.

The peer-reviewed literature suggests an increased risk of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) in the setting of COVID-19 infection. METHODS We searched 3 databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, and CINAHL) with search terms COVID-19, novel coronavirus, stroke, and cerebrovascular accident. Case series and case studies presenting patients positive for both COVID-19 and CVA published from January 1 through September 1, 2020, were included. Data collection and analysis was completed and risk of bias assessed. RESULTS The search identified 28 studies across 7 counties comprising 73 patients. Amongst patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection and CVA, the average age was 60; the most common preexisting conditions were hypertension and diabetes mellitus, and those without preexisting conditions were significantly younger with an average age of 47. Amongst hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and CVA, there was a bimodal association with COVID-19 infection severity with majority of patients classified with mild or critical COVID-19 infection. DISCUSSION The data suggest SARS-CoV-2 is a risk factor for developing stroke, particularly in patients with hypertension and diabetes. Furthermore, the younger average age of stroke in patients with SARS-CoV-2, particularly those patients with zero identifiable preexisting conditions, creates high suspicion that SARS-CoV-2 is an independent risk factor for development of stroke; however, this cannot yet be proven without comparable control population. The data suggest the risk of developing CVA in the setting of COVID-19 infection is not dependent upon severity of illness. Continued studies must be done to understand the epidemiologic factors of COVID-19 infection and stroke and the pathophysiology of the COVID-associated hypercoagulable state.","output":"Cerebrovascular Accident and SARS-CoV-19 (COVID-19): A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Methanol is a natural ingredient with major occurrence in fruit spirits, such as apple, pear, plum or cherry spirits, but also in spirits made from coffee pulp.

This article will review the several factors that influence the methanol content including the pH value of the mash, the addition of various yeast and enzyme preparations, fermentation temperature, mash storage, and most importantly the raw material quality and hygiene. From all these mitigation possibilities, lowering the pH value and the use of cultured yeasts when mashing fruit substances is already common as best practice today. Also a controlled yeast fermentation at acidic pH facilitates not only reduced methanol formation, but ultimately also leads to quality benefits of the distillate.

The model accounts for imperfect vaccination effectiveness, revaccinations and waning immunity. Different restrictions for pass holders and the rest of the population result in different scenarios of the epidemic evolution, some of which yield unfavourable COVID-19 dynamics and new waves. We identify critical variables that should be considered by policymakers and show how unfavourable outcomes can be avoided using adaptive policies. In particular, while pass holders could initially be allowed large freedoms, the gradual loss of immunity will require either increased restrictions for pass holders, or accelerated revaccination. In the long-term, common restrictions for both the pass holders and the rest of the population will have to be kept to avoid epidemic resurgence. Such minimum required restrictions depend on vaccination effectiveness, revaccination rate, waning rate and fraction of never-vaccinated population, and, for realistic combinations of these parameters, range between 29% and 69% reduction of contacts.","output":"Risk of COVID-19 epidemic resurgence with the introduction of vaccination passes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was firstly reported in late December of 2019 and subsequently caused a global outbreak.

We aimed to study the transmission dynamics of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 within families with children in Greece. METHODS: We studied 23 family clusters of COVID\\\\19. Infection was diagnosed by RT\\\\PCR in respiratory specimens. The level of viral load was categorized as high, moderate, or low based on the cycle threshold values. RESULTS: There were 109 household members (66 adults and 43 children). The median attack rate per cluster was 60% (range: 33.4%\\\\100%). An adult member with COVID\\\\19 was the first case in 21 (91.3%) clusters. Transmission of infection occurred from an adult to a child in 19 clusters and/or from an adult to another adult in 12 clusters. There was no evidence of child\\\\to\\\\adult or child\\\\to\\\\child transmission. In total 68 household members (62.4%) tested positive. Children were more likely to have an asymptomatic SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection compared to adults (40% versus 10.5%, p\\\\value=0.021). In contrast, adults were more likely to develop a severe clinical course compared to children (8.8% versus 0%, p\\\\value=0.021). In addition, infected children were significantly more likely to have a low viral load while adults were more likely to have a moderate viral load (40.7% and 18.5% versus 13.8% and 51.7%, respectively; p\\\\value=0.016). CONCLUSIONS: While children become infected by SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2, they do not appear to transmit infection to others. Furthermore, children more frequently have an asymptomatic or mild course compared to adults. Further studies are needed to elucidate the role of viral load on these findings.

Experiment 1 focused on the evaluation of clinical patterns, viremia, and serological responses. All infected calves in this experiment developed respiratory symptoms and seroconverted to BVDV positivity. Contact calves also contracted a respiratory tract infection following exposure to infected animals. Viremia was demonstrated between postinfection days 2 and 17, and the virus was detected in organ specimens of all but one each of the infected and contact calves. In experiment 2, the distribution of BVDV in various tissues of calves euthanized at defined days postinfection was studied. In two of these calves recurrent shedding of BVDV in nasal secretions was shown. BVDV was detected in various tissues of all infected calves throughout the experiment and also following seroconversion and the clearance of BVDV from the circulatory system. Despite the widespread distribution of the virus in various organs, significant tissue damage was found mainly in respiratory tract and lymphoid tissues. These experiments revealed that viruses from cluster Id of BVDV are able to induce primary respiratory disease in previously seronegative, immunocompetent calves. Contact transmission and virus recurrence, contrary to observations from acute experimental infections with noncytopathogenic BVDV, are likely to reflect differences in biological features of these cytopathogenic isolates. Virus shedding and its presence in tissues following peripheral clearance and in the presence of antibodies may have implications in the diagnosis, pathogenesis, and epidemiology of BVDV-induced syndromes in cattle.","output":"Pathogenesis of primary respiratory disease induced by isolates from a new genetic cluster of bovine viral diarrhea virus type I."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Originated in China, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)- the highly contagious and fatal respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has already infected more than 29 million people worldwide with a mortality rate of 3.15% (according to World Health Organization's (WHO's) report, September 2020) and the number is exponentially increasing with no remedy whatsoever discovered till date.

For these reasons, we developed the microRNA Analysis Portal (MAP). MAP selects relevant miRNA-focused articles from PubMed, links biomedical and molecular data and applies bioinformatics modules. At the time of this writing, MAP represents the richest, most complete and integrated database focused on microRNAs. MAP also integrates an updated version of MirCompare (2.0), a computational platform used for selecting plant microRNAs on the basis of their ability to regulate mammalian genes. Both MAP and MirCompare functionalities were used to predict that microRNAs from Moringa oleifera have putative roles across kingdoms by regulating human genes coding for proteins of the immune system. Starting from a selection of 94 human microRNAs, MirCompare selected 6 Moringa oleifera functional homologs. The subsequent prediction of human targets and areas of functional enrichment highlighted the central involvement of these genes in regulating immune system processes, particularly the host-virus interaction processes in hepatitis B, cytomegalovirus, papillomavirus and coronavirus.

Offshore wind energy projects have been promptly suggested in Vietnam due to policy advancement, with the country's excellent wind resources. The success of an offshore wind energy project is decided mainly by choosing the best location for offshore wind power station (OWPS) construction, which is a complex multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) problem with the coexistence of conflicting factors. There is a problem with incomplete decision information use and information loss during the decision-making process, and it is easy to overlook the interaction difficulty in a fuzzy environment. To address the complex nature of the prioritization problem posed, this study proposes a hybrid MCDM framework combining the spherical fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (SF-AHP) and weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS). SF-AHP is used in the first stage to determine the significance levels of OWPS evaluation criteria. WASPAS is then utilized to rank locations of OWPS. A comprehensive set of evaluation criteria developed based on the concept of sustainable development has been recognized by reviewing the literature review and interviewing experts to practice the two-stage MCDM model. A real case study for Vietnam is conducted to test the effectiveness of the proposed method. The best location schemes have been determined by using the decision framework. The results of the sensitivity analysis and a comparison analysis demonstrate that the decision framework is practical and robust.

OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to evaluate changes in QTc in patients receiving double (Hydroxychloroquine + Azithromycin) and triple therapy (Hydroxychloroquine + Azithromycin + Lopinavir/Ritonavir) to treat COVID-19. Secondary outcome was the incidence of in-hospital all-cause mortality. METHODS: Patients under treatment with double (DT) and triple therapy (TT) for COVID-19 were consecutively included in this prospective observational study. Serial in-hospital electrocardiograms were performed to measure QTc at baseline and during therapy. RESULTS: 168 patients (66.2 years old) were included: 32.1% received DT and 67.9% received TT. The mean baseline QTc was 410.33 ms. Patients under DT and TT prolonged QTc interval respect baseline values (p < 0.001), without significant differences between both therapy groups (p = 0.748). Overall, 33 patients (19.6%) had a peak QTc and/or an increase QTc 60 ms from baseline, with a higher prevalence among those with hypokalemia (p = 0.003).

The performances of different schemes with various alighting and boarding passenger ratios are simulated with the software package Legion Studio. Both macroscopic and microscopic parameters to characterize passenger conflicts are obtained for analysis.

Because of the phylogenetic similarity to humans, rhesus macaques are an animal model of choice for many virus-challenge and vaccine-evaluation studies, including SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show that immunization of macaques with SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein generates potent receptor binding domain cross- neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses to both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1, in contrast to human infection or vaccination where responses are typically SARS-CoV-2-specific. Furthermore, the macaque nAbs are equally effective against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Structural studies show that different immunodominant sites are targeted by the two primate species. Human antibodies generally target epitopes strongly overlapping the ACE2 receptor binding site (RBS), whereas the macaque antibodies recognize a relatively conserved region proximal to the RBS that represents another potential pan-SARS-related virus site rarely targeted by human antibodies. B cell repertoire differences between the two primates appear to significantly influence the vaccine response and suggest care in the use of rhesus macaques in evaluation of vaccines to SARS-related viruses intended for human use.

Masks are essentially air filters worn on the face that should filter out as many of the dangerous particles as possible. Here, the dangerous particles are the droplets containing the virus that are exhaled by an infected person. Woven fabric is unlike the material used in standard air filters. Woven fabric consists of fibers twisted together into yarns that are then woven into fabric. There are, therefore, two lengthscales: the diameters of (i) the fiber and (ii) the yarn. Standard air filters have only (i). To understand how woven fabrics filter, we have used confocal microscopy to take three-dimensional images of woven fabric. We then used the image to perform lattice Boltzmann simulations of the air flow through fabric. With this flow field, we calculated the filtration efficiency for particles a micrometer and larger in diameter. In agreement with experimental measurements by others, we found that for particles in this size range, the filtration efficiency is low. For particles with a diameter of 1.5 m, our estimated efficiency is in the range 2.5%C10%. The low efficiency is due to most of the air flow being channeled through relatively large (tens of micrometers across) inter-yarn pores. So, we conclude that due to the hierarchical structure of woven fabrics, they are expected to filter poorly.","output":"Modeling the filtration efficiency of a woven fabric: The role of multiple lengthscales Note: This paper is part of the special topic, Flow and the Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to examine the governance and policy-making challenges in the context of wicked problems based on the case of pandemic influenza.

The objective of this article is to provide an overview of the key features of mantram and the Mantram Repetition Program (MRP) developed in the US Veterans Healthcare System, the evidence base for the MRP, and its applications. METHODS: MRP practices are portable and do not require an extended or regularized period of sitting, in contrast to most methods of meditation. Core functions of MRP practices include focus shifting, frame activation, and fostering of mindfulness. We review scientific research, including multiple randomized trials, that has investigated the MRP. RESULTS: Research on the MRP has documented reductions in posttraumatic stress symptoms, insomnia, hyperarousal, and depression, as well as enhancement of quality of life, self-efficacy, and mindfulness. Mantram repetition may possess comparative advantages for managing symptoms of various mental health conditions, including posttraumatic stress disorder, HIV/AIDS, cancer, and chronic diseases.

Published literature across disciplines about the role of masks in mitigating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission is summarized. Growing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is airborne indicates that infection control interventions must go beyond contact and droplet measures (such as handwashing and cleaning surfaces) and attend to masking and ventilation. Observational evidence suggests that masks work mainly by source control (preventing infected persons from transmitting the virus to others), but laboratory studies of mask filtration properties suggest that they could also provide some protection to wearers (protective effect). Even small reductions in individual transmission could lead to substantial reductions in population spread. To date, only 1 randomized controlled trial has examined a community mask recommendation. This trial did not identify a significant protective effect and was not designed to evaluate source control. Filtration properties and comfort vary widely across mask types. Masks may cause discomfort and communication difficulties. However, there is no evidence that masks result in significant physiologic decompensation or that risk compensation and fomite transmission are associated with mask wearing. The psychological effects of masks are culturally shaped; they may include threats to autonomy, social relatedness, and competence. Evidence suggests that the potential benefits of wearing masks likely outweigh the potential harms when SARS-CoV-2 is spreading in a community. However, mask mandates involve a tradeoff with personal freedom, so such policies should be pursued only if the threat is substantial and mitigation of spread cannot be achieved through other means.","output":"Masks and Face Coverings for the Lay Public : A Narrative Update"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Parents have faced substantial social and economic challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The mean depression score (831, 95% CI 797-865) and anxiety score (1190, 1166-1213) at the COVID-19 pandemic timepoint were higher than previous data collection waves at the 3-year timepoint (mean depression score 505, 485-525; mean anxiety score 951, 935-966), 5-year timepoint (mean depression score 543, 520-566; mean anxiety score 949, 933-965), and 8-year timepoint (mean depression score 579, 555-602; mean anxiety score 1026, 1010-1042). For the within-person comparisons, depression scores were a mean of 230 points (95% CI 195-265) higher and anxiety scores were a mean of 104 points (065-143) higher at the COVID-19 pandemic timepoint, after controlling for time trends. Larger increases in depression and anxiety symptoms were observed for women who had income disruptions, difficulty balancing home schooling with work responsibilities, and those with difficulty obtaining childcare. White mothers had greater increases in anxiety scores than non-white mothers and health-care workers had smaller increases in depressive symptoms than non-health-care workers. INTERPRETATION: Compared with previous estimates, the prevalence of maternal depression and anxiety among mothers in a Canadian cohort increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Financial support, childcare provision, and avoiding the closure of schools, might be key priorities for preventing future increases in maternal psychological distress.

The number of confirmed cases has continued to increase, causing damage to society and the economy worldwide. The public pays close attention to information on the pandemic and learns about the disease through various media outlets. The dissemination of comprehensive and accurate COVID-19 information that the public needs helps to educate people so they can take preventive measures. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the dissemination of COVID-19 information by analyzing the information released by the official WeChat account of the Peoples Daily during the pandemic. The most-read COVID-19 information in China was summarized, and the factors that influence information dissemination were studied to understand the characteristics that affect its dissemination. Moreover, this was conducted in order to identify how to effectively disseminate COVID-19 information and to provide suggestions on how to manage public opinion and information governance during a pandemic. METHODS: This was a retrospective study based on a WeChat official account. We collected all COVID-19Crelated information, starting with the first report about COVID-19 from the Peoples Daily and ending with the last piece of information about lifting the first-level emergency response in 34 Chinese provinces. A descriptive analysis was then conducted on this information, as well as on Qingbo Big Datas dissemination index. Multiple linear regression was utilized to study the factors that affected information dissemination based on various characteristics and the dissemination index. RESULTS: From January 19 to May 2, 2020, the Peoples Daily released 1984 pieces of information; 1621 were related to COVID-19, which mainly included headline news items, items with emotional content, and issues related to the pandemics development. By analyzing the dissemination index, seven information dissemination peaks were discerned. Among the three dimensions of COVID-19 informationmedia salience, content, and formateight factors affected the spread of COVID-19 information. CONCLUSIONS: Different types of pandemic-related information have varying dissemination power. To effectively disseminate information and prevent the spread of COVID-19, we should identify the factors that affect this dissemination. We should then disseminate the types of information the public is most concerned about, use information to educate people to improve their health literacy, and improve public opinion and information governance.","output":"COVID-19 Information Dissemination Using the WeChat Communication Index: Retrospective Analysis Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China in December 2019. Although, the disease appeared in Africa later than other regions, it has now spread to virtually all countries on the continent. We provide early spatio-temporal dynamics of COVID-19 within the first 62 days of the disease's appearance on the African continent. We used a two-parameter hurdle Poisson model to simultaneously analyse the zero counts and the frequency of occurrence. We investigate the effects of important healthcare capacities including hospital beds and number of medical doctors in different countries. The results show that cases of the pandemic vary geographically across Africa with notably high incidence in neighbouring countries particularly in West and North Africa. The burden of the disease (per 100 000) mostly impacted Djibouti, Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria. Temporally, during the first 4 weeks, the burden was highest in Senegal, Egypt and Mauritania, but by mid-April it shifted to Somalia, Chad, Guinea, Tanzania, Gabon, Sudan and Zimbabwe. Currently, Namibia, Angola, South Sudan, Burundi and Uganda have the least burden.

Words such as ?pre-existing conditions?, ?risk groups?, ?accessibility?, and ?vulnerability? have become everyday elements of official and informal communications across the globe. In this article, I explore the contradictions that arise from such uses through the lens of crip studies. In the first part, I observe how the idea of vulnerability became mainstream, moving from being usually attached to disability and illness to being depicted as a universal condition. Such a shift serves the double purpose of reinstating the predominance of able-bodiedness as the preferable normalcy and invisibilising the particular conditions of disabled and chronically ill people in the pandemic. In the second part, I discuss the perverse use of the expressions ?risk group? and ?underlying conditions? as biopolitical tools to reinforce already existing forms of oppression. The third part comprises a reflection on accessibility and the sudden advent of working-from-home. Finally, I reflect on confinement and interdependence as key concepts to draft a politics of transformation that moves from disability and chronic illness to include all experiences of intersectional oppression. As other markers of oppression, illness and disability can determine the possibilities of survival through the crisis, not only because they are linked to bodily fragility but also because of the systemic violence they are immersed in. The knowledge produced from a place of vulnerability can hence show interesting elements to better understand the challenges of this pandemic through an intersectional perspective.","output":"When vulnerability got mainstream: Reading the pandemic through disability and illness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The HR has a significant role to play in crisis management The corona virus eruption is initial and foremost a person's tragedy, moving many thousands of individuals The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading at an unprecedented speed Common respiratory disease, that's worst this year then the foremost, may be a way more vital threat to the world The crisis can impact your organization and employees resulting in a fatal impact on an organizations business gain and even sustainability The foremost necessary issue HR leaders can do is to stay up that perspective and guard against over-reaction Fears concerning the corona virus are comprehensible By providing employees with correct knowledge concerning corona virus, HR leaders can maintain sensible order and defend the organization against potential liability Therefore on avoid the unfold of data, HR leaders need to endeavor to form certain that employees arent sharing false information or gossiping concerning others Scientists still arent entirely positive but the virus is transmitted and, for now, there is no immunizing agent to protective cover against it We are going to use the trends to adapt organizations and additionally the personnel to the new things, and part to assist to put together the new scenario HR ought to take the responsibility to confirm that their organizations are aware about the impact of internal strengths & weaknesses on the human aspect to differing kinds of crises and also the crisis management set up covers all potential HR risks, concerns, and needs After few days, people massively stepped up the use of technologies that modify remote learning, working, services and consumption However this crisis is teaching us a vital human lesson Its a health and safety crisis initial and economic and business drawback second We've to have concern about creating individuals safety first ? 2020 SERSC","output":"Role of hr trends in corona-crisis management and organizational sustainability readiness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The rapidly evolving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in more than 24 million infections and 821 thousand deaths However, a vaccine or specific drug is absent up to this date and more attention has been focused on the use of convalescent plasma (CP) Several articles have described the CP treatment for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection But a comprehensive systematic review with meta-analysis about the safety and efficacy of CP transfusion in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients has not been published We conducted this study for a better understanding of the therapeutic significance of CP for patients with COVID-19 Results: A fixed-effect model (I-2=0 0%) was used on the 9 articles for quantitative analysis showing that the mortality of patients with COVID-19 treated with or without CP was statistically significant (RR=0 57 [0 44-0 74]) Subgroup analysis showed that the severely ill patients benefited more from CP than the critically ill patients Our study concluded that clinical improvement in severe COVID-19 cases were obvious Adverse events were few and the effect of convalescent plasma on reducing viral load was apparent Conclusions: Convalescent plasma therapy appears safe for COVID-19, and plasma treated patients have marked reductions in their serum viral loads and most are virus negative after transfusion Patients with severe COVID-19 benefit more from the convalescent plasma transfusion than critical patients, and patients treated in early stage are more likely to survive Methods: We reviewed the scientific literature from four databases published from December 8, 2019 to August 20, 2020 Statistical analyses were performed with STATA (version 15 1;Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA) The frequency with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was assessed using fixed effect model in analyzing the overall mortality and p &lt;0 05 was considered statistically significant","output":"Safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy in severely and critically ill patients with COVID-19: a systematic review with meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 has caused calamitous health, economic and societal consequences globally.

However, dense depth estimation from stereo fisheye image pair is apparently a more challenging problem. There are two main factors adding to the complexity of the problem: (I) owing to the wider field of view, the fisheye lenses are inherently nonlinear thus making the estimation problem harder. (II) because we want to estimate depth for every pixel coordinate from just two images, i.e. a calibrated stereo pair, the data is statistically insufficient thus greatly complexifying the problem. To alleviate (II) many depth estimation algorithms enlarge their parameter space by incorporating pose parameters and work on image sequence (esp. videos). Here we stick to the stereo camera setting and provide a novel estimation technique and quantify its uncertainty. We use the technique of variational calculus to derive a (noisy) pde for which wellposedness is proved and then solved in the least square sense using proximal algorithms. This setting enables us to invoke the standard machinery of nonlinear least squares for generating the covariance estimates. Most state of the art algorithms that are based on deep learning (nonlinear regression) technique fail to say anything about the uncertainty of the outputs which is of paramount importance in safety critical applications for e.g. arising in automotive domain.

We find that unfortunately, inequality kills: departments with higher income inequality face more deaths, more discharged (gravely ill) patients and more infections. While other papers have studied the impact of the level of income on the severity of COVID-19, we find that it is in fact the dispersion across incomes within the same department that drives the results.

Methods : IMIA Primary Care Informatics Working Group members from Australia, Canada, United Kingdom and United States developed a standardised template for collection of information. The template guided a rapid literature review. We also included experiential learning from primary care and public health perspectives. Results : All countries responded rapidly. Common themes included rapid reductions then transformation to virtual visits, pausing of non-COVID related informatics projects, all against a background of non-standardized digital development and disparate territory or state regulations and guidance. Common barriers in these four and in less-resourced countries included disparities in internet access and availability including bandwidth limitations when internet access was available, initial lack of coding standards, and fears of primary care clinicians that patients were delaying care despite the availability of televisits. Conclusions : Primary care clinicians were able to respond to the COVID crisis through telehealth and electronic record enabled change. However, the lack of coordinated national strategies and regulation, assurance of financial viability, and working in silos remained limitations.

Within Europe, the first countries to be strongly affected have been Italy and Spain. In Spain, infection has expanded in highly populated areas, resulting in one of the largest nationwide bursts so far by early April. We analyze the evolution of the growth curve of the epidemic in both the whole of Spain and Madrid Autonomous Region (the second largest conurbation in Europe), based on the cumulative numbers of reported cases and deaths. We conducted segmented, linear regressions on log-transformed data to identify changes in the slope of these curves and/or sudden shifts in the number of cases (i.e. changes in the intercept) at fitted breaking points, and compared their results with a timeline including both key events of the epidemic and containment measures taken by the national and regional governments. Results were largely consistent in the four curves analyzed (reported infections and deaths for Spain and Madrid, respectively), showing two major shifts in slopes (growth rates) at 14-15 and 26-29 March that resulted in 37-65% reductions of slope, and originated in infection on 4-5 and 16-18 March (for case detections) and 14-23 February and 5-6 March (for deaths). Small upward shifts in the progress of the disease in Madrid were not associated with significant changes in the intercept of the curve, and seem related with unevenness in case reporting. These results evidence an early deceleration in the spread of COVID-19 coinciding with personal hygiene and social distancing recommendations, as well as the general awareness of the population; and a second, stronger decrease when harder isolation measures were enforced. The combination of both breakpoints seemingly led to the start of the contention of the disease outbreak by early April, the limit of our time series. This highlights the importance of adopting public health strategies that include disseminating basic knowledge on personal hygiene and reduced social contact at the onset of the epidemic, and the importance of early enforcement of hard contention measures for its subsequent contention.","output":"Chasing the ghost of infection past: identifying thresholds of change during the COVID-19 infection in Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Librarians from six diverse public and private higher education institutions describe the challenges their libraries have experienced, as well as the operational opportunities that have arisen, in managing electronic resources during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Data collection was conducted within the Medical Informatics Initiative. Outcomes were fractions and admissions. Controlling for decreasing hospital admissions during holidays, calendar weeks of 2018/2019 were aligned to Easter 2020. A lockdown period (LP; 16/03/2020C02/08/2020) and a return-to-normal period (RNP; 04/05/2020C02/08/2020) were defined. The study sample comprised a control (admission 2018/19) and study cohort (admission 2020). We computed weekly incidence and IR ratios from generalized linear mixed models. RESULTS: We included 9365 (CC: 2040, HNC: 7325) inpatient hospital admissions from 14 German university hospitals. For CC, fractions decreased by 19.97% in 2020 compared to 2018/19 in the LP. In the RNP the reduction was 28.57% (p < 0.001 for both periods). LP fractions for HNC increased by 10.38% (RNP: 9.27%; p < 0.001 for both periods). Admissions for CC decreased in both periods (LP: 10.2%, RNP: 22.14%), whereas for HNC, admissions increased (LP: 2.25%, RNP: 1.96%) in 2020. Within LP, for CC, radiotherapy admissions without brachytherapy were reduced by 23.92%, whereas surgery-related admissions increased by 20.48%. For HNC, admissions with radiotherapy increased by 13.84%, while surgery-related admissions decreased by 11.28% in the same period. CONCLUSION: Related to the COVID-19 lockdown in an inpatient setting, radiotherapy for HNC treatment became a more frequently applied modality, while admissions of CC cases decreased.

Here we predict, based on the liability threshold model, the expected reduction in complex disease risk following polygenic embryo screening for a single disease. A strong determinant of the potential utility of such screening is the selection strategy, a factor that has not been previously studied. When only embryos with a very high PRS are excluded, the achieved risk reduction is minimal. In contrast, selecting the embryo with the lowest PRS can lead to substantial relative risk reductions, given a sufficient number of viable embryos. We systematically examine the impact of several factors on the utility of screening, including: variance explained by the PRS, number of embryos, disease prevalence, parental PRSs, and parental disease status. We consider both relative and absolute risk reductions, as well as population-averaged and per-couple risk reductions, and also examine the risk of pleiotropic effects. Finally, we confirm our theoretical predictions by simulating 'virtual' couples and offspring based on real genomes from schizophrenia and Crohn's disease case-control studies.

Employing the Connectivity Map (CMap) that contains >54,000 compounds, we performed an unbiased in silico screen using the transcriptomic profiles of cisplatin-resistant and -sensitive cancer cell lines. Pathway enrichment analysis identified gene-drug targets for which 30 candidate drugs were selected with potential to confer protection against cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. In parallel, transcriptomic analysis of a cisplatin-treated cochlear-derived cell line identified common enriched pathway targets. We subsequently tested these top 30 candidate compounds, 15 (50%) of which are FDA-approved for other indications, and 26 (87%) of which were validated for their protective effects in either a cochlear-derived cell line or zebrafish lateral line neuromasts, thus confirming our in silico transcriptomic approach. Among these top compounds, niclosamide, a salicyanilide drug approved by the FDA for treating tapeworm infections for decades, protected from cisplatin- and noise-induced hearing loss in mice. Finally, niclosamide and ezetimibe (an Nrf2 agonist) exerted synergistic protection against cisplatin-ototoxicity in zebrafish, validating the Nrf2 pathway as part of niclosamides mechanism of action.

Here we profiled the binding and functional capacity of convalescent antibodies and Moderna mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine-induced antibodies across SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs). While neutralizing responses to VOCs decreased in both groups, Fc-mediated responses were distinct. In convalescent individuals, while antibodies exhibited robust binding to VOCs, they showed compromised interactions with Fc-receptors. Conversely, vaccine-induced antibodies also bound robustly to VOCs but continued interacting with Fc-receptors and mediated antibody effector functions. These data point to a resilience in the mRNA vaccine-induced humoral immune response that may continue to protect from SARS-CoV-2 VOCs independent of neutralization.","output":"mRNA-1273 vaccine-induced antibodies maintain Fc-effector functions across SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the sources of functional foodstuff is carbohydrate-based commodities which contain anthocyanin These commodities include black rice, purple corn, and purple sweet potato The anthocyanin compound is a pigment which is responsible for the purple color to the produced commodities This compound possesses antioxidative activities which are able to bind with free radical compounds and protect human body against various diseases Physiological function of the anthocyanin in foodstuff has attract particular interest for further exploration, particularly on its bioavailability nature, functional food ingredients, and its product's appearances Several anthocyanin-rich varieties such as Jeliteng black rice, Srikandi Ungu corn, and Antin purple sweet potato has been released by Indonesian Agency for Agricultural Research and Development (IAARD) In the future, development of processed functional food product is expected to raise in line with the increase in the public's interest on the important of the health The specific function of antioxidant derived from the anthocyanin compound enable human immunity increase which is recently getting popular, particularly during COVID-19 pandemic Potential development of the foodstuffs associated with anthocyanin involves various research from upstream to downstream, starting from superior varieties development which contain higher anthocyanin content, by product creation with higher functional values and preferred by the consumers","output":"Prospects of anthocyanin-rich carbohydrates sources commodity development to support functional food diversification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Acute allergic reactions to messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines are rare but may limit public health immunization efforts.

Methods: This was a retrospective evaluation of referrals to the allergy and immunology clinic for a presumed allergic reaction to the first dose of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) between December 17, 2020, and February 28, 2021. Recommendations for the second dose and outcomes were evaluated by trained board-certified allergists. Results: Seventy-seven patients presented with a Pfizer-BioNTech reaction (56 [72.7%]) or with a Moderna reaction (21 [27.3%]). Most patients (69.7%) had symptom onset within 4 hours. Most commonly reported symptoms were cutaneous (51.9%), cardiovascular (48.1%), and respiratory (33.8%) symptoms. Recommendations included to proceed with the single dose (70.1%), two-step graded dose (19.5%), or deferral (10.4%). Twelve of 15 patients completed the second dose with a graded-dose protocol. Of these patients, five reported at least one or more similar symptoms as experienced with their first dose. Conclusion: Of the patients with presumed allergic reactions to their first dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, most were able to safely receive the second dose.

We identified 870 migraine patients treated at the Leiden Headache Center with headache e-diaries during the period of interest. Adherence to the e-diary had to be &#8805;80%, yielding 592 enrolled patients. RESULTS: Intelligent lockdown led to a decrease in monthly migraine days (-0.48; 95% CI: -0.78 to -0.18, p = 0.002) and acute medication days (-0.48; 95% CI: -0.76 to -0.20, p < 0.001), and an increase in general well-being (0.11; 95% CI: 0.06 to 0.17, p < 0.001).

METHODS: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients who needed oxygen therapy from February to November 2020 were included in the study. The patients were divided into early and late groups based on the time when the oxygen requirement occurred. Basic and epidemiologic characteristics were compared. Clinical variables were analyzed in both groups. RESULTS: A total of 164 patients needed oxygen therapy, 94 of whom were in the early group and 70 of whom were in the late group. The early and late groups had similar baseline characteristics except age (median age, 73 vs. 67 years), uncertain exposure history (50% vs. 31.4%) and the time from the onset of illness to admission (median, 5 vs. 2 days). Multivariate analysis showed that age > 65 years (OR, 4.65), symptom onset > 5 days (OR, 9.13) and several clinical manifestations, such as febrile sensation (OR, 6.01), dyspnea (OR, 30.0), C-reactive protein > 1 mg/dL (OR, 7.87) and chest X-ray abnormality (OR, 8.15), were predictive factors in the early group.

SARS-CoV-2 infections were first detected in a Chinese Province in December 2019 and then declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. An infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 may result in asymptomatic, uncomplicated or fatal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Fatal disease has been linked with the uncontrolled cytokine storm manifesting with complications mostly in people with underlying cardiovascular and pulmonary disease conditions. The severity of COVID-19 disease and the associated mortality has been disproportionately lower in terms of number of cases and deaths in Africa and also Asia in comparison to Europe and North America. Also, persons of colour residing in Europe and North America have been identified as a highly susceptible population due to a combination of several socioeconomic factors and poor access to quality healthcare. Interestingly, this has not been the case in sub-Saharan Africa where majority of the population are even more deprived of the aforementioned factors. On the contrary, sub-Saharan Africa has recorded the lowest levels of mortality and morbidity associated with the disease, and an overwhelming proportion of infections are asymptomatic. Whilst it can be argued that these lower number of cases in Africa may be due to challenges associated with the diagnosis of the disease such as lack of trained personnel and infrastructure, the number of persons who get infected and develop symptoms is proportionally lower than those who are asymptomatic, including asymptomatic cases that are never diagnosed.

CASE SUMMARY: A 54-year-old female hypertensive patient, with a history of non-revascularized inferior and anterior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI) 4 years prior, was admitted to the cardiac unit of the hospital with complaints of abdominal pain and dyspnea lasting 2 mo. The patient was hemodynamically stable, and 12-lead electrocardiogram showed persistent ST elevation and Q wave in the inferior and apical regions. Transthoracic echocardiogram in the two-chamber view showed a narrow neck of a wide PAN in the distal apical left ventricular inferior wall. In addition, the apical four-chamber and subcostal views revealed a second bulky PAN of the apical wall separated from the first by a common organizing thrombus. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the coexistence of more than one PAN. The patient received conservative medical treatment, and surgery was scheduled for outside the country.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to apply rapid online surveying to determine knowledge and perceptions of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among the general public in the United States and the United Kingdom. METHODS: An online questionnaire was administered to 3000 adults residing in the United States and 3000 adults residing in the United Kingdom who had registered with Prolific Academic to participate in online research. Prolific Academic established strata by age (18-27, 28-37, 38-47, 48-57, or 58 years), sex (male or female), and ethnicity (white, black or African American, Asian or Asian Indian, mixed, or other), as well as all permutations of these strata. The number of participants who could enroll in each of these strata was calculated to reflect the distribution in the US and UK general population. Enrollment into the survey within each stratum was on a first-come, first-served basis. Participants completed the questionnaire between February 23 and March 2, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 2986 and 2988 adults residing in the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively, completed the questionnaire. Of those, 64.4% (1924/2986) of US participants and 51.5% (1540/2988) of UK participants had a tertiary education degree, 67.5% (2015/2986) of US participants had a total household income between US $20,000 and US $99,999, and 74.4% (2223/2988) of UK participants had a total household income between 15,000 and 74,999. US and UK participants median estimate for the probability of a fatal disease course among those infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was 5.0% (IQR 2.0%-15.0%) and 3.0% (IQR 2.0%-10.0%), respectively. Participants generally had good knowledge of the main mode of disease transmission and common symptoms of COVID-19. However, a substantial proportion of participants had misconceptions about how to prevent an infection and the recommended care-seeking behavior. For instance, 37.8% (95% CI 36.1%-39.6%) of US participants and 29.7% (95% CI 28.1%-31.4%) of UK participants thought that wearing a common surgical mask was highly effective in protecting them from acquiring COVID-19, and 25.6% (95% CI 24.1%-27.2%) of US participants and 29.6% (95% CI 28.0%-31.3%) of UK participants thought it was prudent to refrain from eating at Chinese restaurants. Around half (53.8%, 95% CI 52.1%-55.6%) of US participants and 39.1% (95% CI 37.4%-40.9%) of UK participants thought that children were at an especially high risk of death when infected with SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of participants by total household income and education followed approximately that of the US and UK general population.

The background theory in this study is based on two: There is no evidence that during epidemics CFR is fixed throughout time or place and there is evidence that viral load (dense of infection) leads to more fatalities. Study Design: This study was done to look for any relationship between mortality rate (MR) presented as deaths/ million (M) population with both of the total cases / (M) population (density of infection) and of CFR. We chose 31 countries with testing coverage > 400,0000 tests /M and with> 1 million population. Methods: We used ANOVA regression analyses for testing the associations. Results: CRF is not a fixed ratio as it changed with a change in (MR). The COVID-19 deaths / million data were fit to calculate the total cases through the equation: total deaths /M =0.006593 X (total cases to the power 1.016959) with a too highly significant correlation between total deaths / 1M and total cases (P-value 0.0000).

The study demonstrates an alternative approach to decide optimum nutrition for these conservation-priority and nutritionally data-poor fishes. The study revealed barbel as a central representative species in terms of wild body composition among other native rheophilic cyprinids considered (asp, nase, vimba bream). Taking barbel as a model, the study shows that barbel or rheophilic cyprinids may have carnivorous-like metabolism and higher requirements of S-containing, aromatic, branched-chain amino acids (AAs) than carps. Besides, there are important interactions of AAs and fatty acids (FAs) biosynthesis to consider. Only proper feeding of nutritionally well-selected diets may contribute to river stocking mandates such as steepest growth trajectory (less time in captivity), ideal size-at-release, body fitness (blend-in with wild conspecifics, predator refuge), better gastrointestinal condition, maximized body reserves of functional nutrients, and retention efficiencies (uncompromised physiology). Considering important physiological functions and how AA-FA interactions shape them, hatchery-raised fishes on casually chosen diets may have high chances of physiological, morphological, and behavioral deficits (low post-stocking survivability).

Multivariate analysis reinforced these, while also identifying perceived personal risk as significant (p = 0.033). Conclusions: Several modifiable factors that reflect confidence in science, scientific knowledge, personal risk perception, experience and medical authority are correlated with vaccine attitudes, indicating that a holistic educational approach to improve trust in science is likely to be effective in long-term reduction in vaccine hesitancy.","output":"Knowledge, Attitudes and Perceptions of COVID-19 Vaccination among Healthcare Workers of an Inner-City Hospital in New York"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At present, nanotechnology is a priority in research in several nations due to its massive capability and financial impact. However, due to the uncertainties and abnormalities in shape, size, and chemical compositions, the existence of certain nanomaterials may lead to dangerous effects on the human health and environment. The present review includes the different advanced applications of nanomaterials in textiles industries, as well as their associated environmental and health risks. The four main textile industry fields using nanomaterials, nanofinishing, nanocoatings, nanofibers, and nanocomposites, are analyzed. Different functional textiles with nanomaterials are also briefly reviewed. Most textile materials are in direct and prolonged contact with our skin. Hence, the influence of carcinogenic and toxic substances that are available in textiles must be comprehensively examined. Proper recognition of the conceivable benefits and accidental hazards of nanomaterials to our surroundings is significant for pursuing its development in the forthcoming years. The conclusions of the current paper are anticipated to increase awareness on the possible influence of nanomaterial-containing textile wastes and the significance of better regulations in regards to the ultimate disposal of these wastes.","output":"Sustainable Use of Nanomaterials in Textiles and Their Environmental Impact"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The serological response profile of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) infection was defined by neutralization tests and subclass-specific immunofluorescent (IF) tests using serial sera from 20 patients.

There was no difference in time to seroconversion between the patients who survived (n = 14) and those who died (n = 6). Although SARS CoV IgM was still detectable by IF tests with 8 of 11 patients at 7 months postinfection, the geometric mean titers dropped from 282 at 1 month postinfection to 19 at 7 months (P = 0.001). In contrast, neutralizing antibody and SARS CoV IgGAM and IgG antibody titers remained stable over this period. The SARS CoV antibody response was sometimes associated with an increase in preexisting IF IgG antibody titers for human coronaviruses OC43, 229E, and NL63. There was no change in IF IgG titer for virus capsid antigen from the herpesvirus that was used as an unrelated control, Epstein-Barr virus. In contrast, patients who had OC43 infections, and probably also 229E infections, without prior exposure to SARS CoV had increases of antibodies specific for the infecting virus but not for SARS CoV.

Little empirical evidence exists regarding the determination of donor eligibility and experiences with donor selection. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This prospective study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in New York to select plasma donors for a randomized, double-blind, controlled convalescent plasma trial. Clearance for donation required successful completion of an online questionnaire and an in-person screening visit, which included (a) completion of a Donor Health Questionnaire (DHQ), (b) Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody testing using an immunochromatographic anti- severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) test, (c) Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing if <28 days from symptom resolution, and (d) routine blood bank testing. RESULTS: After receiving 3093 online questionnaires, 521 individuals presented for in-person screening visits, with 40.1% (n = 209) fully qualifying. Subjects (n = 312) failed to progress due to the following reasons: disqualifying answer from DHQ (n = 30, 9.6%), insufficient antibodies (n = 198, 63.5%), persistent positive PCR tests (n = 14, 4.5%), and blood donation testing labs (n = 70, 22.4%). Importantly, 24.6% and 11.1% of potential donors who reported having PCR-diagnosed infection had low or undetectable SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels, respectively. Surprisingly, 62.9% (56/89) of subjects had positive PCR tests 14-27 days after symptom resolution, with 13 individuals continuing to be PCR positive after 27 days. CONCLUSION: It is feasible for a single site to fully qualify a large number of convalescent plasma donors in a short period of time.

METHODS: DTH studies were performed by intradermal injection of a commercial recombinant spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 along with conventional serology studies. RESULTS: Fifty-one COVID-19 patients were studied showing 84,3% of concordance with spike-DTH and anti-RBD-IgG. Spike-DTH was superior to identify seven more COVID-19 individuals. A high specificity was found with no positive spike DTH reactions in the non-sick individuals. The skin test also showed more stable results over time while specific anti-RBD-IgG decreased gradually. Clinical severity groups also showed a progressive gradient of larger positive spike-DTH.

Furthermore, ICU ventilators offer numerous patient-triggered modes that work differently across brands. We systematically investigated, using a bench model, the effect of patient-triggered modes on the size and variability of VT at different breathing frequencies (f), patient effort, and ARDS severity. METHODS We used a V500 Infinity ICU ventilator connected to an ASL 5000 lung model whose compliance was mimicking mild, moderate, and severe ARDS. Thirteen patient-triggered modes were tested, falling into 3 categories, namely volume control ventilation with mandatory minute ventilation; pressure control ventilation, including airway pressure release ventilation (APRV); and pressure support ventilation. Two levels of f and effort were tested for each ARDS severity in each mode. Median (first-third quartiles) VT was compared across modes using non-parametric tests. The probability of VT > 6 mL/kg ideal body weight was assessed by binomial regression and expressed as the odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI. VT variability was measured from the coefficient of variation. RESULTS VT distribution over all f, effort, and ARDS categories significantly differed across modes (P < .001, Kruskal-Wallis test). VT was significantly greater with pressure support (OR 420 mL, 95% CI 332-527 mL) than with any other mode except for variable pressure support level. Risk for VT to be > 6 mL/kg was significantly increased with spontaneous breaths patient-triggered by pressure support (OR 19.36, 95% CI 12.37-30.65) and significantly reduced in APRV (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26-0.72) and pressure support with guaranteed volume mode. The risk increased with increasing effort and decreasing f. Coefficient of variation of VT was greater for low f and volume control-mandatory minute ventilation and pressure control modes. APRV had the greatest within-mode variability. CONCLUSIONS Risk of VT > 6 mL/kg was significantly reduced in APRV and pressure support with guaranteed volume mode. APRV had the highest variability.

Considering the interplay between these factors, we investigated the effects of digital home exercise (DHE) during government-enforced lockdowns. METHODS: A multicentre randomised controlled trial was performed allocating healthy individuals from nine countries (N=763; 523 female) to a DHE or an inactive control group. During the 4-week main intervention, DHE members engaged in live-streamed multicomponent home exercise. Subsequently, both groups had access to prerecorded workouts for an additional 4 weeks. Outcomes, assessed weekly, included PA level (Nordic Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7), mental well-being (WHO-5 Questionnaire), sleep quality (Medical Outcome Study Sleep Scale), pain/disability (Chronic Pain Grade Scale) and exercise motivation (Self-Concordance Scale). Mixed models were used for analysis. RESULTS: Live-streamed DHE consistently increased moderate PA (eg, week 1: 1.65 times more minutes per week, 95% CI 1.40 to 1.94) and vigorous PA (eg, week 1: 1.31 times more minutes per week, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.61), although the effects decreased over time. In addition, exercise motivation, sleep quality and anxiety were slightly higher for DHE in the 4-week live streaming period. The same applied to mental well-being (mean difference at week 4: +0.99, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.86), but an inverted trend was observed after live streaming was substituted by prerecorded exercise. CONCLUSIONS: Live-streamed DHE represents an efficacious method to enhance PA and selected markers of health during pandemic-related public life restrictions.

Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews of attending physicians who work regularly at the study institution, an urban ED, Level 1 Trauma Center with an annual census of 85, 000 and an EM residency program. Physicians were first asked about overall burnout followed by questions relating the physical environment to burnout. Subjects participated in a virtual reality (VR) simulation of the study ED. In the VR simulation, subjects placed virtual sticky notes to describe elements of the environment that contributed to or relieved burnout. Physicians also completed occupant comfort surveys to measure their overall satisfaction with the built environment for three different ED spaces. The surveys contained prompts for 6 categories: acoustics, air quality, cleanliness and maintenance, lighting, layout and furnishings, temperature (photo). A modified grounded theory approach was used to analyze interview transcripts, VR collected virtual memos and surveys. Results: 19 emergency physicians were enrolled (68% male, 42% early-, 42% mid-, 16% late-career) Average Maslach Burnout Inventory scores were 2.8 for emotional exhaustion, 2.4 for depersonalization and 4.8 for personal accomplishment. Sources of overall ED burnout were most commonly attributed to to ED volume, crowding, lack of resources, lack of institutional support, provider metrics, difficult patients, medico-legal concerns, worsening job market and effects of COVID-19. For the main study question, 71 themes were coded over 6 built environment domains and 25 themes related to impact and burnout. Of the 6 environmental domains, layout, cleanliness and acoustics were more commonly associated with burnout compared to air quality, lighting and temperature. An internal waiting room was the strongest contributor to physician burnout due to the close proximity to unassigned (waiting) patients associated with interruptions, distractions and concern for provider safety which contributed to emotional exhaustion and depersonalization. Increased distance to patient rooms was connected with a sense of depersonalization. Clutter, non-useful displays, poor organization and equipment issues were frequently noted and connected to a sense of disorganization and decreased personal accomplishment. Additionally, poor visualization of patients and monitors from physician workstations contributed to decreased situational awareness, anxiety, lack of provider safety and decreased personal accomplishment. Other frequently cited components included lack of visual/acoustical privacy in hallways, patient proximity to physician workstations associated with patient discomfort, medico-legal concerns, emotional exhaustion and depersonalization. 100% of the physicians agreed or strongly agreed that the VR simulation was helpful to elicit memories and reflection about the built environment. Conclusion: The study reflects associations between the ED built environment and components of physician burnout. Interventions aimed at balancing distance to patients (unassigned and assigned), reducing clutter and disorganization, balancing the acoustical environment and improving patient comfort and privacy may improve provider wellness.

It is closely related to bovine parainfluenza virus 3, human parainfluenza virus 1, and Sendai virus. Recent reports suggest PPIV-1 is widespread in swine herds in the United States and abroad. However, seroprevalence studies and the ability to evaluate cross neutralization between heterologous strains is not possible without validated antibody assays. This study describes the development of an indirect fluorescence antibody (IFA) assay, a whole virus enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (wv-ELISA) and a serum virus neutralization (SVN) assay for the detection of PPIV-1 antibodies using 521 serum samples collected from three longitudinal studies and two different challenge strains in swine. RESULTS: The area under the curve (AUC) of the wv-ELISA (95% CI, 0.93C0.98) was significantly higher (p = 0.03) compared to the IFA (95% CI, 0.90C0.96). However, no significant difference was observed between the IFA and wv-ELISA when compared to the SVN (95% CI, 0.92C0.97). All three assays demonstrated relatively uniform results at a 99% true negative rate, with only 11 disagreements observed between the IFA, wv-ELISA and SVN. CONCLUSIONS: All three serology assays detected PPIV-1 antibody in swine serum of known status that was collected from experimental studies. The SVN detected seroconversion earlier compared to the IFA and the wv-ELISA. Both the wv-ELISA and the SVN had similar diagnostic performance, while the IFA was not as sensitive as the wv-ELISA. All three assays are considered valid for routine diagnostic use. These assays will be important for future studies to screen seronegative swine for research, determine PPIV-1 seroprevalence, and to evaluate vaccine efficacy against PPIV-1 under experimental and field conditions.","output":"Detection of porcine parainfluenza virus type-1 antibody in swine serum using whole-virus ELISA, indirect fluorescence antibody and virus neutralizing assays"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The cytokine growth factor, G-CSF (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor), is commonly used in oncologic practice and is generally believed to be a safe agent to administer.

We aimed to determine the cumulative percentage of complete radiological resolution at each time point, to explore the relevant affecting factors, and to describe the chest CT findings at different time points after hospital discharge. Methods: : Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by RT-PCR who were discharged consecutively from the hospital between 5 February 2020 and 10 March 2020 and who underwent serial chest CT scans on schedule were enrolled. The radiological characteristics of all patients were collected and analysed. The total CT score was the sum of non-GGO involvement determined at discharge. Afterwards, all patients underwent chest CT scans during the 1 st , 2 nd , and 3 rd weeks after discharge. Imaging features and distributions were analysed across different time points. Results: : A total of 149 patients who completed all CT scans were evaluated;there were 67 (45.0%) men and 82 (55.0%) women, with a median age of 43 years old (IQR 36-56). The cumulative percentage of complete radiological resolution was 8.1% (12 patients), 41.6% (62), 50.3% (75), and 53% (79) at discharge and during the 1 st , 2 nd , and 3 rd weeks after discharge, respectively. Patients 44 years old showed a significantly higher cumulative percentage of complete radiological resolution than patients >44 years old at the 3-week follow-up.

The intended effect of these NPIs has been to reduce mobility. A strong reduction in mobility is believed to have a positive effect on the reduction of COVID-19 transmission by limiting the opportunity for the virus to spread in the population. Due to the huge costs of implementing these NPIs, it is essential to have a good understanding of their efficacy. Using global mobility data, released by Apple and Google, and ACAPS NPI data, we investigate the proportional contribution of NPIs on i) size of the change (magnitude) of transition between pre- and post-lockdown mobility levels and ii) rate (gradient) of this transition. Using generalized linear models to find the best fit model we found similar results using Apple or Google data. NPIs found to impact the magnitude of the change in mobility were: Lockdown measures (Apple, Google Retail and Recreation (RAR) and Google Transit and Stations (TS)), declaring a state of emergency (Apple, Google RAR and Google TS), closure of businesses and public services (Google RAR) and school closures (Apple). Using cluster analysis and chi square tests we found that closure of businesses and public services, school closures and limiting public gatherings as well as border closures and international flight suspensions were closely related. The implementation of lockdown measures and limiting public gatherings had the greatest effect on the rate of mobility change.

This study evaluated the effect of matching/mismatching vaccine strains, type/subtype pattern changes in Taiwan's influenza viruses, and the impact of post-SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) public health efforts on excess influenza-associated mortalities among the elderly. A negative binomial model was developed to estimate Taiwan's monthly influenza-associated mortality among the elderly. We calculated three winter and annual excess influenza-associated mortalities [pneumonia and influenza (P&I), respiratory and circulatory, and all-cause] from the 1999C2000 through the 2006C2007 influenza seasons. Obtaining influenza virus sequences from the months/years in which death from P&I was excessive, we investigated molecular variation in vaccine-mismatched influenza viruses by comparing hemagglutinin 1 (HA1) of the circulating and vaccine strains. We found that the higher the isolation rate of A (H3N2) and vaccine-mismatched influenza viruses, the greater the monthly P&I mortality. However, this significant positive association became negative for higher matching of A (H3N2) and public health efforts with post-SARS effect. Mean excess P&I mortality for winters was significantly higher before 2003 than after that year [mean  S.D.: 1.441.35 vs. 0.351.13, p = 0.04]. Further analysis revealed that vaccine-matched circulating influenza A viruses were significantly associated with lower excess P&I mortality during post-SARS winters (i.e., 2005C2007) than during pre-SARS winters [0.030.06 vs. 1.571.27, p = 0.01]. Stratification of these vaccine-matching and post-SARS effect showed substantial trends toward lower elderly excess P&I mortalities in winters with either mismatching vaccines during the post-SARS period or matching vaccines during the pre-SARS period. Importantly, all three excess mortalities were at their highest in May, 2003, when inter-hospital nosocomial infections were peaking. Furthermore, vaccine-mismatched H3N2 viruses circulating in the years with high excess P&I mortality exhibited both a lower amino acid identity percentage of HA1 between vaccine and circulating strains and a higher numbers of variations at epitope B.

Previously, we studied a series of C-terminal truncation constructs expressing DENV type 4 prM/E or E proteins and found the ectodomain of E protein alone could be recognized by all 12 mAbs tested, suggesting E protein ectodomain as a potential subunit immunogen without inducing anti-prM response. The characteristics of DENV E protein ectodomain in the absence of prM protein remains largely unknown. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we investigated the expression, membrane association, glycosylation pattern, secretion and particle formation of E protein ectodomain of DENV4 in the presence or absence of prM protein. E protein ectodomain associated with membrane in or beyond trans-Golgi and contained primarily complex glycans, whereas full-length E protein associated with ER membrane and contained high mannose glycans. In the absence of prM protein, E protein ectodomain can secrete as well as form particles of approximately 49 nm in diameter, as revealed by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation with or without detergent and electron microscopy. Mutational analysis revealed that the secretion of E protein ectodomain was affected by N-linked glycosylation and could be restored by treatment with ammonia chloride. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Considering the enhancement of DENV infectivity by anti-prM antibodies, our findings provide new insights into the expression and secretion of E protein ectodomain in the absence of prM protein and contribute to future subunit vaccine design.","output":"Characterization of the Ectodomain of the Envelope Protein of Dengue Virus Type 4: Expression, Membrane Association, Secretion and Particle Formation in the Absence of Precursor Membrane Protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Health care workers (HCW) are at the frontline response to the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), exposing themselves to a higher risk of ac","output":"COVID-19 in Healthcare Workers: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Prevalence, Risk Factors, Clinical Characteristics, and Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Risk scores are needed to predict the risk of death in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients in the context of rapid disease progression.

A One Health approach emphasizing inter-disciplinary co-operation is increasingly seen as necessary for effective EID control and prevention. There are, however, socio-political, ethical and legal challenges, which must be met by such a One Health approach. DISCUSSION: Based on the philosophical review and critical analysis of scholarship around the theory and practice of One Health it is clear that EID events are not simply about pathogens jumping species barriers; they are comprised of complex and contingent sets of relations that involve socioeconomic and socio-political drivers and consequences with the latter extending beyond the impact of the disease. Therefore, the effectiveness of policies based on One Health depends on their implementation and alignment with or modification of public values. SUMMARY: Despite its strong motivating rationale, implementing a One Health approach in an integrated and considered manner can be challenging, especially in the face of a perceived crisis. The effective control and prevention of EIDs therefore requires: (i) social science research to improve understanding of how EID threats and responses play out; (ii) the development of an analytic framework that catalogues case experiences with EIDs, reflects their dynamic nature and promotes inter-sectoral collaboration and knowledge synthesis; (iii) genuine public engagement processes that promote transparency, education and capture peoples preferences; (iv) a set of practical principles and values that integrate ethics into decision-making procedures, against which policies and public health responses can be assessed; (v) integration of the analytic framework and the statement of principles and values outlined above; and (vi) a focus on genuine reform rather than rhetoric.","output":"Implementing a One Health approach to emerging infectious disease: reflections on the socio-political, ethical and legal dimensions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters human cells upon binding of its spike (S) glycoproteins to ACE2 receptors. Several nanobodies neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection by binding to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S protein, but the underlying mechanism is not well understood. Here, we identified an extended network of pairwise interactions between RBD and nanobodies H11-H4, H11-D4, and Ty1 by performing all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Simulations of the nanobody-RBD-ACE2 complex revealed that H11-H4 more strongly binds to RBD without overlapping with ACE2 and triggers dissociation of ACE2 due to electrostatic repulsion. In comparison, Ty1 binding results in dissociation of ACE2 from RBD due to an overlap with the ACE2 binding site, whereas H11-D4 binding does not trigger ACE2 dissociation. Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V1 and 501.V2 variants resulted in a negligible effect on RBD-ACE2 binding. However, the 501.V2 variant weakened H11-H4 and H11-D4 binding while strengthening Ty1 binding to RBD.

In 2016, alcohol use caused 2.2% of female deaths and 6.8% of male deaths, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were 2.3% in female and 8.9% in male. Individuals with alcohol use disorder are at high risk of anxiety, depression, impaired cognition performance, and illicit drug use and are comorbid with liver disease, such as alcoholic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis, which is a major cause of personal death and disability worldwide. Psychological interventions, such as cognitive behavior therapy and motivational interviewing, as well as medical treatments, such as disulfiram, naltrexone, acamprosate, and nalmefene, are used for the treatment of alcohol addiction in Europe and the United States. However, the effect of current interventions is limited, and the need for additional interventions is substantial. Alcohol use impairs the intestinal barrier and causes changes to the intestinal permeability as well as the gut microbiota composition. Emerging studies have tried to reveal the role of the gut-brain axis among individuals with alcohol use disorder with or without alcohol liver disease. Bacterial products penetrate the impaired intestinal barrier and cause central inflammation; changes to the gut microbiota impair enterohepatic circulation of bile acids; alcohol abuse causes shortage of vital nutrients such as thiamine. Several studies have suggested that probiotics, through either oral administration or fecal microbiota transplantation, increased intestinal levels of potentially beneficial bacteria such as bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, improving the levels of liver-associated enzymes in patients with mild alcoholic hepatitis, and demonstrating beneficial psychotropic effects on anxiety and depression. In addition to medications for alcohol addiction, gene editing therapy such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) may be another potential research target. Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), which are associated with ADH and ALDH genes, are major enzymes involved in alcohol metabolism, and gene editing approaches may have the potential to directly modify specific genes to treat alcoholism caused by genetic defects.

However, because 35% of SARS-CoV-2 infections are asymptomatic, patients admitted for unrelated indications with an incidentally positive test could be misclassified as a COVID-19 hospitalization. Electronic health record (EHR)Cbased studies have been unable to distinguish between a hospitalization specifically for COVID-19 versus an incidental SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization. Although the need to improve classification of COVID-19 versus incidental SARS-CoV-2 is well understood, the magnitude of the problems has only been characterized in small, single-center studies. Furthermore, there have been no peer-reviewed studies evaluating methods for improving classification. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are to, first, quantify the frequency of incidental hospitalizations over the first 15 months of the pandemic in multiple hospital systems in the United States and, second, to apply electronic phenotyping techniques to automatically improve COVID-19 hospitalization classification. METHODS: From a retrospective EHR-based cohort in 4 US health care systems in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Illinois, a random sample of 1123 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive patients hospitalized from March 2020 to August 2021 was manually chart-reviewed and classified as admitted with COVID-19 (incidental) versus specifically admitted for COVID-19 (for COVID-19). EHR-based phenotyping was used to find feature sets to filter out incidental admissions. RESULTS: EHR-based phenotyped feature sets filtered out incidental admissions, which occurred in an average of 26% of hospitalizations (although this varied widely over time, from 0% to 75%). The top site-specific feature sets had 79%-99% specificity with 62%-75% sensitivity, while the best-performing across-site feature sets had 71%-94% specificity with 69%-81% sensitivity.

There have been very few research studies evaluating clinical care during this time but clinicians have managed to provide supports virtually, which has been evaluated positively by some individuals. This narrative review concludes by identifying gaps in the literature and suggests key directions for future mental health research, policy, and practice efforts. Any mental health efforts now and during pandemic recovery need to have an understanding of how the mental health needs and services for adults with ID have evolved over the course of the pandemic. Further research is needed on the impact of both clinical interventions and other nonclinical efforts on the mental health of people with ID.","output":"The mental health and well\\\\being of adults with intellectual disability during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic: A narrative review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To describe steps taken that enabled a high rate of retention and early resumption of enrollment in the Zoster Eye Disease Study (ZEDS), a randomized controlled trial funded by the National Eye Institute, during the first 13 months (3/1/2020C3/31/2021) of the COVIDC19 pandemic. METHODS: A number of responses were implemented in ZEDS when the focus shifted to retention of study participants at the beginning of the pandemic including frequent communication with the participating clinical centers (PCCs) about remote visits, local lab work, shipping study medication, and completion of revised case report forms. Additional payments were provided to the PCCs. Remote activation of PCCs continued. Screening and enrollment visits gradually resumed when allowed. RESULTS: Communication with PCCs increased, and average attendance at monthly coordinator teleconferences went up from 17 to 47. Remote visits peaked in April 2020, accounting for 75% (33/44) of study visits, then declined to less than 10% of study visits beginning August 2020. Overall, 97% (590/609) of study visits were completed. Only 5.5% (9/165) of study participants withdrew consent, and 2.4% (4/165) were lost to follow-up. Enrollment returned to pre-pandemic levels by September 2020. DISCUSSION: Strong communication and unwavering commitment, combined with the technological capability for remote work, visits, and shipment of study medication, were key to the successful retention of study participants and resumption of enrollment. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid responses to challenges to trials caused by the COVID-19 pandemic can enable them to continue successfully and provide insights into the planning of future trials.","output":"Meeting the challenges of retention and enrollment of study participants in clinical trials during the COVID-19 pandemic from the study leadership perspective: Experience from the Zoster Eye Disease Study (ZEDS)()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A new subcutaneous formulation of the infliximab biosimilar CT-P13 has recently been developed for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), providing response rates similar to intravenous treatment.

A critical aspect of fighting this pandemic is to obtain accurate and timely test results so that patients who have tested positive for COVID-19 can be identified and isolated to reduce the spread of the virus. Research has shown that saliva is a promising candidate for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics because its collection is minimally invasive and can be reliably self-administered. However, little research has been conducted on saliva testing and SARS-CoV-2 self-sampling (SARS-CoV-2SS) in Sub-Saharan Africa. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study is to comparatively evaluate the clinical sensitivity and specificity of nasal and oral samples self-collected by individuals for SARS-CoV-2 testing against a reference method involving sample collection and testing by a health care professional. The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the usability of nasal self-sampling and saliva self-sampling as a sample collection method for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing by using failure mode and error assessment. METHODS: Participants will be recruited from the general population by using various methods, Participants will be screened progressively as they present at the clinical trial sites as well as in primary health care catchment areas in the inner city of Johannesburg, South Africa. In the event that recruitment numbers are low, we will use a mobile van to recruit participants from outlying areas of Johannesburg. We aim to enroll 250 participants into this study in approximately 6 weeks. Two sample types-a self-administered nasal swab and a self-administered saliva sample-will be collected from each participant, and a health care professional will collect a third sample by using a nasopharyngeal swab (ie, the standard reference method). RESULTS: This protocol has been approved by the University of the Witwatersrand Human Research Ethics Committee on July 31, 2020 (Protocol number EzCov003). As of May 13, 2021, 120 participants have been enrolled into the study. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2SS may offer many benefits to individuals, by allowing for initial self-identification of symptoms and collection of samples without involving third parties and potential risk of infection provided the sample can be safely processed via a collection system. The results of this study will provide preliminary data on the acceptability, feasibility, and usability of SARS-CoV-2SS among the general population for its future implementation.

However, the causality as well as the role of body fat distribution in this context still unclear. Thus, using a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach, we investigated the causal impact of obesity on the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19. Methods Obesity was quantified by body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). Summary statistics of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for these anthropometric measures were drawn from the GIANT consortium (Locke et al. (n=322154); Shungin et al. (n=232101)) and for the COVID-19 susceptibility (n=1079768) as well as hospitalization (n = 900687) from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. Causal estimates were calculated using Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and sensitivity analyses were done applying several robust MR techniques. Results Genetically predicted BMI was significantly associated (per one SD) with both, COVID-19 susceptibility (OR=1.41; 95% CI: 1.15 - 1.72; P-value=0.001) and hospitalization (OR=1.60; 95% CI: 1.19 - 2.14; P-value=0.006). WC was associated with the susceptibility (OR=1.38; 95% CI: 1.07 - 1.78; P-value=0.015) but not with hospitalization. WHR was not associated with any of the COVID-19 outcomes. Conclusions This study provides evidence for a causal impact of overall obesity on the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19. Therefore, obese people should be regarded as a risk group.

However, although desirable, it is difficult to design tailored (and thus effective) WHP programs, particularly in smallCmedium companies, which rarely have access to sufficient economic and organizational resources. In this study, 1305 employees filled out an online anonymous lifestyle questionnaire hosted on the website of a non-profit organization, which aims to promote a healthy lifestyle among workers. The data show gender differences regarding stress perception and, in the working population meeting current physical activity recommendations (threshold = 600 METmin/week), they point out the evidence of a better psychological and nutrition profile, a perception of better job performance, and improved sleep and health quality. Moreover, a unitary index (ranging from 0C100 (with higher scores being healthier)), combining self-reported metrics for diet, exercise and stress, was significantly higher in active employees (67.51  12.46 vs. 39.84  18.34, p < 0.001). The possibility of assessing individual lifestyle in an easy, timely and cost-effective manner, offers the opportunity to collect grouped data useful to drive tailored WHP policies and to have metric to quantify results of interventions.

There is a need to identify key pathogenic molecules in COVID-19-associated inflammation attainable to target with existing therapeutic compounds. The endogenous damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecule HMGB1 initiates inflammation via two separate pathways. Disulfide-HMGB1 triggers TLR4 receptors generating pro-inflammatory cytokine release. Extracellular HMGB1, released from dying cells or secreted by activated innate immunity cells, forms complexes with extracellular DNA, RNA and other DAMP or pathogen-associated molecular (DAMP) molecules released after lytic cell death. These complexes are endocytosed via RAGE, constitutively expressed at high levels in the lungs only, and transported to the endolysosomal system, which is disrupted by HMGB1 at high concentrations. Danger molecules thus get access to cytosolic proinflammatory receptors instigating inflammasome activation. It is conceivable that extracellular SARS-CoV-2 RNA may reach the cellular cytosol via HMGB1-assisted transfer combined with lysosome leakage. Extracellular HMGB1 generally exists in vivo bound to other molecules, including PAMPs and DAMPs. It is plausible that these complexes are specifically removed in the lungs revealed by a 40% reduction of HMGB1 plasma levels in arterial versus venous blood. Abundant pulmonary RAGE expression enables endocytosis of danger molecules to be destroyed in the lysosomes at physiological HMGB1 levels, but causing detrimental inflammasome activation at high levels. Stress induces apoptosis in pulmonary endothelial cells from females but necrosis in cells from males. CONCLUSION: Based on these observations we propose extracellular HMGB1 to be considered as a therapeutic target for COVID-19.","output":"Extracellular HMGB1: a therapeutic target in severe pulmonary inflammation including COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral ?1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) as a potential antiviral target has attracted interest because many human viral pathogens, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and coronaviruses, rely on ?1 PRF for optimal propagation. Efficient eukaryotic ?1 PRF requires an optimally placed stimulator structure downstream of the frameshifting site and different strategies targeting viral ?1 PRF stimulators have been developed. However, accessing particular ?1 PRF stimulator information represents a bottle-neck in combating the emerging epidemic viral pathogens such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Recently, an RNA hairpin upstream of frameshifting site was shown to act as a cis-element to attenuate ?1 PRF with mechanism unknown. Here, we show that an upstream duplex formed in-trans, by annealing an antisense to its complementary mRNA sequence upstream of frameshifting site, can replace an upstream hairpin to attenuate ?1 PRF efficiently. This finding indicates that the formation of a proximal upstream duplex is the main determining factor responsible for ?1 PRF attenuation and provides mechanistic insight. Additionally, the antisense-mediated upstream duplex approach downregulates ?1 PRF stimulated by distinct ?1 PRF stimulators, including those of MERS-CoV, suggesting its general application potential as a robust means to evaluating viral ?1 PRF inhibition as soon as the sequence information of an emerging human coronavirus is available.","output":"A general strategy to inhibiting viral ?1 frameshifting based on upstream attenuation duplex formation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. In response to the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the state mandated Stay At Home order included closure of schools and public places and physical distancing measures. As a result, social interactions among children were significantly impaired and pediatric outpatient offices and vaccination rates declined.

We conducted a survey through the Wayne County Public School Districts to elicit information regarding subjects access to pediatric health care as well as experiences pertinent to their child(ren)s mental health. Results. Approximately 8500 surveys were sent to families and 278 responses were received. Responses revealed that 46% of children spent more time alone during the pandemic, 36.9% had changes in sleep, 25.6% had little pleasure in doing things, and 32.5% were unhappy or sad. 66.2% were able to make new visits during the pandemic, however, 20.1% missed their childs doctors visits for reasons including clinic cancellations and fear of entering a healthcare setting. Conclusions. The results of this survey demonstrate significant mental health concerns among our pediatric population as approximately 1/3 of families reported changes in behavior or mental health. As school closures persist in response to the ongoing pandemic and social interactions remain limited, it is imperative that pediatricians screen for depression, behavioral problems and other mental health concerns and offer families help to identify appropriate community mental health resources.","output":"COVID-19 Impact on Pediatric Health: A survey of families in Wayne County, MI"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic the use of cloth masks has increased dramatically due to the shortage of medical masks. However, the efficiency of this material is controversial. We aimed to investigate the efficiency of cloth masks in reducing transmission and contamination by droplets and aerosols for the general population and healthcare workers. Electronic databases were searched without year or language restrictions. Clinical and laboratorial studies were included. The risk of bias (RoB) was assessed using an adapted quality checklist for laboratory-based studies. ROBINS-I tool and Cochrane RoB 2.0 were used to evaluate non-randomized (n-RCT) and randomized clinical trials (RCT), respectively. The quality of the evidence was assessed through GRADE tool. From the eleven studies selected, eight were laboratory-based studies, one non-randomized and one RCT supported by laboratory data.

A meta-analysis was not feasible due to a high methodological heterogeneity. The overall quality of evidence ranged from very low to moderate. Despite the lower efficiency compared to medical masks, laboratorial results may underestimate the efficiency of cloth masks in real life. Cloth mask efficiency is higher when made of hybrid fabrics (cotton/chiffon, cotton/silk) and cotton quilt, mainly with multiple layers.

Our goal was to create and field-test a low burden, low tech, and high-yield method. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In building this service line, the RIC strove to complement, rather than replace, CTSA hubs existing cohort assessment tools. For each new EHR cohort request, we work with the investigator to develop a computable phenotype algorithm that targets the desired population. CTSA hubs run the phenotype query and return results using a standardized survey. We provide a comprehensive report to the investigator to assist in study site selection. RESULTS: From 2017 to 2020, the RIC developed and socialized 36 phenotype-dependent cohort requests on behalf of investigators. The average response rate to these requests was 73%. DISCUSSION: Achieving enrollment goals in a multicenter clinical trial requires that researchers identify study sites that will provide sufficient enrollment. The fast and flexible method the RIC has developed, with CTSA feedback, allows hubs to query their EHR using a generalizable, vetted phenotype algorithm to produce reliable counts of potentially eligible study participants.

Appointments were conducted either by a rheumatologist or a qualified medical assistant for rheumatology (RFA). Additional data regarding perceived concerns arising from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as attitudes to vaccination were collected. Methods: Methods: Patients not requiring adjustment of their DMARDs at the two previous attendances were considered stable. At cancellation of the planned attendance, patients were offered participation in the study and provided verbal informed consent. Participants were randomized to a telemedicine appointment by either a physician or RFA. Telemedicine appointments consisted of a standardized patient interview, including assessment of disease activity (modified CDAI score), attitudes to vaccination as well as current vaccine status and concerns about COVID-19. Following participation, all patients received a pseudonymized postal questionnaire to evaluate appointment satisfaction (FAPI-Score). Results: In total 112/116 (96%) patients that were offered appointments, participated in the study (RA 50%, axSpA 30%, PsA 20%). Of these 88/112 (79%) returned their postal questionnaires. Overall patient satisfaction was excellent (mean 4.3/5 modified FAPI score) and did not differ between care setting or clinical status of the interviewer. RFAs conducted 19/112 (17%) of appointments, 6 (32%) of which required additional physician intervention. Change of DMARDs occurred in 19/112 (17%) appointments. Patients reporting a pain score 7 (VAS 1-10) were most dissatisfied with the telemedicine appointment (p=0.036). Concerns about COVID-19 correlated with disease activity: high disease activity (p = 0.031), presence of tender joints (p=0.001), high pain levels (p=0.009) correlated with concern of contracting COVID-19 or experiencing severe disease course. Only 38% of the patients had been vaccinated against pneumococci in the past 5 years and 54% had been vaccinated against influenza in 2019/2020. Conclusion: Telemedicine can contribute to patient care in stable patients. RFAs can also contribute to patient care especially for follow-up appointment when patients are in remission.

Three were particularly relevant to the correctional setting: 1) Risk perception: participants perceived that they were at lower risk of COVID-19 due to restricted visits and interactions; 2) Health care services in prison: participants reported feeling punished and stigmatized due to strict COVID-19 restrictions, and failed to identify personal benefits of vaccination due to the lack of incentives; 3) Universal distrust: participants expressed distrust in prison employees, including health care providers. INTERPRETATION: Reasons for vaccine refusal among people in prison are multifaceted. Educational interventions could seek to address COVID-19 risk misconceptions in prison settings. However, impact may be limited if trust is not fostered and if incentives are not considered in vaccine promotion.","output":"Reasons for COVID-19 vaccine refusal among people incarcerated in Canadian federal prisons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Lpidmie de COVID-19 a boulevers lorganisation des tablissements de sant  travers la modification des flux de patients, la limitation des ressources mdicales disponibles et la ncessit dadapter les parcours de soins.

Mthodes Les modles de simulation  vnements discrets (DES) ont pour principe la modlisation dentits qui empruntent diverses trajectoires sur lesquelles elles consomment des ressources en fonction de leurs caractristiques. Afin de modliser lactivit hospitalire, un DES a t dvelopp pour modliser la prise en charge des patients et lutilisation de ressources hospitalires (volumes horaires des blocs chirurgicaux, radiothrapie, chimiothrapie, ) en fonction du type de cancer. Les flux patients ont t simuls  partir de donnes individuelles anonymises issues du Programme de mdicalisation des systmes dinformation (PMSI) de Gustave-Roussy. Les donnes historiques du PMSI de janvier 2018  fvrier 2020 ont permis la modlisation en sries temporelles (modle ARIMA) des flux patients en labsence de perturbation pidmique.

Additionally, investors would benefit from understanding this causation in both the pre- and post-Covid-19 eras. We conceive this study to plug this gap and advance the knowledge in this critical area. We study the causality and spillover between NASDAQ clean energy indexes, and their corresponding alternatives namely, NASDAQ Composite Index and NASDAQ Global Select Market Composite using the daily data and from 1 st January 2011 to 29 th June 2021.

Our results suggest us to observe that both sustainable and green indexes exhibit bi-directional causality where both sets of indexes impact each other in the long-run. Additionally, after the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the connectivity between the two sets of indices rose significantly. Our findings also suggest that the investors will not lose on risk-adjusted returns if they chose to go green.

The current study aims to perform psychometric analyses of the Arabic version of the Family Impact Scale and investigate the association of its domains with the oral health status of children. This cross-sectional study was carried out in a sample of 500 parent-child dyads from high schools of Jazan city of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Arabic version of the Family Impact Scale was subjected to reliability and validity tests. The explanatory variables in the current study are: the oral health status, parents combined income, parents education, age and sex of the child. The descriptive analysis was reported using proportions, this was followed by the bivariate and multivariable analyses. About 24.2% of children were reported to have fair, poor, and very poor oral health. A lower frequency of family impact corresponded with better oral health (OH) status of children (p < 0.001). The likelihood of parents taking time off from work and having financial difficulties was nearly two-times greater if their children had poor oral health. Similarly, interruption in sleep and other normal activities of parents is four times and five times greater, respectively, if the child has poor oral health status. Thus, the poor oral health of school children in the Jazan region of Saudi Arabia is a matter of grave concern as it is observed to be associated with family impacts; particularly affecting the parents work, sleep, and other normal family activities.","output":"Impact of the Poor Oral Health Status of Children on Their Families: An Analytical Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to transform a resource of linked electronic health records (EHR) to the OMOP common data model (CDM) and evaluate the process in terms of syntactic and semantic consistency and quality when implementing disease and risk factor phenotyping algorithms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using heart failure (HF) as an exemplar, we represented three national EHR sources (Clinical Practice Research Datalink, Hospital Episode Statistics Admitted Patient Care, Office for National Statistics) into the OMOP CDM 5.2. We compared the original and CDM HF patient population by calculating and presenting descriptive statistics of demographics, related comorbidities, and relevant clinical biomarkers. RESULTS: We identified a cohort of 502 536 patients with the incident and prevalent HF and converted 1 099 195 384 rows of data from 216 581 914 encounters across three EHR sources to the OMOP CDM. The largest percentage (65%) of unmapped events was related to medication prescriptions in primary care. The average coverage of source vocabularies was >98% with the exception of laboratory tests recorded in primary care. The raw and transformed data were similar in terms of demographics and comorbidities with the largest difference observed being 3.78% in the prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that the OMOP CDM can successfully be applied to convert EHR linked across multiple healthcare settings and represent phenotyping algorithms spanning multiple sources. Similar to previous research, challenges mapping primary care prescriptions and laboratory measurements still persist and require further work. The use of OMOP CDM in national UK EHR is a valuable research tool that can enable large-scale reproducible observational research.","output":"Transforming and evaluating electronic health record disease phenotyping algorithms using the OMOP common data model: a case study in heart failure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract This paper asks whether the UN Sustainable Development Goal to end poverty is achievable in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. We discuss various estimates of the poverty impact of the pandemic. We then differentiate growth-poverty-inequality pathways based on empirical observations from developing countries over the last 25 years. We take the most equitable growth pathways (characterised by mean household income/consumption expenditure growth per capita with the largest falls in inequality) and least equitable growth pathways (mean household income/consumption expenditure growth per capita with the largest rises in inequality) as a basis to extrapolate potential scenarios for poverty levels in 2030. Our main finding is that the SDG to end poverty is achievable (or something close) if the impact of the pandemic on income poverty is addressed and countries are able to follow the most equitable growth pathway after the pandemic has abated. In short, the greatest poverty reduction, and greatest likelihood of attaining the SDG poverty reduction goals, will occur if economic growth is combined with inequality reduction.

PURPOSE: To assess pharmacy technician learning preferences using the VARK tool and through self-identification. METHODS: The VARK (visual, aural, read/write, kinesthetic) questionnaire was incorporated into a larger survey, which was distributed during live staff meetings and a continuing education session held by the state Pharmacists Association attended by 204 pharmacy technicians across various practice settings. RESULTS: A 90% response rate was achieved. Most respondents (78.8%) self-identified a single predominant learning preference, with 60.3% indicating a preference for kinesthetic learning methods. In contrast, after assessment with the VARK questionnaire 37.9% of survey participants were categorized as having a quadmodal learning style incorporating all VARK modalities. With regard to the Pharmacy Technician Certification Exam, a large majority of participants (96.2% of those providing a response) indicated that they had taken the exam in the past, with 17 participants (9.3% of those providing a response) indicating more than 1 attempt to pass the exam. Furthermore, experiential (on-the-job) training was identified by a large majority of survey respondents (79.3%) as the preferred way to learn new information. CONCLUSION: Learning preferences of pharmacy technicians vary amongst individuals, with many found to have multiple learning preferences through VARK questionnaire assessment. Incorporating experiential training and establishing learning preferences of pharmacy technicians may aid in development of accredited training programs that cater to the needs of pharmacy technicians.","output":"Assessment of pharmacy technician learning preferences and implications for training"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ultrasound (US) is an ideal diagnostic tool for paediatric patients owning to its high spatial and temporal resolution, realtime imaging, and lack of ionizing radiation and bedside availability.

In the previous meta-analyses, the effect of non-invasive ventilation was not evaluated according to ventilation modes in those patients. Furthermore, no meta-analyses comparing non-invasive respiratory management strategies with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) have been reported. We performed a network meta-analysis to compare the efficacy of non-invasive ventilation according to ventilation modes with high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO), standard oxygen therapy (SOT), and IMV in adult patients with AHRF. METHODS: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Ichushi databases were searched. Studies including adults with AHRF and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing two different respiratory management strategies (continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), pressure support ventilation (PSV), HFNO, SOT, or IMV) were reviewed. RESULTS: We included 25 RCTs (3,302 participants: 27 comparisons). Using SOT as the reference, CPAP (risk ratio [RR] 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.31C0.95; very low certainty) was associated significantly with a lower risk of mortality. Compared with SOT, PSV (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.62C1.06; low certainty) and HFNO (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.65C1.25; very low certainty) were not associated with a significantly lower risk of mortality. Compared with IMV, no non-invasive respiratory management was associated with a significantly lower risk of mortality, although all certainties of evidence were very low. The probability of being best in reducing short-term mortality among all possible interventions was higher for CPAP, followed by PSV and HFNO; IMV and SOT were tied for the worst (surface under the cumulative ranking curve value: 93.2, 65.0, 44.1, 23.9, and 23.9, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: When performing non-invasive ventilation among patients with de novo AHRF, it is important to avoid excessive tidal volume and lung injury. Although pressure support is needed for some of these patients, it should be applied with caution because this may lead to excessive tidal volume and lung injury.

Newer methodologies have begun to demonstrate the underlying physiological changes and elucidate the mechanism of action. We postulated that systematic, CT-based assessment of the response of individual airways to BT is feasible, and our aim was to determine the distribution of these responses and the relationship with airway size. Twenty patients meeting the ERS/ATS definition of severe asthma underwent BT and assessment including CT, Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ), and spirometry. Treatment was structured so that the left and right lungs are treated sequentially with a mid-treatment assessment providing an internal control. Pairs of CT scans were analysed using a new semi-automatic processing algorithm which matched individual segmented airways for quantitative comparison. Cross-sectional airway lumen area from matched airway pairs in treated lungs increased on average by 6.4% after BT (p<0.02) but showed no change in the untreated lung. Matched airway length was also unchanged. Breakdown by airway size showed amplified response in more distal airways, with the smallest quintile of measured airways dilating by 13.2% (p<0.001). ACQ improved from 3.50.9 to 1.91.2 (p<0.001). These data show that the response to BT in individual airways can be assessed by CT and that dilation is heterogeneous and predominant in distal compared with proximal airways.

Here, we demonstrate the development of a nanoparticle vaccine candidate, REVC-128, in which multiple trimeric spike ectodomains with glycine (G) at position 614 were multimerized onto a nanoparticle. In-vitro characterization of this vaccine confirms its structural and antigenic integrity. In-vivo immunogenicity evaluation in mice indicates that a single dose of this vaccine induces potent serum neutralizing antibody titre at two weeks post-immunization. This is significantly higher than titre caused by trimeric spike protein without nanoparticle presentation. The comparison of serum binding to spike subunits between animals immunized by a spike with and without nanoparticle presentation indicates that nanoparticle prefers the display of spike RBD (Receptor-Binding Domain) over S2 subunit, likely resulting in a more neutralizing but less cross-reactive antibody response. Moreover, a Syrian golden hamster in-vivo model for the SARS-CoV-2 virus challenge was implemented two weeks post a single dose of REVC-128 immunization. The results showed that vaccination protects hamsters against the SARS-CoV-2 virus challenge with evidence of steady body weight, suppressed viral loads and alleviation of tissue damage for protected animals, compared with 10% weight loss, high viral loads and tissue damage in unprotected animals. Furthermore, the data showed that vaccine REVC-128 is thermostable at up to 37C for at least 4 weeks.

Some specialists proposed chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for treating or preventing the disease. The efficacy and safety of these drugs have been assessed in randomized controlled trials. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of chloroquine (CQ) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for 1) treating people with COVID\\\\19 on death and time to clearance of the virus; 2) preventing infection in people at risk of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 exposure; 3) preventing infection in people exposed to SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Current Controlled Trials (www.controlled\\\\trials.com), and the COVID\\\\19\\\\specific resources www.covid\\\\nma.com and covid\\\\19.cochrane.org, for studies of any publication status and in any language. We performed all searches up to 15 September 2020. We contacted researchers to identify unpublished and ongoing studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in people with COVID\\\\19, people at risk of COVID\\\\19 exposure, and people exposed to COVID\\\\19. Adverse events (any, serious, and QT\\\\interval prolongation on electrocardiogram) were also extracted. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed eligibility of search results, extracted data from the included studies, and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of bias tool. We contacted study authors for clarification and additional data for some studies. We used risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We performed meta\\\\analysis using a random\\\\effects model for outcomes where pooling of effect estimates was appropriate. MAIN RESULTS: 1. Treatment of COVID\\\\19 disease We included 12 trials involving 8569 participants, all of whom were adults. Studies were from China (4); Brazil, Egypt, Iran, Spain, Taiwan, the UK, and North America (each 1 study); and a global study in 30 countries (1 study). Nine were in hospitalized patients, and three from ambulatory care. Disease severity, prevalence of comorbidities, and use of co\\\\interventions varied substantially between trials. We found potential risks of bias across all domains for several trials. Nine trials compared HCQ with standard care (7779 participants), and one compared HCQ with placebo (491 participants); dosing schedules varied. HCQ makes little or no difference to death due to any cause (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.19; 8208 participants; 9 trials; high\\\\certainty evidence). A sensitivity analysis using modified intention\\\\to\\\\treat results from three trials did not influence the pooled effect estimate. HCQ may make little or no difference to the proportion of people having negative PCR for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 on respiratory samples at day 14 from enrolment (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.10; 213 participants; 3 trials; low\\\\certainty evidence). HCQ probably results in little to no difference in progression to mechanical ventilation (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.37; 4521 participants; 3 trials; moderate\\\\certainty evidence). HCQ probably results in an almost three\\\\fold increased risk of adverse events (RR 2.90, 95% CI 1.49 to 5.64; 1394 participants; 6 trials; moderate\\\\certainty evidence), but may make little or no difference to the risk of serious adverse events (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.79; 1004 participants; 6 trials; low\\\\certainty evidence). We are very uncertain about the effect of HCQ on time to clinical improvement or risk of prolongation of QT\\\\interval on electrocardiogram (very low\\\\certainty evidence). One trial (22 participants) randomized patients to CQ versus lopinavir/ritonavir, a drug with unknown efficacy against SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2, and did not report any difference for clinical recovery or adverse events. One trial compared HCQ combined with azithromycin against standard care (444 participants). This trial did not detect a difference in death, requirement for mechanical ventilation, length of hospital admission, or serious adverse events. A higher risk of adverse events was reported in the HCQ\\\\and\\\\azithromycin arm; this included QT\\\\interval prolongation, when measured. One trial compared HCQ with febuxostat, another drug with unknown efficacy against SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 (60 participants). There was no difference detected in risk of hospitalization or change in computed tomography (CT) scan appearance of the lungs; no deaths were reported. 2. Preventing COVID\\\\19 disease in people at risk of exposure to SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 Ongoing trials are yet to report results for this objective. 3. Preventing COVID\\\\19 disease in people who have been exposed to SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 One trial (821 participants) compared HCQ with placebo as a prophylactic agent in the USA (around 90% of participants) and Canada. Asymptomatic adults (66% healthcare workers; mean age 40 years; 73% without comorbidity) with a history of exposure to people with confirmed COVID\\\\19 were recruited. We are very uncertain about the effect of HCQ on the primary outcomes, for which few events were reported: 20/821 (2.4%) developed confirmed COVID\\\\19 at 14 days from enrolment, and 2/821 (0.2%) were hospitalized due to COVID\\\\19 (very low\\\\certainty evidence). HCQ probably increases the risk of adverse events compared with placebo (RR 2.39, 95% CI 1.83 to 3.11; 700 participants; 1 trial; moderate\\\\certainty evidence). HCQ may result in little or no difference in serious adverse events (no RR: no participants experienced serious adverse events; low\\\\certainty evidence). One cluster\\\\randomized trial (2525 participants) compared HCQ with standard care for the prevention of COVID\\\\19 in people with a history of exposure to SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 in Spain. Most participants were working or residing in nursing homes; mean age was 49 years. There was no difference in the risk of symptomatic confirmed COVID\\\\19 or production of antibodies to SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 between the two study arms. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: HCQ for people infected with COVID\\\\19 has little or no effect on the risk of death and probably no effect on progression to mechanical ventilation. Adverse events are tripled compared to placebo, but very few serious adverse events were found. No further trials of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for treatment should be carried out.

Some of these activities, namely antiherpes, antioxidant, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory, were known a century ago. Only recently have further studies revealed other crucial activities of the same plant molecules as powerful agents against human immunodeficiency virus, human papillomavirus, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and symptoms of aging. Molecular mechanisms underlying the antiviral and anticancer activities have been elucidated and involve the inhibition of SP1 dependent gene transcription.

Some of these host proteins are enclosed within the virion structure, while others, in the case of enveloped viruses, are embedded in the host-derived membrane. While many of these host protein incorporations are likely accidental, some may play a role in virus infectivity, replication and/or immunoreactivity in the next host. Host protein incorporations may be especially important in therapeutic applications where large numbers of virus particles are administered. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is the prototypic rhabdovirus and a candidate vaccine, gene therapy and oncolytic vector. Using mass spectrometry, we previously examined cell type dependent host protein content of VSV virions using intact (whole) virions purified from three cell lines originating from different species. Here we aimed to determine the localization of host proteins within the VSV virions by analyzing: i) whole VSV virions; and ii) whole VSV virions treated with Proteinase K to remove all proteins outside the viral envelope. A total of 257 proteins were identified, with 181 identified in whole virions and 183 identified in Proteinase K treated virions. Most of these proteins have not been previously shown to be associated with VSV. Functional enrichment analysis indicated the most overrepresented categories were proteins associated with vesicles, vesicle-mediated transport and protein localization. Using western blotting, the presence of several host proteins, including some not previously shown in association with VSV (such as Yes1, Prl1 and Ddx3y), was confirmed and their relative quantities in various virion fractions determined.

Malaria is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Ghana. This study aims to describe the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on malaria cases observed in health facilities in the Northern Region of Ghana. METHODS: Monthly routine data from the District Health Information Management System II (DHIMS2) of the Northern Region of Ghana were analysed. Overall outpatient department visits (OPD) and malaria case rates from the years 2015C2019 were compared to the corresponding data of the year 2020. RESULTS: Compared to the corresponding periods of the years 2015C2019, overall visits and malaria cases in paediatric and adult OPDs in northern Ghana decreased in March and April 2020, when major movement and social restrictions were implemented in response to the pandemic. Cases slightly rebounded afterwards in 2020, but stayed below the average of the previous years. Malaria data from inpatient departments showed a similar but more pronounced trend when compared to OPDs. In pregnant women, however, malaria cases in OPDs increased after the first COVID-19 wave. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study show that the COVID-19 pandemic affects the malaria burden in health facilities of northern Ghana, with declines in inpatient and outpatient rates except for pregnant women. They may have experienced reduced access to insecticide-treated nets and intermittent preventive malaria treatment in pregnancy, resulting in subsequent higher malaria morbidity. Further data, particularly from community-based studies and ideally complemented by qualitative research, are needed to fully determine the impact of the pandemic on the malaria situation in Africa.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on malaria cases in health facilities in northern Ghana: a retrospective analysis of routine surveillance data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Kegiatan Pengabdian Kepada Masyarakat yang dilaksanakan oleh Tim Pengabdian Program Studi S1 Administrasi Publik Fisipol Universitas Mulawarman mengacu kepada pemberdayaan masyarakat dalam pencegahan COVID-19 di Kota Balikpapan.

In particular, research suggests that women have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic psychologically, socially, and economically. Methods: The COVID-19 Defence Team (DT) survey was designed to assess the impacts of the pandemic on DT members. The current study focused on the mental health of Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) Regular Force members and the impacts of gender and family status on key mental health outcomes. Results: Women were more likely to experience mental health concerns, including anxiety, depression, and worse perceived mental health and stress since the start of the pandemic, compared with men. Most respondents with depression or anxiety experienced some degree of functional impairment. Although overall levels of functional impairment did not differ by gender, men with dependent children at home were more likely to experience functional impairment than those without children, whereas women with dependent children at home were less likely to report such impairment than those without children. Discussion: Th e findings provide a snapshot of the mental health of CAF Regular Force members early in the COVID-19 pandemic.

It has been established that this virus originates from bats and uses an intermediate host for transfer to humans. The knowledge about the intermediate host is important to find the virus shuttle mechanism to stop future outbreaks. For this, the genetic and structural analysis of coronaviruses spike proteins was performed using a computer-assisted approach.To conduct the In silico analysis, 43 sequences of spike protein belong to different species were retrieved from the NCBI nucleotide database. Pairwise and multiple sequence alignments were performed to check the similarities and differences of the retrieved sequences. Moreover, to highlight relationships among different species, phylogenetics analysis was performed using the MEGA software tool. In the end, protein structure alignment (superimposition) was performed against the reference structure by UCSF Chimera software. The results highlighted that the maximum similarity of human protein was found against Bat and Pangolinsequences. Moreover, among Bat and Pangolin, the highest similarity was found against pangolin based on phylogenetics analysis.

Fourteen masks were selected based on differences in design, such as type of material, shape (cheek wings vs. none), filter type, and the number of layers. Leakage expressed in mean mist percentages (visualized with a camera), patterns of coloured mist left inside the masks, as well as visual fit of the masks on the manikin head, showed that a loose fit mask results in more leakage. Also, combining quantitative with qualitative assessment proved to be complementary. Future tests should be conducted on a range of users, covering the best fit over time as well breathability, use, and comfort.

Predictive scores for admission to intensive care unit (ICU) or death based on clinical and easily affordable laboratory data are still needed in secondary hospital and hospitals in developing countries that do not have high-performance laboratories. Methods: The goal of this study is to verify that a recently published predictive score conducted on a large scale in China (Liang score) can be used on patients coming from a Belgian population catchment area. Monocentric retrospective cohort study of 66 patients with known COVID-19 disease run from early March to end of May in Clinique Saint-Pierre Ottignies, a secondary care hospital in Belgium. The outcomes of the study are (I) admission in the ICU and (II) death. All patients admitted in the Emergency Department with a positive RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 test were included in the study. Routine clinical and laboratory data were collected at their admission and during their stay, as well as chest X-rays and CT-scans. Liang score was used as benchmark. Logistic regression models were used to develop predictive. Results: Liang score performs poorly, both in terms of admission to intensive care and in terms of death. In our cohort, it appears that lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) above 579 UI/L and venous lactate above 3.02 mmol/L may be considered as good predictive biological factors for ICU admission. With regards to death risk, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) above 22.1, tobacco abuse status and respiratory impairment appears to be relevant predictive factors. Conclusions: Firstly, a promising score from a large-scale study in China appears to perform poorly when applied to a European cohort, whether to predict for admission to ICU or death. Secondly, biological features that are quite significant for the admission to ICU such as LDH or venous lactate cannot predict death. Thirdly, simple and affordable variables such as LDH, LDH + sex, or LDH + sex + venous lactate have a very good sensitivity and an acceptable specificity for ICU admission. ?

Serological immunoglobulin M (IgM)/IgG testing has been proposed as a useful tool for detecting SARS-CoV-2 exposure. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to compare the results of the rapid serological VivaDiag test for SARS-CoV-2-related IgM/IgG detection with those of the standard RT-PCR laboratory test for identifying SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. METHODS: We simultaneously performed both serological and molecular tests with a consecutive series of 191 symptomatic patients. The results provided by a new rapid serological colorimetric test for analyzing IgM/IgG expression were compared with those of RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 detection. RESULTS: Of the 191 subjects, 70 (36.6%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 based on RT-PCR results, while 34 (17.3%) tested positive based on serological IgM/IgG expression. Additionally, 13 (6.8%) subjects tested positive based on serological test results, but also tested negative based on RT-PCR results. The rapid serological test had a sensitivity of 30% and a specificity of 89% compared to the standard RT-PCR assay. Interestingly, the performance of both assays improved 8 days after symptom appearance. After 10 days had passed since symptom appearance, the predictive value of the rapid serological test was higher than that of the standard molecular assay (proportion of positive results: 40% vs 20%). Multivariate analysis showed that age >58 years (P<.01) and period of >15 days after symptom onset (P<.02) were significant and independent factors associated with serological test positivity. CONCLUSIONS: The rapid serological test analyzed in this study seems limited in terms of usefulness when diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, it may be useful for providing relevant information on people's immunoreaction to COVID-19 exposure.","output":"Rapid Serological Assays and SARS-CoV-2 Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Assays for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2: Comparative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction play a key role in the pathogenesis of long-term cardiovascular complications in patients with diabetes. The present observational prospective study is aimed at evaluating the effects of micronutrients and phytochemicals contained in the dietary supplement Flebotrofine? (AMNOL Chimica Biologica) on biochemical markers of inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and glycemic control in patients with diabetes. METHODS: 105 type 1 or type 2 diabetes patients regularly took a daily dose of the dietary supplement Flebotrofine? for three consecutive months, and haematological and biochemical parameters were checked at baseline, after three months of treatment, and one month after its suspension. Statistical comparison of the laboratory parameters was performed using the two-tailed ANOVA test for repeated samples with a statistical significance level set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: The daily use of Flebotrofine? did not change the glycemic metabolic compensation of enrolled patients. After three months of regular Flebotrofine? intake, the plasma levels of the antioxidant -carotene and of arginine were significantly higher compared with the baseline values, with a decrease in the ADMA/arginine ratio. In contrast, apolipoprotein B, ApoB/ApoA1 ratio, and platelet and leukocyte counts significantly dropped. CONCLUSION: The daily use of Flebotrofine? might be a valid supplement of arginine, the precursor of NO, and essential in the prevention of endothelial dysfunction. The regular intake of arginine and phytochemicals also improved the antioxidant and antithrombotic profile of enrolled patients. Therefore, Flebotrofine? could be a useful dietary supplement to prevent long-term complications in patients with diabetes.","output":"Short-Term Effects of Supplemental L-Arginine, Diosmin, Troxerutin, and Hesperidin in Diabetic Patients: A Pilot Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Data about optimal initial assessment in patients with suspicion for COVID19-infection or already confirmed infection are sparse. Especially, in preparation for expected mass casualty incident it is necessary to distinguish early and efficiently between outpatient and inpatient treatment including the need for intensive care therapy. METHODS We present a model for a safe and efficient triage, which is established and used in the university hospital of Essen, Germany. It is intended for a non-disaster situation. This model is a combination of clinical assessment by using vital parameters and Manchester triage scale (MTS). Possible additional parameters are POCT (point-of-care-testing) values, electrocardiogram, CT pulmonary angiography, SARS-Cov2-PCR as well as detailed diagnostic of laboratory values. The model was validated by 100 consecutive patients. We demonstrate three patients to illustrate this model. RESULTS During the first two weeks after implementing this model in our normal operation at the emergency department, we had an efficient selectivity between need for inpatient and outpatient treatment. 16 patients were classified as \\"inpatients\\" according to initial assessment. Among 84 patients who were initially classified as \\"outpatients\\", 7 patients returned to our emergency department within 14 days. Three of these patients returned due to complaints other than COVID19. One female patient had to be admitted due to progressive dyspnea. CONCLUSIONS This introduced triage-model seems to be an efficient concept.

LD biogenesis from the endoplasmic reticulum is driven by phase separation of neutral lipids, overcoming surface tension and membrane deformation. However, the core biophysics of the initial steps of LD formation remains relatively poorly understood. Here, we use a tunable, phenomenological coarse-grained model to study triacylglycerol (TG) nucleation in a bilayer membrane. We show that PL rigidity has a strong influence on TG lensing and membrane remodeling: when membrane rigidity increases, TG clusters remain more planar with high anisotropy but a minor degree of phase nucleation. This finding is confirmed by advanced sampling simulations that calculate nucleation free energy as a function of the degree of nucleation and anisotropy. We also show that asymmetric tension, controlled by the number of PL molecules on each membrane leaflet, determines the budding direction. A TG lens buds in the direction of the monolayer containing excess PL molecules to allow for better PL coverage of TG, consistent with the reported experiments. Finally, two governing mechanisms of the LD growth, Ostwald ripening and merging, are observed. Taken together, this study characterizes the interplay between two thermodynamic quantities during the initial LD phases, the TG bulk free energy and membrane remodeling energy.","output":"Key Factors Governing Initial Stages of Lipid Droplet Formation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the SARS-CoV-2 virus triggered the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists, government officials, and healthcare professionals around the world recognized the need for accessible, affordable, and accurate testing to predict and contain the spread of COVID-19.

With so many infections, SARS-CoV-2 received many opportunities to replicate and mutate, and from these mutations emerged more contagious, deadly, and difficult-to-diagnose viral mutants. Each change to the viral genome presented potential added challenges to containing the virus, and as such, researchers have continued developing and improving testing methods to keep up with COVID-19. In this chapter, we examine several SARS-CoV-2 variants that have emerged during the pandemic.

These patients do not need treatment in hospital and can be isolated at home. To date, most studies have been conducted among inpatients with severe COVID-19. In this study, the authors surveyed patients with mild COVID-19 who remained in home isolation, and analyzed the sources and occupational risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infections. MATERIAL AND METHODS This cross-sectional study was carried out on April 17-18, 2020, among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 who remained in home isolation in Poland. Data were acquired through a structured interview that included questions about the isolation course, symptoms, comorbidities, infection source, household characteristics, occupation, and workplace. Data were presented with descriptive statistics. RESULTS Of the 4878 patients in home isolation, the authors were able to contact 3313. Of them, 1191 patients declined their invitation, and 2122 agreed to take part. The median age of the patients included in the study was 50 years; 59% were female. Most patients (92%) had not been abroad before the infection. More than half (55%) knew how they became infected; of them, 75% became infected at work.

Ochratoxin A is a well-known mycotoxin which contaminates a large variety of food and is associated with food safety concerns. It is a minor substrate of CYP2D6, although the effects of CYP2D6 polymorphisms on its metabolism may be overlooked. Insights on this aspect would provide a useful mechanistic basis for a more science-based hazard assessment, particularly to integrate inter-individual differences in CYP2D6 metabolism. This work presents a molecular modelling approach for the analysis of mechanistic features with regard to the metabolic capacity of CYP2D6 variants to oxidise a number of substrates. The outcomes highlighted that a low-frequency CYP2D6 variant (CYP2D6*110) is likely to enhance ochratoxin A oxidation with possible consequences on TK and TD. It is therefore recommended to further analyse such TK and TD consequences. Generally speaking, we propose the identification of mechanistic features and parameters that could provide a semi-quantitative means to discriminate ligands based on the likelihood to undergo transformation by CYP2D6 variants. This would support the development of a fit-for-purpose pipeline which can be extended to a tool allowing for the bulk analysis of a large number of compounds. Such a tool would ultimately include inter-phenotypic differences of polymorphic xenobiotic-metabolising enzymes in the hazard assessment and risk characterisation of food chemicals.","output":"A Computational Understanding of Inter-Individual Variability in CYP2D6 Activity to Investigate the Impact of Missense Mutations on Ochratoxin A Metabolism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) represents a major complication in many clinical settings, it remains a diagnostic dilemma due to its reliance on insensitive assays or invasive biopsy.

APNSO has the backbone comprising renal-clearable fluorophore fragments and the self-immolative structure units. In the presence of oxidative stress biomarker (superoxide anion, O2 a?- ) during hepatic IRI, APNSO can be fluorescently activated for in vivo NIRF imaging and depolymerized to release renal-clearable fluorophore for urinalysis. By virtue of its high hepatic accumulation, sensitive response towards O2 a?- , and effective release of renal-clearable fluorophores, APNSO -based imaging and urinalysis detect hepatic IRI at least 7 h earlier than the typical clinical assays in mouse model. This study not only provides new opportunities for non-invasive diagnosis of hepatic IRI, but also reveals guidelines for development of optical nanosensors for early urinalysis.

The involvement of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the evolution and pathogenesis of lung diseases has been implicated in recent years. The two enzymes of RAS, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2, serve a contrasting function. ACE helps in the formation of angiotensin II (AGII) from angiotensin I (AGI), and ACE2 cleaves AGI and AGII into AG (1-9) and AG (1-7) respectively. The ACE-induced AGII has vasoconstrictor and pro-inflammatory properties via AT1R, whereas ACE2 has been shown to protect against lung injury. The less spoken about AGII receptor, angiotensin receptor type 2 (AT2R), has anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects in lung tissue and may be of significance in light of the lung pathology presentation in COVID-19. A review of articles searched in PubMed and peer-reviewed journals of importance was done using search terms ACE2, AT2, SARS, and COVID-19. Lung involvement in both SARS and COVID-19 has been very severe and suggestive of severe inflammatory and immune reactions. Animal studies have shown that ACE2 and AT2 receptors counter the pro-inflammatory and other effects mediated by angiotensin II by their vasodilator, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, and anti-proliferative effects. They have been shown to protect against and revert acute lung injuries.

However, the evidence for an association between PFAS and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (including gestational hypertension and preeclampsia) is equivocal and warrants further investigation. OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between background levels of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) and the development of gestational hypertension or preeclampsia in a Canadian pregnancy cohort. We also explored the potential for effect modification according to fetal sex. METHODS: Maternal plasma samples were collected in the first trimester from participants in the MIREC study and were analyzed for PFOA, PFOS, and PFHxS. Blood pressure was measured during each trimester. Gestational hypertension and preeclampsia were defined using the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada guidelines. Logistic regression models were used to derive adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations between PFAS concentrations (per doubling of concentration as well as according to tertiles) and gestational hypertension or preeclampsia. Linear mixed models were used to examine the association between PFAS concentrations and changes in blood pressure throughout pregnancy. RESULTS: Data from 1739 participants were analyzed. 90% of women were normotensive throughout pregnancy, 7% developed gestational hypertension without preeclampsia, and 3% developed preeclampsia. In the full analyses, neither PFOA nor PFOS were associated with gestational hypertension or preeclampsia. However, each doubling of PFHxS plasma concentration was associated with higher odds of developing preeclampsia (OR = 1.32; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.70). In addition, participants in the highest PFHxS tertile (1.4-40.0 g/L) had higher odds of developing preeclampsia relative to those in the lowest tertile (OR = 3.06; 95% CI: 1.27, 7.39). In stratified analyses, this effect was only apparent among women carrying a female fetus (OR = 4.90; 95% CI: 1.02, 22.3). However, among women carrying a male fetus, both PFOS and PFHxS were associated with gestational hypertension, but not preeclampsia. Higher plasma concentrations of all three PFAS were associated with increases in diastolic blood pressure throughout pregnancy, and PFOA and PFHxS were also associated with systolic blood pressure. Discrepant findings were similarly revealed in analyses stratified by fetal sex. CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of PFHxS were associated with the development of preeclampsia, but not gestational hypertension. Neither PFOA nor PFOS were associated with either outcome. However, we show, for the first time, that fetal sex may modify these associations, a finding which warrants replication and further study.","output":"Association of perfluoroalkyl substances with gestational hypertension and preeclampsia in the MIREC study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background/Purpose The outbreak of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to unprecedented impact on mental health globally.

METHOD: We did a retrospective policy tracing of the COVID-19 coordination mechanisms from March 2020 (when first cases of COVID-19 in the AFRO region were reported) to the end of the third wave in September 2021. Data sources were from document and Literature review of COVID-19 response strategies, plans, regulations, press releases, government websites, grey and peer-reviewed literature. The data was extracted to Excel file database and coded then analysed using Stata (version 15). Analysis was done through descriptive statistical analysis (using measures of central tendencies (mean, SD, and median) and measures of central dispersion (range)), multiple linear regression, and thematic analysis of qualitative data. RESULTS: There are three distinct layered coordination mechanisms (strategic, operational, and tactical) that were either implemented singularly or in tandem with another coordination mechanism. 87.23% (n = 41) of the countries initiated strategic coordination, and 59.57% (n = 28) initiated some form of operational coordination. Some of countries (n = 26,55.32%) provided operational coordination using functional Public Health Emergency Operation Centres (PHEOCs) which were activated for the response. 31.91% (n = 15) of the countries initiated some form of tactical coordination which involved the decentralisation of the operations at the local/grassroot level/district/ county levels. Decentralisation strategies played a key role in coordination, as was the innovative strategies by the countries; some coordination mechanisms built on already existing coordination systems and the heads of states were effective in the success of the coordination process.

We investigated time-varying associations between daily time to oneself and loneliness, and the role of everyday creativity as a resource. METHODS: 126 adults aged 18-84 completed online questionnaires including a 10-day daily diary module, during which they self-reported alone time, everyday creativity, and loneliness. Data were analyzed using multilevel models, controlling for study day, participation date, gender, and relationship status. RESULTS: Greater average amounts of alone time were associated with greater loneliness, an association that was stronger in old age. In a daily context, individuals reported feeling lonelier on days when they had more time to themselves than usual. This within-person association was weaker with older age. Everyday creativity did not moderate alone time-loneliness associations. However, holding time to oneself constant, participants felt less lonely and less bothered by alone time on days when they were more creative than usual. DISCUSSION: Participating in creative behaviors (e.g., pursuing arts and crafts) might be linked with reduced loneliness. Intervention studies are needed to investigate whether fostering creativity could help promote mental well-being in times when people, especially older adults, are vulnerable to loneliness and associated health risks.","output":"COVID-19, time to oneself, and loneliness: Creativity as a resource"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The advent of the miniaturization approach has influenced the research trends in almost all disciplines. Bioengineering is one of the fields benefiting from the new possibilities of microfabrication techniques, especially in cell and tissue culture, disease modeling, and drug discovery. The limitations of existing 2D cell culture techniques, the high time and cost requirements, and the considerable failure rates have led to the idea of 3D cell culture environments capable of providing physiologically relevant tissue functions in vitro. Organ-on-chips are microfluidic devices used in this context as a potential alternative to in vivo animal testing to reduce the cost and time required for drug evaluation. This emerging technology contributes significantly to the development of various research areas, including, but not limited to, tissue engineering and drug discovery. However, it also brings many challenges. Further development of the technology requires interdisciplinary studies as some problems are associated with the materials and their manufacturing techniques. Therefore, in this paper, organ-on-chip technologies are presented, focusing on the design and fabrication requirements. Then, state-of-the-art materials and microfabrication techniques are described in detail to show their advantages and also their limitations.

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The impetus for strategic rescheduling of operations is multifactorial and includes our societal responsibility to minimize COVID-19 exposure risk and propagation among patients, the healthcare workforce, and our community at large. Strategic rescheduling is also driven by the need to preserve limited resources. As many states have already or are considering to re-open and relax stay-at-home orders, there remains a continued need for careful surgical scheduling because we must face the reality that we will need to co-exist with COVID-19 for months, if not years. METHODS: The quality officers, chairs, and leadership of the 9 surgical departments in our Division of Surgery provide specialty-specific approaches to appropriately triage patients. RESULTS: We present the strategic approach for surgical rescheduling during and immediately after the COVID-19 first wave for the 9 departments in the Division of Surgery at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer surgeons should continue to use their oncologic knowledge to determine the window of opportunity for each surgical procedure, based on tumor biology, preoperative treatment sequencing, and response to systemic therapy, to safely guide patients through this cautious recovery phase.","output":"Cancer Surgery Scheduling During and After the COVID-19 First Wave: The MD Anderson Cancer Center Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report data regarding three countries with similar healthcare systems which had three different vaccinal strategies between 1st of January and 10th of April 2021: rapid full vaccination (Israel), rapid first-dose vaccination (United Kingdom) and a delayed vaccination strategy (France).","output":"SARS-CoV-2 vaccination efficacy on hospitalisation and variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The term 'crisis' is omnipresent.

Consultant colorectal surgeons were invited to participate in the exercise via the previous survey and the mailing list of the professional society. Iterative voting was performed on each statement using a five-point Likert scale and electronic voting, with opportunity for discussion and refinement between each vote. Consensus was defined as > 80% agreement. RESULTS Seventeen surgeons and two patient representatives voted upon 51 statements. Consensus was achieved on 39 items. Participants advocated a patient-centred approach by a colorectal specialist, within strong multidisciplinary teamworking. The use of anti-TNF therapy is advocated. Where definitive surgical techniques are considered they should be carefully selected to avoid adverse impact on function. Ano/rectovaginal fistulas should be managed by specialists in fistulating disease.

It co-assembles with the viral RNA genome into the capsid core. Virions deficient in RHA are less infectious as a result of reduced reverse transcription efficiency, demonstrating that the virion-associated RHA promotes reverse transcription before the virion gains access to the new host's RHA. Here, we quantified reverse transcription intermediates in HIV-1-infected T cells to clarify the mechanism by which RHA enhances HIV-1 reverse transcription efficiency. Consistently, purified recombinant human RHA promoted reverse transcription efficiency under in vitro conditions that mimic the early reverse transcription steps prior to capsid core uncoating. We did not observe RHA-mediated structural remodeling of the tRNALys3:viral RNA-annealed complex. RHA did not enhance the DNA synthesis rate until incorporation of the first few nucleotides, suggesting that RHA participates primarily in the elongation phase of reverse transcription. Pre-steady-state and steady-state kinetic studies revealed that RHA has little impact on the kinetics of single-nucleotide incorporation. Primer extension assays performed in the presence of trap dsDNA disclosed that RHA enhances the processivity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). The biochemical assays used here effectively reflected and explained the low RT activity in HIV-1 virions produced from RHA-depleted cells. Moreover, RT activity in our assays indicated that RHA in HIV-1 virions is required for the efficient catalysis of (-)cDNA synthesis during viral infection before capsid uncoating.

However, the effect of hypertension on outcomes of COVID-19 patients remains unclear. RESEARCH QUESTION: The aim of this study was to explore the effect of hypertension on the outcomes of patients with COVID-19 by using propensity score-matching (PSM) analysis. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants enrolled in this study were patients with COVID-19 who had been hospitalized at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, China. Chronic comorbidities and laboratory and radiological data were reviewed; patient outcomes and lengths of stay were obtained from discharge records. We used the Cox proportional-hazard model (CPHM) to analyze the effect of hypertension on these patients' outcomes and PSM analysis to further validate the abovementioned effect. RESULTS: A total of 226 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in this study, of whom 176 survived and 50 died. The proportion of patients with hypertension among non-survivors was higher than that among survivors (26.70% vs. 74.00%; P < 0.001). Results obtained via CPHM showed that hypertension could increase risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients (hazard ratio 3.317; 95% CI [1.709-6.440]; P < 0.001). Increased D-dimer levels and higher ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes (N/L) were also found to increase these patients' mortality risk. After matching on propensity score, we still came to similar conclusions. After we applied the same method in critically ill patients, we found that hypertension also increased risk of death in patients with severe COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Hypertension, increased D-dimer and the ratio of neutrophil to lymphocyte increased mortality in patients with COVID-19, with hypertension in particular.","output":"Effect of hypertension on outcomes of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a propensity score-matching analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite great advances in describing Bordetella pertussis infection, the role of the host microbiota in pertussis pathogenesis remains unexplored. Indeed, the microbiota plays important role in defending against bacterial and viral respiratory infections. We investigated the nasopharyngeal microbiota in infants infected by B. pertussis (Bp), Rhinovirus (Rv) and simultaneously by both infectious agents (Bp + Rv). We demonstrated a specific nasopharyngeal microbiome profiles for Bp group, compared to Rv and Bp + Rv groups, and a reduction of microbial richness during coinfection compared to the single infections. The comparison amongst the three groups showed the increase of Alcaligenaceae and Achromobacter in Bp and Moraxellaceae and Moraxella in Rv group. Furthermore, correlation analysis between patients features and nasopharyngeal microbiota profile highlighted a link between delivery and feeding modality, antibiotic administration and B. pertussis infection. A model classification demonstrated a microbiota fingerprinting specific of Bp and Rv infections. In conclusion, external factors since the first moments of life contribute to the alteration of nasopharyngeal microbiota, indeed increasing the susceptibility of the host to the pathogens' infections.

We propose here the first model explaining how the outcome of first, crucial 10-15 days after infection, depends on the balance between the cumulative dose of viral exposure and the efficacy of the local innate immune response (natural IgA and IgM antibodies, mannose-binding lectin). If SARS-CoV-2 runs the blockade of this innate immunity and spreads from the upper airways to the alveoli in the early phases of the infections, it can replicate with no local resistance, causing pneumonia and releasing high amounts of antigens. The delayed and strong adaptive immune response (high-affinity IgM and IgG antibodies) that follows, causes severe inflammation and triggers mediator cascades (complement, coagulation, and cytokine storm), leading to complications often requiring intensive therapy and being, in some patients, fatal. Low-moderate physical activity can still be recommended. However, extreme physical activity and oral breathing with hyperventilation during the incubation days and early stages of COVID-19 facilitates re-inhalation and early direct penetration of high numbers of own virus particles in the lower airways and the alveoli, without impacting on the airway's mucosae covered by neutralizing antibodies (\\"viral auto-inhalation\\" phenomenon). This allows the virus to bypass the efficient immune barrier of the upper airway mucosa in already infected, young, and otherwise healthy athletes. In conclusion, whether the virus or the adaptive immune response reaches the lungs first is a crucial factor deciding the fate of the patient.

Patients with severe depression with endogenous features have a more robust response to pharmacotherapy than do patients with mild-to-moderate depression. Findings in relation to reward sensitivity and changes in brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels contradict research conducted in adults, suggesting developmental differences in the mechanisms underlying depression.

Here, we elucidated the protective effects and underlying mechanism of fluorofenidone on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. In this study, fluorofenidone alleviated lung tissue structure injury and reduced mortality, decreased the pulmonary inflammatory cell accumulation and level of inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6, and TNF- in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and attenuated pulmonary apoptosis in LPS-induced ALI mice. Moreover, fluorofenidone could block LPS-activated phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and P38 and further inhibited the phosphorylation of IB and P65. These results suggested that fluorofenidone can significantly contrast LPS-induced ALI through suppressing the activation of the MAPK/NF-B signaling pathway, which indicates that fluorofenidone could be considered as a novel therapeutic candidate for ALI.","output":"Protective Effect of Fluorofenidone Against Acute Lung Injury Through Suppressing the MAPK/NF-B Pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article aims to cast light on how digital governance tools, such as proofs of vaccination, would impact European freedoms during unstable Covid-19 times.

This long emergency will probably cause years of severe suffering in every region. Health expenses greatly increased, supply chains were disrupted, and governments coped with much less revenue. Good clinicians plan for ALL contingencies, and we need to consider that the current disaster may get much worse. How can we adapt psychiatry to a long emergency? This goes far beyond previous work on crisis standards of care because the emergency is severe, prolonged, and widespread. If we had to spend much less on psychotropics, which meds stay on the formulary? If we have to close hospitals, which patients get a bed? What adaptations could be used if demand exceeds the supply of providers? Very little is known about how to make severe, permanent cuts to healthcare. Our previous systematic review found no scholarship addressing the ethics of severe and prolonged healthcare rationing. Global catastrophes need a global health policy, but this one has no experts. The present study starts the project by surveying experts with related experience that could be useful in future plans. METHOD We used purposive sampling to find 18 professionals with experience in healthcare rationing from underserved, indigenous communities, homeless programs, and African nations. We also interviewed ethicists, pharmacists, administrators, NGO clinicians, and military. Interviews were transcribed and coded using basic inductive techniques. Because so little is known about this topic, we used grounded theory, an iterative approach to guide further sampling, refine interviews, and make some preliminary conclusions. RESULTS Participants all agreed this crisis planning is extremely important and complex. They described diverse concerns regarding ethical decision making, with some having confidence with top-down government policy, and others recommending a grassroots approach. Minority participants had less confidence in government. There was no consensus on any best ethical framework. Most had confidence that clinicians will ultimately do the right thing. Native American leaders had confidence in a holistic, preventive approach. All agreed that social justice should be central in measuring economic impact of long emergencies and choosing ethical options. We collected suggestions for innovative approaches to rationing. CONCLUSIONS This research program illuminates the difficult ethical questions about adapting psychiatry to a prolonged, widespread, and severe emergency. Our interviews identify areas where severe but ethical cuts can be made in medications, hospitals, clinical staff, and administration. Next steps include evidence-based formularies, utilitarian staff cuts, and ethical standards for closing beds or revamping state hospitals. Underserved and diverse communities with rationing experience must have a voice in the discussion.","output":"Psychiatry on a Shoestring: Developing New Standards of Care for a Severe, Prolonged, and Widespread Emergency."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Communications about the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) often employ metaphors, which can help people understand complex issues.

The present study directly compares vaccine acceptance behavior across four different groups: those who are fully accepting of the CDC-recommended schedule, those who are accepting but on a delayed schedule, those who only partially vaccinate, and those who do not vaccinate at all. METHODS: A total of 779 adults residing in the United States with at least one child under the age of 18 years participated in an online survey. RESULTS: Logistic and Ordinary Least Squares regression analyses revealed clear differences between the vaccination behavior groups on a variety of demographic, psychographic, and behavioral metrics. Results suggest financial and insurance-related barriers still hinder full vaccination, and there are differences by race, ethnicity, and educational attainment. Sources of information about vaccines also differed by vaccination behavior group, with those who never vaccinate more likely to rely on friends and family for information. Finally, those whose child experienced what the parent interpreted as an adverse reaction to a previous vaccine, even if that reaction was within the bounds of normal, were more likely to report they delay or partially vaccinate.

In most cases it is caused by pathogenic variants in the SERPING1 gene, coding for C1-Inhibitor (C1-INH). The pathogenic variants in the gene result in reduced C1-INH levels and/or activity, which causes aberrant bradykinin production and enhanced vascular permeability. The standard-of-care diagnostic test is performed biochemically via measuring C1-INH level and activity as well as the C4 level. This, however, does not allow for the diagnosis of HAE types with normal C1-INH. There is an urgent need to identify and characterize HAE biomarkers for facilitating diagnostics and personalizing the treatment. The Hereditary Angioedema Kininogen Assay (HAEKA) study aims to measure the dynamics of cleaved High Molecular Weight Kininogen (HKa) and other metabolite levels during the angioedema and non-angioedema state of the disease. The metabolites will be analyzed and verified by liquid chromatography ion mobility high resolution mass spectrometry (LC/IM-QToF MS) of dried blood spot (DBS) cards upon the study completion. The study design is truly innovative: 100 enrolled participants provide blood samples via DBS: (1) every 3 months within 2 years during regular study site visits and (2) by at-home self-sampling during HAE attacks via finger pricking. We are presenting a project design that permits clinical study activities during pandemic contact restrictions and opens the door for other clinical studies during COVID-19. RESULTS: As of October 2020, there are 41 patients from 5 sites in Germany enrolled. 90 blood samples were collected during the regular visits, and 19 of the participants also performed self-sampling during the HAE attacks from which a total of 286 attack blood samples were collected. Participating patients rate the study procedures as easy to implement in their daily lives. The concept of home self-sampling is effective, reproducible, and convenient especially in times of contact restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: It is the hope that the HAEKA study will complete in 2023, reveal biomarker(s) for monitoring HAE disease activity, and may help to avoid HAE attacks via applying medication prior to the symptom onset.

Offspring born to influenza A virus infected mothers are stunted in growth and more vulnerable to heterologous infections (influenza B virus and MRSA) than those born to PBS- or poly(I:C)-treated mothers. Enhanced vulnerability to infection in neonates is associated with reduced haematopoetic development and immune responses. In particular, alveolar macrophages of offspring exposed to maternal influenza have reduced capacity to clear second hit pathogens. This impaired pathogen clearance is partially reversed by adoptive transfer of alveolar macrophages from healthy offspring born to uninfected dams.

Findings: We propose a conceptual framework of the recognition and exploitation of business opportunities during the COVID-19 pandemic. The framework assumes the influence of specific dynamic capabilities (strategic foresight - at the strategic level and innovation, self-structured and relational capabilities - at the operational level) and the entrepreneur's key characteristics (being intuitive, having the ability to learn - especially in the field of crisis management, being innovative, having leadership competencies and having the ability to use advanced digital technologies) on the identification, creation and exploitation of opportunities during the COVID-19 pandemic.

RESULTS: The mean ( standard deviation) age of respondents was 35.9  14.5 years. In all, 70% of respondents indicated that medical and/or non-medical considerations should play a role in prioritizing patients for the ICU, whereas 15% agreed with a \\"first come, first served\\" strategy and the remaining 15% had no opinion. Respondents deemed risk-conscious behavior on a societal level to be the most important non-medical factor that should be used to prioritize patients in phase three of the framework, garnering an attribute importance (AI) of 31.2%, followed by patient age (AI 16.3%) and health-conscious behavior (AI 16.0%). ICU length of stay had the lowest impact on patient prioritization for ICU admittance (AI 10.9%). Younger and older respondents attached more importance to age than respondents in the middle age group and indicated a stronger preference to prioritize patients in their own age group (p = 0.042). CONCLUSION: The results of our study demonstrate the relative importance members of the public attach to responsible societal behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the next phase of the study, we will elicit the perspectives of a representative sample of the Dutch population. Changes to the task design and attribute operationalization could improve the external validity of the study findings, and optimization of the experimental design will improve the internal validity of the study.","output":"Public Preferences in Priority Setting when Admitting Patients to the ICU During the COVID-19 Crisis: A Pilot Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The unprecedented abrupt shift to remote online learning (OL) within the context of the national lockdown due to the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) highlights the importance of addressing students' preparedness in managing their first experiences with OL. Purpose To investigate the experiences of undergraduate nursing students during their first uses of OL to increase the understanding of their encountered opportunities and challenges. Design A descriptive qualitative design guided by a phenomenological approach was used. Methods The study used a purposive sampling technique to recruit 18 undergraduate nursing students from two universities. Data were collected using two focus group discussions, and the discussions with participants were audio/video recorded through the online platform Zoom due to the national imposed curfew. Content analysis employed Colaizzi's steps to derive the themes/categories. Results The study revealed four themes: experience of helplessness, burdens, and burnout;the need for social and technical support to manage OL;the propensity to consider OL as a positive opportunity;and the deficiency of OL in fulfilling the educational outcomes of clinical courses. Conclusions Abrupt remote OL was a challenge to clinical encounters. This format was very stressful;however, it was also useful. The current study highlighted the need for further research on the effectiveness of remote OL platforms in regard to the achievement of the intended learning outcomes of clinical courses.","output":"Experiences of nursing students under the unprecedented abrupt online learning format forced by the national curfew due to COVID-19: A qualitative research

Toxicological, Radiation and Biological Safety (FSBSI FCTRBS-RRVI hereafter referred to as Center) (to December 2004 - Russian Research Veterinary Institute) was established in 1960 by the Decree No 1377-611 of the Council of Ministers of the USSR The Ministry of Agriculture of the Russian Federation determined the Center as the head scientific institution for toxicological, radiation and biological safety The Institution is a Precision Center of developing a methodology for identifying and evaluating radioactive contamination, indicating potent toxic substances, toxicants and pathogens of infectious diseases in environmental objects, pathological material, agricultural goods of domestic and import production The Center deposits especially dangerous microorganisms for state needs;works on the development, production and introduction of medicines for veterinary use necessary for anti-epizootic measures;organizes the courses of advanced studies Scientific research is conducted in 15 laboratory and vivarium boxes, including special radiobiological and dioxin boxes, which provide a closed technological cycle The Center employs highly qualified personnel: more than 130 Doctors and Candidates of Sciences The Department of Toxicology, one of the major divisions of the Center, conducts large-scale theoretical and experimental studies to analyze the mechanism of action of toxic substances at the body, organ, cellular and molecular levels and to find means and methods for diagnosing, treating and preventing animal poisoning Toxicologists have developed fundamentally new therapeutic and preventive antidotes of prolonged action, which protect animals from poisoning by toxic substances, and highly sensitive express methods for their indication, monitoring toxic substances of technogenic and natural origin in all parts of the trophic chain: soil-plants-animal products (including imported products) To eliminate the effects of exposure to highly active chemical toxic substances at the objects of veterinary supervision the Center created facilities (receipts) that have no analogues in world practice The results of studies on the development of MPC and MRL of potent toxic substances in feed and water, organochlorine and organophosphorus pesticides, heavy metals, mycotoxins and dioxin are important in research and practice The drug Adilin-super has been developed and is widely used for emergency immobilization and mass bloodless slaughter of animals in the field The study of the mechanism of the toxic effect of dioxins and the search for means of treatment and prevention of dioxin toxicosis is a significant aspect of the work of the Department The Center created and operates unique radiobiological complex, where complex fundamental and applied research is carried out to ensure the protection, prevention and treatment of farm animals from radiation injuries using modern irradiation equipment The most significant aspects of scientific research are the development of a prolonged-action bioprotective agent (radiovaccine) based on a cytoplasmic antigen from organs of irradiated animals and microorganisms and an unique method for diagnosing radiation sickness by indicating radio-induced antigens in the peripheral blood of irradiated animals using modern molecular biological and immunochemical tests -systems The Department developed the technology of the production of specific diagnostic kits (enzyme immunoassay, antibody-based erythrocyte diagnosticum and radiation allergen) for conducting immunochemical, serological and allergic studies to indicate radioinduced toxins and radiation sensitizers in acute radiation sickness Scientists have tested biochemical genetic test systems for accelerated diagnosis of ARS and prediction of its outcome Methodological guidelines have been developed and implemented to identify radio-induced antigens in animal and vegetable products and to use EIA and IHT methods for early diagnosis of animal diseases exposed to ionizing radiation In recent years, the Center has been actively cooperating with State Corporation named Rosatom on the introduction of small doses of radiation in the national economy Epizootological and immunological monitoring of brucellosis, anthrax, chlamydia, CoES, rabies, necrobacteriosis, rota-, coronavirus infection of young animals, salmonellosis, leukemia and other infections is carried out in the field of biological safety in many regions of the Russian Federation Diagnostic tools for especially dangerous diseases have been improved using new primers for PCR, monoclonal antibodies sensitive to cell culture viruses, and new microbiological agents As a result of basic research, strains were obtained, on the basis of which highly effective vaccines against brucellosis, chlamydia, necrobacteriosis, parainfluenza-3 and infectious rhinotracheitis of cattle were created and introduced into veterinary practice;pig chlamydia;infectious gastrointestinal diseases of young farm animals In recent years, the Center has launched significant research and constructed new-generation vaccines by irradiating with g-rays virulent and vaccine strains of the causative agents of classical swine fever, Aujeszky's disease, anthrax, brucellosis, glanders One of the areas of research by employees of

We evaluated the utility of digital review of breast cancer immunohistochemical prognostic markers (IHC) using whole slide images (WSI) from formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) cytology cell block specimens (CB) using three different scanners. CB from 20 patients with breast cancer diagnosis and available IHC were included. Glass slides including 20 Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), 20 Estrogen Receptor (ER), 20 Progesterone Receptor (PR), 16 Androgen Receptor (AR), and 20 Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) were scanned on 3 different scanners. Four breast pathologists reviewed the WSI and recorded their semi-quantitative scoring for each marker. Kappa concordance was defined as complete agreement between glass/digital pairs. Discordances between microscopic and digital reads were classified as a major when a clinically relevant change was seen. Minor discordances were defined as differences in scoring percentages/staining pattern that would not have resulted in a clinical implication. Scanner precision was tabulated according to the success rate of each scan on all three scanners. In total, we had 228 paired glass/digital IHC reads on all 3 scanners. There was strong concordance kappa [Formula: see text] 0.85 for all pathologists when comparing paired microscopic/digital reads. Strong concordance (kappa [Formula: see text] 0.86) was also seen when comparing reads between scanners. Twenty-three percent of the WSI required rescanning due to barcode detection failures, 14% due to tissue detection failures, and 2% due to focus issues. Scanner 1 had the best average precision of 92%. HER2 IHC had the lowest intra-scanner precision (64%) among all stains. This study is the first to address the utility of WSI in breast cancer IHC in CB and to validate its reporting using 3 different scanners.

It is an airborne disease that spreads easily and has a high death rate. Development of healthcare support systems using cloud computing is emerging as an effective solution with the benefits of better quality of service, reduced costs and flexibility. In this paper, an effective cloud computing architecture is proposed which predicts H1N1 infected patients and provides preventions to control infection rate. It consists of four processing components along with secure cloud storage medical database. The random decision tree is used to initially assess the infection in any patient depending on his/her symptoms. Social Network Analysis (SNA) is used to present the state of the outbreak. The proposed architecture is tested on synthetic data generated for two million users. The system provided 94% accuracy for the classification and around 81% of the resource utilization on Amazon EC2 cloud. The key point of the paper is the use of SNA graphs to calculate role of an infected user in spreading the outbreak known as Outbreak Role Index (ORI).

This observation led many oncologists to change their daily practice in cancer care, without solid evidence and recommendations. Moreover, the COVID-19 manifestations as well as its diagnosis are particular in this special population. In this review paper we expose the challenges of cancer management in the era of SARS-CoV-2, the epidemiological, clinical, pathological and radiological characteristics of the disease in cancer patients and its outcomes on this population.

It is assumed that the noisy and stressful ICU environment leads to sensory overload and deprivation and potentially to long-term cognitive impairment. OBJECTIVE In this study, we investigated three different virtual reality environments and their potentially restorative and relaxing effects for reducing sensory overload and deprivation in the ICU. METHODS A total of 45 healthy subjects were exposed to three different environments, each 10 minutes in length (dynamic, virtual, natural, and urban environments presented inside the head-mounted display, and a neutral video on an ICU TV screen). During the study, data was collected by validated questionnaires (ie, restoration and sickness) and sensors to record physiological parameters (240 hertz). RESULTS The results showed that the natural environment had the highest positive and restorative effect on the physiological and psychological state of healthy subjects, followed by the urban environment and the ICU TV screen. CONCLUSIONS Overall, virtual reality stimulation with head-mounted display using a dynamic, virtual and natural environment has the potential, if directly used in the ICU, to reduce sensory overload and deprivation in critically ill patients and thus to prevent neurocognitive late effects.","output":"Comparing the Relaxing Effects of Different Virtual Reality Environments in the Intensive Care Unit: Observational Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The main clinical manifestation of the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is respiratory issues. Neurological manifestations are being increasingly recognized, including febrile seizures, headache, dizziness, and myalgia, as well as encephalopathy, encephalitis, stroke, and acute peripheral nerve diseases. Cerebral vasculitis is rarely reported. We describe a case of SARS-CoV-2 interstitial pneumonia complicated by flaccid tetraplegia due to Guillain-Barr Syndrome (GBS) associated with a cerebral vasculitis-like pattern. Case description: A 62-year-old man was hospitalized for cough, fever, and severe respiratory failure requiring tracheal intubation and invasive ventilation. The chest Computerized Tomography (CT) showed images related to interstitial pneumonia and the subsequent nasopharyngeal swab confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. During the hospitalization, there was a progressive deterioration of the senses associated with areflexic flaccid tetraplegia. The treatment with high doses of immunoglobulin G (IgG) led to the immediate improvement of the general conditions and a partial response in terms of recovery of the upper limb and of the distal lower limb movements. Subsequently the patient was admitted to our Rehabilitation Unit, where he received an intensive rehabilitation treatment consisting of physiotherapy and occupational therapy. Two months later the patient was discharged at home and able to walk independently even for long distances thanks to the use of Ankle-Foot Orthosis (AFO). Conclusion: In this report, we present the case of a patient with peripheral and central neurological damage occurred later severe pneumonia induced by SARS-CoV-2. The Immunoglobulin G therapy allowed the patient to benefit considerably from early rehabilitation, reaching the walking, increasing the independence in daily living tasks, and enabling safe discharge from hospital to home.

The aim - to evaluate the changes in the consumption of food supplements in the Lithuanian population over 1997-2020, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the consumption of food supplements. METHODS: A representative sample of the Lithuanian adult population was formed by sex, age and the number of residents in each county. A total of 2573 adult respondents were surveyed using questionnaires on their consumption of food supplements and the results were compared to previous studies. SPSS, 20.0 for Windows version was used for the statistical analysis of the data. The reliability of the differences was found by the chi-squared (2) test with statistical significance of p  0.05. RESULTS: Between 1997 and 2017, food supplements were never taken by an average of 37-47 % of the Lithuanian population. In 2020, the number of never users dropped to 17.6 % and 82.4 % of the Lithuanian population started taking food supplements, mostly to strengthen the body and boost the immune system. The number of daily consumers more than doubled - from 8.9 % in 2017 to 18.6 % in 2020. In recent years the number of consumers of food supplements for 3-4 months per year has doubled and reached 15.5%.

This coordination requires complex communication between cells. Growing evidence suggests that bioelectrical signals controlled via ion channels contribute to cell communication during development. Ion channels collectively regulate the transmembrane potential of cells, and their function plays a conserved role in the development of organisms from flies to humans. Spontaneous calcium oscillations can be found in nearly every cell type and tissue, and disruption of these oscillations leads to defects in development. However, the mechanism by which bioelectricity regulates development is still unclear. Ion channels play essential roles in the processes of cell death, proliferation, migration, and in each of the major canonical developmental signaling pathways. Previous reviews focus on evidence for one potential mechanism by which bioelectricity affects morphogenesis, but there is evidence that supports multiple different mechanisms which are not mutually exclusive. Evidence supports bioelectricity contributing to development through multiple different mechanisms.

Current surveillance protocols generally focus on qualitative impact assessments of viral diversity. These efforts are primarliy aimed at ecosystem and human impact monitoring, and do not help to precisely quantify emergence. Currently, the similarity of biological strains is measured by the edit distance or the number of mutations that separate their genomic sequences, e.g. the number of mutations that make an avian flu strain human-adapted. However, ignoring the odds of those mutations in the wild keeps us blind to the true jump risk, and gives us little indication of which strains are more risky. In this study, we develop a more meaningful metric for comparison of genomic sequences. Our metric, the q-distance, precisely quantifies the probability of spontaneous jump by random chance. Learning from patterns of mutations from large sequence databases, the q-distance adapts to the specific organism, the background population, and realistic selection pressures; demonstrably improving inference of ancestral relationships and future trajectories. As important application, we show that the q-distance predicts future strains for seasonal Influenza, outperforming World Health Organization (WHO) recommended flu-shot composition almost consistently over two decades. Such performance is demonstrated separately for Northern and Southern hemisphere for different subtypes, and key capsidic proteins. Additionally, we investigate the SARS-CoV2 origin problem, and precisely quantify the likelihood of different animal species that hosted an immediate progenitor, producing a list of related species of bats that have a quantifiably high likelihood of being the source.

In addition to histones, some HDACs also deacetylate transcription factors and specific cytoplasmic proteins.Monocytes, as part of the innate immune system, maintain tissue homeostasis and help fight infections and cancer. In these cells, HDACs are involved in multiple processes including proliferation, migration, differentiation, inflammatory response, infections, and tumorigenesis. Here, a systematic description of the role that most HDACs play in these functions is reviewed. Specifically, some HDACs induce a pro-inflammatory response and play major roles in host defense. Conversely, other HDACs reprogram monocytes and macrophages towards an immunosuppressive phenotype. The right balance between both types helps monocytes to respond correctly to the different physiological/pathological stimuli. However, aberrant expressions or activities of specific HDACs are associated with autoimmune diseases along with other chronic inflammatory diseases, infections, or cancer.This paper critically reviews the interesting and extensive knowledge regarding the role of some HDACs in these pathologies. It also shows that as yet, very little progress has been made toward the goal of finding effective HDAC-targeted therapies.

Clinical efficacy of heparin is due to its interaction with antithrombin (AT) that may be decreased in COVID-19. Therefore, we correlated AT levels with outcomes of COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: We recruited 49 consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19. AT levels were significantly lower in 16 non-survivors than in 33 survivors (72.2  23.4 versus 94.6  19.5%; p = 0.0010). A multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that low AT (levels below 80%) was a predictor of mortality (HR:3.97; 95%CI:1.38 to 11.43; p = 0.0103). BMI was the only variable that showed a significant difference between patients with low and those with normal AT levels (32.9  7.9 versus 27.5  5.9%; p = 0.0104).

While technical advancements in stent design and cerebral protection devices (CPD) may help reduce the procedural stroke risk, and anatomy remains important, tailoring stenting procedures according to plaque and lesion characteristics might be a useful strategy in reducing stroke associated with CAS. In this descriptive report of the ongoing Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial-2 (ACST-2), it was assessed whether choice for stent and use or type of CPD was influenced by plaque and lesion characteristics. METHODS Trial patients who underwent CAS between 2008 and 2015 were included in this study. Chi-square statistics were used to study the effects of plaque echolucency, ipsilateral preocclusive disease (90-99%), and contralateral high-grade stenosis (>50%) or occlusion of the carotid artery on interventionalists' choice for stent and CPD. Differences in treatment preference between specialties were also analysed. RESULTS In this study, 831 patients from 88 ACST-2 centres were included. Almost all procedures were performed by either interventional radiologists (50%) or vascular surgeons (45%). Plaque echolucency, ipsilateral preocclusive disease (90-99%), and significant contralateral stenosis (>50%) or occlusion did not affect the choice of stent or either the use of cerebral protection and type of CPD employed (i.e., filter/flow reversal). Vascular surgeons used a CPD significantly more often than interventional radiologists (98.6% vs. 76.3%; p < .001), but this choice did not appear to be dependent on patient characteristics. CONCLUSION In ACST-2, plaque characteristics and severity of stenosis did not primarily determine interventionalists' choice of stent or use or type of CPD, suggesting that other factors, such as vascular anatomy or personal and centre preference, may be more important. Stent and CPD use was highly heterogeneous among participating European centres.","output":"Choices of Stent and Cerebral Protection in the Ongoing ACST-2 Trial: A Descriptive Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundStructural barriers to testing may introduce selection bias in COVID-19 research. We explore whether changes to testing and lockdown restrictions introduce time-specific selection bias into analyses of socioeconomic position (SEP) and SARS-CoV-2 infection. MethodsUsing UK Biobank (N = 420 231; 55 % female; mean age = 56{middle dot}3 [SD=8{middle dot}01]) we estimated the association between SEP and i) being tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection versus not being tested ii) testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection versus testing negative and iii) testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection versus not being tested, at four distinct time-periods between March 2020 and March 2021. We explored potential selection bias by examining the same associations with hypothesised positive (ABO blood type) and negative (hair colour) control exposures. Finally, we conducted a hypothesis-free phenome-wide association study to investigate how individual characteristics associated with testing changed over time. FindingsThe association between low SEP and SARS-CoV-2 testing attenuated across time-periods. Compared to individuals with a degree, individuals who left school with GCSEs or less had an OR of 1{middle dot}05 (95% CI: 0{middle dot}95 to 1{middle dot}16) in March-May 2020 and 0{middle dot}98 (95% CI: 0{middle dot}94 to 1{middle dot}02) in January-March 2021. The magnitude of the association between low SEP and testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection increased over the same time-period. For the same comparisons, the OR for testing positive increased from 1{middle dot}27 (95% CI: 1{middle dot}08 to 1{middle dot}50), to 1{middle dot}73 (95% CI: 1{middle dot}59 to 1{middle dot}87). We found little evidence of an association between both control exposures and all outcomes considered. Our phenome-wide analysis highlighted a broad range of individual traits were associated with testing, which were distinct across time-periods. InterpretationThe association between SEP (and indeed many individual traits) and SARS-CoV-2 testing changed over time, indicating time-specific selection pressures in COVID-19. However, positive, and negative control analyses suggest that changes in the magnitude of the association between SEP and SARS-CoV-2 infection over time were unlikely to be explained by selection bias and reflect true increases in socioeconomic inequalities.

Using a sample of ten countries with dual-banking systems, where the Islamic banking sector is considered systemically important, this paper evaluates the systemic risk and identifies the determinants of systemic importance (measured using spillover indices) of financial institutions. The objective is to understand whether there are any differences in the systemic risk profiles of conventional and Islamic banks during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results indicate a significant increase in systemic risk in the sample countries during the first half, followed by a recovery in the second half, of 2020. Comparative analysis shows that Islamic banks, while earning abnormal returns, pose significantly less spillover to others relative to conventional banks. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an overall increase in spillovers, the magnitude of the effect of systematic risk increased, and higher abnormal return performance shows a negative association with spillover. Furthermore, we find that sensitivity to oil prices is a systemic risk factor for financial institutions, especially for Islamic banks. The results are robust to alternate estimation techniques. The findings of this study provide valuable insights for regulators of dual-banking systems.","output":"Systemic Risk, Islamic banks and the COVID-19 pandemic: An empirical investigation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PCR assay cannot always detect the SARS-CoV2 virus, which might be due to differences in the sensitivities of each sampling site.

We designed a flow-based assay to phenotype cells and quantify cell division by measuring the dilution of fluorescently labeled protein as cells divide. Leukocytes from consenting donors were purified from fresh liquid or fresh-frozen plasma units and cultured for three to seven days with unrelated irradiated allogeneic targets. RESULTS: We discovered a median of 1.6107 viable lymphocytes were detectable in fresh plasma units after collection (n=8), comprised of a mixture of CD3+ CD8+ and CD3+ CD4+ cells. Furthermore, we identified a median of 8.4% of live CD3+ plasma lymphocytes divided as early as Day 4 when co-cultured with unrelated allogeneic cells, expanding to a median 88.8% by Day 7 (n=3). Although freezing the plasma product reduced the total number of viable leukocyte cells down to 2.3105 (n=10), residual naive CD3+ cells were viable and demonstrated division through Day 7 of co-culture.

Given accessibility of methods with demonstrated efficacy in reducing depression and anxiety (eg, mindfulness meditation and cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT]) and limitations imposed by geographic obstructions and localized expertise, web-based alternatives have become vehicles for scaled-up delivery of benefits at modest cost. Mindfulness Virtual Community (MVC), a web-based program informed by CBT constructs and featuring online videos, discussion forums, and videoconferencing, was developed to target depression, anxiety, and experiences of excess stress among university students. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of an 8-week web-based mindfulness and CBT program in reducing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress (primary outcomes) and increasing mindfulness (secondary outcome) within a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with undergraduate students at a large Canadian university. METHODS: An RCT was designed to assess undergraduate students (n=160) who were randomly allocated to a web-based guided mindfulness-CBT condition (n=80) or to a waitlist control (WLC) condition (n=80). The 8-week intervention consisted of a web-based platform comprising (1) 12 video-based modules with psychoeducation on students' preidentified life challenges and applied mindfulness practice; (2) anonymous peer-to-peer discussion forums; and (3) anonymous, group-based, professionally guided 20-minute live videoconferences. The outcomes (depression, anxiety, stress, and mindfulness) were measured via an online survey at baseline and at 8 weeks postintervention using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ9), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and the Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire Short Form (FFMQ-SF). Analyses employed generalized estimation equation methods with AR(1) covariance structures and were adjusted for possible covariates (gender, age, country of birth, ethnicity, English as first language, paid work, unpaid work, relationship status, physical exercise, self-rated health, and access to private mental health counseling). RESULTS: Of the 159 students who provided T1 data, 32 were males and 125 were females with a mean age of 22.55 years. Participants in the MVC (n=79) and WLC (n=80) groups were similar in sociodemographic characteristics at T1 with the exception of gender and weekly hours of unpaid volunteer work. At postintervention follow-up, according to the adjusted comparisons, there were statistically significant between-group reductions in depression scores (?=-2.21, P=.01) and anxiety scores (?=-4.82, P=.006), and a significant increase in mindfulness scores (?=4.84, P=.02) compared with the WLC group. There were no statistically significant differences in perceived stress for MVC (?=.64, P=.48) compared with WLC. CONCLUSIONS: With the MVC intervention, there were significantly reduced depression and anxiety symptoms but no significant effect on perceived stress. Online mindfulness interventions can be effective in addressing common mental health conditions among postsecondary populations on a large scale, simultaneously reducing the current burden on traditional counseling services.

However, there is not currently a core outcome set (COS) for studies of RFM. This study aims to create a COS for use in research studies that aim to raise awareness of RFM and/or evaluate interventions for the clinical management of RFM. METHODS: A systematic review will be conducted, to identify outcomes used in randomised and non-randomised studies with control groups that aimed to raise awareness of RFM (for example by using mindfulness techniques, fetal movement counting, or other tools such as leaflets or mobile phone applications) and/or that evaluated the clinical management of RFM. An international Delphi consensus will then be used whereby stakeholders will rate the importance of the outcomes identified in the systematic review in (i) awareness and (ii) clinical management studies. The preliminary lists of outcomes will be discussed at a consensus meeting where one final COS for awareness and management, or two discrete COS (one for awareness and one for management), will be agreed upon.

Well-established evolutionary biology theory suggests lifespan trades-off against reproductive success, possibly sex-specifically. We examined whether a key driver of reproductive success, testosterone, affected survival using a Mendelian randomization longevity study in the UK Biobank to obtain unbiased estimates, along with control exposures. We applied published genetic instruments for testosterone to obtain inverse variance weighted estimates of associations with survival to (i.e., age at) recruitment, in 167,020 men and 194,174 women. We similarly obtained estimates for a positive control (smoking initiation), and a negative control (absorbate), a marker of vitamin C metabolism. Testosterone was associated with poorer survival (0.10 years younger at recruitment per effect size of testosterone, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.004 to 0.20). As expected, smoking initiation was also associated with poorer survival (0.37 years younger, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.50), but not absorbate (0.01 years younger, 95% CI ? 0.09 to 0.11). Several aspects of a healthy lifestyle (low animal fat diet) and several widely used medications (statins, metformin, dexamethasone and possibly aspirin) may modulate testosterone.

Propranolol hydrochloride and 2-naphthol both contain hydrogen-bond-donor groups, and the pyridine moiety on the polymer acts as a hydrogen-bond acceptor to facilitate removal. Copolymers with different amounts of pyridine comonomer are synthesized, and as the amount of the pyridine comonomer is increased, the ability of the polymer to bind and remove the contaminant also increases. The concentrations of propranolol hydrochloride and 2-naphthol decreased by approximately 20-40% and 60-88%, respectively, depending on the polymer type that is used in the binding experiment. A control polymer was synthesized by using styrene in place of the pyridine monomer. In analogous binding experiments, the styrene polymer decreases the concentration of propranolol hydrochloride by 2% and 2-naphthol by 26%. Thus, the binding effectiveness is significantly reduced when the hydrogen-bond-acceptor group is not present on the polymer. We also show that the best performing crosslinked pyridine-functionalized polymer is reusable.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 1 (ACE1) inhibitors decrease the synthesis of angiotensin II (Ang II) from its precursor angiotensin I and inhibit the breakdown of bradykinin, while Ang II receptor blockers antagonize the action of Ang II at the receptor level downstream. The actions of both classes of drugs lead to vasodilation, a blunting of sympathetic drive and a reduction in aldosterone release, all beneficial effects in hypertension and congestive heart failure. ACE2 cleaves the vasoconstrictor Ang II to produce the anti-inflammatory cytoprotective angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) peptide, which functions through the G protein-coupled receptor MAS to counteract the pathophysiologic effects induced by Ang II via its receptors, including vasoconstriction, inflammation, hypercoagulation, and fibrosis. SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells by binding ACE2 on the cell surface, decreases ACE2 activity, competes for ACE2 receptor-binding sites, and shifts the RAS toward an overexpression of Ang II, accounting for many of the deleterious effects of the virus. Thus, there is great interest in developing recombinant ACE2 as a therapeutic for prevention or treatment of COVID-19. Notably, ACE2 is highly expressed in the oral cavity, and saliva and dorsum of the tongue are major reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2.

We used Cox proportional hazards modeling to estimate multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) of a positive COVID-19 test. FINDINGS: Among 2,035,395 community individuals and 99,795 frontline HCWs, we documented 5,545 incident reports of a positive COVID-19 test over 34,435,272 person-days. Compared with the general community, frontline HCWs had an aHR of 116 (95% CI: 109 to 123) for reporting a positive test. The corresponding aHR was 340 (95% CI: 337 to 343) using an inverse probability weighted Cox model adjusting for the likelihood of receiving a test. A symptom-based classifier of predicted COVID-19 yielded similar risk estimates. Compared with HCWs reporting adequate PPE, the aHRs for reporting a positive test were 146 (95% CI: 121 to 176) for those reporting PPE reuse and 131 (95% CI: 110 to 156) for reporting inadequate PPE. Compared with HCWs reporting adequate PPE who did not care for COVID-19 patients, HCWs caring for patients with documented COVID-19 had aHRs for a positive test of 483 (95% CI: 399 to 585) if they had adequate PPE, 506 (95% CI: 390 to 657) for reused PPE, and 591 (95% CI: 453 to 771) for inadequate PPE.

METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on all patients who underwent treatment for intracranial tumors from 3/12C7/1 for 2019 and 2020. Dates aligned with declaration of State of Emergency through the multi-phase public re-opening. Primary comparative endpoints included case volume, median time to surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, and COVID-related mortality. RESULTS: Overall surgical case volume decreased by 26.6%, while a 46.9% decrease was evident during the ban on elective surgeries. Case reduction occurred only for glial (p= 0.33) and pituitary tumors (p=0.04) where volume was nearly identical for other tumors. Median time to surgery was 2.5 days (range: 0C9) for high-grade glioma patients, 3 days for metastases, 3 days for meningiomas, and 26 days (range: 0C98) for pituitary adenomas, not significantly different from 2019. Time to chemoradiation and planned number of treatments were without significant difference. Among 2,795 Covid-19 patients treated in our institution, only four had brain tumors. Only one patient experienced delayed radiation treatment (three weeks) due to inability to achieve seroconversion prior to planned simulation. Only one COVID-related mortality in our cohort occurred. DISCUSSION: The pandemic did not significantly delay type and time to treatment for neuro-oncology patients at Inova. With swift implementation of PPE and strict peri-operative testing, we provided standard of care treatment without increases in COVID-19 contraction or mortality. Decreases in overall case volume are likely due to ongoing cultural avoidance of seeking medical care; deferment of endonasal surgery may be attributed to a known greater mortality for ENT procedures. Future patient care challenges include establishing clinical significance of seroconversion for asymptomatic, COVID-19 infected patients without delaying necessary systemic treatment.","output":"COVD-13.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether fisetin affects angiogenesis through the VEGFR pathway. In the present study, Y79 cells were treated with 100 ng/ml VEGF in the presence of fisetin at concentrations of 0, 25, 50 and 100 M. A Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was used to detect proliferation and the Transwell and Matrigel assays were used to assess cell migration and invasion, respectively. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis was applied to measure the expression level of VEGFR mRNA and western blot analysis was used to measure the protein expression of VEGFR. An immunofluorescence assay was used to detect the expression of VEGFR. Angiogenesis in vitro was assessed by a tube formation assay. The results demonstrated that fisetin significantly inhibited the proliferation of Y79 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Fisetin also inhibited the migration and invasion of Y79 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, fisetin inhibited the expression of VEGFR in Y79 cells in a dose-dependent manner and tumor angiogenesis in vitro. Thus, fisetin was found to inhibit angiogenesis via inhibition of the VEGF/VEGFR signaling pathway, and could be used as a candidate drug to inhibit angiogenesis in retinoblastoma.","output":"Fisetin inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor-induced angiogenesis in retinoblastoma cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The COVID19 lockdown has altered the dynamics of living. Its collateral fallout on head injury care has not been studied in detail, especially from low- and middle-income countries, possibly overwhelmed more than developed nations. Here, we analyze the effects of COVID19 restrictions on head injury patients in a high-volume Indian referral trauma center. METHODS From the prospective trauma registry, clinico-epidemiological and radiological parameters of patients managed during 190 days before and 190 days during COVID19 phases were studied. As an indicator of care, the inpatient mortality of patients with severe HI was also compared with appropriate statistical analyses. RESULTS Of the total 3372 patients, there were 83 head injury admissions per week before COVID19 restrictions, which decreased to 33 every week (60% drop) during the lock phases and stabilized at 46 per week during the unlock phases. COVID19 restrictions caused a significant increase in the proportion of patients arriving directly without resuscitation at peripheral centers and later than 6 h of injury. Though the most common mechanism was vehicular, a relative increase in the proportion of assaults was noted during COVID19. There was no change in the distribution of mild, moderate, and severe injuries. Despite a decrease in the percentage of patients with systemic illnesses, severe head injury mortality was significantly more during the lock phases than before COVID19 (59% vs. 47%, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS COVID19 restrictions have amplified the already delayed admission among patients of head injury from north-west India. The severe head injury mortality was significantly greater during lock phases than before COVID19, highlighting the collateral fallout of lockdown. Pandemic control measures in the future should not ignore the concerns of trauma emergency care.","output":"The collateral fallout of COVID19 lockdown on patients with head injury from north-west India."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: The suspension of elective operations in March 2020 to prepare for the COVID-19 surge posed significant challenges to resident education. To mitigate the potential negative effects of COVID-19 on surgical education, it is important to quantify how the pandemic influenced resident operative volume. Objective: To examine the association of the pandemic with general surgical residents' operative experience by postgraduate year (PGY) and case type and to evaluate if certain institutional characteristics were associated with a greater decline in surgical volume. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective review included residents' operative logs from 3 consecutive academic years (2017-2018, 2018-2019, and 2019-2020) from 16 general surgery programs. Data collected included total major cases, case type, and PGY. Faculty completed a survey about program demographics and COVID-19 response. Data on race were not collected. Operative volumes from March to June 2020 were compared with the same period during 2018 and 2019. Data were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis test adjusted for within-program correlations. Main Outcome and Measures: Total major cases performed by each resident during the first 4 months of the pandemic. Results: A total of 1368 case logs were analyzed. There was a 33.5% reduction in total major cases performed in March to June 2020 compared with 2018 and 2019 (45.0 [95% CI, 36.1-53.9] vs 67.7 [95% CI, 62.0-72.2];P &lt; .001), which significantly affected every PGY. All case types were significantly reduced in 2020 except liver, pancreas, small intestine, and trauma cases. There was a 10.2% reduction in operative volume during the 2019-2020 academic year compared with the 2 previous years (192.3 [95% CI, 178.5-206.1] vs 213.8 [95% CI, 203.6-223.9];P &lt; .001). Level 1 trauma centers (49.5 vs 68.5;27.7%) had a significantly lower reduction in case volume than non-level 1 trauma centers (33.9 vs 63.0;46%) (P = .03). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study of operative logs of general surgery residents in 16 US programs from 2017 to 2020, the first 4 months of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a significant reduction in operative experience, which affected every PGY and most case types. Level 1 trauma centers were less affected than non-level 1 centers.

This study evaluated possible changes in child eating behaviors, parental feeding practices, and parental motivations when buying food during the lockdown, compared to the period before the lockdown. Parents of 498 children aged 3-12 years (238 boys; M = 7.32; SD = 2.27) completed an online survey with items from validated questionnaires (e.g., CEDQ, CEBQ, HomeSTEAD). They reported on their (child's) current situation during the lockdown, and retrospectively on the period before the lockdown. Many parents reported changes in child eating behaviors, feeding practices, and food shopping motivations. When changes occurred, child appetite, food enjoyment, food responsiveness and emotional overeating significantly increased during the lockdown. Increased child boredom significantly predicted increased food responsiveness, emotional overeating and snack frequency in between meals. When parents changed their practices, they generally became more permissive: less rules, more soothing with food, more child autonomy. They bought pleasurable and sustainable foods more frequently, prepared more home-cooked meals and cooked more with the child. Level of education and increased stress level predicted changes in parental practices and motivations. This study provides insights in factors that can induce positive and negative changes in families' eating, feeding and cooking behaviors.

The technique is based on the internal locking capability of the short guidewire, assistant wire control and the possibility of targeting the wire by a physician. Material and methods: ERCPs were performed with Olympus duodenoscopes, using a short guidewire (260-270 cm) and accessories designed for short- and long-wire systems. The speed of deployment of the accessories and incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP) when using the short-wire hybrid technique were compared with the same parameters when using a long-wire system. The success of cannulations, the percentage of bleeding and cholangitis were monitored. Results: From 2016 to 2020, a total number of 1,506 ERCPs were done. Hybrid technique was used in 58.2% (2017), 88.5% (2018), 91.3% (2019) and 98.5% (2020) of the procedures. The cannulation success rate was 94.73%.

However, it remains unclear how 5-HT3Rs shape synaptic plasticity for memory function. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Extracellular as well as whole-cell recordings were used to monitor hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and synaptic transmission in hippocampal slices from 5-HT3AR knock-out or 5-HT3AR-GFP mice. Immunocytochemistry, qRT-PCR and Western blot were used to measure receptor expression. We also assessed hippocampal dependent cognition and memory using the Morris water maze (MWM) and novel object recognition. KEY RESULTS We found that 5-HT3R dysfunction impaired hippocampal LTP in Schaffer collateral (SC)-CA1 pathway in hippocampal slices by facilitating GABAergic inputs in pyramidal cells. This effect was dependent on 5-HT3Rs on axon-terminals. It resulted from reduced expression and function of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) co-localized with 5-HT3Rs on axon terminals, which led to diminishment of tonic inhibition of GABA release by CB1Rs. Inhibition of CB1Rs mimicked the facilitation of GABAergic transmission by 5-HT3R disruption. Consequently, mice with hippocampal 5-HT3R disruption exhibited impaired spatial memory in Morris water maze tasks.

We incorporated the hospital-bed capacity of both designated and Fangcang shelter hospitals. We used the models to assess the success of the strategy adopted in Wuhan to control the COVID-19 epidemic. Findings: Based on the 13 348 Fangcang shelter hospitals beds used in practice, our models show that if the Fangcang shelter hospitals had been opened on 6 February (a day after their actual opening), the total number of COVID-19 cases would have reached 7 413 798 (instead of 50 844) with 1 396 017 deaths (instead of 5003), and the epidemic would have lasted for 179 days (instead of 71).

HCW occupation and concerns about contracting COVID-19 outside work were associated with nonacceptance of the recommendations (P = .016 and P = .036 respectively). CONCLUSION: As part of their pandemic response plans, healthcare institutions should have ongoing training for HCWs that focus on appropriate PPE doffing and discussions around modes of transmission of COVID-19.","output":"Healthcare worker perception of a global outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and personal protective equipment: Survey of a pediatric tertiary-care hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is an invasive alien species in Indonesia. This study aimed to assess the impact of its invasion in Indonesia by measuring the damaged area caused by the pest in maize fields located across East Java and simultaneously determine whether S. frugiperda outcompetes the native Asian armyworm Spodoptera litura (Fabricius). Secondly, the virulence of 14 entomopathogenic fungus (EPF) isolates against S. frugiperda larvae was evaluated in an effort to find effective biocontrol agent candidates. Results: The damaged area caused by S. frugiperda was generally higher than that caused by S. litura during the survey period from August 2019 to December 2021. It indicated that S. frugiperda may have dominated the native armyworm and become the primary key pest of maize in Indonesia. Based on a single-concentration assay (106 conidia ml?1), the tested EPF isolates displayed varying degrees of virulence against S. frugiperda larvae, causing larval mortality of 3.5 to 71% at 10-day post-treatment, with the highest mortality rates provided by Beauveria bassiana sensu lato and Trichoderma asperellum sensu lato. At a concentration of 108 conidia ml?1, B. bassiana s.l. and T. asperellum s.l. elicited high larval mortality of 76 and 81%, respectively, at 10-day post-treatment. Nevertheless, the probit analysis based on a concentrationCresponse assay revealed that T. asperellum s.l. had lower LC50 and LC90 values than B. bassiana s.l. Conclusions: The attack and invasion of S. frugiperda seem to be a continual threat to the maize agro-ecosystem in Indonesia. As a consequence, Indonesia should mitigate and be well-prepared for future outbreaks of S. frugiperda. Indigenous EPF isolates used in this study may act as promising biocontrol agents of S. frugiperda, especially T. asperellum s.l. This study also serves as the first report documenting the direct lethality of Trichoderma fungus on S. frugiperda larvae.

After completing the online course, the final scores and evaluation results were compared among different groups of interns, and their preference to distinct contents of the course was analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS program (version 22.0).Results: Our online course received consistent positive recognition from the interns. Ninety-nine percent of the interns recommended incorporating the online course into the conventional offline training program after the pandemic. There was no significant difference between interns from different programs concerning the final scores and course evaluation. A smaller learning group size (<15 students) could achieve a better teaching effect than a larger group size (p < 0.05). The interns preferred interactive discussions, and course contents that they can get practice and feedback from, rather than video watching and didactic lectures.Conclusions: The online neurology intern training course based on SPOC and blending learning mode is worthy of popularization in a large student base. The teaching effect of an online intern training program may be improved by limiting the group size to less than 15 students and encouraging more interactive discussion, more practice and feedback.","output":"Remote clinical training practice in the neurology internship during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Large medical centers located in urban areas such as Los Angeles care for a diverse patient population and offer the potential to study the interplay between genomic ancestry and social determinants of health within a single medical system. Here, we introduce the UCLA ATLAS Community Health Initiative-- a biobank of genomic data linked with de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) of UCLA Health patients. We leverage the unique genomic diversity of the patient population in ATLAS to explore the interplay between self-reported race/ethnicity and genetic ancestry within a disease context using phenotypes extracted from the EHR. First, we identify an extensive amount of continental and subcontinental genomic diversity within the ATLAS data that is consistent with the global diversity of Los Angeles; this includes clusters of ATLAS individuals corresponding to individuals with Korean, Japanese, Filipino, and Middle Eastern genomic ancestries. Most importantly, we find that common diseases and traits stratify across genomic ancestry clusters, thus suggesting their utility in understanding disease biology across diverse individuals. Next, we showcase the power of genetic data linked with EHR to perform ancestry-specific genome and phenome-wide scans to identify genetic factors for a variety of EHR-derived phenotypes (phecodes). For example, we find ancestry-specific associations for liver disease, and link the genetic variants with neurological and neoplastic phenotypes primarily within individuals of admixed ancestries. Overall, our results underscore the utility of studying the genomes of diverse individuals through biobank-scale genotyping efforts linked with EHR-based phenotyping.","output":"Leveraging genomic diversity for discovery in an EHR-linked biobank: the UCLA ATLAS Community Health Initiative"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several comorbidities including diabetes, immune deficiency, and chronic respiratory disorders increase the risk of severe Covid-19 and fatalities among SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Severe Covid-19 risk among diabetes patients may reflect reduced immune response to viral infections. SARS-CoV-2 initially infects respiratory tract epithelial cells by binding to the host cell membrane ACE2, followed by proteolytic priming for cell entry by the host cell membrane serine protease TMPRSS2. Additionally, the protease FURIN facilitates cell exit of mature SARS-CoV-2 virions. Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), the major plasma serine protease inhibitor, encoded by SERPINA1, is known to promote immune response to viral infections. AAT inhibits neutrophil elastase, a key inflammatory serine protease implicated in alveolar cell damage during respiratory infections, and AAT deficiency is associated with susceptibility to lung infections. AAT is implicated in Covid-19 as it inhibits TMPRSS2, a protease essential for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. Here we show that treatment of A549 human lung epithelial cells for 7 days with 25 mM d-galactose, an inducer of diabetic-like and oxidative stress cellular phenotypes, leads to increased mRNA levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and FURIN, along with reduced SERPINA1 mRNA. Together, the dysregulated transcription of these genes following d-galactose treatment suggests that chronic diabetic-like conditions may facilitate SARS-CoV-2 infection of lung epithelial cells. Our findings may in part explain the higher severe Covid-19 risk in diabetes, and highlight the need to develop special treatment protocols for diabetic patients.","output":"d-Galactose treatment increases ACE2, TMPRSS2, and FURIN and reduces SERPINA1 mRNA expression in A549 human lung epithelial cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To treat the SARS-CoV-2 virus, that enters the body through the respiratory tract, different vaccines in particular against the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)-protein have been developed or are in the development process. For the BioNTech / Pfizer mRNA vaccine BNT162b2, which is injected twice, protection against COVID-19 has been described for the first weeks after the second vaccination. The underlying mechanisms of defense and the long-term effectiveness of this vaccine against COVID-19 are currently under investigation. In addition to the induction of systemic antibodies (Abs), Ab responses in the respiratory tract would help to form a first line of defense against SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, protection depends on Fab-part-dependent neutralizing capacities, however, Fc-part-mediated effector mechanisms might also be important. Long-term defense would be based on the induction of long-lived antibody-producing plasma cells (PCs) and memory B cells. Here, we established different assays to analyze anti-SARS-CoV-2-S IgG and IgA Abs in blood serum and saliva as well as SARS-CoV-2-S1-reactive IgG and IgA PCs and potential memory B cells in the blood of individuals upon their first immunization with BNT162b2. We show that the vaccine induces in particular anti-SARS-CoV-2-S IgG1 and IgG3 as well as IgA1 and in some individuals also IgG2 and IgA2 serum Abs. In the saliva, we found no anti-SARS-CoV-2-S IgA, but instead IgG Abs. Furthermore, we found SARS-CoV-2-S reactive IgG+ blood PCs and potential memory B cells as well as SARS-CoV-2-S reactive IgA+ PCs and/or potential memory B cells in some individuals. Our data suggest that the vaccine induces a promising CD4+ T cell-dependent systemic IgG1 and IgG3 Ab response with IgG+ PCs and potential memory B cells.

Mexico was not included in the first-ever report on a global cohort of patients with this coinfection. We report on a case of SARS-CoV-2/MBT coinfection in a 51-year-old taxi driver from Mexico City that underscores the importance of rapid and accurate laboratory testing, diagnosis, and treatment. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a man in the sixth decade of life who was admitted to the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases (INER) with a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, which was confirmed by nasopharyngeal exudate using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the identification of SARS-CoV-2. Findings from imaging studies suggested that the patient might be coinfected with MBT. That suspicion was confirmed with light microscopy of a sputum sample after Ziehl-Neelsen staining and when a Cepheid Xpert MTB/RIF assay, an automated semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay, failed to detect rifampicin resistance. The patient was discharged from the hospital 10 days later. CONCLUSIONS: The present report underscores the importance of using validated molecular diagnostic tests to identify coin-fections in areas where there is a high prevalence of other causes of pneumonia, such as MBT, as a way to improve clinical outcomes in patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. While it is imperative to control the COVID-19 pandemic, the medical community must not forget about the other pandemics to which populations are still prey, and tuberculosis is one of them.

A total of 859 nurses actively involved in caring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in Malaysia participated in the study. More than three-quarters of the nurses experienced stress (77.2%). A total of 88.7% and 7.2% of nurses revealed a moderate and high stress level, respectively. Approximately one in eight (12.1%) nurses reported feeling depressed. Nurses working in the outpatient departments reported significantly higher stress levels than nurses working in inpatient care departments. Nurses having chronic health problems reported significantly higher depression levels than nurses with no chronic health problem. Highly stressed or depressed nurses tend to adopt avoidance coping strategies while religion and emotional support were used regardless of the stress or depression levels experienced.

A specific treatment or proper therapy is still lacking, and the investigations from across the world for proper drug/vaccine development towards disease control are in progress. The Coronavirus replication takes place by the conversion of the polypeptide into functional protein and this occurs due to the key enzyme Main protease (Mpro). Therefore, identification of natural and effective Mpro inhibitors could be a safe and promising approach for COVID-19 control. METHODS: The present in silico study evaluates the effect of bioactive compounds found in Eucalyptus and Corymbia species essential oil on Mpro by docking. Molecular docking of the major seven compounds of essential oil (citronellol, alpha-terpineol, eucalyptol, d-limonene, 3-carene, o-cymene, and alpha-pinene) with Mpro was studied by AutoDock 4.2, and the properties were analysed by PreADMET and Biovia Discovery Studio visualizer. RESULTS: The calculated parameters such as binding energy, hydrophobic interactions, and hydrogen bond interactions of 6LU7 (Mpro) with Eucalyptus and Corymbia volatile secondary metabolites represented its scope as an effective therapy option against covid-19. Among the docked compounds, eucalyptol shows the least binding energy without toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of this study reported that the essential oil of Eucalyptus and Corymbia species, mainly eucalyptol can be utilized as a potential inhibitor against COVID-19 and also it can be used in its treatment.

However, the characteristics of these rumors in different phases of the epidemic have not been studied in depth, and the official responses to the rumors have not been systematically evaluated. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to evaluate the rumor epidemic and official responses during the COVID-19 outbreak in China and to provide a scientific basis for effective information communication in future public health crises. METHODS: Data on internet rumors related to COVID-19 were collected via the Sina Weibo Official Account to Refute Rumors between January 20 and April 8, 2020, extracted, and analyzed. The data were divided into five periods according to the key events and disease epidemic. Different classifications of rumors were described and compared over the five periods. The trends of the epidemic and the focus of the public at different stages were plotted, and correlation analysis between the number of rumors and the number of COVID-19 cases was performed. The geographic distributions of the sources and refuters of the rumors were graphed, and analyses of the most frequently appearing words in the rumors were applied to reveal hotspots of the rumors. RESULTS: A total of 1943 rumors were retrieved. The median of the response interval between publication and debunking of the rumors was 1 day (IQR 1-2). Rumors in text format accounted for the majority of the 1943 rumors (n=1241, 63.9%); chat tools, particularly WeChat (n=1386, 71.3%), were the most common platform for initial publishing of the rumors (n=1412, 72.7%). In addition to text rumors, Weibo and web pages were more likely to be platforms for rumors released in multimedia formats or in a combination of formats, respectively. Local agencies played a large role in dispelling rumors among social media platforms (1537/1943, 79.1%). There were significant differences in the formats and origins of rumors over the five periods (P<.001). Hubei Province accounted for most of the countrys confirmed rumors.

In addition, there are production, handling, and disposal costs. Needle phobia is an additional issue faced by many recipients of injections with needles. In addition to a detailed literature review highlighting the need for needle-free injection systems, a compressed air-driven needle-free jet injection system with a hydro-pneumatic mechanism was designed and developed by employing an axiomatic design approach. The proposed injection system has higher flexibility, uninterrupted force generation, and provides the possibility of delivering repeated injections at different tissue depths from the dermis to the muscle (depending on the drug delivery requirements) by controlling the inlet compressed air pressure. The designed needle-free jet injector consists of two primary circuits: the pneumatic and the hydraulic circuit. The pneumatic circuit is responsible for driving, pressurizing, and repeatability. The hydraulic circuit precisely injects and contains the liquid jet, allowing us to control the volume of the liquid jet at elevated pressure by offering flexibility in the dose volume per injection.

Matched controls were obtained from patients who died of other causes over the same interval. The mean duration of illness was 27 days (range 5C108 days). Post-mortem lung tissues from 19 of 20 patients with probable SARS were positive for SARS-associated coronavirus by RT-PCR. Histologically, all patients showed varying degrees of exudative and proliferative phase acute lung injury, evidenced in conventional and immunohistochemical stains by edema, inflammatory infiltrate, pneumocyte hyperplasia, fibrinous exudates, and organization. Eight of 20 patients showed predominantly a diffuse alveolar damage pattern of acute lung injury, six showed predominantly an acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia pattern, and the remainder showed an admixture of the two patterns. Squamous metaplasia and scattered multinucleate giant cells were present in most cases. Vascular fibrin thrombi were a common finding and were often associated with pulmonary infarcts. Special stains demonstrated vascular endothelial damage of both small- and mid-sized pulmonary vessels. Two cases were complicated by invasive fungal disease consistent with Aspergillosis, and another by coinfection with cytomegalovirus. Our findings indicate that the lungs of patients who die of SARS are almost always positive for the SARS-associated coronavirus by RT-PCR, and may show features of both diffuse alveolar damage and acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia patterns of acute injury.

It is considered to be less stable in the environment and its degradation products may have toxicological consequences due to longer persistence and off-site movements. We studied the persistence behavior and leaching potential of tembotrione and its major metabolite TCMBA in clay loam and sandy loam soils having different physico-chemical properties. The rapid transformation of parent tembotrione to degradation products and their high interactions with soil provided challenging task of residues separation from complex soil matrix. Therefore, a novel sample preparation method (modified QuEChERS) was optimized for trace estimation of tembotrione and TCMBA which offered 86.6-95.6% recoveries with limit of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) as 0.001 and 0.003 g/g, respectively in both soils without any matrix interference. A first order dissipation kinetics was followed by tembotrione and TCMBA residues with half-life ranged from 7.2 to 13.4 days in both soils. Residues reached below detectable limit on 45-60 days after treatments in two application doses. Leaching experiment revealed maximum retention of tembotrione residues from 15 to 25 cm depth in both soils whereas TCMBA show appreciable leaching potential. It was concluded that tembotrione can be phytotoxic to the succeeding crops if applied at late post-emergence stage.

One difficulty of undertaking evolutionary analyses over short timescales is the dependency of the inferred evolutionary parameters on the timespan of observation. Here, we characterise the molecular evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) influenza during the first 12 months of their respective pandemics. We use Bayesian phylogenetic methods to estimate the dates of emergence, evolutionary rates, and growth rates of SARS-CoV-2 and pH1N1 over time and investigate how varying sampling window and dataset sizes affects the accuracy of parameter estimation. We further use a generalised McDonald-Kreitman test to estimate the number of segregating non-neutral sites over time. We find that the inferred evolutionary parameters for both pandemics are time-dependent, and that the inferred rates of SARS-CoV-2 and pH1N1 decline by [~]50% and [~]100%, respectively, over the course of one year. After at least 4 months since the start of sequence sampling, inferred growth rates and emergence dates remain relatively stable and can be inferred reliably using a logistic growth coalescent model. We show that the time-dependency of the mean substitution rate is due to elevated substitution rates at terminal branches which are 2-4 times higher than those of internal branches for both viruses. The elevated rate at terminal branches is strongly correlated with an increasing number of segregating non-neutral sites, demonstrating the role of purifying selection in generating the time-dependency of evolutionary parameters during pandemics.","output":"Purifying selection determines the short-term time dependency of evolutionary rates in SARS-CoV-2 and pH1N1 influenza"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) demonstrate dysregulated immune responses including exacerbated neutrophil functions.

The patient complained of prolonged fever and coughs for 7 days which had not improved after oral treatment with sultamicillin for 5 days, prescribed by the patient's general practitioner. Physical examination showed high blood pressure due to previously known hypertension. Other vital signs without pathological findings. Pulmonary auscultation showed basal soft crackling noises of the left lung FINDINGS AND DIAGNOSIS: Laboratory examination showed increased values for LDH, pro-BNP and CRP and normal values for leucocytes and procalcitonin. Conventional X-Ray of the chest showed bipulmonal lateral atypical infiltrates. After the first PCR turned in negative another PCR-analysis for SARS-CoV-2 of a deep oral swab-sample was performed since the clinical, laboratory and radiological findings were typical for COVID-19. Again, SARS-CoV-2-RNA was not detected. A CT-scan of the chest showed bipulmonal lateral ground-glass attenuation, again typical for COVID-19 associated pneumonia. After a third attempt for a PCR-analysis of a deep oral swab-sample was negative, analysis of a sputum was performed which finally confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19 associated pneumonia. THERAPY AND COURSE OF EVENTS: The patient was admitted for evaluation of syncopes and suspect of COVID-19 associated pneumonia. The patient was prophylactically isolated while the result of SARS-CoV-2-PCR from a deep oral swab was pending. Suspecting a possible secondary bacterial infection at the beginning, intravenous antibiotic treatment with ampicillin/sulbactam was initiated. While further examinations showed no indication for bacterial infection, antibiotics were discontinued after 3 days. Due to clinical recovery antiviral therapy was not performed after confirming the diagnosis. The patient was discharged 17 days after onset of first symptoms without any requirements for further isolation.

We study the impact of major interventions across 11 European countries for the period from the start of COVID-19 until the 4th of May 2020 when lockdowns started to be lifted. Our model calculates backwards from observed deaths to estimate transmission that occurred several weeks prior, allowing for the time lag between infection and death. We use partial pooling of information between countries with both individual and shared effects on the reproduction number. Pooling allows more information to be used, helps overcome data idiosyncrasies, and enables more timely estimates. Our model relies on fixed estimates of some epidemiological parameters such as the infection fatality rate, does not include importation or subnational variation and assumes that changes in the reproduction number are an immediate response to interventions rather than gradual changes in behavior. Amidst the ongoing pandemic, we rely on death data that is incomplete, with systematic biases in reporting, and subject to future consolidation. We estimate that, for all the countries we consider, current interventions have been sufficient to drive the reproduction number [Formula: see text] below 1 (probability [Formula: see text]< 1.0 is 99.9%) and achieve epidemic control. We estimate that, across all 11 countries, between 12 and 15 million individuals have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 up to 4th May, representing between 3.2% and 4.0% of the population.

Rather than following the conventional exponential growth, the outbreak that is initially strongly suppressed eventually accelerates and scales faster than exponential during an explosive growth period.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to simulate the effect of different social distancing interventions and investigate whether their timing and stringency can lead to multiple waves (subepidemics), which can provide a better fit to the wavy behavior observed in the infected population curve in the majority of countries. METHODS: We have designed and run agent-based simulations and a multiple wave model to fit the infected population data for many countries. We have also developed a novel Pandemic Response Index to provide a quantitative and objective way of ranking countries according to their COVID-19 response performance. RESULTS: We have analyzed data from 18 countries based on the multiple wave (subepidemics) hypothesis and present the relevant parameters. Multiple waves have been identified and were found to describe the data better. The effectiveness of intervention measures can be inferred by the peak intensities of the waves. Countries imposing fast and stringent interventions exhibit multiple waves with declining peak intensities. This result strongly corroborated with agent-based simulations outcomes. We also provided an estimate of how much lower the number of infections could have been if early and strict intervention measures had been taken to stop the spread at the first wave, as actually happened for a handful of countries.

Methods: To conduct this systematic review and meta-analysis, Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and CINAHL databases were searched using pre-specified search strategies. Further searches were conducted using the reference list of the selected studies, renowned preprint servers (eg, medRxiv, bioRxiv, SSRN), and relevant journals' websites. Studies written in the English language included if those were conducted among COVID-19 patients with and without comorbidities and presented survivor vs non-survivor counts or hazard/odds of deaths or survivors with types of pre-existing comorbidities. Comorbidities reported in the selected studies were grouped into eight categories. The pooled likelihoods of deaths in each category were estimated using a fixed or random-effect model, based on the heterogeneity assessment. Publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of the funnel plot asymmetry and Egger's regression test. Trim and Fill method was used if there any publication bias was found. Results: A total of 41 studies included in this study comprised of 27 670 samples. The most common pre-existing comorbidities in COVID-19 patients were hypertension (39.5%), cardiovascular disease (12.4%), and diabetes (25.2%).

The virus responsible for COVID-19-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-gains entry into host cells via ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2). ACE2 is a primary enzyme within the key counter-regulatory pathway of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which acts to oppose the actions of Ang (angiotensin) II by generating Ang-(1-7) to reduce inflammation and fibrosis and mitigate end organ damage. As COVID-19 spans multiple organ systems linked to the cardiovascular system, it is imperative to understand clearly how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 may affect the multifaceted RAS. In addition, recognition of the role of ACE2 and the RAS in COVID-19 has renewed interest in its role in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease in general. We provide researchers with a framework of best practices in basic and clinical research to interrogate the RAS using appropriate methodology, especially those who are relatively new to the field. This is crucial, as there are many limitations inherent in investigating the RAS in experimental models and in humans. We discuss sound methodological approaches to quantifying enzyme content and activity (ACE, ACE2), peptides (Ang II, Ang-[1-7]), and receptors (types 1 and 2 Ang II receptors, Mas receptor). Our goal is to ensure appropriate research methodology for investigations of the RAS in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and COVID-19 to ensure optimal rigor and reproducibility and appropriate interpretation of results from these investigations.","output":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, COVID-19, and the Renin-Angiotensin System: Pressing Needs and Best Research Practices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Cytokine release syndrome is a dangerous complication of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib in the management of this complication. METHODS: The retrospective study included COVID-19 patients with C-reactive protein (CRP) levels of 60-150 mg/L. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients who received tofacitinib (TOF group) and 30 patients who did not receive any anti-cytokine drugs (control [CON] group) were enrolled. Mortality and the incidence of admission to the intensive care unit were lower in the TOF group than in the CON group (16.6% vs. 40.0%, p = 0.009; and 15.6% vs. 50.0%, p = 0.004). There was a significant decrease in the volume of the affected part of the lungs (p = 0.022) and a significant increase in oxygen saturation (p = 0.012) in the TOF group than in the CON group 7-10 days after the beginning tofacitinib administration. CRP level was lower in the TOF group than in the CON group (7 [3-22] vs. 20 [5-52] mg/L; p = 0.048) 7-10 days after the start of the administration of tofacitinib. During this period, the number of patients requiring mechanical ventilation or those in the prone position increased in the CON group compared to those in the TOF group (26.7% vs. 0.0%, p = 0.002; 33.3% vs. 6.7%, p = 0.020). There was no significant difference in the development of secondary infections, liver or kidney injury, and cytopenia between the two groups.

The role of inflammation in myocardial injury remains unclear. We sought to determine the association of elevated troponin with mortality in a large, ethnically diverse population of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and to determine the association of elevated inflammatory markers with increased troponin levels. We reviewed all patients admitted at our health system with COVID-19 from March 1 to April 27, 2020, who had a troponin assessment within 48 hours of admission. We used logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for mortality during hospitalization, controlling for demographics, co-morbidities, and markers of inflammation. Of 11,159 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 6,247 had a troponin assessment within 48 hours. Of these, 4,426 (71%) patients had normal, 919 (15%) had mildly elevated, and 902 (14%) had severely elevated troponin. Acute phase and inflammatory markers were significantly elevated in patients with mildly and severely elevated troponin compared with normal troponin. Patients with elevated troponin had significantly increased odds of death for mildly elevated compared with normal troponin (adjusted OR, 2.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.68 to 2.53; p < 0.001) and for severely elevated compared with normal troponin (OR, 4.51; 95% confidence interval, 3.66 to 5.54; p < 0.001) independently of elevation in inflammatory markers.

As this virus spread rapidly, it became a matter of time before many countries began to implement measures to try and contain the spread of the disease. COVID-19 as it is referred to, resulted in two main approaches to fighting the viral pandemic, either through a progressive set of measures to slow down the number of identified cases designed to flatten the curve over time (anticipated to be at least six months), or to attack it by the severest of measures including a total lock-down and/or herding exposure to fast track immunisation while we await a vaccine. The paper reports the findings from the first phase of an ongoing survey designed to identify the changing patterns in travel activity of Australian residents as a result of the stage 2 restrictions imposed by the Australian government. The main restrictions, in addition to social distancing of at least 1.5 m, are closure of entry to Australia (except residents returning), and closure of non-essential venues such as night clubs, restaurants, mass attendee sporting events, churches, weddings, and all social gatherings in any circumstance. With some employers encouraging working from home and others requiring it, in addition to job losses, and many children attending school online from home, the implications on travel activity is extreme.

Terrific efforts are generous by the researchers to search for a drug to control SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Here, a series of arsenical derivatives were optimized and analyzed with in silico study to search the inhibitor of RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), the major replication factor of SARS-CoV-2. All the optimized derivatives were blindly docked with RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 using iGEMDOCK v2.1. RESULTS: Based on the lower idock score in the catalytic pocket of RdRp, darinaparsin (-82.52 kcal/mol) revealed most effective among them. Darinaparsin strongly binds with both Nsp9 replicase protein (-8.77 kcal/mol) and Nsp15 endoribonuclease (-8.3 kcal/mol) of SARS-CoV-2 as confirmed from the AutoDock analysis. During infection, the ssRNA of SARS-CoV2 is translated into large polyproteins forming viral replication complex by specific proteases like 3CL protease and papain protease. This is also another target to control the virus infection where darinaparsin also perform the inhibitory role to proteases of 3CL protease (-7.69 kcal/mol) and papain protease (-8.43 kcal/mol). CONCLUSION: In host cell, the furin protease serves as a gateway to the viral entry and darinaparsin docked with furin protease which revealed a strong binding affinity. Thus, screening of potential arsenic drugs would help in providing the fast invitro to in-vivo analysis towards development of therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"In Silico Identification of a Potent Arsenic Based Approved Drug Darinaparsin against SARS-CoV-2: Inhibitor of RNA Dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and Essential Proteases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Various CT severity scores have already been described in literature since the start of this pandemic. One pertinent issue with all of the previously described severity scores is their relative challenging calculation and variance in inter-observer agreement. The severity score proposed in our study is relatively simpler, easier to calculate and apart from a trained radiologist, can easily be calculated even by physicians with good inter-observer agreement. Therefore, a rapid CT severity score calculation can give a clue to physician about possible clinical outcome without being dependent on radiologist who may not be readily available especially in third world countries. Objective The objective of this study is to develop a simple CT severity score (CT-SS) with good inter-observer agreement and access its correlation with clinical outcome. Methods This retrospective study was conducted by the Department of Radiology and Internal Medicine, at the Aga Khan University Hospital Karachi, from April 2020 to August 2020. Non-probability consecutive sampling was used to include all patients who were positive for COVID-19 on PCR, and underwent CT chest examination at AKUH. Severity of disease was calculated in each lobe on the basis of following proposed CT severity scoring system (CT-SS). For each lobe the percentage of involvement by disease was scored C 0% involvement was scored 0, <50% involvement was scored 1 and >50% involvement was scored 2. Maximum score for one lobe was 2 and hence total maximum overall score for all lobes was 10. Continuous data was represented using mean and standard deviation, and compared using independent sample t-tests. Categorical data was represented using frequencies and percentages, and compared using Chi-squared tests. Inter-observer reliability between radiologist and COVID intensivist for the 10 point CT-SS rated on 0-10 was assessed using the Kappa statistic. A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant for all analyses. Results A total of 73 patients were included, the majority male (58.9%) with mean age 55.8  13.93 years. The CT-SS rated on 0-10 showed substantial inter-observer reliability between radiologist and intensivist with a Kappa statistic of 0.78. Patients with CT-SS 8-10 had a significantly higher ICU admission & intubation rate (53.8% vs. 23.5%) and mortality rate (35.9% vs. 11.8%; p = 0.017), as compared to those with CT-SS 0-7. Conclusion We conclude that the described CT severity score (CT-SS) is a quick, effective and easily reproducible tool for prediction of adverse clinical outcome in patients with COVID 19 pneumonia. The tool shows good inter-observer agreement when calculated by radiologist and physician independently.","output":"Correlation of Computerized Tomography (CT) Severity Score for COVID-19 pneumonia with Clinical Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Moodle represents a great contribution to the educational world since it provides an evolving platform for Virtual Learning Management Systems (VLMS) that became a standard de facto for most of the educational institutions around the world. Through the pedagogical functions provided, it collects in the many globally spread out databases a huge amount of information regarding the activities that teachers and students perform during the learning process. This reality makes Moodle a natural choice for conducting experimental research by Artificial Intelligence researchers interested in theories for improving learning and teaching; particularly those related with the controversial learning styles concept. Roughly defined, a learning style intends to be a model of the way and media an apprentice acquires knowledge and hence the way a teacher should present that knowledge to the apprentice matching his/her learning style. Independently of the many controversies (be these scientific, psychological or even ethical) about the soundness and real outcomes that such ideas can bring to improve learning, its a worthy intriguing research area for many researchers pursuing the ideal automated teacher: the teachbot dream. Behind this goal we have developed Middle, a Moodle plug-in able to infer the learning style of each student taking a course using an advanced version of a Bayesian network model that we previously tested. Middle intends support personalized teaching based on the Felder-Silvermans ILS model and has been evaluated through controlled experiments and pilot test in high schools and university courses. Such experiments showed promising results that shed some light on learning styles modeling and its potential outcomes. During the experience we found strong limitations in the Moodle design regarding its supposed flexibility to incorporate new functionalities. From a strict software architecture point of view, we found that such flexibility is far from being enough to easier the implementation of the dynamic computational behavior required to support a teachbot. This made our effort much harder than expected, perhaps because of the illusion induced by the widespread use of Moodle. In this article we present our results and experiences extending Moddle with intelligent behavior from a software architecture point of view, focusing on the lessons learnt in such extension.

DESIGN: Cross-country comparable, descriptive study based on a longitudinal survey. SETTING: Six national surveys from countries representing 38% of the sub-Saharan African population (Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Malawi, Mali, Nigeria and Uganda). PARTICIPANTS: Respondents of national high-frequency phone surveys, aged 15 years and older, drawn from a nationally representative sample of households. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19 if an approved vaccine is provided now and for free, disaggregated by demographic attributes and socioeconomic factors obtained from national household surveys. Correlates of and reasons for vaccine hesitancy. RESULTS: Acceptance rates in the six sub-Saharan African countries studied are generally high, with at least four in five people willing to be vaccinated in all but one country. Vaccine acceptance ranges from nearly universal in Ethiopia (97.9%, 95% CI 97.2% to 98.6%) to below what would likely be required for herd immunity in Mali (64.5%, 95% CI 61.3% to 67.8%). We find little evidence for systematic differences in vaccine hesitancy by sex or age but some clusters of hesitancy in urban areas, among the better educated, and in richer households. Safety concerns about the vaccine in general and its side effects specifically emerge as the primary reservations toward a COVID-19 vaccine across countries. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that inadequate demand is unlikely to represent the key bottleneck to reaching high COVID-19 vaccine coverage in sub-Saharan Africa.

While these drugs may increase cardiac toxicity risk, cardiomyocyte mechanisms underlying this risk remain poorly understood in humans. Therefore, we evaluated the pro-arrhythmia risk and inotropic effects of these drugs in the cardiomyocyte contractility-based model of the human heart. We found Hydroxychloroquine to have a low pro-arrhythmia risk, while Chloroquine and Azithromycin were associated with high risk. Hydroxychloroquine pro-arrhythmia risk changed to high with low level of K+, while high level of Mg2+ protected against pro-arrhythmic effect of high Hydroxychloroquine concentrations. Moreover, therapeutic concentration of Hydroxychloroquine caused no enhancement of elevated temperature-induced pro-arrhythmia. Polytherapy of Hydroxychloroquine plus Azithromycin and sequential application of these drugs were also found to influence pro-arrhythmia risk categorization. Hydroxychloroquine pro-arrhythmia risk changed to high when combined with Azithromycin at therapeutic concentration. However, Hydroxychloroquine at therapeutic concentration impacted the cardiac safety profile of Azithromycin and its pro-arrhythmia risk only at concentrations above therapeutic level. We also report that Hydroxychloroquine and Chloroquine, but not Azithromycin, decreased contractility while exhibiting multi-ion channel block features, and Hydroxychloroquine's contractility effect was abolished by Azithromycin. Thus, this study has the potential to inform clinical studies evaluating repurposed therapies, including those in the COVID-19 context. Additionally, it demonstrates the translational value of the human cardiomyocyte contractility-based model as a key early discovery path to inform decisions on novel therapies for COVID-19, malaria, and inflammatory diseases.","output":"Cardiotoxic Potential of Hydroxychloroquine, Chloroquine and Azithromycin in Adult Human Primary Cardiomyocytes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) for people living with HIV (PLWH) is poorly understood.

Gene expression level is widely accepted as the primary determinant of protein evolutionary rate, because it scales with the extent of selective constraints imposed on a protein, leading to the well-known negative correlation between expression level and protein evolutionary rate (the E-R anticorrelation). Selective constraints have been hypothesized to entail the maintenance of protein function, the avoidance of cytotoxicity caused by protein misfolding or nonspecific protein-protein interactions, or both. However, empirical tests evaluating the relative importance of these hypotheses remain scarce, likely due to the nontrivial difficulties in distinguishing the effect of a deleterious mutation on a protein's function versus its cytotoxicity. We realized that examining the sequence evolution of viral proteins could overcome this hurdle. It is because purifying selection against mutations in a viral protein that result in cytotoxicity per se is likely relaxed, whereas purifying selection against mutations that impair viral protein function persists. Multiple analyses of SARS-CoV-2 and nine other virus species revealed a complete absence of any E-R anticorrelation. As a control, the E-R anticorrelation does exist in human endogenous retroviruses where purifying selection against cytotoxicity is present. Taken together, these observations do not support the maintenance of protein function as the main constraint on protein sequence evolution in cellular organisms.","output":"The Missing Expression Level-Evolutionary Rate Anticorrelation in Viruses Does Not Support Protein Function as a Main Constraint on Sequence Evolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The possibility of COVID-19 transmission by environmental surfaces such as playground equipment has been previously suggested. The objective of this study was to investigate how the parents' Knowledge and beliefs regarding using public playgrounds contribute to asymptomatic community transmission of the virus. Methods: An online survey questionnaire was designed through SurveyMonkey (Palo Alto, California, USA), including 18 closed-ended and one open-ended question. Albertans having at least one non-school-aged child were invited to participate via a link placed on social media platforms. The initial survey was sent out in December 2020, and the survey period continued for 3 weeks. The survey results were summarized, graphed, and reported using SurveyMonkey. Results: : A total of 162 anonymous responses were included in this study. Overall, the dimensions evaluated have demonstrated remarkable levels of compliance with the current public health measures among parents (Average score 6.1/9.0 (68%)). However, most respondents believed a more stringent health measure is needed to improve public playground safety during this pandemic, such as regular cleaning and sanitizing the equipment, capacity restrictions, sanitizer available at playgrounds, etc. While the majority of respondents were aware of the possibility of COVID-19 transmission through public playgrounds, there were some indications of inappropriate use of playgrounds;a few parents used playgrounds even after the child was diagnosed with Covid-19 infection or identified as a close contact of someone who is confirmed as having COVID-19 by a health care provider. Conclusions: : Our study highlights the current lack of screening and risk assessments of public playgrounds that may contribute to an increase in a variety of pathogens, including COVID-19, that cause a range of health outcomes.","output":"Using public playgrounds during COVID-19 pandemic: A Survey of Parental Knowledge, Attitudes, and Beliefs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is now a global crisis and the Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh are in the most vulnerable situation.

Here, we aimed to investigate the quality of life (QoL) in brain tumor patients and relatives in this setting. Over twelve weeks during the first wave of the pandemic (04-07/2020), brain tumor patients and their families from two large German tertiary care centers were asked to complete weekly questionnaires for anxiety, depression, distress, and well-being. Information regarding social support and living conditions was also collected. One hundred participants (63 patients, 37 relatives) completed 729 questionnaires over the course of the study. Compared to relatives, patients showed more depressive symptoms (p < 0.001) and reduced well-being (p = 0.013). While acceptance of lockdown measures decreased over time, QoL remained stable. QoL measures between patients and their families were weakly or moderately correlated. The number of social contacts was strongly associated with QoL. Age, living conditions, ongoing therapy, employment, and physical activity were other predictors. QoL is correlated between patients and their families and heavily depends on social support factors, indicating the need to focus on the entire family and their social situation for QoL interventions during the pandemic.","output":"Quality of Life in Brain Tumor Patients and Their Relatives Heavily Depends on Social Support Factors during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: In an effort to mitigate COVID-19 related challenges for clinical research, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued new guidance for the conduct of virtual clinical trials in late March 2020. This study documents trends in the use of connected digital products (CDPs), tools that enable remote patient monitoring and telehealth consultation, in clinical trials both before and after the onset of the pandemic. DESIGN: We applied a comprehensive text search algorithm to clinical trial registry data to identify trials that use CDPs for remote monitoring or telehealth. We compared CDP use in the months before and after the issuance of FDA guidance facilitating virtual clinical trials. SETTING: All trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov with start dates from May 2019 through February 2021. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was the overall percentage of CDP use in clinical trials started in the 10 months prior to the pandemic onset (May 2019CFebruary 2020) compared with the 10 months following (May 2020CFebruary 2021). Secondary outcome measures included CDP usage by trial type (interventional, observational), funder type (industry, non-industry) and diagnoses (COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 participants). RESULTS: CDP usage in clinical trials increased by only 1.65 percentage points, from 14.19% (n=23 473) of all trials initiated in the 10 months prior to the pandemic onset to 15.84% (n=26 009) of those started in the 10 months following (p<0.01). The increase occurred primarily in observational studies and non-industry funded trials and was driven entirely by CDP usage in trials for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that in the short-term, new options created by regulatory guidance to stimulate telehealth and remote monitoring were not widely incorporated into clinical research. In the months immediately following the pandemic onset, CDP adoption increased primarily in observational and non-industry funded studies where virtual protocols are likely medically necessary due to the participants COVID-19 diagnosis.","output":"Use of connected digital products in clinical research following the COVID-19 pandemic: a comprehensive analysis of clinical trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing pandemic of 2019-nCov (COVID-19) coronavirus has made reliable epidemiological modeling an urgent necessity.

Abstract Objective: The Covid-19 pandemic affected today more than 3,000,000 worldwide, and more than half of humanity has been placed in quarantine. The scientific community and the political authorities fear an epidemic of suicide secondary to this crisis. The aim of this review is to analyze the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the dimensions of the suicidal process and its interaction with the various risk factors. We also propose innovative strategies to manage suicidal behavior in the context of pandemic. Methods: We carried out a narrative review of international publications dealing with major pandemics (Covid-19, SARS) and their influence on suicidal vulnerability. Results: Many factors are likely to increase the emergence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts during this crisis. Social distancing and quarantine could increase the feeling of disconnection and the perception of social pain in vulnerable individuals. Some populations at high suicidal risk could be further impacted by the current pandemic: the elderly, medical staff and individuals exposed to economic insecurity. Several innovative tools adapted to the constraints of social distancing and quarantine may prevent suicide risk: e-health, VigilanS, buddhist-derived practices and art engagement. Conclusions: This unprecedented crisis may interact with certain dimensions of the suicidal process. However it is time to innovate. Several suicide prevention tools all have their place in new modes of care and should be tested on a large scale.","output":"pidmie de COVID-19 et prise en charge des conduites suicidaires: challenge et perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Conventional vaccine strategies have been highly efficacious for several decades in reducing mortality and morbidity due to infectious diseases. The bane of conventional vaccines, such as those that include whole organisms or large proteins, appear to be the inclusion of unnecessary antigenic load that, not only contributes little to the protective immune response, but complicates the situation by inducing allergenic and/or reactogenic responses. Peptide vaccines are an attractive alternative strategy that relies on usage of short peptide fragments to engineer the induction of highly targeted immune responses, consequently avoiding allergenic and/or reactogenic sequences. Conversely, peptide vaccines used in isolation are often weakly immunogenic and require particulate carriers for delivery and adjuvanting. In this article, we discuss the specific advantages and considerations in targeted induction of immune responses by peptide vaccines and progresses in the development of such vaccines against various diseases.

In this study, the dimeric RGD peptide, E-[c(RGDfK)]2, was conjugated with NODAGA and radiolabeled with (18)F in a simple one-pot process with a radiolabeling yield of 20%, the whole process lasting only 45 min. NODAGA-E-[c(RGDfK)]2 labeled with (18)F at a specific activity of 1.8 MBq nmol(-1) and a radiochemical purity of 100% could be achieved. The logP value of (18)F-labeled NODAGA-E-[c(RGDfK)]2 was -4.26  0.02. In biodistribution studies, (18)F-NODAGA-E-[c(RGDfK)]2 cleared rapidly from the blood with 0.03  0.01 percentage injected dose per gram (%ID g(-1)) in the blood at 2 h p.i., mainly via the kidneys, and showed good in vivo stability.

The pandemics impact on people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains poorly understood. We hypothesised that the UK-wide lockdown restrictions were associated with reductions in severe COPD exacerbations. We provide the first national level analyses of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and first lockdown on severe COPD exacerbations resulting in emergency hospital admissions and/or leading to death as well as those recorded in primary care or emergency departments. METHODS: Using data from Public Health Scotland and the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage Databank in Wales, we accessed weekly counts of emergency hospital admissions and deaths due to COPD over the first 30 weeks of 2020 and compared these to the national averages over the preceding 5 years. For both Scotland and Wales, we undertook interrupted time-series analyses to model the impact of instigating lockdown on these outcomes. Using fixed-effect meta-analysis, we derived pooled estimates of the overall changes in trends across the two nations. RESULTS: Lockdown was associated with 48% pooled reduction in emergency admissions for COPD in both countries (incidence rate ratio, IRR 0.52, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.58), relative to the 5-year averages. There was no statistically significant change in deaths due to COPD (pooled IRR 1.08, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.33). In Wales, lockdown was associated with 39% reduction in primary care consultations for acute exacerbation of COPD (IRR 0.61, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.71) and 46% reduction in COPD-related emergency department attendances (IRR 0.54, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.81).

OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors associated with admission and subsequent mortality among COVID-19Cinfected asthmatics. METHODS: Adults at our institution with a positive polymerase chain reaction for COVID-19 between March 14 and April 27, 2020, were retrospectively identified. Comorbidities, laboratory results, and mortality rates during hospitalization were recorded. RESULTS: In total, 737 of 951 (77.5%) asthma patients with COVID-19 were seen in the emergency department (ED), and 78.8% of these ED patients (581 of 737) were admitted. Individuals with previously measured mean absolute eosinophil counts (AEC) 150 cells/L were less likely to be admitted (odds ratio [OR] = 0.46, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.21-0.98, P = .04), whereas concomitant heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were risk factors for admission. Hospitalized patients with asthma with peak hospital-measured AEC 150 cells/L (n = 104) were less likely to die compared with those whose AEC remained <150 cells/L (n = 213) (mortality rate 9.6% vs 25.8%; OR = 0.006, 95% CI: 0.0001-0.64, P = .03).

The mortality rate in patients with asthma alone (no associated CHF, CKD, COPD, diabetes, or hypertension) was similar to that of patients without asthma or any of these comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: In asthmatics, pre-existing eosinophilia (AEC 150 cells/L) was protective from COVID-19Cassociated admission, and development of eosinophilia (AEC 150 cells/L) during hospitalization was associated with decreased mortality.

Individuals, organizations, and governments are using social media to communicate with each other on a number of issues relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Not much is known about the topics being shared on social media platforms relating to COVID-19. Analyzing such information can help policy makers and health care organizations assess the needs of their stakeholders and address them appropriately. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the main topics posted by Twitter users related to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Leveraging a set of tools (Twitter's search application programming interface (API), Tweepy Python library, and PostgreSQL database) and using a set of predefined search terms (\\"corona,\\" \\"2019-nCov,\\" and \\"COVID-19\\"), we extracted the text and metadata (number of likes and retweets, and user profile information including the number of followers) of public English language tweets from February 2, 2020, to March 15, 2020. We analyzed the collected tweets using word frequencies of single (unigrams) and double words (bigrams). We leveraged latent Dirichlet allocation for topic modeling to identify topics discussed in the tweets. We also performed sentiment analysis and extracted the mean number of retweets, likes, and followers for each topic and calculated the interaction rate per topic. RESULTS: Out of approximately 2.8 million tweets included, 167,073 unique tweets from 160,829 unique users met the inclusion criteria. Our analysis identified 12 topics, which were grouped into four main themes: origin of the virus; its sources; its impact on people, countries, and the economy; and ways of mitigating the risk of infection. The mean sentiment was positive for 10 topics and negative for 2 topics (deaths caused by COVID-19 and increased racism). The mean for tweet topics of account followers ranged from 2722 (increased racism) to 13,413 (economic losses). The highest mean of likes for the tweets was 15.4 (economic loss), while the lowest was 3.94 (travel bans and warnings).

A questionnaire was developed to identify risk factors for Cryptosporidium infection. Overall, the percentage of positive calves and farms was 38.8 and 68.2%, respectively. The SSU rRNA-based PCR identified two Cryptosporidium species, Cryptosporidium parvum (95.8%) and C. bovis (4.2%). Sequence analyses of the glycoprotein (gp60) gene revealed that all C. parvum isolates belonged to the subtype family IIa (IIaA15G2R1 and IIaA16G3R1), with the exception of three isolates that belonged to the subtype family IId (IIdA20G1b and IIdA20). Mixed logistic regression results indicated that calves aged 15C21 days were more likely to be Cryptosporidium-positive. The risk of being positive was also significantly higher in herds from Central Sardinia and in farms using non-slatted flooring. In addition, the application of disinfectants and milk replacers was significantly associated with higher Cryptosporidium prevalence. In contrast, the risk of being positive was significantly reduced in halofuginone-treated calves. Our results reveal that a significant percentage of suckling calves are carriers of zoonotic subtypes of C. parvum. Thus, both healthy and diarrhoeic calves younger than 1 month may represent a risk for the transmission of cryptosporidiosis in humans and animals.

Previous studies reported an increased risk of thromboembolic events, including stroke. This systematic review aims to describe the clinical features and etiological characteristics of ischemic stroke patients with CO-VID-19 infection. METHOD: A literature search was performed in principal databases for studies and case reports containing data concerning risk factors, clinical features, and etiological characteristics of patients infected with COVID-19 and suffering from stroke. Descriptive and analytical statistics were applied. RESULTS: Overall, 14 articles were included for a total of 93 patients. Median age was 65 (IQR: 55-75) years with prevalence in males. Stroke occurred after a median of 6 days from COVID-19 infection diagnosis. Median National of Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 19. Cryptogenic (Cry) strokes were more frequent (51.8%), followed by cardioembolic etiology, and they occurred a long time after COVID-19 diagnosis compared with large-artery atherosclerosis strokes (ptrend: 0.03). The clinical severity of stroke was significantly associated with the severity grade of COVID-19 infection (ptrend: 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Ischemic strokes in COVID-19-infected patients were clinically severe, affecting younger patients mainly with Cry and cardioembolic etiologies.

Several public health interventions were applied to contain the infection. However, the pandemic itself and the lockdown measure negatively influence people's lifestyles and psychological health. Purpose: To explore determinants of healthy dietary intake and depression, and examine the interaction between healthy dietary intake and COVID-19 lockdown on depression. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted at 18 hospitals and health centers from February 14 to May 31, 2020. Data of 8,291 outpatients were collected including patients' characteristics, clinical parameters, health literacy, healthy dietary intake (using the healthy eating score, HES), other health-related behaviors, and depression (using the patient health questionnaire, PHQ). Depression was defined as PHQ score  10. Results: Protective factors of healthy dietary intake and depression were higher education, better medication payment ability, higher social status, more physical activity, and higher health literacy, whereas older age, ever married, own business or other types of occupation, lockdown, suspected COVID-19 symptoms, and comorbidity were associated with lower HES scores and a higher depression likelihood. Besides, overweight/obesity and alcohol drinking were associated with lower HES scores. As compared with patients not under lockdown and with lowest HES score, those who were under lockdown and with lowest HES score had 10.6 times higher depression likelihood (odds ratio, OR, 10.60; 95% CI 6.88, 16.32; p < 0.001), whereas people with higher HES score had 15% lower depression likelihood (OR 0.85; 95% CI 0.82, 0.89; p < 0.001). Conclusions: Healthy dietary intake and depression were determined by several sociodemographic, clinical, and behavioral factors.

While viewed traditionally as an opportunistic pathogen, increasing research into M. abscessus in recent years has highlighted its continued evolution into a true pathogen. This is demonstrated through an extensive collection of virulence factors (VFs) possessed by this organism which facilitate survival within the host, particularly in the harsh environment of the CF lung. These include VFs resembling those of other Mycobacteria, and non-mycobacterial VFs, both of which make a notable contribution in shaping M. abscessus interaction with the host. Mycobacterium abscessus continued acquisition of VFs is cause for concern and highlights the need for novel vaccination strategies to combat this pathogen. An effective M. abscessus vaccine must be suitably designed for target populations (i.e., individuals with CF) and incorporate current knowledge on immune correlates of protection against M. abscessus infection. Vaccination strategies must also build upon lessons learned from ongoing efforts to develop novel vaccines for other pathogens, particularly Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb); decades of research into M. tb has provided insight into unconventional and innovative vaccine approaches that may be applied to M. abscessus. Continued research into M. abscessus pathogenesis will be critical for the future development of safe and effective vaccines and therapeutics to reduce global incidence of this emerging pathogen.","output":"Virulence Mechanisms of Mycobacterium abscessus: Current Knowledge and Implications for Vaccine Design"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: As of March 23, 2020, suspension of non-essential activities was declared in Mexico throughout the country in order to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.

PURPOSE: : This study reviews the effect and safety of CHM granules in the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19. METHODS: : We conducted a single-center, retrospective study on patients with severe COVID-19 in a designated hospital in Wuhan from January 15, 2020 to March 30, 2020. The propensity score matching (PSM) was used to assess the effect and safety of the treatment using CHM granules. The ratio of patients who received treatment with CHM granules combined with usual care and those who received usual care alone was 1:1. The primary outcome was the time to clinical improvement within 28 days, defined as the time taken for the patients health to show improvement by decline of two categories (from the baseline) on a modified six-category ordinal scale, or to be discharged from the hospital before Day 28. RESULTS: : Using PSM, 43 patients (45% male) aged 65.6 (57C70) years from each group were exactly matched. No significant difference was observed in clinical improvement of patients treated with CHM granules compared with those who received usual (P = 0.851). However, the use of CHM granules reduced the 28-day mortality (P = 0.049) and shortened the duration of fever (4 days vs. 7 days, P = 0.002). The differences in the duration of cough and dyspnea and the difference in lung lesion ratio on computerized tomography scans were not significant. Commonly, patients in the CHM group had an increased D-dimer level (P = 0.036). CONCLUSION: : For patients with severe COVID-19, CHM granules, combined with usual care, showed no improvement beyond usual care alone. However, the use of CHM granules reduced the 28-day mortality rate and the time to fever alleviation. Nevertheless, CHM granules may be associated with high risk of fibrinolysis.","output":"Effect and safety of Chinese herbal medicine granules in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective, single-center study with propensity score matching"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background These last months, dozens of SARS-CoV-2 serological tests have become available with varying performances. A major effort was completed to compare 17 serological tests.

In a second phase, the five best performing and most available tests were further evaluated on a total of 582 sera (178 and 404 expected positive and negative, respectively), allowing the assessment of 20 possible cross-reactions with other virus. Results In the preliminary phase, among eight IgG/pan-Ig ELISA or CLIA/ECLIA tests, four had a sensitivity and specificity above 90% and 98% respectively, and on six IgM/IgA tests, only one was acceptable. Only one LFA test on three showed good performances for both IgG and IgM. For all the tests IgM and IgG aroused concomitantly. In the second phase, no tests showed particular cross-reaction.

Endotracheal intubation is one of the procedures mostly generating aerosol and, therefore, requiring full protection of medical personnel against the infection. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this paper, basing on a literature review, the recommended intubation procedure is presented together with recommendations for personal protection during intubation. Additionally, a proposal of a simple and cheap protective barrier is described against spreading aerosol outside the intubation area. The aim was to propose a simple and cheap method to increase the safety of medical personnel performing AGPs in patients infected or suspected of being infected with COVID-19, which could be easily introduced into clinical practice. RESULTS: The presented method is the authors' own idea, based on their experience gathered from working in an operating room. Judging from their clinical experience, the presented method is effective and safe for patients.

Holstein heifer calves (n = 90) were enrolled at 6  1 days old and monitored for 28 days, from July to August 2017. Calves were randomly assigned to a control (CTR; n = 45) or a treatment group (SRB; n = 45). The CTR group received milk alone and the SRB group received 120 g of SRB per day in milk to achieve a 10% w/w dose of the total calories. Daily health evaluations were conducted to score health status and disease severity (healthy, slightly affected, moderately or severely sick) of calves, through integrated assessment of diarrhea, dehydration, attitude, and milk intake.

Here, we report that polyethyleneimine-functionalized graphene oxide nanoparticles (GP nanoparticles) showed high antigen-loading capacities and superior immunoenhancing properties. Via a facile electrostatic adsorption approach, influenza hemagglutinin (HA) was incorporated into GP nanoparticles and maintained structural integrity and antigenicity.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the psychological impact of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic and the precautionary measure of social isolation on adults in the Asir region of Saudi Arabia. METHODS: A descriptive cross\\\\sectional survey design was carried out in the Asir region for a period of 5 months from May 2020 to September 2020 to assess the psychological response of the adult population during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic using an anonymous online questionnaire. The questionnaire was adapted from previous research and involved three sections, namely sociodemographic data, Patient Health Questionnaire\\\\9 (PHQ\\\\9) and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD\\\\7 Scale). A total score of 10 indicates depression and anxiety. Data were analysed using SPSS V.25. RESULTS: Females had higher rates of COVID\\\\19 depression than males. There was a significant correlation between age and home setting and anxiety, and a significant association between marital status and the level of education and depression. There was a significant association between gender and depression and anxiety, while there was no significant association between occupation and income, and depression and anxiety. CONCLUSION: The findings of the study clearly show that depression and anxiety are highly prevalent among adults. Females had higher rates of COVID\\\\19 depression and anxiety than males. The findings from this study show that implementing a strategy for the prevention and management of depression and anxiety is highly recommended to minimise the impact of these disorders.","output":"An evaluation of the psychological impact of COVID\\\\19 and the precautionary measure of social isolation on adults in the Asir region, Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Growing concerns about the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) will likely lead to increased mental health diagnoses and treatment. To provide a pre-COVID-19 baseline, we have examined antidepressant prescribing trends for 5 years preceding COVID-19. Methods A retrospective analysis of anonymised data on medicines prescribed by GPs in England from the Open-Prescribing Database (January 2015 to December 2019) identified the 10 most prescribed antidepressant and, for comparison, cardiovascular medicines. Results Prescription items for the 10 most prescribed antidepressants rose 25% from 58 million (2015) to 72 million (2019). Citalopram was the most prescribed antidepressant; prescriptions for sertraline rose fastest at 2 million items year on year. Over the same period, costs for antidepressant prescribing fell 27.8%. Across all Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) in England, antidepressant prescribing levels, adjusted for population were positively correlated with the index of multiple deprivation (IMD) score. In comparison, prescribing for the top 10 most prescribed cardiovascular medicines increased by 2.75% from 207 million (2015) to 213 million (2019) items. Limitations Anonymised data in the Open-Prescribing Database means no patient diagnoses or treatment plans are linked to this data. Conclusion Antidepressant prescribing, particularly sertraline, is increasing. Prescribing is higher in more deprived regions, but costs are falling to < 2% of all items prescribed. Absolute numbers of prescriptions for cardiovascular medicines are higher, likely reflecting the greater prevalence of cardiovascular disease, and are rising more slowly. This study will enable future work to look at the impact of COVID-19 on prescribing for mental health.","output":"An analysis of antidepressant prescribing trends in England 2015C2019."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Endoscopic Zenker diverticulotomy (EZD) is a primary treatment for Zenker diverticulum (ZD). During EZD, the diverticulum is not excised, and interpretation of postoperative videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS) is challenging. The purpose of this investigation was to describe normal VFSS findings status post-successful EZD. METHODS The charts of all patients with ZD treated at our center between October 01, 2011, and May 30, 2014, were abstracted. Outcome measures included recidivistic diverticulum size, Eating Assessment Tool-10 (EAT-10), penetration aspiration scale, pharyngeal constriction ratio (PCR), and pharyngoesophageal segment (PES) opening. RESULTS Twenty patients met inclusion criteria. The mean age was 70.5 ( 13) years. Seventy percent of the patients were male. Mean EAT-10 decreased 72.1% from 17.9 ( 8.2) to 5 ( 6.9) (P < 0.0001), and diverticulum size decreased 50.9% from 1.96 cm ( 0.68) to 0.96 cm ( 0.57) (P < 0.001). The PCR improved 33.6% from 0.17 ( 0.13) to 0.11 ( 0.11) (P < 0.001).

We compared face-to-face and remote settings to ascertain whether remote administration affected performance. Design: We used a longitudinal design for healthy older controls who completed face-to-face neuropsychological assessments between three and four years before taking part remotely. For patients, we used a cross-sectional design, contrasting a prospective remote cohort with a retrospective face-to-face cohort matched in age, education, and disease duration. Setting: Remote assessments were performed using video-conferencing and online testing platforms, with participants using a personal computer or tablet and situated in a quiet room in their own home. Face-to-face assessments were carried out in dedicated testing rooms in our research centre. Participants: The remote cohort comprised ten healthy older controls (also seen face-to-face 3-4 years previously) and 25 patients (n=8 Alzheimer's disease (AD); n=3 behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD); n=4 semantic dementia (SD); n=5 progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA); n=5 logopenic aphasia (LPA)). The face-to-face patient cohort comprised 64 patients (n=25 AD; n=12 bvFTD; n=9 SD; n=12 PNFA; n=6 LPA). Primary and secondary outcome measures: The outcome measures comprised the strength of evidence under a Bayesian analytic framework for differences in performances between face-to-face and remote testing environments on a general neuropsychological (primary outcomes) and neurolingustic battery (secondary outcomes). Results: There was evidence to suggest comparable performance across testing environments for all participant groups, for a range of neuropsychological tasks across both batteries.

It plays a pivotal role in intercellular interactions in neuroinflammation, reduction of vascular oxidative stress, and provides a barrier regulating vascular permeability. In the brain, the glycocalyx is closely related to functions of the blood-brain barrier and neurovascular unit, both responsible for adequate neurovascular responses to potential threats to cerebral homeostasis. An aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) occurs following rupture of an intracranial aneurysm and leads to immediate brain damage (early brain injury). In some cases, this can result in secondary brain damage, also known as delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). DCI is a life-threatening condition that affects up to 30% of all aSAH patients. As such, it is associated with substantial societal and healthcare-related costs. Causes of DCI are multifactorial and thought to involve neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, thrombosis, and neurovascular uncoupling. To date, prediction of DCI is limited, and preventive and effective treatment strategies of DCI are scarce. There is increasing evidence that the glycocalyx is disrupted following an aSAH, and that glycocalyx disruption could precipitate or aggravate DCI. This review explores the potential role of the glycocalyx in the pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to DCI following aSAH. Understanding the role of the glycocalyx in DCI could advance the development of improved methods to predict DCI or identify patients at risk for DCI. This knowledge may also alter the methods and timing of preventive and treatment strategies of DCI. To this end, we review the potential and limitations of methods currently used to evaluate the glycocalyx, and strategies to restore or prevent glycocalyx shedding.","output":"The Role of the Glycocalyx in the Pathophysiology of Subarachnoid Hemorrhage-Induced Delayed Cerebral Ischemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background COVID-19 may be associated with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes in pregnancy, but there is little controlled data to quantify the magnitude of these risks or to characterize the epidemiology and risk factors. Objective To quantify the associations of COVID-19 with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes in pregnancy and to characterize the epidemiology and risk factors. Methods We performed a matched case-control study of pregnant patients with confirmed COVID-19 (cases) who delivered between 16 and 41 weeks gestation from March 11-June 11, 2020. Uninfected pregnant women (controls) were matched to COVID-19 cases on a 2:1 ratio based on delivery date. Maternal demographic characteristics, COVID-19 symptoms, laboratory evaluations, obstetrical and neonatal outcomes, and clinical management were chart abstracted. The primary outcomes included (i) a composite of adverse maternal outcome, defined as preeclampsia, venous thromboembolism, antepartum admission, maternal intensive care unit admission, need for mechanical ventilation, supplemental oxygen, or maternal death; and (ii) a composite of adverse neonatal outcome, defined as respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, five-minute Apgar score <5, persistent category 2 fetal heart rate tracing despite intrauterine resuscitation, or neonatal death. In order to quantify the associations between exposure to mild and severe/critical COVID-19 and adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, unadjusted and adjusted analyses were performed using conditional logistic regression (to account for matching), with matched-pair odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) based on 1000 bias-corrected bootstrap resampling as the effect measure. Associations were adjusted for potential confounders. Results 61 confirmed COVID-19 cases were enrolled during the study period (mild disease: n=54, 88.5%; severe disease: n=6, 9.8%; and critical disease: n=1, 1.6%). The odds of adverse composite maternal outcome were 3.4 times higher among cases compared to controls (18.0% versus 8.2%, adjusted OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.2-13.4). The odds of adverse composite neonatal outcome were 1.7 times higher in the case group compared to the control group (18.0% versus 13.9%, adjusted OR 1.7, 95% CI 0.8-4.8). Stratified analyses by disease severity indicated that the morbidity associated with COVID-19 in pregnancy was largely driven by the severe/critical disease phenotype. Major risk factors for associated morbidity were Black and Hispanic race, advanced maternal age, medical comorbidities, and antepartum admissions related to COVID-19. Conclusions COVID-19 during pregnancy is associated with increased risk for adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, an association that is primarily driven by morbidity associated with severe/critical COVID-19.

Background Since the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, higher education institutions (HEIs) have rapidly adopted e-learning and students are now engaging with e-learning systems. These systems present a new research opportunity for examining the relative efficacy of using e-learning systems versus using IT in traditional classrooms. Although prior research has examined various types of e-learning systems in different contexts and using various methodological approaches, evidence in the literature indicates that the relative efficacy of e-learning remains uncertain as little is known about the factors that affect the adoption and use of e-learning systems during COVID-19, as there is limited academic research. Methodology The model is tested based on the perceptions of a group of 569 students of the adoption of e-learning versus using IT in traditional classrooms in the United Arab Emirates. The data were analyzed with IBM SPSS statistics 26 and partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) implemented in SmartPLS 3 software. Contribution This research contributes to the literature by: (1) extending the UTAUT model to understand students' relative attitudes and relative behavioral intentions towards using e-learning systems;(2) an extension to e-learning studies to examine relative factors affecting the adoption of e-learning systems by comparing the perceptions of the same group of students on e-learning and using IT in a traditional classroom environment in the context of COVID-19;and (3) providing valuable practical implications for HEIs to improve pedagogical approaches and e-learning systems. Findings The findings suggest that relative computer self-efficacy, relative cognitive absorption, relative system interactivity, and relative system functionality each positively influence both relative performance expectancy and relative effort expectancy, which in turn affect relative attitude;and that relative intention to use is positively affected by relative attitude and relative facilitating conditions. Recommendations for Practitioners Firstly, HEIs should feel more confident that e-learning systems indeed provide an appropriate learning approach, demonstrated by a high relative efficacy of e- learning systems perceived by the sample students in this study. Thus, it seems fitting for HEIs to use e-learning systems to enhance the development and delivery of programs and the quality of student experience, especially in the context of COVID-19. Secondly, HEIs wishing to use e-learning systems successfully should at least pay attention to a few key factors to ensure that students will have a positive attitude toward using e-learning systems. Such factors include students' perceived usefulness of e-learning systems, developing encouraging facilitating conditions such as training, technical and IT support, thereby enabling students to use e-learning systems while enjoying their engagement with e-learning systems. Recommendations for Researchers First, this study shows that relative to using IT in a classroom environment, e- learning is favored by the students involved in this research. Second, this re- search indicates the value of examining relative antecedents and relative UTAUT related constructs, evaluating the relative perceptions of students, thereby understanding the relative efficacy of e-learning systems versus using IT in a traditional classroom environment in HEIs. Third, in addition to examining students' perceptions of different learning approaches, or comparing the relative efficacy of different learning approaches based on the perceptions of different groups of students, the relative approach based on comparing the perceptions of the same group of students used in this research could offer a new way to advance our understanding of IT adoption. Finally, this study demonstrates that relative attitude, relative performance expectancy, and relative facilitating conditions are the top three vital factors that affect the adoption and use of e-learning systems during the COVID-19 crisis. Impact on Society The positive result of the students' relative perceptions of e-learning systems suggests that private and public organizations, as well as education policy-makers in providing the learning process, could certainly use e-learning systems as a valuable means of training and/or education, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future Research First, the result of this study is based on data collected from HEIs in the United Arab Emirates. This work could be extended to other HEIs in other countries. Second, this study uses a non-probability sampling approach to collect data, which may limit the validity of the findings. Thus, probability sampling could be an option for future research. Third, this study focuses on developing an understanding of the key relative antecedents that may affect students' relative attitudes and relative intentions to use e-learning systems. There might be other antecedents worth including in future research. Other potential future research may include using the relative approach employed in this study to examine IT adoption, or collecting data from a group of learners on different learning approaches for comparative research, which seems germane to comparing the relative efficacy of different learning modes.","output":"Students' Relative Attitudes and Relative Intentions to Use E-learning Systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate COVID-19 mortality and severity among patients with pre-existing COPD.

For those directly affected by the disease, the stress of facing potential death and overcoming fear can overwhelm their personal coping resources and can lead to symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder and anxiety and depression. The objective of our study was to investigate the effectiveness of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy to reduce anxio-depressive symptoms, distress and fear of the unknown in COVID-19 patients hospitalized for intensive care. A pilot study was conducted with 21 participants hospitalized for COVID-19 (11 women and 10 men) who were treated with EMDR therapy and assessed for anxio-depressive symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS), intensity of distress (Subjective Units of Disturbance, SUD scale), and levels of experienced fear (i.e., fear of the unknown) (Multidimensional Assessment of COVID-19-Related Fears, MAC-RF). After the 4-session treatment, the EMDR therapy showed to be effective in reducing all of the evaluated symptoms in all patients and allowed for stabilization. All patients maintained improved psychological states for one week following the four sessions. EMDR therapy has been shown to be an effective strategy for helping patients process exposure to adverse events by relieving symptoms of acute stress and trauma.

This study aimed to examine the perceived risks of tobacco use on COVID-19 infection and severity, and possible COVID-related changes in perceptions of tobacco use and overall health. METHODS: We conducted an online survey of adults in the United States in June 2020 (n=2097). The survey covered cigarettes, cigars, e-cigarettes, and hookah. We also assessed changes in the use of any of the four tobacco products. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds of agreeing with the perceived risks for each risk and each product, with the adjustment of demographic and COVID-19 related variables. RESULTS: For all four tobacco products, the perceived risks to general health were slightly higher during the pandemic than before the pandemic (77% vs 79.5% for cigarettes) and the perceived risk of COVID-19 severity was larger than the perceived risk of COVID-19 infection (73.3% vs 56.2% for cigarettes). All risk measures varied with tobacco products consistently, with the risks highest for cigarettes, then cigars, followed by e-cigarettes and hookah. Females and people with higher income or education were more likely to endorse the risks of tobacco use than their counterparts. People who perceived higher risks of using cigarettes (OR=1.65; 95% CI: 1.20C2.27) and cigars (OR=1.63; 95% CI: 1.17C2.27) to COVID-19 severity were more likely to have decreased or quit their use. CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco/nicotine use was perceived to increase the risk of COVID-19 severity and the perceived risk of tobacco/nicotine use to general health was high during the pandemic, particularly for cigarettes. The change of perceived risks appeared to be prompting harm-reducing changes in tobacco product use.","output":"Perceived health risks associated with the use of tobacco and nicotine products during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 is a rapidly emerging viral respiratory disease.

The structural and functional characterization of these viral enzymes and the identification of their viral and cellular substrates is providing valuable insights into the biology of viral infections and the host's antiviral defense. Given the growing body of evidence demonstrating their key contribution to pathogenesis, the viral deconjugases are now recognized as attractive targets for the design of novel antiviral therapeutics.","output":"Viral Ubiquitin and Ubiquitin-Like Deconjugases-Swiss Army Knives for Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To identify factors associated with pneumomediastinum during management of connective tissue disease (CTD)-related interstitial lung disease (ILD). METHODS: Patients diagnosed with pneumomediastinum after the initiation of corticosteroid therapy for their CTD-ILD were enrolled. The baseline characteristics of patients who developed pneumomediastinum after the initiation of corticosteroid therapy (n=13, all occurring within 120 days) were compared to those of patients who did not develop pneumomediastinum (n=49). A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with pneumomediastinum. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was also performed to assess the predictive performance. RESULTS: The body mass index (BMI) [odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval (CI)) 0.482 (0.272-0.853)] and serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) [OR (95% CI) 1.013 (1-1.025)] levels at baseline were identified as independent factors associated with pneumomediastinum after corticosteroid initiation. The optimal cut-off points of the BMI and LDH levels for predicting pneumomediastinum development, as estimated by the Youden index, were 20.2 kg/m(2) and 378 U/L, respectively. LDH showed a sensitivity of 61.5% and the highest specificity of 87.8%. Importantly, combining these markers resulted in the highest sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 71.4%.

This is due to the genomic variation observed in the six DTUs of T. cruzi. This work aims to propose a consensus sequence of the enolase protein from different strains of T. cruzi and mainly evaluate its immunogenic properties at the bioinformatic level. From specialized databases, 15 sequences of the enolase gene were aligned to obtain a consensus sequence, where this sequence was modeled and then evaluated and validated through different bioinformatic programs to learn their immunogenic potential. Finally, chimeric peptides were designed with the most representative epitopes. The results showed high immunogenic potential with six epitopes for MHC-I, and seven epitopes for MHC-II, all of which were highly representative of the enolase present in strains from the American continent as well as five epitopes for B cells. Regarding the computational modeling, molecular docking with Toll-like receptors showed a high affinity and low constant of dissociation, which could lead to an innate-type immune response that helps to eliminate the parasite. In conclusion, the consensus sequence proposed for enolase is capable of providing an ideal immune response; however, the experimental evaluation of this enolase consensus and their chimeric peptides should be a high priority to develop a vaccine against Chagas disease.","output":"Consensus Enolase of Trypanosoma Cruzi: Evaluation of Their Immunogenic Properties Using a Bioinformatics Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microsporidia are a large phylum of obligate intracellular parasites.

Data collected included patient demographics, COVID-19 status, reason for consult, location of consult, type of consult, procedures performed, need for surgical intervention, length of hospital stay and recommended follow up. RESULTS: Patient populations in the pre-COVID-era and COVID-era were similar in terms of their distribution of demographics and chief complaints. Craniofacial trauma was the most common reason for consultation in both periods, followed by vocal fold and airway-related consults. We saw a 21.5% decrease in the rate of consults seen per month during the COVID-era compared to the 6 months prior.

In this study, we developed a cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)-based group telemedicine model and will investigate effectiveness and implementability in a multicentre randomised controlled trial. METHODS: A total of 220 participants will be recruited from the social networks of eight sites in Indonesia: three hospitals, two primary healthcare centres and three rehabilitation centres. The intervention arm will participate in a relapse prevention programme called the Indonesia Drug Addiction Relapse Prevention Programme (Indo-DARPP), a newly developed 12-week module based on CBT and motivational interviewing constructed in the Indonesian context. The programme will be delivered by a healthcare provider and a peer counsellor in a group therapy setting via video-conferencing, as a supplement to participants usual treatments. The control arm will continue treatment as usual. The primary outcome will be the percentage increase in days of abstinence from the primarily used substance in the past 28 days. Secondary outcomes will include addiction severity, quality of life, motivation to change, psychiatric symptoms, cognitive function, coping, and internalised stigma.

Given the rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic many changes were rapidly adopted and were not substantiated by robust evidence. This study aimed to describe the changes adopted internationally to chemotherapy services, which may be used to guide future changes to treatment delivery. METHODS: A survey was developed to understand the impact of COVID-19 on the delivery of systemic anti-cancer therapies (SACT).

Several studies provide evidence for an association between MAFLD and atherosclerosis and cardio-metabolic disorders, including CVDs such as coronary heart disease and stroke. Therefore, the combination of MAFLD/NASH is associated with vascular risk and CVD progression, but the underlying mechanisms linking MAFLD/NASH and CVD are still under investigation. Several underlying mechanisms may probably be involved, including hepatic/systemic insulin resistance, atherogenic dyslipidemia, hypertension, as well as pro-atherogenic, pro-coagulant, and pro-inflammatory mediators released from the steatotic/inflamed liver. MAFLD is strongly associated with insulin resistance, which is involved in its pathogenesis and progression to NASH. Insulin resistance is a major cardiovascular risk factor in subjects without diabetes. However, T2D has been considered the most common link between MAFLD/NASH and CVD.

However, there has been limited comparison of antibody titers against various spike protein antigens among COVID-19 infected patients. METHODS: We compared four spike proteins (RBD, S1, S2 and a stabilized spike trimer (ST)) representing commonly used antigens for their reactivity to human IgG antibodies using indirect ELISA in serum from COVID-19 patients and pre-2020 samples. ST ELISA was also compared against the EUROIMMUN IgG ELISA test. Further, we estimated time appropriate IgG and IgA seropositivity rates in COVID-19 patients using a panel of sera samples collected longitudinally from the day of onset of symptoms (DOS). RESULTS: Among the four spike antigens tested, the ST demonstrated the highest sensitivity (86.2%; 95% CI: 77.8-91.7%), while all four antigens showed high specificity to COVID-19 sera (94.7-96.8%). 13.8% (13/94) of the samples did not show seroconversion in any of the four antigen-based assays. In a double-blinded head-to-head comparison, ST based IgG ELISA displayed a better sensitivity (87.5%, 95%CI: 76.4-93.8%) than the EUROIMMUN IgG ELISA (67.9%, 95% CI: 54.8-78.6%). Further, in ST-based assays, we found 48% and 50% seroconversion in the first six days (from DOS) for IgG and IgA antibodies, respectively, which increased to 84% (IgG) and 85% (IgA) for samples collected 22 days from DOS.

Thus, this paper aims to assess the clinical and psychological characteristics of eating disorder (ED) patients, looking for differences between patients without a history of trauma and patients with trauma experiences, as well as at possible differences between exposure in childhood, adulthood, or repeated events. Another aim of the paper is to evaluate the possible mediation role of cognitive schemas and personality traits in the relationship between early trauma and eating psychopathology. Methods: From January to November 2020, 115 consecutive inpatients admitted for a specific multidisciplinary ED treatment in a dedicated Unit were evaluated for trauma, differentiating between trauma occurring in childhood and adulthood. The subjects were evaluated for early maladaptive schemas (EMS), personality traits, trauma symptomatology, quality of life, and specific psychopathologies linked to EDs. Mediation analyses between childhood and adulthood trauma and eating psychopathology were performed, with EMS and personality traits as mediators. Results: Patients with a history of trauma showed higher physical and psychological symptomatology scores, with a more impaired clinical profile in patients with both childhood and adulthood trauma exposure. The mediation analysis showed a specific mediator role for the disconnection and rejection (DR) EMS factor in the relationship between childhood trauma (cT) and eating psychopathology. Conclusion: Trauma experiences are associated with more severe clinical symptomatology in EDs and may need a specific assessment in patients with failed outpatient standard treatments. Specific cognitive schemas linked to DR domain should be evaluated in treatments for ED patients with history of trauma due to the mediation role between trauma and eating psychopathology.

Previous studies have demonstrated that interactions between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and lifestyle interventions such as food and exercise may vary metabolic outcomes, contributing to obesity. However, there is a paucity of research relating outcomes from digital therapeutics to the inclusion of genetic data in care interventions. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe and model the weight loss of participants enrolled in a precision digital weight loss program informed by the machine learning analysis of their data, including genomic data. It was hypothesized that weight loss models would exhibit a better fit when incorporating genomic data versus demographic and engagement variables alone. METHODS: A cohort of 393 participants enrolled in Digbi Healths personalized digital care program for 120 days was analyzed retrospectively. The care protocol used participant data to inform precision coaching by mobile app and personal coach. Linear regression models were fit of weight loss (pounds lost and percentage lost) as a function of demographic and behavioral engagement variables. Genomic-enhanced models were built by adding 197 SNPs from participant genomic data as predictors and refitted using Lasso regression on SNPs for variable selection. Success or failure logistic regression models were also fit with and without genomic data. RESULTS: Overall, 72.0% (n=283) of the 393 participants in this cohort lost weight, whereas 17.3% (n=68) maintained stable weight. A total of 142 participants lost 5% bodyweight within 120 days. Models described the impact of demographic and clinical factors, behavioral engagement, and genomic risk on weight loss. Incorporating genomic predictors improved the mean squared error of weight loss models (pounds lost and percent) from 70 to 60 and 16 to 13, respectively. The logistic model improved the pseudo R(2) value from 0.193 to 0.285. Gender, engagement, and specific SNPs were significantly associated with weight loss. SNPs within genes involved in metabolic pathways processing food and regulating fat storage were associated with weight loss in this cohort: rs17300539_G (insulin resistance and monounsaturated fat metabolism), rs2016520_C (BMI, waist circumference, and cholesterol metabolism), and rs4074995_A (calcium-potassium transport and serum calcium levels). The models described greater average weight loss for participants with more risk alleles. Notably, coaching for dietary modification was personalized to these genetic risks. CONCLUSIONS: Including genomic information when modeling outcomes of a digital precision weight loss program greatly enhanced the model accuracy. Interpretable weight loss models indicated the efficacy of coaching informed by participants genomic risk, accompanied by active engagement of participants in their own success.

Since the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002, extensive structural analyses have revealed key atomic-level interactions between the SARS-CoV spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV. Here, we analyzed the potential receptor usage by 2019-nCoV, based on the rich knowledge about SARS-CoV and the newly released sequence of 2019-nCoV. First, the sequence of 2019-nCoV RBD, including its receptor-binding motif (RBM) that directly contacts ACE2, is similar to that of SARS-CoV, strongly suggesting that 2019-nCoV uses ACE2 as its receptor. Second, several critical residues in 2019-nCoV RBM (particularly Gln493) provide favorable interactions with human ACE2, consistent with 2019-nCoV's capacity for human cell infection. Third, several other critical residues in 2019-nCoV RBM (particularly Asn501) are compatible with, but not ideal for, binding human ACE2, suggesting that 2019-nCoV has acquired some capacity for human-to-human transmission. Last, while phylogenetic analysis indicates a bat origin of 2019-nCoV, 2019-nCoV also potentially recognizes ACE2 from a diversity of animal species (except mice and rats), implicating these animal species as possible intermediate hosts or animal models for 2019-nCoV infections.

Our decade-long structural studies on the receptor recognition by SARS-CoV have identified key interactions between SARS-CoV spike protein and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV. One of the goals of SARS-CoV research was to build an atomic-level iterative framework of virus-receptor interactions to facilitate epidemic surveillance, predict species-specific receptor usage, and identify potential animal hosts and animal models of viruses.

As for other innovative nanopharmaceuticals (NPhs), the advancement of robust methods to assess their quality and safety profiles-in line with regulatory needs-is critical for facilitating their development and clinical translation. Asymmetric-flow field-flow fractionation coupled to multiple online optical detectors (MD-AF4) is considered a very versatile and robust approach for the physical characterisation of nanocarriers, and has been used successfully for measuring particle size, polydispersity and physical stability of lipid-based systems, including liposomes and solid lipid nanoparticles. However, the unique core structure of LNP-RNA, composed of ionizable lipids electrostatically complexed with RNA, and the relatively labile lipid-monolayer coating, is more prone to destabilization during focusing in MD-AF4 than previously characterised nanoparticles, resulting in particle aggregation and sample loss. Hence characterisation of LNP-RNA by MD-AF4 needs significant adaptation of the methods developed for liposomes. To improve the performance of MD-AF4 applied to LNP-RNA in a systematic and comprehensive manner, we have explored the use of the frit-inlet channel where, differently from the standard AF4 channel, the particles are relaxed hydrodynamically as they are injected. The absence of a focusing step minimizes contact between the particle and the membrane, reducing artefacts (e.g. sample loss, particle aggregation). Separation in a frit-inlet channel enables satisfactory reproducibility and acceptable sample recovery in the commercially available MD-AF4 instruments. In addition to slice-by-slice measurements of particle size, MD-AF4 also allows to determine particle concentration and the particle size distribution, demonstrating enhanced versatility beyond standard sizing measurements.","output":"Improved multidetector asymmetrical-flow field-flow fractionation method for particle sizing and concentration measurements of lipid-based nanocarriers for RNA delivery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing allows quantitative determination of disease prevalence, which is especially important in high-risk communities We performed anonymized convenience sampling of 200 currently asymptomatic residents of Chelsea, the epicenter of COVID-19 illness in Massachusetts, by BioMedomics SARS-CoV-2 combined IgM-IgG point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay The seroprevalence was 31 5% (17 5% IgM+IgG+, 9 0% IgM+IgG-, and 5 0% IgM-IgG+) Of the 200 participants, 50 5% reported no symptoms in the preceding 4 weeks, of which 24 8% (25/101) were seropositive, and 60% of these were IgM+IgG- These data are the highest seroprevalence rates observed to date and highlight the significant burden of asymptomatic infection","output":"High seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Chelsea, Massachusetts, USA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED) is a rare clinical entity.

We describe a retrospective observational study examining the utility of repeat nasopharyngeal (NP) SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing at an academic center in a low prevalence setting. METHODS: All patients within our health system with >1 NP SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test result were included. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing was performed according to one of four validated assays. Key clinical and demographic data was collected including whether the patient was inpatient or outpatient at time of the test and whether the test was performed as part of a person under investigation (PUI) for possible COVID-19 or for asymptomatic screening. RESULTS: A total of 660 patients had >1 NP SARS-CoV-2 PCR test performed. The initial test was negative in 638. There were only 6 negative-to-positive conversions (0.9%). All 6 were outpatients undergoing a PUI work-up 5-17 days after an initial negative result.

However, the American Association of Blood Banks and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have not recommended any specific SARS-CoV-2-related actions to be taken at blood collection centres at this time. In this report, we describe a case of a 21-year-old man with very severe aplastic anaemia who received apheresis platelet transfusion from an individual who was subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19. Our patient tested negative for COVID-19 and is awaiting allogeneic stem cell transplantation.","output":"COVID-19 transmission and blood transfusion: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Acute myocardial injury and heart failure characterized by elevated cardiac troponin and decreased heart pump function are significant clinical features and prognostic factors of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Triglyceride to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TG/HDL-C) ratio is an indicator of insulin resistance. This study aimed to explore the association of the TG/HDL-C ratio with cardiovascular risk and prognosis in COVID-19. METHODS: Ninety-eight laboratory-confirmed patients with COVID-19 admitted in a tertiary teaching hospital in Wuhan, China, were enrolled in this retrospective study. Regression models were used to investigate the association between TG/HDL-C ratio with myocardial injury, heart failure, severity, and mortality in COVID-19. RESULTS: Among the 98 patients, the mean age was 63.91.4 years, and male sex (58, 59%) was predominant. Forty-six patients (47%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), 32 (33%) and 46 (47%) patients suffered from myocardial injury and heart failure, respectively, and 36 (37%) patients died. The TG/HDL-C ratio was increased in patients with myocardial injury, heart failure, severe illness, and fatal outcome (P<0.05 for each). Baseline TG/HDL-C ratio significantly correlated with log transformed levels of plasma high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (r=0.251, P=0.018), N-terminal brain natriuretic propeptide (r=0.274, P=0.008), glycated hemoglobin (r=0.239, P=0.038), and interleukin-6 (r=0.218, P=0.042). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that an increased TG/HDL-C ratio was independently associated with the risk of myocardial injury [odds ratio (OR)=2.73; P=0.013], heart failure (OR=2.64; P=0.019), disease severity (OR=3.01; P=0.032), and fatal outcome (OR=2.97; P=0.014). CONCLUSION: Increased TG/HDL-C ratio was independently associated with myocardial injury, heart failure, disease severity, and mortality in patients with COVID-19, and it may be a useful marker for early identification of patients with high risk and poor outcome.","output":"Triglyceride to High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Ratio is an Important Determinant of Cardiovascular Risk and Poor Prognosis in Coronavirus Disease-19: A Retrospective Case Series Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Can models with particular structure avoid being biased towards spurious correlation in out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization?

This pandemic has devastating effects on societies and economies around the world, and poor countries and continents are likely to face particularly serious and long-lasting damage, which could lead to large epidemic outbreaks because of the lack of financial and health resources. The increasing number of COVID-19 tests gives more information about the epidemic spread, and this can help contain the spread to avoid more infection. As COVID-19 keeps spreading, medical products, especially those needed to perform blood tests, will become scarce as a result of the high demand and insufficient supply and logistical means. However, technological tests based on deep learning techniques and medical images could be useful in fighting this pandemic. In this perspective, we propose a COVID-19 disease diagnosis (CDD) tool that implements a deep learning technique to provide automatic symptoms checking and COVID-19 detection. Our CDD scheme implements two main steps. First, the patient's symptoms are checked, and the infection probability is predicted. Then, based on the infection probability, the patient's lungs will be diagnosed by an automatic analysis of X-ray or computerized tomography (CT) images, and the presence of the infection will be accordingly confirmed or not.

The primary and secondary outcomes were mortality and severe COVID-19, respectively. RESULTS: We included 25 studies with 22,734 COVID-19 patients, and we compared the outcomes between patients who did and did not receive ACEIs/ARBs. The use of ACEIs/ARBs was not associated with higher risks of severe disease (OR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.63, 1.15, I2=38.55%), mechanical ventilation (OR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.61, 1.16, I2=3.19%), dialysis (OR = 1.24, 95% CI: 0.09, 2.39, I2=0.00%), or the length of hospital stay (SMD = 0.05, 95% CI: -0.16, 0.26, I2=84.43%) in COVID-19 patients.

During the formation of the Global Fund, necessary anti-corruption, transparency, and accountability (ACTA) structures were not put in place to prevent fraud and corruption in its grants, which resulted in the misuse of funds by grant recipients and an eventual loss of donor confidence in 2011. The Global Fund has instituted various ACTA mechanisms to address this misuse of funding and the subsequent loss of donor confidence, and this paper seeks to understand these implementations and their impacts over the past decade, in an effort to probe ACTA more deeply. RESULTS By restructuring the governing committees in 2011, and the Audit and Finance; Ethics and Governance; and Strategy Committees in 2016, the Global Fund has delineated committee mandates and strengthened the Board's oversight of operations. Additionally, the Global Fund has adopted a rigorous risk management framework which it has worked into all aspects of its functioning. An Ethics and Integrity Framework was adopted in 2014 and an Ethics Office was established in 2016, resulting in increased conflict of interest disclosures and greater considerations of ethics within the organization. The Global Fund's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) has effectively performed internal and external audits and investigations on fraud and corruption, highlighted potential risks for mitigation, and has implemented ACTA initiatives, such as the I Speak Out Now! campaign to encourage whistleblowing and educate on fraud and corruption. CONCLUSIONS From 2011 onwards, the Global Fund has developed a number of ACTA mechanisms which, in particular, resulted in reduced grant-related risks and procurement fraud as demonstrated by the decreased classification from high to moderate in 2017, and the reduction of investigations in 2018 respectively. However, it is crucial that the Global Fund continues to evaluate the effectiveness of these mechanisms; monitor for potential perverse impacts; and make necessary changes, when and where they are needed.","output":"The Global Fund: why anti-corruption, transparency and accountability matter."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is a postnatal withdrawal syndrome that most commonly results from prenatal opioid exposure. Every 15 minutes, an infant is born in the United States with signs of NAS. The field lacks a standardized clinical definition of NAS, complicating discussions on programmatic and policy development to support opioid-exposed mothers and infants. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this paper is to describe a protocol for a systematic expert panel process to inform the development of a clinical definition of NAS. METHODS: We will conduct two three-round online modified-Delphi panels using the ExpertLens system and will follow the recommendations for Conducting and REporting of DElphi Studies (CREDES). One panel will focus on developing key components of a clinical definition of NAS, and the second panel will focus on neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS), which is a term that has come into use to differentiate opioid-exposed infants from infants exposed to other substances in utero. However, there is lack of agreement on the precise clinical definition of NOWS and how it is distinct from or overlaps with NAS. Each panel will complete two rating rounds and a discussion round using a similar protocol. We will analyze all rating data descriptively and determine the presence of agreement within and between the two panels. We will also perform thematic analysis of the qualitative comments to contextualize the panel findings. RESULTS: The panels were convened between October 29 and December 17, 2020. Their results were disseminated and discussed at a national conference on NAS that took place on March 17-18, 2021.

We examined publically available time-series data of laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, the causal agent for COVID-19, to try to explore, using a Bayesian approach, about the sensitivity and specificity of the PCR-based diagnostic test. Data originated from Alberta, Canada (available on 3/28/2020) and city of Philadelphia, USA (available on 3/31/2020). Our analysis revealed that the data were compatible with near-perfect specificity but it was challenging to gain information about sensitivity (prior and posterior largely overlapped). We applied these insights to uncertainty/bias analysis of epidemic curves into jurisdictions under the assumptions of both improving and degrading sensitivity. If the sensitivity improved from 60 to 95%, the observed and adjusted epidemic curves likely fall within the 95% confidence intervals of the observed counts. However, bias in the shape and peak of the epidemic curves can be pronounced, if sensitivity either degrades or remains poor in the 60C70% range. In the extreme scenario, hundreds of undiagnosed cases, even among tested, are possible, potentially leading to further unchecked contagion should these cases not self-isolate.

Samples were taken at the time of diagnosis and analyzed via flow cytometry within 24 h. The participants' demographic data and initial laboratory tests were also recorded. In total, 33 patients with COVID-19 (mean age = 45.4  17.2) and 25 controls (mean age = 43.4  17.4) participated in the study. All patients were identified as having mild (16), moderate (5), or severe (12) disease severity. Both early and late apoptotic cells in B and T lymphocytes were increased in all patients with COVID-19 (p < .05). Early apoptotic (EA) B and T lymphocytes were also higher in severe cases compared to mild cases (p = .026). There was no significant difference between lymphopenia and apoptosis in patients with COVID-19. However, patients with lymphopenia (n = 14) and severe COVID-19 (p = .013) had increased EA T lymphocytes.

At present, little is known about the disease, and vaccines are still under development. Therefore, in the face of severe outbreaks, previous effective experience can help people better protect themselves and their families. The aim of this article is to discuss the social distancing measures for COVID-19. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Literature and document search. RESULTS: Recent research and a novel coronavirus pneumonia prediction model revealed social distancing measures and wearing masks are required to mitigate hospital system overload and prevent pathogen exposure. After a series of social distancing measures, there are 309 cities with zero cases and 34 cities with confirmed cases in China as of April 13, 2020. CONCLUSION: From China's experience with novel coronavirus pneumonia, we know that social distancing is the most effective measure at present.

Methods: This study prospectively enrolled 594 patients hospitalized with influenza-like illness (ILI) and laboratory-confirmed RSV, hMPV, or influenza infections over three consecutive influenza seasons at a tertiary hospital in China. Results: While certain clinical features were of value as predictors of infection type, none exhibited good predictive performance as a means of discriminating between these three infections (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve < 0.70). After controlling for potential confounding variables, RSV infections in pneumonia patients were found to be associated with a 30-day mortality risk comparable to that of influenza patients [odds ratio (OR) 1.016, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.267-3.856, p = 0.982], whereas hMPV infection was associated with a reduced risk of mortality (OR 0.144, 95% CI 0.027-0.780, p = 0.025). Among those without pneumonia, the 30-day mortality risk in patients with influenza was comparable to that in patients infected with RSV (OR 1.268, 95% CI 0.172-9.355, p = 0.816) or hMPV (OR 1.128, 95% CI 0.122-10.419, p = 0.916).

The present study aims to conduct an online survey to investigate the psychological status of high school students in Shandong Province. Methods: Using a web-based cross-sectional survey, data was collected from 1,018 voluntary high school students assessed with demographic information, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and a self-designed online-study effect survey. Correlation analysis was performed to explore the relationships between depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and study effect. Result: The prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and a combination of depressive and anxiety symptoms was 52.4, 31.4, and 26.8%, respectively, among high school students in Shandong Province during the COVID-19 epidemic. And from moderate to severe severity level, the rates of depressive symptoms and anxious symptoms were 17.6 and 4.6%. Female students exhibited a higher rate and severity of mental symptoms than male, and grade one senior high school students got a higher rate and severity of mental symptoms than the other two grades.

The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein promotes entry into host cells and is the main target of neutralizing antibodies. Here we describe multiple monoclonal antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 S identified from memory B cells of a SARS survivor infected in 2003. One antibody, named S309, potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV pseudoviruses as well as authentic SARS-CoV-2 by engaging the S receptor-binding domain. Using cryo-electron microscopy and binding assays, we show that S309 recognizes a glycan-containing epitope that is conserved within the sarbecovirus subgenus, without competing with receptor attachment. Antibody cocktails including S309 along with other antibodies identified here further enhanced SARS-CoV-2 neutralization and may limit the emergence of neutralization-escape mutants. These results pave the way for using S309 and S309-containing antibody cocktails for prophylaxis in individuals at high risk of exposure or as a post-exposure therapy to limit or treat severe disease.","output":"Structural and functional analysis of a potent sarbecovirus neutralizing antibody"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine has been theorized to provide protection against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Our aim was to determine whether any MMR IgG titers are inversely correlated with severity in recovered COVID-19 patients previously vaccinated with MMR II We divided 80 subjects into two groups, comparing MMR titers to recent COVID-19 severity levels The MMR II group consisted of 50 subjects who would primarily have MMR antibodies from the MMR II vaccine, and a comparison group of 30 subjects consisted of those who would primarily have MMR antibodies from sources other than MMR II, including prior measles, mumps, and/or rubella illnesses There was a significant inverse correlation (r(s) = -0 71, P &lt; 0 001) between mumps virus titers (mumps titers) and COVID-19 severity within the MMR II group There were no significant correlations between mumps titers and severity in the comparison group, between mumps titers and age in the MMR II group, or between severity and measles or rubella titers in either group Within the MMR II group, mumps titers of 134 to 300 arbitrary units (AU)/ml (n = 8) were found only in those who were functionally immune or asymptomatic;all with mild symptoms had mumps titers below 134 AU/ml (n = 17);all with moderate symptoms had mumps titers below 75 AU/ml (n = 11);all who had been hospitalized and had required oxygen had mumps titers below 32 AU/ml (n = 5) Our results demonstrate that there is a significant inverse correlation between mumps titers from MMR II and COVID-19 severity IMPORTANCE COVID-19 has presented various paradoxes that, if understood better, may provide clues to controlling the pandemic, even before a COVID-19 vaccine is widely available First, young children are largely spared from severe disease Second, numerous countries have COVID-19 death rates that are as low as 1% of the death rates of other countries Third, many people, despite prolonged close contact with someone who is COVID-19 positive, never test positive themselves Fourth, nearly half of people who test positive for COVID-19 are asymptomatic Some researchers have theorized that the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine may be responsible for these disparities The significance of our study is that it showed that mumps titers related to the MMR II vaccine are significantly and inversely correlated with the severity of COVID-19-related symptoms, supporting the theorized association between the MMR vaccine and COVID-19 severity","output":"Analysis of Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) Titers of Recovered COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the last decade, the Internet of Things (IoT) domain has grown dramatically, from ultra-low-power hardware design to cloud-based solutions, and now, with the rise of 5G technology, a new horizon for edge computing on IoT devices will be introduced.

While there have been reports and studies on this procedure, none has suggested the possibility of doing repeated hepatic resections via a single incision. This report on three such cases aims to determine the feasibility and safety of this approach for such patients. Three patients who had previously had liver resections underwent single-incision laparoscopic hepatic resection in our center. Patient demographics, type of port and instruments used, operating time, complications and incision length were collected. The operating time in each case was less than 230 min. The incision length for the single-port device was 3.5 cm or less. The length of hospital stay was less than 5 days in each case. Intra-operative blood loss was limited to 250 mL in each case. There were no immediate postoperative complications related to hepatic resection. Single-incision laparoscopic hepatic resection is feasible for selected patients who have had previous hepatic resections. Because the port entry site for the single-incision laparoscopic approach is usually slightly larger than that for the conventional approach, it is safer in re-resection cases where there may be adhesions from previous surgery. Other possible benefits, such as cosmesis and reduced port-associated morbidity, are mainly related to the use of only one small incision.","output":"Single-incision laparoscopic hepatic resection in patients with previous hepatic resections: a mini case series."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: World Health Organization has reported fifty countries have now detected the new coronavirus (B.1.1.7 variant) since a couple of months ago.

Therefore, this study aims to create a forecast analysis regarding the occasions of COVID-19 and B.1.1.7 cases based on data from the 1st January to 18th March 2021, and also analyze the association between meteorological factors with B.1.1.7 incidences in three different provinces of Indonesia such as the West Java, South Sumatra and East Kalimantan. METHODS: We used the Autoregressive Moving Average Models (ARIMA) to forecast the number of cases in the upcoming 14 days and the Spearman correlation analysis to analyze the relationship between B.1.1.7 cases and meteorological variables such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, sunshine, and wind speed. RESULTS: The results of the study showed the fitted ARIMA models forecasted there was an increase in the daily cases in three provinces. The total cases in three provinces would increase by 36% (West Java), 13.5% (South Sumatra), and 30% (East Kalimantan) as compared with actual cases until the end of 14 days later.

METHODS: McMaster Universitys Department of Medicine undertook surveys and analyses to determine whether there was inequity in leadership positions and salaries, or unprofessional behaviour within the department. Measures of academic productivity in relation to gender for both educators and researchers were analyzed. The department began shifting policies to foster greater gender diversity and inclusion. A revision of the leadership selection process, incorporating tenets of equity and a new game theoryCbased strategy called Diversitive Agreement Versus Nash Equilibrium (DAvNE) was evaluated. RESULTS: The departments survey revealed underrepresentation of women and people of colour in leadership positions, with perceived barriers to their promotion. Both women and people of colour reported experiencing unprofessional behaviour directed toward them. A gender gap in base salary was observed, with female full professors being paid less. No difference in academic productivity was seen between male and female educators or researchers. The leadership competitions conducted under new selection processes emphasizing diversity resulted in 66% of participating women securing a leadership position, in comparison to 25% of participating men. People of colour made up 27% of members participating in these leadership competitions, but none was successful in obtaining a position.

METHODS: Confirmed patients with COVID-19 (n = 60) were recruited retrospectively from Musashino Red Cross Hospital. The factors of liver injury especially on the elevation of liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) were analyzed. Grading was assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. RESULTS: During a median hospitalization follow-up of 15 (4C41) days, 51 (85.0%) patients had COVID-19 pneumonia.

Results suggest that people tended to cycle more often after the lockdown than before. For every five cyclists, two cycled more frequently while two others maintained their cycling frequency. Most cycling trips were recreational or to exercise, and these increased after the lockdown, while trips for work and school decreased, as expected. Moreover, the lower the individuals cycling frequency levels before the lockdown, the more they cycled after it. Our study diagnoses the impact of the lockdown on cycling habits, indicating an overall propensity to cycling more by the Lisbon citizens.

METHODS: Guided by Person-Based Approach (PBA) and Biopsychosocial Model, the MSW|PC was adapted by combining evidence from the literature, an expert group (n = 27: patients, partners, and HPs working in cancer care) and the research team. New content was developed relevant for a mixed cancer population. The Maximising Sexual Wellbeing| Cancer Care (MSW|CC) eLearning prototype was usability tested and modified with HPs using think aloud interviews (n = 18). RESULTS: Many identified sexual challenges were common across cancer populations, with additional information required for breast, colorectal, gynaecological, head and neck, and prostate cancers. During the testing phase, navigational difficulties were identified and resolved. HPs reported the MSW|CC as engaging, informative, and relevant with helpful communication and signposting tools to support practice. CONCLUSION: This systematic and iterative PBA yielded important insights to enhance the content and usability of MSW|CC.

The causative agent for COVID-19 identified as a novel strain of beta coronavirus named nSARS-CoV-2. The nSARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the respiratory tract and results in severe acute respiratory distress (ARDS), leading to the collapse of the respiratory tract. The virus internalizes primarily via ACEII receptor, and many tissues reported a significant level of expression of ACEII receptor including lungs, hearts, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are diverse, but growing evidence suggests that gut dysbiosis is one of them and poses a threat to native immunity. The human microbial ecology plays a vital role in human physiology, including building immunity. The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) habitats trillions of beneficial microbes precisely bacterial species synchronize with human physiology and remain symbiotic. On the contrary, harmful microbiota seeks an opportunity to break the equilibrium failure of balance between beneficial and detrimental human gut microbiota results in impaired physiology and immunity. The grown research evidence demonstrated that infection caused by the nSARS-CoV-2 result in moderate to severe diarrheal outcomes. The diarrheal conditions in COVID-19 patients are due to alteration of gut microbial ecology. The management of COVID-19 requires specialized therapeutics along with a series of nutraceuticals. Probiotics remain vital nutrient supplements in COVID-19 management, offer relief in diarrhea and improve/restore immunity.

Due to a lack of available real-world data, we assessed its effectiveness and safety in moderately to critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted in two public/specialty hospitals in Saudi Arabia. We included patients 18 years) admitted AprilCAugust 2020 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnosed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal swab. Patients received either favipiravir (1800 mg or 1600 mg twice daily loading dose, followed by 800 mg or 600 mg twice daily) or supportive-care treatment. Patients were excluded if they were outside the study period, classified as having a mild form of the disease per WHO criteria, or had an incomplete patient file. KaplanCMeier (KM) models were used to estimate median time to discharge. Discharge ratios, progression to mechanical ventilation, and mortality outcomes were estimated across the severity spectrum using Cox proportional-hazards models. As a sensitivity analysis, we performed propensity score-matching (PSM) analysis. RESULTS: Overall, median time to discharge was 10 days (95%CI = 9C10) in the favipiravir arm versus 15 days (95%CI = 14C16) in the supportive-care arm. The accelerated discharge benefit was seen across the COVID-19 spectrum of severity. The adjusted discharge ratio was 1.96 (95%CI = 1.56C2.46). Progression to mechanical ventilation was slower with favipiravir (HR(adj) = 0.10, 95%CI = 0.04C0.29). There was no significant effect on mortality (HR(adj) = 1.56, 95%CI = 0.73C3.36). There was a statistically non-significant trend toward worse outcomes in the critical category (HR(adj) = 2.80, 95%CI = 0.99C7.89). Age was an independent risk factor for mortality in mechanically ventilated patients. PSM analyses confirmed these findings. CONCLUSION: Favipiravir was associated with clinical benefits, including accelerated discharge rate and less progression to mechanical ventilation; however, no overall mortality benefits were seen across the severity spectrum.","output":"Effectiveness and safety of favipiravir compared to supportive care in moderately to critically ill COVID-19 patients: a retrospective study with propensity score matching sensitivity analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We compared the expressions of class I and class II major histocompatibility antigen complex (MHC) on the surface of Jijoye and P3HR\\\\1 cells of Burkitt's lymphoma sublines.

We conducted a cross-sectional study of Japanese citizens aged 20-65 years using an online self-administered questionnaire in December 2020. Logistic regression analysis was performed. Among 27,036 participants (13,814 men and 13,222 women), the percentage who were willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine was lower among women than among men (33.0% vs. 41.8%). Age and education level showed a gender gap regarding the association with willingness to get the COVID-19 vaccine: men who were older or had a higher level of education were more willing to get the vaccine, whereas women aged 30-49 years and those with a higher level of education showed a relatively low willingness to get the vaccine. For both men and women, marriage, higher annual household income, underlying disease, current smoking, vaccination for influenza during the current season, and fear of COVID-19 transmission were linked to a higher likelihood of being willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine. These findings give important insight into identifying target groups in need of intervention regarding COVID-19 vaccination, especially among women.

These people were advised to strictly self-isolate (shield) at the start of the pandemic, except for necessary healthcare. We examined who was identified as clinically extremely vulnerable, how their healthcare changed during isolation, and whether this process exacerbated healthcare inequalities. MethodsWe linked those on the shielding register in NHS Grampian, a health authority in Scotland, to healthcare records from 2015-2020. We described the source of identification, demographics, and clinical history of the cohort. We measured changes in out-patient, in-patient, and emergency healthcare during isolation in the shielding population and compared to the general non-shielding population. ResultsThe register included 16,092 people (3% of the population), clinically vulnerable primarily due to a respiratory disease, immunosuppression, or cancer. Among them, 42% were not identified by national healthcare record screening but added ad hoc, with these additions including more children and fewer economically-deprived. During isolation, all forms of healthcare use decreased (25%-46%), with larger decreases in scheduled care than in emergency care. However, people shielding had better maintained scheduled care compared to the non-shielding general population: out-patient visits decreased 35% vs 49%; in-patient visits decreased 46% vs 81%. Notably, there was substantial variation in whose scheduled care was maintained during isolation: younger people and those with cancer had significantly higher visit rates, but there was no difference between sexes or socioeconomic levels. ConclusionsHealthcare changed dramatically for the clinically extremely vulnerable population during the pandemic. The increased reliance on emergency care while isolating indicates that continuity of care for existing conditions was not optimal. However, compared to the general population, there was success in maintaining scheduled care, particularly in young people and those with cancer. We suggest that integrating demographic and primary care data would improve identification of the clinically vulnerable and could aid prioritising their care.","output":"The clinically extremely vulnerable to COVID: Identification and changes in health care while self-isolating (shielding) during the coronavirus pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The corona pandemic poses enormous financial challenges for hospitals. Using the example of a clinic for visceral, transplantation, thorax and vascular surgery (VTTG), the performance development of inpatient care in the first 7 weeks in comparison to the previous year as well as an evaluation of the compensation measures laid down by law were evaluated. METHODOLOGY: Based on the performance figures, a comparison was made between the period from 16 March to 3 May 2019 and the same period in 2020. Changes in the number of cases, case mix, case mix index and day mix index as well as the bed occupancy days were recorded. The monetary measures from the COVID-19 Hospital Relief Act were applied to these changes and the adequacy was evaluated. RESULTS: Compared to the previous year there was a decrease in inpatient admissions of 120 patients during the observation period. As a result there was a decrease of 370 points in case mix and 1433 days of occupancy. For the whole VTTG this resulted in a decrease in revenue of approximately 0.8a?million ?, which was completely compensated by the flat rate payment for empty beds. The individual areas of the VTTG showed a heterogeneous picture in relation to the compensation for the loss of revenue. Elective units in particular showed a shortfall up to 128,163a?? with respect to inpatient treatment for 7 weeks. CONCLUSION: The measures taken by the Government are an important support for the economic security of German hospitals. The lack of differentiation of measures by specialty leads to a heterogeneous picture in compensation for VTTG revenues and has to be understood as an alarm signal especially for elective surgical healthcare.","output":"Wie stark trifft die Corona-Pandemie die chirurgische Klinik eines universit?ren Maximalversorgers? : Eine Analyse der ersten 7 Wochen./ [How severe is the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on the department of surgery of a university hospital? : An analysis of the first 7 weeks]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to understand the impacts of Pokmon GO, a popular location-based augmented reality (AR) mobile gaming app, on route and mode choices.

Its gaming nature and social components can possibly enhance long-term user engagement through applying the characteristics of game elements and providing opportunities for competition, collaboration, companionship, and social reinforcement. An online survey is conducted to collect the self-reported behavior of a group of Pokmon GO users to explore its impacts on the following aspects of travel behavior: (1) the frequency of changing the route to interact with virtual objects; (2) the likelihood of carpooling more instead of driving alone for more in-app collaboration; and (3) the likelihood of shifting mode from drive alone to public transit, walking, and cycling if provided with additional incentives. The ordered survey responses including frequency and likelihood are analyzed using random parameters ordered probit models to account for the unobserved heterogeneity across users and identify subpopulations of travelers who are more susceptible to the influence of Pokmon GO.

There is emerging evidence of SARS-CoV-2 virus found in the blood of patients from China and some developed countries. However, there is inadequate data reported in Ghana and other parts of Africa, where blood transfusion service heavily relies on voluntary and replacement blood donors. This study aimed to investigate whether plasma of infected individuals could pose significant transfusion transmitted risk of COVID-19 in Ghanaian populations. METHODS: This cross-sectional retrospective study was conducted at the Kumasi Centre for Collaborative Research into Tropical Medicine (KCCR), KNUST, Ghana. Study subjects comprised contacts of COVID-19 individuals, those with classical symptoms of COVID-19 and individuals who had recovered based on the new Ghana discharge criteria. Whole blood, sputum or deep coughed saliva samples were collected and transported to KCCR for SARS-CoV-2 testing. Viral nucleic acid was extracted from sputum/nasopharyngeal samples using Da An Gene column based kit and from plasma using LBP nucleic acid extraction kit. Real-Time PCR was performed specifically targeting the ORF1ab and Nucleocapsid (N) genomic regions of the virus. RESULTS: A total of 97 individuals were recruited into the study, with more than half being males (58; 59.7%). The mean age of all subjects was 33 years (SD = 7.7) with minimum being 22 years and maximum 56 years. Majority (76; 78.4%) of all the subjects were asymptomatic, and among the few symptomatic subjects, cough (10; 10.3%) was the most predominant symptom. Of the 97 sputum samples tested, 79 (81.4%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. We identified SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in the plasma of 1 (1.03%) subject who had clinically recovered. CONCLUSION: This study reports the identification of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in a convalescent individual in Ghana. Due to the low prevalence observed and the marginal cycling thresholds associated, the risk of transfusion transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is negligible.

However, the occurrence of strokes in young and middle aged patients with COVID-19 is not fully explained. METHODS: In this series, six patients younger than 55 years of age with diagnosis of stroke and a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were evaluated for symptoms, lab data, imaging findings, and outcomes from March 2020 to the end of April 2020 from all stroke cases in a tertiary academic hospital. Patients older than 55 and all others who had evidence of cardiac abnormalities (arrhythmia/valvular) were excluded. RESULTS: Fever, myalgia, cough, and dyspnea were the most common clinical symptoms noted in 66.66% (4/6), 66.66% (4/6), 50% (3/6), and 50% (3/6) of the patients, respectively.

The work reveals the relevance of UBI concept development in the context of the need to overcome mass poverty in Russia. The result of the theoretical analysis shows that generally recognized UBI principles (universality, unconditionality, individual nature of monetary payments, their regularity) are justified by long-term trends in social policy evolution. The prospect of introducing universal basic income is presented as a qualitative transition (leap) in implementation of the latter. The social policy measures, closest to implementation of UBI principles, are characterized as its transitional forms including experiments on its introduction. To assess the practical feasibility of UBI transitional forms, the article uses the results of a survey of experts from different Russian regions conducted with the authors' participation and a pilot experiment and modeling of the results of UBI toolkit implementation. The paper proposes a possible scheme for implementing UBI tools in Russia, as well as pilot projects for low-income families with children, graduates of universities and secondary vocational educational institutions during the transition from study to the first place of work, the unstable employed (including the unemployed). The authors assess the paradox of activating the implementation of UBI principles in the context of the COVID-2019 pandemic under unfavorable financial conditions as confirming the reality of the prospects for its transitional forms for Russia. The results of the study can contribute to the development of discussions about the introduction of UBI tools in the Russian Federation, and to the promotion of its wide experimental testing for different population categories.

The purpose of this study was to analyze gender differences associated with various hyperinflammatory conditions (HIC) and mortality in the Indian COVID-19 patients Methods: This study was conducted at the Era's Lucknow Medical College and Hospital (ELMCH), ERA University, which is located in the northern part of India. Starting from July 4, 2020 till December 3, 2020 a total of 2997 patients were treated at ELMCH. We randomly collected blood samples from 150 severe COVID-19 patients (required oxygen) between August 10 and September 15, 2020 for analyzing the following HIC and associated laboratory markers: hyperferritinaemia (serum ferritin), hematological dysfunctions (lymphocytopenia and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio), cytokinaemia (C-reactive protein), coagulopathy (D-dimer), liver inflammation (aspartate aminotransferase), renal inflammation (blood urea and creatinine), and hyperglycemia (random blood glucose). The threshold values/cut off limits of these laboratory markers used for analyzing the risk of mortality in male and female COVID-19 patients were set according to the scale validated recently by Webb et al, (2020). Results: In the above cohort of consecutively admitted COVID-19 patients, analysis of various HIC revealed hyperferritinaemia (odd ratio: 2.9, 95% CI 1.4-6.0), hematological dysfunctions (odd ratio: 2.10, 95% CI 1.0-4.2), hepatic inflammation (odd ratio: 2.0, 95% CI 0.52-7.40), and coagulopathy (odd ratio: 1.5, 95% CI 1.50, 95% CI 0.50-4.60) were more prevalent and sever in male COVID-19 patients. Approximately 86% male to 64% female COVID-19 patients developed lymphocytopenia. Regarding mortality, while hyperferritinaemia (odd ratio: 1.70, 95% CI 0.37-7.43) and cytokinaemia (odd ratio: 1.60, 95% CI 0.37 -7.30) were strongly associated with mortality in male COVID-19 patients, coagulopathy (odd ratio: 3.30, 95% CI 0.31-35), and hematological dysfunctions (odd ratio: 1.70, 95% CI 0.27-10) were more commonly associated with mortality in female COVID-19 patients. Nearly 80% male and female COVID-19 patients, who died had developed []2 criteria of HIS criteria. Chronic renal disease was associated with more deaths in female than male COVID-19 patients (odd ratio: 2.0, 95% CI 0.54 - 7.4). While the mortality proportion was slightly higher in male (6.3%) than female (4.5%) COVID-19 patients, survival curves of the two genders were not different (hazard ratio: 1.02, 95% CI 0.71-1.40, P = 0. 953). Conclusion: Distinct HIC were associated with the severity, and mortality in male and female COVID-19 patients. Coagulopathy and renal injury were detrimental, specifically, for female COVID-19 patients. The overall mortality proportion was around 5.3%. The above results suggest that gender differences associated with COVID-19 severity and mortality arise due to differences in various HIC. These results may help in developing personalized or gender based treatments for COVID-19 patients.

In the Kenyan private sector, general practitioners (GP), with no post-graduate training in family medicine, offer primary care. There is a paucity of evidence on the ability of primary care providers to deliver comprehensive care and no such evidence is available for GPs practising in the private sector in Kenya. AIM To evaluate GPs' training and experience in the skills required for comprehensive primary care. DESIGN AND SETTING A cross-sectional descriptive survey in 13 primary care clinics in the private sector of Nairobi, Kenya METHOD: A questionnaire, originally designed for a national survey of primary care doctors in South Africa, was adapted. The study collected self-reported data on performance of clinical skills by 25 GPs. Data were analysed in the Statistical Package for Social Sciences. RESULTS GPs were mostly under 40 years, with less than 10 years of experience and an equal gender distribution. GPs reported moderate performance with adult health, communication and consultation, and clinical administration; and weak performance with emergencies, child health, surgery, ear-nose-and-throat, eyes, women's health and orthopaedics. The GPs lacked training in specific skills such as proctoscopy, contraceptive devices, skin procedures, intra-articular injections, red reflex test and use of a genogram. CONCLUSION General practitioners lacked training and performed poorly in some of the essential skills required in primary care.

We use secondary data to interpret the deprivation features that puts them at greater epidemic risk. In addition, the Covid-19 crisis led to a sudden return of the Romanian Roma living in Western Europe. The slums and ghettos were more strictly quarantined than regular areas, suggesting a form of negative quarantine. Quarantine was - next to its medical purpose - used as a rhetoric and disciplinary device. Roma were portrayed as infection spreaders, and racism was channelled mainly through the media. While the spread of the disease placed them at risk, the lockdown itself induced major survival challenges. By using media and social media analysis, we show how the discourse of negative quarantine unfolded.

METHODS SITS Open was a prospective, open, blinded evaluation, international, multicenter, controlled, nonrandomized registry study. Centers lacking access to thrombectomy contributed controls. Primary end point was categorical shift in modified Rankin Scale score at 3 months in the per protocol (PP) population. Principal secondary outcomes were symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, functional independency (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2) and death at 3 months. Patients independently evaluated by video-recorded modified Rankin Scale interviews blinded to treatment or center identity by central core laboratory were regarded as PP population. Propensity score matching with covariate adjusted analysis was performed. RESULTS During 2014 to 2017, 293 patients (257 thrombectomy, 36 control) from 26 centers in 10 countries fulfilled intention-to-treat and 200 (170 thrombectomy, 30 control) PP criteria; enrollment of controls was limited by rapid uptake of thrombectomy. In PP analysis, median age was 71 versus 71 years, and baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 17 versus 17 in the thrombectomy and control arms, respectively. The propensity score matching analysis for PP showed a significant shift for modified Rankin Scale at 3 months favoring the thrombectomy group (odds ratio, 3.8 [95% CI, 1.61-8.95]; P=0.002).

Several studies have explored the relationship between preoperative urine cytology and intravesical recurrence (IVR) in patients with UUT-UC. However, the results of these studies are controversial or even contradictory, and investigations with UUT-UC patients in northeast China are rare. METHODS: We first estimated the prognostic significance of preoperative urine cytology in the outcomes of intravesical recurrence in 231 UUT-UC patients (training cohort = 142, validation cohort = 89) after radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) by the nomogram model. Subsequently, we quantitatively combined our results with the published data after searching several databases to assess whether preoperative positive urine cytology was associated with poor intravesical recurrence-free survival and a high risk of tumor malignant biological behavior. RESULTS: Firstly, the multicenter retrospective cohort study demonstrated that preoperative positive urine cytology correlated with poor intravesical recurrence-free survival and can serve as significant independent predictors of IVR by KaplanCMeier curves and Cox regression analysis. The construction of the nomogram demonstrated that predictive efficacy and accuracy were significantly improved when preoperative urine cytology was combined. Meanwhile, meta-analysis showed that preoperative positive urine cytology was associated with a 49% increased risk of IVR. In the subgroup analysis by region, study type, and sample size, the pooled hazard ratios (HRs) were statistically significant for the Japan subgroup (HR 1.32), China subgroup (HR 1.88), cohort study subgroup (HR 1.45), and the single-arm study subgroup (HR 1.63). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative urine cytology was validated as a potential predictor of intravesical recurrence in patients with UUT-UC after RNU, although these results need to be generalized with caution.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Sixty-eight follow-up MR FLAIR datasets of ischemic stroke patients with known modified Rankin Scale (mRS) functional outcome after 30 days were used. The infarct regions were segmented and used to calculate the percentage of lesioned voxels in the predefined MNI, Harvard-Oxford cortical and subcortical atlas regions as well as using four problem-specific VOIs, which were identified from the database using voxel-based lesion symptom mapping. An overall of 12 SVM classification models for predicting the corresponding mRS score were generated using the lesion overlap values from the different brain region definitions, stroke laterality information, and the optional parameters infarct volume, admission NIHSS, and patient age. RESULTS Leave-one-out cross validations revealed that including information about the stroke location in terms of lesion overlap measurements led to improved mRS prediction results compared to classification models not utilizing the stroke location information. Furthermore, integration of the optional features led to improved mRS prediction results in all cases tested. The problem-specific brain regions and additional integration of the optional features led to the best mRS predictions with a precise multi-value mRS prediction accuracy of 56%, sliding window multi-value mRS prediction accuracy (mRS1) of 82%, and binary mRS (0-2 vs. 3-5) prediction accuracy of 85%. CONCLUSION Therefore, a graded SVM-based functional stroke outcome prediction using the problem-specific brain regions for lesion overlap quantification leads to promising results but needs to be further validated using an independent database to rule out a potential methodical bias and overfitting effects.

Citrullinome analysis reveals significant changes in deimination levels of both cellular and viral proteins, with interferon (IFN)-inducible protein IFIT1 being among the most heavily deiminated one. As genetic depletion of IFIT1 strongly enhances HCMV growth, and in vitro IFIT1 citrullination impairs its ability to bind to 5-ppp-RNA, we propose that viral-induced IFIT1 citrullination is a mechanism of HCMV evasion from host antiviral resistance.

Hesitancy, that is, provides a paradigm through which such regrettably delayed responses to hydromet hazards might be better understood and effectively addressed. Without exaggeration, just about every hydromet event provides an example of how hesitancy hinders individual, community, and national government risk-reducing preventive and mitigative responses to forecasts of foreseeable, relatively near-term climate, water, or weather hazards. Reasons for such hesitancy (for vaccine and forecast use alike) includeamong otherslack of trust in the science, lack of confidence in government, and persistent concern about the uncertainties that surround forecastingboth meteorological and public health. As such, a better understanding of the causes that lead to individual and group hesitancy can better inform hydromet forecasters and affected communities about ways in which beneficial actions in response to timely forecasts are often delayed. This better understanding will facilitate, where necessary, targeted interventions to enhance the societal value of forecasting by reducing this long-observed challenge of forecast hesitancy.

After, the notion of forecast hesitancy with regard to hydrometeorological hazards is discussed.","output":"Forecast Hesitancy: Why are People Reluctant to Believe, Accept, or Respond to Various Weather, Water, and Climate Hazard-Related Forecasts?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ageing has been recognized as one of the most critically important health-care issues worldwide. It is relevant to Asia, where the increasing number of older populations has drawn attention to the paramount need for health-care investment, particularly in end-of-life care. The advocacy of advance care planning is a mean to honor patient autonomy. Since most East Asian countries are influenced by Confucianism and the concept of 'filial piety,' patient autonomy is consequently subordinate to family values and physician authority. The dominance from family members and physicians during a patient's end-of-life decision-making is recognized as a cultural feature in Asia. Physicians often disclose the patient's poor prognosis and corresponding treatment options to the male, family member rather to the patient him/herself. In order to address this ethical and practical dilemma, the concept of 'relational autonomy' and the collectivism paradigm might be ideally used to assist Asian people, especially older adults, to share their preferences on future care and decision-making on certain clinical situations with their families and important others. In this review article, we invited experts in end-of-life care from Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan to briefly report the current status of advance care planning in each country from policy, legal and clinical perspectives. According to the Asian experiences, we have seen different models of advance care planning implementation. The Asian Delphi Taskforce for advance care planning is currently undertaken by six Asian countries and a more detailed, culturally sensitive whitepaper will be published in the near future.","output":"Advance care planning in Asian culture."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The novel coronavirus outbreak is now shifting the way educational institutions operate around the world. This study aims to assess the online learning experience during the pandemic and recognize its perceived barriers according to university professors in Jordan. Methods: This is a questionnaire-based, cross-sectional, and descriptive study. A web-based survey was distributed to all university professors and lecturers in public universities across Jordan. Results: A total of 508 educators responded to this study. Males (67.5%, n=343) dominated the study population compared to females (32.5%, n=165). Educators spent an average of 20.2  15.9 hours/week using the internet for educational purposes during the pandemic. Positive attitudes towards online teaching were seen, as 65.7% reported being prepared for online teaching, while 40.8% were comfortable communicating with students via online platforms. Institutional support for online learning also appears to have increased following the coronavirus outbreak. An overwhelming majority (81.9%, n=416) stated that their universities supported online education during the pandemic, compared to 56.5% (n=287) before. The main recognized barriers for online teaching were poor internet connection (78.3%, n=398), disadvantages in old learning tools (e.g., uploading capacity) (70.9%, n=360), and family atmosphere (69.3%, n=352). Participants also recognized technical (74.0%, n=376) and computer skills (49.2%, n=250) as areas requiring development. Conclusion: Despite the positive attitudes of educators towards online teaching, many barriers need to be overcome before the shift from traditional learning is implemented. Faculty training and inter-departmental communication are warranted for the success of online teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Attitudes and Practices of Educators towards e-Learning during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is a global priority. Here, we develop two capsid-like particle (CLP)-based vaccines displaying the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. RBD antigens are displayed on AP205 CLPs through a split-protein Tag/Catcher, ensuring unidirectional and high-density display of RBD. Both soluble recombinant RBD and RBD displayed on CLPs bind the ACE2 receptor with nanomolar affinity. Mice are vaccinated with soluble RBD or CLP-displayed RBD, formulated in Squalene-Water-Emulsion. The RBD-CLP vaccines induce higher levels of serum anti-spike antibodies than the soluble RBD vaccines. Remarkably, one injection with our lead RBD-CLP vaccine in mice elicits virus neutralization antibody titers comparable to those found in patients that had recovered from COVID-19. Following booster vaccinations, the virus neutralization titers exceed those measured after natural infection, at serum dilutions above 1:10,000. Thus, the RBD-CLP vaccine is a highly promising candidate for preventing COVID-19.","output":"Capsid-like particles decorated with the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain elicit strong virus neutralization activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study describes a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak caused by the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant in a nursing home in Central Italy during OctoberCNovember 2021.

The closterovirus group combines several positive-strand RNA viruses with very flexuous filamentous particles, of which beet yellows virus (BYV) is the type virus. Closteroviruses are distinct from other RNA viruses of plants in some important phenomenological aspects. They have genomes of up to 20 kilobases (kb), a value comparable only to those of the animal coronaviruses and toroviruses, which have the largest RNA genomes of all positive-strand RNA viruses. The existence of such genomes having a coding capacity several times that of an average RNA virus genome raises questions as to the trend whereby the long genomes have evolved and the possible novel functions they have acquired. The dramatic increase in the closterovirus genome coding capacity may be linked to the distinct ecological niche they occupy. Thus, closteroviruses are the only elongated plant viruses known so far to cause phloem-limited infections in plants and to persist in their insect vectors for many hours, in contrast to only minutes.","output":"Principles of Molecular Organization, Expression, and Evolution of Closteroviruses: Over The Barriers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter will present a look at the medical device market with a particular focus on the materials of construction of devices and what we can expect in new products looking ahead.

As of 2018, 128 Americans die each day of an opioid overdose, and total economic costs associated with opioid misuse are estimated to be more than $500 billion annually. The crisis has evolved in three phases, starting in the 1990s and continuing through 2010 with a massive increase in use of prescribed opioids associated with lax prescribing regulations and aggressive marketing e?orts by the pharmaceutical industry. A second phase included tightening restrictions on prescribed opioids, reformulation of some commonly misused prescription medications, and a shift to heroin consumption over the period 2010 to 2013. Since 2013, the third phase of the crisis has included a movement towards synthetic opioids, especially fentanyl, and a continued tightening of opioid prescribing regulations, along with the growth of both harm reduction and addiction treatment access policies. Economic research, using innovative frameworks, causal methods, and rich data, has added to our understanding of the causes and consequences of the crisis. This body of research also identi?es intended and unintended impacts of policies designed to address the crisis. Although there is general agreement that the causes of the crisis include a combination of supply- and demand-side factors, and interactions between them, there is less consensus regarding the relative importance of each. Studies show that regulations can reduce opioid prescribing but may have less impact on root causes of the crisis and, in some cases, have spillover e?ects resulting in greater use of more harmful substances obtained in illicit markets, where regulation is less possible. There are e?ective opioid use disorder treatments available, but access, stigma, and cost hurdles have sti?ed utilization, resulting in a large degree of under-treatment in the U.S. How challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic may intersect with the opioid crisis is unclear.

In particular, activity, respiratory and environmental data are continuously streamed and collected. The solution has been tested on 18 healthy volunteers during non-supervised recordings lasting at least 48 hours. The combination of recognized activities and associated respiratory parameters provided statistically significant variations in breathing patterns between one activity and the other, thus giving more complete information to the clinicians than previously studied telemedicine systems based on spot-checks. In particular, statistically significant differences are found in tidal volume and minute ventilation between horizontal and vertical postures (p<0.001) and between vertical postures and dynamic activities (p<0.001); the respiratory rate shows statistically significant differences between horizontal and vertical postures (p<0.001). Some environmental parameters have different mean values between day and night, such as carbon dioxide (p<0.001).

We aimed to examine the use of Kids Helpline during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We analyzed monthly and weekly time trends of demand for and response by the Kids Helpline. The frequency of counseling contacts by common concern types, age, and gender were also examined. We used Joinpoint regression. RESULTS: Analyses of weekly demand for Kids Helpline showed an increase when the pandemic was declared, followed by a gradual decline. A second rise from 12 July 2020 when parts of Australia experienced a second wave of infections, followed by another decline, occurred more recently. Increased demand was almost entirely in the WebChat modality. Most answered counseling contacts were from girls and those aged 13-18 years.

Previous studies have suggested that viral infection is a major cause of SHL, especially sudden SHL, but the system that protects against pathogens in the inner ear, which is isolated by the blood-labyrinthine barrier, remains poorly understood. We recently showed that, as audiosensory receptor cells, cochlear hair cells (HCs) are protected by surrounding accessory supporting cells (SCs) and greater epithelial ridge (GER or K?llikers organ) cells (GERCs) against viral infections. Here, we found that virus-infected SCs and GERCs induce HC death via production of the tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Notably, the HCs expressed the TRAIL death receptors (DR) DR4 and DR5, and virus-induced HC death was suppressed by TRAIL-neutralizing antibodies. TRAIL-induced HC death was not caused by apoptosis, and was inhibited by necroptosis inhibitors. Moreover, corticosteroids, the only effective drug for SHL, inhibited the virus-induced transformation of SCs and GERCs into macrophage-like cells and HC death, while macrophage depletion also inhibited virus-induced HC death.

During the initial onset of COVID-19 and compared to 1 year prior, TCs requested and the NMDP performed less donor searches. More multiple URD and direct to workup requests were processed by the NMDP, which likely reflected reductions in donor availability. Yet TCs continued to perform allogeneic transplants for acute disease indications like acute leukemia and myelodysplasia, using more cryopreserved grafts than before COVID-19. In comparison to prepandemic patient cycle conversion rates and durations, the NMDP was able to convert patient cycles at nearly the same or higher rates and in similar or shorter periods of time.

We redesigned the previous prevention program and adapted the new type of quarantine system so that they can still work without risk to the others. Material and Method: We invent the bubble and seal system for HCWs. If the COVID-19 patient dodged to admit in ward and detected later. We did the COVID test for all the high-risk exposers and quarantine them. We seal the ward with no new patient admit and we arrange the room for those who needed quarantine near the sealed ward so that they can work, they were in the high-risk bubble. For those who went home they must go straight to their home and not stop anywhere and vice versa to hospital. Result and Conclusion: In the 4th wave of pandemic. Our team did exposure investigation 5,019 times and got high risk exposure 886 persons (17.7%). There were 401 high-risk exposed HCWs (45.3%) who worked in high-risk bubble instead of staying home. Those high risk exposed cluster were support workers 35.1%, nurses and doctor clusters were 29.3% and 27.2%. There was no transmission among those who worked in high-risk bubble.

To study meeting effectiveness and meeting inclusiveness, we first conducted a large-scale email survey (N=4,425; after filtering N=3,290) at a large technology company (pre-COVID-19); using this data we derived a multivariate model of meeting effectiveness and show how it correlates with meeting inclusiveness, participation, and feeling comfortable to contribute. We believe this is the first such model of meeting effectiveness and inclusiveness. The large size of the data provided the opportunity to analyze correlations that are specific to sub-populations such as the impact of video. The model shows the following factors are correlated with inclusiveness, effectiveness, participation, and feeling comfortable to contribute in meetings: sending a pre-meeting communication, sending a post-meeting summary, including a meeting agenda, attendee location, remote-only meeting, audio/video quality and reliability, video usage, and meeting size. The model and survey results give a quantitative understanding of how and where to improve meeting effectiveness and inclusiveness and what the potential returns are. Motivated by the email survey results, we implemented a post-meeting survey into a leading computer-mediated communication (CMC) system to directly measure meeting effectiveness and inclusiveness (during COVID-19). Using initial results based on internal flighting we created a similar model of effectiveness and inclusiveness, with many of the same findings as the email survey.

PURPOSE: Highly effective coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines have brought hope for ending the pandemic. Unprecedented mass vaccination started first among healthcare workers. The aim of this report is to describe key strategies undertaken by a large hospital pharmacy department to meet the challenges of preparing a large quantity of COVID-19 vaccine doses in a short period of time. SUMMARY: MedStar Washington Hospital Center (MWHC) was in the first group of hospitals in Washington, DC, to receive Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in December 2020. The pharmacy department faced challenges including stringent vaccine storage requirements, a need for specific equipment and workflow, limited funding, and staffing constraints. The pharmacy department's senior leaders defined pharmacy responsibilities, budgeted for equipment, participated in vaccination center design, and instructed pharmacy informatics personnel. The vaccine coordinators were appointed to oversee all vaccination-related operations. An ultra-low temperature freezer was installed 2 weeks before arrival of the first shipment of vaccine. All pharmacy order entry tools and operating procedures were standardized, and staff training and schedules were finalized by December 15. The first dose of the vaccine was administered on December 16 at the vaccination center. Pharmacy staff members dispensed the vaccine doses and monitored patients. By January 6, 2021, MWHC had vaccinated 3,812 employees with their first vaccine dose, with an average of 228 doses administered daily. CONCLUSION: Key strategies such as systemic coordination, early preparation, detailed planning, operating procedure development, and staff education and engagement proved successful in facilitating preparation of thousands of COVID-19 vaccine doses for hospital employees within a short period of time.","output":"Strategies used to meet the challenges of mass COVID-19 vaccination by the pharmacy department in a large academic medical center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We discuss the current understanding of COVID-19s neurological implications, their basis, and the evolving clinical consensus with a focus on cerebrovascular stroke.

The observed extraordinary speed can be much faster than that triggered by a constant field with the same amplitude. The effect can be understood as the efficient suppression of the pinning of AFM domain walls by the strong exchange torque triggered by the reversal of the Fe magnetization, as revealed by spin dynamics simulations.

Drug targets with human genetic evidence of disease association are twice as likely to lead to approved drugs. A key enabler of identifying and validating these genetically validated targets is access to association results from genome-wide genotyping, whole-exome sequencing, and whole-genome sequencing studies with observable traits (often diseases) across large numbers of individuals. Today, linkage between genotype and real-world data (RWD) provides significant opportunities to not only increase the statistical power of genome-wide association studies by ascertaining additional cases for diseases of interest, but also to improve diversity and coverage of association studies across the disease phenome. As RWD-genetics linked resources continue to grow in diversity of participants, breadth of data captured, length of observation, and number of participants, there is a greater need to leverage the experience of RWD experts, clinicians, and highly experienced geneticists together to understand which lessons and frameworks from general research using RWD sources are relevant to improve genetics-driven drug discovery and development. This paper describes new challenges and opportunities for phenotypes enabled by diverse RWD sources, considerations in the use of RWD phenotypes for disease gene identification across the disease phenome, and challenges and opportunities in leveraging RWD phenotypes in target validation. The paper concludes with views on the future directions for phenotype development using RWD, and key questions requiring further research and development to advance this nascent field.","output":"Integration of Real-World Data and Genetics to Support Target Identification and Validation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This document details the methodology of the Los Alamos National Laboratory COVID-19 forecasting model, COFFEE (COVID-19 Forecasts using Fast Evaluations and Estimation).","output":"COFFEE: COVID-19 Forecasts using Fast Evaluations and Estimation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Seroma is a frequent complication of endoscopic totally extraperitoneal (TEP) mesh repair of direct inguinal hernia that may cause discomfort and anxiety. Its volume is proportional to the size of the preperitoneal dead space created after the reduction of the hernia. Attempts to reduce its incidence have included tacking the transversalis fascia (TF) to the pubic ramus or closed suction drainage of the preperitoneal space. Both of these techniques are not without problems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of a new alternate technique that must be safe and easily reproducible, using a widely available and inexpensive pre-tied suture loop (Endoloop(?) Ligature) for plication of the weakened TF. METHODS This is a prospective study of consecutive patients diagnosed with inguinal hernia during a 33-month period and eligible for endoscopic TEP repair. A single surgeon performed all operations. Each of the M2 or M3 direct defects, according to the European Hernia Society (EHS), were systematically closed prior to the introduction of the prosthetic mesh and as follows: grasping and inversion of the attenuated TF at its apex, using a laparoscopic forceps and plication of the TF by placing a tight Endoloop of Polydioxanone (PDS) at its base. All meshes were secured with fibrin sealant only. Patients were reviewed in the clinic 2 and 6 weeks after the operation. Further follow-up was scheduled if it was deemed necessary. The primary post-operative outcome parameter was seroma formation; secondary outcome parameters included groin pain, surgical complications, and recurrence. RESULTS Two hundred and fifty hernia repairs were prospectively recorded during this period. All procedures were carried out endoscopically. Seventy-nine patients with 94 direct inguinal hernias were selected in a sequential manner. There were 75 males and four females, with a median age of 57 years. Of those, 55 were combined with an indirect inguinal defect. In total, Endoloops of PDS were used to close the weakened TF in 76 cases (30 M3, 44 M2, and two M1). Only one patient (1.3%) complained of a residual seroma formation, which was still clinically present at 3 months post-operatively, but was not symptomatic. There were only two minor post-operative complications, which occurred in the same patient and were not related to the Endoloop technique. Finally, no patient complained of chronic groin pain and there was no hernia recurrence after a median follow-up of 18 months. CONCLUSIONS The primary closure of direct inguinal hernia defects with a pre-tied suture loop during endoscopic TEP repair is safe, efficient, and very reliable for the prevention of post-operative seroma formation, without increasing the risk of developing chronic groin pain or hernia recurrence. This technique should be the preferred method over stapling of the TF or the insertion of a closed suction drainage device in such a situation.","output":"The Endoloop technique for the primary closure of direct inguinal hernia defect during the endoscopic totally extraperitoneal approach."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Poor outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) have been linked to diabetes but its relation to pre\\\\infection glycemic control is still unclear. METHODS: To address this question we report here the association between pre\\\\infection HemoglobinA1c (A1C) levels and COVID\\\\19 severity as assessed by need for hospitalization in a cohort of 2068 patients with diabetes tested for COVID\\\\19 in Leumit Health Services, Israel, between February 1 and April 30, 2020. Using the LHS integrated electronic medical records system we were able to collect a large amount of clinical information including age, sex, socioeconomic status, weight, height, body mass index, A1C, prior diagnosis of ischemic heart disease, depression/anxiety, schizophrenia, dementia, hypertension, cerebrovascular accident, congestive heart failure , smoking and chronic lung disease. RESULTS: Of the patients included in the cohort, 183 (8.85 %) were diagnosed with COVID\\\\19 and 46 were admitted to hospital. More hospitalized patients were female, came from higher socioeconomic background and had a higher baseline A1C. A prior diagnosis of cerebrovascular accident and chronic lung disease conferred an increased risk of hospitalization but not obesity or smoking status. In a multivariate analysis, controlling for multiple prior clinical conditions, the only parameter associated with a significantly increased risk for hospitalization was A1C9%. CONCLUSION: Using pre\\\\infection glycemic control data we identify A1C as a clear predictor of COVID\\\\19 severity. Pre\\\\infection risk stratification is crucial to successfully manage this disease, efficiently allocate resources and minimize the economic and social burden associated with an undiscriminating approach.

Indeed, high prevalence rates of depression, sleep disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been reported in Chinese healthcare workers during the epidemic peak. Symptoms of psychological distress are expected to be long-lasting and have a systemic impact on healthcare systems, warranting the need for evidence-based psychological treatments aiming at relieving immediate stress and preventing the onset of psychological disorders in this population. In the current COVID-19 context, internet-based interventions have the potential to circumvent the pitfalls of face-to-face formats and provide the flexibility required to facilitate accessibility to healthcare workers. Online cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in particular has proved to be effective in treating and preventing a number of stress-related disorders in populations other than healthcare workers.

METHODS: Powered for superiority testing, this six-site open trial involves the random assignment of 120 healthcare workers with stress levels > 16 on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) to either the 7-session online CBT program or bibliotherapy. The primary outcome is the decrease of PSS-10 scores at 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes include depression, insomnia, and PTSD symptoms; self-reported resilience and rumination; and credibility and satisfaction.

METHODS: In the COVID-19 era eighteen patients (8 men, 10 women) with a mean age of 80 years, needing undelayable abdominal surgery underwent awake open surgery at our Department. Prior to surgery, all patients underwent COVID-19 investigation. In all cases locoregional anesthesia (LA) was performed. Intraoperative and postoperative pain has been monitored and regularly assessed. A distinct pathway has been set up to keep patients of uncertain COVID-19 diagnosis separated from all other patients. RESULTS: Mean operative time was 104 minutes. In only one case conversion to general anesthesia was necessary. Postoperative pain was always well controlled. None of them required postoperative intensive care support. Only one perioperative complication occurred. Early readmissions after surgery were never observed. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of our experience awake laparotomy under LA resulted feasible, safe, painless and, in specific cases, the only viable option.

In each scenario, respondents were presented with real (anonymized) patient lab results using either numeric expressions, graphs, or verbal expressions. Participants were asked to assess the gravity of the hypothetical patients condition and the course of action they would follow if they were that patient. The questionnaire was distributed to more than 300 participants, of whom 225 submitted usable responses. RESULTS: Laypersons were more likely to overestimate the gravity of the information when it was presented either numerically or graphically compared to the narrative format. High perceived gravity was most likely to produce an inclination to actively seek medical attention, even when unwarranted. Dont know responses were most likely to produce an inclination to either search the Internet or wait for the doctor to call. POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS: We discuss the studys implications for the effective design of lab results in the patient portals. We suggest (1) that graphs, tables, and charts would be easier to interpret if coupled with a brief verbal explanation; (2) that highlighting an overall level of urgency may be more helpful than indicating a diversion from the norm; and (3) that statements of results should include the type of follow-up required.","output":"Numbers, graphs and words C do we really understand the lab test results accessible via the patient portals?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES With endoscopic submucosal dissection and laparoscopic surgery, treatment for colorectal neoplasms has become minimally invasive. However, few studies have compared endoscopic submucosal dissection with laparoscopic surgery for colorectal neoplasms, excluding deeply invasive cancer on preoperative diagnosis. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the files of patients who had undergone endoscopic submucosal dissection or laparoscopic surgery for colorectal neoplasms between November 2005 and December 2015. We limited patients who were not suspected preoperatively to have aggressive submucosal invasion >1,000 m. RESULTS Ninety-five patients underwent endoscopic submucosal dissection and 37 underwent laparoscopic surgery. Cases of endoscopic submucosal dissection tended to involve rectal neoplasms more often than colonic neoplasms, shorter operative times, and shorter lengths of hospital stay compared with laparoscopic surgery. The perforation rate during colonic endoscopic submucosal dissection in the early period (November 2005 to December 2010) and late period (January 2011 to December 2015) was 14.8% and 2.9%, respectively. In all cases of perforation during colonic endoscopic submucosal dissection, the ability to maneuver the endoscope was compromised. Though tumors were larger in patients who underwent rectal endoscopic submucosal dissection compared with colonic endoscopic submucosal dissection, the perforation and postoperative bleeding rates with rectal endoscopic submucosal dissection were both 3.2%. The most common indication for laparoscopic surgery was difficulty performing endoscopic submucosal dissection. Serious complications were rare. CONCLUSIONS For colonic neoplasms, laparoscopic surgery should be considered when endoscopic submucosal dissection is technically difficult in the early period. For rectal neoplasms, endoscopic submucosal dissection is desirable even for those of large size.","output":"Short-term outcomes of endoscopic submucosal dissection versus laparoscopic surgery for colorectal neoplasms: An observational study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A pandemia da COVID-19 vem afetando o modo de vida nas cidades Em alguns pases C como o Brasil C a curva epidemiolgica cresce significativamente, exigindo respostas rpidas da administra??o pblica Esta pesquisa, conduzida em abril de 2020, visa caracterizar a utiliza??o de ferramentas digitais na adapta??o das cidades brasileiras  pandemia, baseada no conceito de smart city Para tanto, buscou-se tra?ar um panorama da ado??o de ferramentas digitais pela administra??o pblica nas cem maiores cidades brasileiras, como resposta aos desafios impostos pela situa??o pandmica, contribuindo para efetivar o isolamento ou para adaptar o funcionamento de atividades Os resultados indicam a aplica??o de tais estratgias em 83% das cidades pesquisadas, segundo a distribui??o geogrfica de casos da doen?a confirmados A concentra??o das iniciativas sugere que a ado??o da tecnologia acompanha a previs?o da curva de infec??o, e aponta para a tendncia de ado??o das estratgias em locais de contexto historicamente favorvel  inova??o Caracterstica fundamental das cidades inteligentes, o recurso  tecnologia digital na otimiza??o dos servi?os indica que as cidades pesquisadas est?o, em algum nvel, seguindo uma tendncia mundial Alternate abstract: COVID-19 has been affecting the way of life in cities The pandemic curve grows significantly in some countries, such as Brazil, requiring rapid responses from the public administration This research, conducted in April 2020, characterizes the use of digital tools in adapting Brazilian cities to the pandemic in light of the concept of smart cities, presenting a panorama of the current situation The results indicated that 83% of the cities surveyed used digital tools in measures to fight the pandemic, such as increasing social distancing and adapting public services The concentration of initiatives tends to follow the geographic distribution of confirmed cases, i e , digital tools are more used in places where the pandemic curve is more accentuated Also, cities that are historically more open to innovation demonstrated a heavier use of digital technologies and strategies to fight the pandemic Finally, the results indicate that the largest Brazilian cities follow, at some level, the trends of digital optimization observed worldwide Alternate abstract: La pandemia de COVID-19 ha estado afectando la forma de vida en las ciudades En algunos pases ?como Brasil? la curva epidemiolgica crece significativamente, lo que requiere respuestas rpidas de la administracin pblica Esta investigacin, realizada en abril de 2020, tiene como objetivo caracterizar el uso de herramientas digitales en la adaptacin de las ciudades brasile?as a la pandemia, a la luz del concepto de ciudad inteligente Para ello, buscamos esbozar un panorama de la adopcin de estas herramientas por parte de la administracin pblica en las cien ciudades brasile?as ms grandes, como una forma de responder a los desafos impuestos por la situacin de pandemia, contribuyendo a efectuar el aislamiento o adaptar el desempe?o de las actividades Los resultados indicaron la presencia de tales estrategias en el 83% de las ciudades encuestadas La concentracin de las iniciativas sugiere que la adopcin de la tecnologa sigue el pronstico de la curva de infeccin, y se?ala la tendencia a adoptar estrategias en lugares con un contexto histricamente favorable a la innovacin Caracterstica fundamental de las ciudades inteligentes, el uso de tecnologa digital en la optimizacin de los servicios indica que las ciudades encuestadas estn siguiendo, en algn nivel, una tendencia mundial","output":"Smart cities e pandemia: tecnologias digitais na gest?o pblica de cidades brasileiras"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previous studies have showed clinical characteristics of patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the evidence of person-to-person transmission. Limited data are available for asymptomatic infections. This study aims to present the clinical characteristics of 24 cases with asymptomatic infection screened from close contacts and to show the transmission potential of asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers. Epidemiological investigations were conducted among all close contacts of COVID-19 patients (or suspected patients) in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China, from Jan 28 to Feb 9, 2020, both in clinic and in community. Asymptomatic carriers were laboratory-confirmed positive for the COVID-19 virus by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal swab samples. Their clinical records, laboratory assessments, and chest CT scans were reviewed. As a result, none of the 24 asymptomatic cases presented any obvious symptoms while nucleic acid screening. Five cases (20.8%) developed symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue, etc.) during hospitalization. Twelve (50.0%) cases showed typical CT images of ground-glass chest and 5 (20.8%) presented stripe shadowing in the lungs. The remaining 7 (29.2%) cases showed normal CT image and had no symptoms during hospitalization. These 7 cases were younger (median age: 14.0 years; P=0.012) than the rest. None of the 24 cases developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. The median communicable period, defined as the interval from the first day of positive nucleic acid tests to the first day of continuous negative tests, was 9.5 days (up to 21 days among the 24 asymptomatic cases). Through epidemiological investigation, we observed a typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Overall, the asymptomatic carriers identified from close contacts were prone to be mildly ill during hospitalization. However, the communicable period could be up to three weeks and the communicated patients could develop severe illness. These results highlighted the importance of close contact tracing and longitudinally surveillance via virus nucleic acid tests. Further isolation recommendation and continuous nucleic acid tests may also be recommended to the patients discharged.","output":"Clinical characteristics of 24 asymptomatic infections with COVID-19 screened among close contacts in Nanjing, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The Coronavirus belongs to large groups of viruses that cause serious health problems including the mental health of the society particularly the health care providers.

The rat underwent laparotomy and a HBBM was placed directly below the incision. Tissue samples at the incision and away from the incision (normal tissue) were harvested and inflammatory response and fibrosis were evaluated using quantitative PCR and histological scoring.

This has led to the mandatory usage of surgical masks for protection against this lethal virus in many countries. However, the currently available disposable surgical masks have limitations in terms of their hydrophobicity and reusability. Here, we report a single-step spray-coating technique for the formation of a superhydrophobic layer of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) on a melt-blown polypropylene (PP) surgical mask. The sprayed SWCNTs form a nanospike-like architecture on the PP surface, increasing the static contact angle for water from 113.6  3.0 to 156.2  1.8 and showing superhydrophobicity for various body fluids such as urine, tears, blood, sweat, and saliva. The CNT-coated surgical masks also display an outstanding photothermal response with an increase in their surface temperature to more than 90 C within 30 s of 1 sun solar illumination, confirming its self-sterilization ability. Owing to the cumulative effect of the superhydrophobicity and photothermal performance of the SWCNTs, the CNT-coated masks show 99.99% higher bactericidal performance toward Escherichia coli than pristine masks. Further, the virucidal ability of the SWCNT-coated mask, tested by using virus-like particles, was found to be almost 99% under solar illumination.

In this paper, a fractional-order memory-dependent model for simulating the spread of COVID-19 is proposed. In this model, the impact of governmental interventions and public perception are incorporated as part of the nonlinear time-varying transmission rate. In addition, an algorithm for approximating the optimal values of the fractional order and strength of governmental interventions is provided. This approach makes our model suitable for capturing the given data set and consequently reliable for future predictions. The model simulation is performed using the two-step generalized exponential time-differencing method and tested for data from Mainland China, Italy, Saudi Arabia and Brazil. The simulation results demonstrate that the fractional order model calibrates to the data better than its integer order counterpart.

Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the salient politicized discourses of blaming Chinese people for spreading the virus have fueled over 2000 reports of anti-Asian racial incidents and hate crimes in the United States. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to investigate the relationships between news consumption, trust, intergroup contact, and prejudicial attitudes toward Asians and Asian Americans residing in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. We compare how traditional news, social media use, and biased news exposure cultivate racial attitudes, and the moderating role of media use and trust on prejudice against Asians is examined. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was completed in May 2020. A total of 430 US adults (mean age 36.75, SD 11.49 years; n=258, 60% male) participated in an online survey through Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform. Respondents answered questions related to traditional news exposure, social media use, perceived trust, and their top three news channels for staying informed about the novel coronavirus. In addition, intergroup contact and racial attitudes toward Asians were assessed. We performed hierarchical regression analyses to test the associations. Moderation effects were estimated using simple slopes testing with a 95% bootstrap confidence interval approach. RESULTS: Participants who identified as conservatives (?=.08, P=.02), had a personal infection history (?=.10, P=.004), and interacted with Asian people frequently in their daily lives (?=.46, P<.001) reported more negative attitudes toward Asians after controlling for sociodemographic variables. Relying more on traditional news media (?=.08, P=.04) and higher levels of trust in social media (?=.13, P=.007) were positively associated with prejudice against Asians. In contrast, consuming news from left-leaning outlets (?=-.15, P=.001) and neutral outlets (?=-.13, P=.003) was linked to less prejudicial attitudes toward Asians. Among those who had high trust in social media, exposure had a negative relationship with prejudice. At high levels of trust in digital websites and apps, frequent use was related to less unfavorable attitudes toward Asians. CONCLUSIONS: Experiencing racial prejudice among the Asian population during a challenging pandemic can cause poor psychological outcomes and exacerbate health disparities. The results suggest that conservative ideology, personal infection history, frequency of intergroup contact, traditional news exposure, and trust in social media emerge as positive predictors of prejudice against Asians and Asian Americans, whereas people who get COVID-19 news from left-leaning and balanced outlets show less prejudice. For those who have more trust in social media and digital news, frequent use of these two sources is associated with lower levels of prejudice. Our findings highlight the need to reshape traditional news discourses and use social media and mobile news apps to develop credible messages for combating racial prejudice against Asians.","output":"Intergroup Contact, COVID-19 News Consumption, and the Moderating Role of Digital Media Trust on Prejudice Toward Asians in the United States: Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Long-term forecasts are hard, but also indispensable in personal and policy planning. How could long-term predictions of complex phenomena, such as COVID-19 contagion, be enhanced? While much effort has gone into building predictive models of the pandemic, some have argued that early exponential growth combined with the stochastic nature of epidemics make the long-term prediction of contagion trajectories impossible. We leverage the diverse models contributing to CDC repository of COVID-19 death projections to identify factors associated with prediction accuracy across different projection horizons. We find that better long-term predictions correlate with (1) capturing the physics of transmission (instead of using black-box models);(2) projecting human behavioral reactions to an evolving pandemic;and (3) resetting state variables to account for randomness not captured in the model before starting projection. A very simple model, SEIRb, that incorporates these features and includes few other nuances offers predictions comparable with the most accurate models in the CDC set. Key to the long-term predictive power of multi-wave COVID-19 trajectories is endogenously capturing behavioral responses: balancing feedbacks where the perceived risk of death continuously changes transmission rate through the adoption, and relaxation, of various Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs).","output":"Enhancing Long-term Forecasting: Learning from COVID-19 Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Proposed SARS-CoV-2 surveillance tool using a mobile app for non-invasive monitoring of humans and animals Engineering a biomedical device as a low-cost, non-invasive, detection, and diagnostic platform for surveillance of infections in humans, and animals The system embraces the IoT digital by design metaphor by incorporating elements of connectivity, data sharing and (secure) information arbitrage Using an array of aptamers to bind viral targets may help in detection, diagnostics, and potentially prevention in case of SARS-CoV-2 The ADD tool may become part of a broader platform approach","output":"Aptamers for Detection and Diagnostics (ADD) is a proposed mobile app acquiring optical data from conjugated quantum nanodots to identify molecules indicating presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus: Why public health and healthcare need smartphone sensors as a platform for early detection and prevention (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Patients with solid cancer or haematologic malignancies have been considered to be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and to more often develop severe complications.

One of these is remdesivir, which was originally repurposed from its use against Ebola and functions by causing early RNA chain termination. We used this as justification to evaluate three molecules we had previously identified computationally with antiviral activity against Ebola and Marburg. Out of these we previously identified pyronaridine, which inhibited the SARS-CoV-2 replication in A549-ACE2 cells. Herein, the in vivo efficacy of pyronaridine has now been assessed in a K18-hACE transgenic mouse model of COVID-19. Pyronaridine treatment demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of viral load in the lungs of SARS CoV-2 infected mice. Furthermore, the pyronaridine treated group reduced lung pathology, which was also associated with significant reduction in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokine and cell infiltration. Notably, pyronaridine inhibited the viral PLpro activity in vitro (IC50 of 1.8 M) without any effect on Mpro, indicating a possible molecular mechanism involved in its ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. Interestingly, pyronaridine also selectively inhibits the host kinase CAMK1 (IC50 of 2.4 M). We have also generated several pyronaridine analogs to assist in understanding the structure activity relationship for PLpro inhibition. Our results indicate that pyronaridine is a potential therapeutic candidate for COVID-19. One sentence summary There is currently intense interest in discovering small molecules with direct antiviral activity against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2). Pyronaridine, an antiviral drug with in vitro activity against Ebola, Marburg and SARS-CoV-2 has now statistically significantly reduced the viral load in mice along with IL-6, TNF-, and IFN- ultimately demonstrating a protective effect against lung damage by infection to provide a new potential treatment for testing clinically.","output":"Pyronaridine Protects Against SARS-CoV-2 in Mouse"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectiveAfter COVID-19 was declared as a pandemic, different countries have enforced lockdowns, and shielding to mitigate the spread of the virus as preventing loss of lives was the priority.Our aim is to look for possible explanations for increased rates of visual hallucinations presented to Community Mental Health Teams for Older People during the period of lockdown.Case reportA review of clinical cases presenting with new onset visual hallucinations to the Community Mental Health Teams for Older People during the lockdown period in 2020 was summarised in two case scenarios. One scenario represents cases with known background of dementia, while the other scenario represents new referrals during the lockdown period with no known psychiatric background. In those cases, the visual hallucinations started during lockdown with no clear cause, did not respond to psychotropic medications, physical health investigations were all normal and hallucinations improved markedly with the end of the lockdown and social isolation.DiscussionFrom clinical practice point of view, during the period of lockdown in the COVID-19 pandemic, visual hallucinations has been one of the commonest presentations reported to the Community Mental Health Teams for Older People. Families were calling frequently reporting that their loved ones were seeing things. Possible underlying causes include: social isolation, sensory and perceptual deprivation, visual impairment and Charles Bonnet syndrome, lack of cognitive stimulation activities with progress of dementia, superimposed delirium, in addition to depression secondary to loneliness, reduction in community support, increased alcohol consumption and negative effects of repeated media consumption.ConclusionThere has been a marked increase in reporting visual hallucinations in the shielding older people population in the community during the period of lockdown in the COVID-19 pandemic. This shielded population was not exposed to COVID-19, so it didn't give an explanation to this new phenomenon. Though there are multiple possible causative factors, the effect of the lockdown itself with its resultant social isolation and sensory deprivation remains to be the most significant. Shielding the older people population throughout the COVID-19 pandemic came as an essential measure as the physical safety and preventing loss of lives was the priority;however the lockdown had significant negative effects on the mental health of the shielding population. It remains unclear if those negative effects are going to be reversible in the future, resulting in poor quality of life.","output":"Lockdown and visual hallucinations in older people: a community perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Evidence from past pandemics suggests that fear, uncertainty, and loss of control during large-scale public health crises may lead to increased pandemic-related information seeking, particularly among persons predisposed to high anxiety. In such groups, a greater consumption of information pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic may increase anxiety. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we examine the association between online activity and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) scores in the United States. METHODS: We recruited participants for an online survey through advertisements on various platforms such as Google, Facebook, and Reddit. A total of 406 adult US participants with moderate to severe (10) GAD-7 scores met the inclusion criteria and completed the survey. Anxiety levels measured using the GAD-7 scale formed our primary outcome. Our key independent variables were average daily time spent online and average daily time spent online searching about COVID-19 within the past 14 days. We used as controls potential confounders of the relation between our key independent variables and GAD-7 scores, namely, sleep quality, the COVID-19 Fear Inventory scale, binge drinking, substance use, prescription drug abuse, and sociodemographic attributes. RESULTS: Linear multivariate regression analyses showed that GAD-7 scores were higher among those who spent >4 hours online (per day) searching for information about COVID-19 (coefficient 1.29, P=.002), controlling for all other covariates. The total time spent online was not statistically associated with GAD-7 scores. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study indicate that limiting pandemic-related online information seeking may aid anxiety management in our study population.","output":"Association Between Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scores and Online Activity Among US Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-Sectional Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ivermectin (IVM) is a broad-spectrum antiparasitic agent, having inhibitory potential against wide range of viral infections. It has also been found to hamper SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro, and its precise mechanism of action against SARS-CoV-2 is yet to be understood. IVM is known to interact with host importin (IMP)&#945; directly and averts interaction with IMP?1, leading to the prevention of nuclear localization signal (NLS) recognition. Therefore, the current study seeks to employ molecular docking, molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) analysis and molecular dynamics simulation studies for decrypting the binding mode, key interacting residues as well as mechanistic insights on IVM interaction with 15 potential drug targets associated with COVID-19 as well as IMP&#945;. Among all COVID-19 targets, the non-structural protein 9 (Nsp9) exhibited the strongest affinity to IVM showing -5.30 kcal/mol and -84.85 kcal/mol binding energies estimated by AutoDock Vina and MM-GBSA, respectively. However, moderate affinity was accounted for IMP&#945; amounting -6.9 kcal/mol and -66.04 kcal/mol. Stability of the protein-ligand complexes of Nsp9-IVM and IMP&#945;-IVM was ascertained by 100 ns trajectory of all-atom molecular dynamics simulation.

A scoping review was conducted to map the global evolution of these new approaches to CPR training, to assess their efficacy and determine future directions to meet gaps in current knowledge. METHODS: A standardised five-stage scoping methodology was used to (1) identify the research question, (2) identify relevant studies, (3) select the studies, (4) chart the data and (5) summarise the findings. The Kirkpatrick model levels of evidence were used to chart and assess the efficacy of each intervention reported. A multi-pronged search term strategy was used to search the Web of Science, PubMed, CINAHL and EMBASE databases up to June 2020. RESULTS: A total of 42 articles were included in this review. The first relevant paper identified was published in 2009 and based on VR, from 2014 onwards there was a large increase in the volume of work being published regarding VR and AR uses in CPR training. This review reports Kirkpatrick level one to three evidence for the use of VR/ARCCPR. Inconsistencies in the specific language, keywords used and methodologies are highlighted. CONCLUSION: VR and AR technologies have shown great potential in the area of CPR, and there is continuing evidence of new novel applications and concepts. As VR/AR research into CPR reaches an inflection point, it is key to bring collaboration and consistency to the wider research community, to enable the growth of the area and ease of access to the wider medical community.

The questionnaire was designed in English language and included a set of 44 multiple-choice close-ended questions that covered demographic profile of participants, awareness of symptoms and practice against COVID-19. It also included a set of questions that attempted to investigate the attitudes and perceptions towards the uptake of vaccine. Out of the total 186 who participated in this study, 48.4% were 24 years old or younger and 55.9% were health field students. The results showed that majority of participants were aware of most common symptoms and causes of COVID-19 and had positive attitude toward the protective measures against the disease. Regarding the acceptability of vaccination against COVID-19, around 44% of the total participants showed hesitancy to uptake the vaccine of whom, 68.3% were concerned about the adverse effects of the vaccine. Significant differences were found between gender and current position at university of Jeddah in term of vaccine acceptance with p-values of &lt; 0.001. Despite this high level of awareness, health field community at the university of Jeddah have medium acceptance level of disease vaccine. Thus, health educational programs are important to increase the acceptance level among such societies which will contribute to increase the acceptance level among the whole society.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the impact of a quarantine strategy on patient safety and quality of care. Material and methods This retrospective cohort study enrolled patients admitted to the quarantine ward in a tertiary hospital in southern Taiwan. The incidence and causes of acute critical illness, including clinical deterioration and unexpected complications during the quarantine period, were reviewed. Further investigation was performed to identify risk factors for acute critical illness during quarantine. Results Of 320 patients admitted to the quarantine ward, more than two-thirds were elderly, and 37.8% were bedridden. During the quarantine period, 68 (21.2%) developed acute critical illness, which more commonly occurred among patients older than 80 years and with a bedridden status, nasogastric tube feeding, or dyspnea symptoms. Bedridden status was an independent predictor of acute critical illness. Through optimization of sampling for COVID-19 and laboratory schedules, both the duration of quarantine and the proportion of acute critical illness among bedridden patients during quarantine exhibited a decreasing trend. There was no COVID-19 nosocomial transmission during the study period. Conclusions The quarantine ward is a key measure to prevent nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 but may carry a potential negative impact on patient care and safety. For patients with multiple comorbidities and a bedridden status, healthcare workers should remain alert to rapid deterioration and unexpected adverse events during quarantine.","output":"The occurrence of and risk factors for developing acute critical illness during quarantine as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coastal tourism development can appropriately contribute to the livelihood of the community. To date, few studies have been conducted on the impacts of tourism development on the coastal communities in Thailand. This study assessed these impacts through the analysis of local perceptions based on four criteria of tourism developmentthe economic, environmental, social, and cultural impactsusing a five-point Likert scale. A survey of 116 households (HHs) was conducted at Cha-am Beach in the Gulf of Thailand. We found that the impacts of tourism development on coastal communities were 3.13  1.02 ( refers to standard deviation) for social impact and 2.85  1.03 for economic impact, indicating that tourism development had neutral and positive impacts. However, impacts on the other two criteria were below the average scores, indicating that tourism development had a negative impact on the local environment (2.50  1.05) and local culture (2.41  0.95). For overall impacts, the average score was 2.72  1.02, indicating the coastal communities accepted tourism development in their communities. Nevertheless, as the overall score of tourism development was still far below the maximum point of 5, more efforts by the government as well as the private sector are needed to protect the local culture and coastal communities while improving the positive impacts on economic development and social integrity.","output":"Impacts of Tourism Development on Coastal Communities in Cha-am Beach, the Gulf of Thailand, through Analysis of Local Perceptions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 has emerged as a global pandemic, affecting nearly 104 million people worldwide as of February 4th 2021.

The aim of this study was to re-examine the relationship between the Vit D status of each country and COVID-19 infection, recovery, and mortality using updated data and a different methodological approach. Methods: Information only form the last decade on Vit D concentration/deficiency for each country was retrieved through literature search on PubMed database. As of February, 4th 2021, COVID-19 infections and mortalities per one million population as well as total recoveries were extracted from the Worldometer website. The association between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 infection, recovery, and mortality were explored using correlation coefficients and scatterplots. Results: The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among European countries ranged from 6.0 (Finland) to 75.5% (Turkey), with several countries facing more than 50% of vitamin D deficiency among their population. Non-significant correlations were observed between the number of COVID-19 infections (r=0.190; p=0.374), recoveries (rs=0.317, p=0.131), and mortalities (r=0.129; p=0.549) per one million population, with the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency.

We (i) assessed associations between residential green space and cumulative incidence of, and relief from, loneliness over 4 years; and (ii) explored contingencies by age, sex, disability and cohabitation status. METHODS: Multilevel logistic regressions of change in loneliness status in 8049 city-dwellers between 2013 (baseline) and 2017 (follow-up) in the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia study. Associations with objectively measured discrete green-space buffers (e.g. parks) (<400, <800 and <1600 m) were adjusted for age, sex, disability, cohabitation status, children and socio-economic variables. Results were translated into absolute risk reductions in loneliness per 10% increase in urban greening. RESULTS: The absolute risk of loneliness rose from 15.9% to 16.9% over the 4 years; however, a 10% increase in urban greening within 1.6 km was associated with lower cumulative incident loneliness [odds ratio (OR) = 0.927, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.862 to 0.996; absolute risk reduction = 0.66%]. Stronger association was observed for people living alone (OR = 0.828, 95% CI = 0.725 to 0.944). In comparison to people with <10% green space, the ORs for cumulative incident loneliness were 0.833 (95% CI = 0.695 to 0.997), 0.790 (95% CI = 0.624 to 1.000) and 0.736 (95% CI = 0.549 to 0.986) for 10-20%, 20-30% and >30% green space, respectively. Compared with the <10% green-space reference group with 13.78% incident loneliness over 4 years and conservatively assuming no impact on incident loneliness, associations translated into absolute risk reductions of 1.70%, 2.26% and 2.72% within populations with 10-20%, 20-30% and >30% green space, respectively. These associations were stronger again for people living alone, with 10-20% (OR = 0.608, 95% CI = 0.448 to 0.826), 20-30% (OR = 0.649, 95% CI = 0.436 to 0.966) and >30% (OR = 0.480, 95% CI = 0.278 to 0.829) green space within 1600 m. No age, sex or disability-related contingencies, associations with green space within 400 or 800 m or relief from loneliness reported at baseline were observed.

Efficient viral subtyping enables visualization and modeling of the geographic distribution and temporal dynamics of disease spread. Subtyping thereby advances the development of effective containment strategies and, potentially, therapeutic and vaccine strategies. However, identifying viral subtypes in real-time is challenging: SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus, and the pandemic is rapidly expanding. Viral subtypes may be difficult to detect due to rapid evolution; founder effects are more significant than selection pressure; and the clustering threshold for subtyping is not standardized. We propose to identify mutational signatures of available SARS-CoV-2 sequences using a population-based approach: an entropy measure followed by frequency analysis. These signatures, Informative Subtype Markers (ISMs), define a compact set of nucleotide sites that characterize the most variable (and thus most informative) positions in the viral genomes sequenced from different individuals. Through ISM compression, we find that certain distant nucleotide variants covary, including non-coding and ORF1ab sites covarying with the D614G spike protein mutation which has become increasingly prevalent as the pandemic has spread. ISMs are also useful for downstream analyses, such as spatiotemporal visualization of viral dynamics. By analyzing sequence data available in the GISAID database, we validate the utility of ISM-based subtyping by comparing spatiotemporal analyses using ISMs to epidemiological studies of viral transmission in Asia, Europe, and the United States. In addition, we show the relationship of ISMs to phylogenetic reconstructions of SARS-CoV-2 evolution, and therefore, ISMs can play an important complementary role to phylogenetic tree-based analysis, such as is done in the Nextstrain project. The developed pipeline dynamically generates ISMs for newly added SARS-CoV-2 sequences and updates the visualization of pandemic spatiotemporal dynamics, and is available on Github at https://github.com/EESI/ISM (Jupyter notebook), https://github.com/EESI/ncov_ism (command line tool) and via an interactive website at https://covid19-ism.coe.drexel.edu/.","output":"Genetic grouping of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus sequences using informative subtype markers for pandemic spread visualization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Idarucizumab is a monoclonal antibody fragment with high affinity for dabigatran that reverses its anticoagulant effects within minutes. It may exhibit the potential for patients under dabigatran therapy suffering ischemic stroke to regain eligibility for thrombolysis with rt-PA and may inhibit lesion growth in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage on dabigatran. Aims To provide insights into the clinical use of idarucizumab in patients under effective dabigatran anticoagulation presenting with signs of ischemic stroke or intracranial hemorrhage. Methods Retrospective data collected from German neurological/neurosurgical departments administering idarucizumab following product launch from January to August 2016 were used. Results Thirty-one patients presenting with signs of stroke received idarucizumab in 22 stroke centers. Nineteen patients treated with dabigatran presented with ischemic stroke and 12 patients suffered from intracranial bleeding. In patients receiving rt-PA thrombolysis following idarucizumab, 79% benefitted from i.v. thrombolysis with a median improvement of five points in NIHSS. No bleeding complications occurred. Hematoma growth was observed in 2 out of 12 patients with intracranial hemorrhage. The outcome was favorable with a median NIHSS improvement of 5.5 points and mRS 0-3 in 67%. Overall, mortality was low with 6.5% (one patient in each group). Conclusion Administration of rt-PA after reversing dabigatran activity with idarucizumab in case of ischemic stroke is feasible, easy to manage, effective, and appears to be safe.

The current study examined the factors affecting consumers decision-making regarding the use of FOP labels a year after the reform was implemented. METHODS: The survey was conducted between December 2020 and January 2021 and included a sample of 507 participants age 21 and over. The questionnaire included Health Belief Model (HBM) constructs related to food labeling, nutrition habits, media exposure and extent of support for the reform, frequency of using FOP labels, intention to change purchasing and consumption habits in the coming year, and personal details. RESULTS: The study found that 58.5% reported using the FOP labels to some extent. In addition, 70% indicated willingness to change to healthier products in the coming year. The results of the analytical model confirm the validity of the HBM and the other behavioral constructs. In particular, the frequency of using FOP labels increases as the following factors increase: levels of perceived benefits and perceived importance of reading FOP labels, level of perceived importance of healthy nutrition, frequency of conforming to healthy nutrition, and support for the reform. CONCLUSIONS: The study's findings are important for understanding the impact of the new reform and for guiding future complementary actions to increase peoples motivation to use FOP labels.

FPH is the UK's professional standards body for public health specialists and practitioners, with over 4000 members working around the world. FPH has played a leading role in assuring an internationally respected PH workforce, development of robust PH systems; and powerful advocated for the reduction of inequalities and the best conditions for health and wellbeing to flourish. FPH members have been centre stage during the pandemic and their experience and learning is of value to other countries and PH systems. There will be presentations by distinguished senior members of FPH, who have also played significant influential roles in their own professional roles during the pandemic. While the PH pandemic response has been described by commentators as nothing less than heroic, what is clear is that the PH systems and workforce has been under stress, pressure and scrutiny. It's therefore important to understand the nature and impacts of the challenges so that the PH workforce is adequately supported, and PH systems are robust, resilient and fit for purpose. The session will include presentations on: the wellbeing survey conducted by FPH on the impact of the pandemic on health and wellbeing of the public health workforce. an influential report produced by FPH on Functions and standards of a Public Health System as part of efforts to ensure integrated robust PH systems, recognition of the key role of the specialist PH workforce and local Directors of public health at a time when these have been under intense work pressure and scrutiny; and explore activities, experience and learning in response to issues of inequalities, racism and injustice, brought to the fore during the pandemic, and the responses of FPH and its members. These have not been considered as optional extras to the powerful epidemiological analysis and modelling work of PH workforce and the remarkable vaccination programme, but core to the moral mandate of the profession and work of FPH.

Thisstudy aimed to estimate the impact of hypothetical disruptions to organized FIT-based CRC screening programs on short-and long-term CRC incidence and mortality in three countries using microsimulation modelling. Methods Using CRC microsimulation models for Australia (Policy1-Bowel), Canada (OncoSim) and the Netherlands (ASCCAand MISCAN-Colon) participating in the COVID-19 and Cancer Global Modelling Consortium (CCGMC), we simulated a rangeof scenarios to assess the potential impact of disruptions to screening on CRC incidence and mortality. Modelled scenariosvaried by disruption duration (3-, 6-and 12-months), post-disruption participation reduction, and catch-up screeningstrategy (no catch-up, immediate and 6-month delayed catch-up). Results Without catch-up screening, CRC incidence increased by 0.1-0.3 %, 0.2-0.6 %, and 0.4-1.2 % over 2020-2050among individuals aged 50 years and older in the three modelled countries after 3-, 6-, and 12-month disruptions,respectively, compared to undisrupted screening and CRC mortality increased by 0.2-0.5 %, 0.4-1.0 %, and 0.8-2.0 % over2020-2050 among individuals aged 50 years and older compared to undisrupted screening. A 6-month disruption withoutcatch-up resulted in an estimated 3,552, 2,844 and 803-1,803 additional CRC diagnoses and 1,961, 1,319, and 678-881 additional CRC-related deaths in Australia, Canada and the Netherlands, respectively. A post-disruption reduction inparticipation increased CRC diagnoses by 0.2-0.9 % and CRC-related deaths by 0.5-1.6 % compared to undisruptedscreening. Providing catch-up screening minimized this impact to 0.0-0.2 %. Conclusions Although the relative impact of the modelled CRC screening disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemicappears modest, given a high burden of CRC, there is a substantial impact on CRC diagnoses and deaths across allcountries considered. It is crucial that, if disrupted, screening programs ensure participation rates return to previouslyobserved rates and provide catch-up screening wherever possible, as the impact of any disruption could be considerablylarger otherwise.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 related disruptions to colorectal cancer screening programs in threecountries: A comparative modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article examines how middle\\\\class identity is experienced and employed by traditional and neo\\\\middle\\\\class identifiers in India The economically and socially heterogeneous middle\\\\class identifiers vote similarly, but we know very little about what they want out of politics We focus on the subjective experiences of middle\\\\class identifiers, we theorize the expressive function of middle\\\\class identities, and we examine the socially and personally focused core values of traditional middle\\\\class identifiers and neo\\\\middle aspirers We introduce the \\"Class as Social Identity\\" scale and analyze qualitative interviews with strong middle\\\\class identifiers (Study 1) and the 2006, 2012, and 2014 World Values Survey India segments (Study 2) The interviews show that upper middle class and lower middle class identifiers express similar socially focused values but different personally focused values The WVS analyses show convergence of upper\\\\middle\\\\class and lower\\\\middle\\\\class identifiers on conservation and self\\\\transcendence in line with dominant political narratives and divergence on materialism, hedonism, and stimulation in line with their rising differences in income and every\\\\day life pressures We discuss the significance of these findings for the understanding of the political function of middle\\\\class identities in India in the context of heightened Hindu nationalism and recent socioeconomic challenges aggravated by the COVID\\\\19 pandemic [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Political Psychology is the property of Wiley-Blackwell and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Who Is in the Middle: Social Class, Core Values, and Identities in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has affected all of society at different levels. Similarly, COVID-19 has significantly impacted every medical field, including neurosurgery. By exposing scarcities in the healthcare industry and requiring the reallocation of available resources towards the priority setting and away from elective surgeries and outpatient visits, the pandemic posed new, unprecedented challenges to the medical community. Despite the redistribution of resources towards COVID-19 patients and away from elective surgeries, urgent and emergent surgeries for life-threatening conditions needed to be continued. The neurosurgical community, like other specialties not directly involved in the care of COVID-19 patients, initially struggled to balance the needs of COVID-19 patients with those of neurosurgical patients, residents, and researchers. Several articles describing the effect of COVID-19 on neurosurgical practice and training have been published throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, the typical repair model utilizes an acute injury. In recognition of that distinction, our laboratory developed an overuse animal model; however it is unclear whether induced overuse is necessary in the repair model. We studied the repair properties of overuse-induced tendons compared to normal tendons. We hypothesized that histological and mechanical properties would not be altered between the overuse-induced and normal tendons 1 and 4 weeks after repair. Thirty-one adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to either overuse or cage activity for 4 weeks prior to bilateral supraspinatus tendon repair surgery. Rats were sacrificed at 1 and 4 weeks post-surgery and evaluated for histology and mechanics. Results at 1 week showed no clear histologic changes, but increased inflammatory protein expression in overuse tendons. At 4 weeks, percent relaxation was slightly increased in the overuse group. No other alterations in mechanics or histology were observed. Our results suggest that the effects of the surgical injury overshadow the changes evoked by overuse. Because clinically relevant mechanical parameters were not altered in the overuse group, we conclude that when examining tendons 4 weeks after repair in the classic rat supraspinatus model, inducing overuse prior to surgery is likely to be unnecessary.","output":"Effect of overuse-induced tendinopathy on tendon healing in a rat supraspinatus repair model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (mRT-PCR) assay was developed for the simultaneous detection of canine distemper virus (CDV), canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) and canine influenza virus (CIV).

The virus rapidly spread globally, resulting in a major world public-health crisis. The major disease manifestation occurs in the respiratory tract. However further studies documented other systemic involvement. This study investigate histopathologic eye changes in post-mortem material of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Methods Sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded eyes from 5 patients (10 eyes) who died of COVID-19 at the University Hospital in Basel were included. Gross examination and histological evaluation were performed by three independent ophthalmopathologists. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using antibodies against fibrin, cleaved caspase 3 and ACE-2. Five enucleated eyes of patients not infected with SARS-CoV-2 served as control group. All cases have been studied for presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by means of RT-PCR and RNA in situ hybridization. The choroidal vessels of one case were analyzed with electron microscope. Results Ophthalmopathologically, eight eyes from four patients displayed swollen endothelial cells in congested choroidal vessels. No further evidence of specific eye involvement of SARS-CoV-2 was found in any of the patients. In the eight eyes with evidence of changes due to SARS-CoV-2, immunohistochemical staining demonstrated fibrin microthrombi, apoptotic changes of endothelial and inflammatory cells. In control eyes, ACE-2 was detectable in the conjunctiva, cornea, retina and in the choroidea, and displayed significantly lower amounts of stained cells as in COVID-19 eyes. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detectable in both bulbi of 2/5 patients, yet in situ hybridization failed to visualize viruses. Electron microscopy showed no significant results due to the artifacts. Discussion/Conclusion As already described in other organs of COVID-19 patients, the ophthalmological examination revealed-microthrombi, i.e. hypercoagulation and vasculopathy most probably due to endothelial damage. A possible viral spread to the endothelial cells via ACE-2 provides one pathophysiological explanation. The expression of ACE-2 receptors in the conjunctiva hints towards its susceptibility to infection. To what extend eyes function are disrupted by SARS-CoV-2 is subject to further studies, especially in the clinic.","output":"Ocular pathology and occasionally detectable intraocular SARS-CoV-2 RNA in five fatal COVID-19 cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Many African countries have reported fewer COVID-19 cases than countries elsewhere. By the end of 2020, Guinea-Bissau, West Africa, had <2500 PCR-confirmed cases corresponding to 0.1% of the 1.8 million national population. We assessed the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in urban Guinea-Bissau to help guide the pandemic response in Guinea-Bissau. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional assessment of SARS-CoV-2 antibody in a cohort of staff at the Bandim Health Project. METHODS: We measured IgG antibodies using point-of-care rapid tests among 140 staff and associates at a biometric research field station in Bissau, the capital of Guinea-Bissau, during November 2020. RESULTS: Of 140 participants, 25 (18%) were IgG-positive. Among IgG-positives, 12 (48%) reported an episode of illness since the onset of the pandemic. Twenty-five (18%) participants had been PCR-tested between May and September; 7 (28%) had been PCR-positive. Four of these seven tested IgG-negative in the present study. Five participants reported that somebody had died in their house, corresponding crudely to an annual death rate of 4.5/1000 people; no death was attributed to COVID-19. Outdoor workers had a lower prevalence of IgG-positivity. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of the low official number of COVID-19 cases, our serosurvey found a high prevalence of IgG-positivity. Most IgG-positives had not been ill. The official number of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases has thus grossly underestimated the prevalence of COVID-19 during the pandemic. The observed overall mortality rate in households of Bandim Health Project employees was not higher than the official Guinean mortality rate of 9.6/1000 people.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey among adults involved in healthcare and health research in Guinea-Bissau, West Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article identifies the factors associated with the health and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on people working in the textile industry of Lima, Peru, during 2021.

Underlying immune cell activation is a likely culprit. Although immune cells are important for protection against invading pathogens, their chronic overactivation may lead to tissue damage and high blood pressure. Triggers that may initiate immune activation include viral infections, autoimmunity, and lifestyle factors such as excess dietary salt. These conditions activate the immune system either directly or through their impact on the gut microbiome, which ultimately produces chronic inflammation and hypertension. T cells are central to the immune responses contributing to hypertension. They are activated in part by binding specific antigens that are presented in major histocompatibility complex molecules on professional antigen-presenting cells, and they generate repertoires of rearranged T-cell receptors. Activated T cells infiltrate tissues and produce cytokines including interleukin 17A, which promote renal and vascular dysfunction and end-organ damage leading to hypertension.

Vaccine development against chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has been hampered by an inability to conduct efficacy trials due to the unpredictability of CHIKV outbreaks. Therefore, immune correlates are being explored to gain inference into vaccine-induced protection. This study is an in-depth serological characterization of Fab- and Fc-mediated antibody responses in selected phase II clinical trial participants following immunization with the recombinant measles-vectored CHIKV vaccine, MV-CHIK. Antibody comparisons were conducted between participants who received prime and those who received prime-boost vaccine regimens. MV-CHIK vaccination elicited potent Fab-mediated antibody responses (such as CHIKV-specific IgG, neutralization, and avidity), including dominant IgG3 responses, which translated into strong antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis. At 1 month, prime-boost immunization led to significantly greater responses in every measured Fab and Fc antibody parameter.

Nonetheless, antibody avidity and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis remained significantly greater following boost immunization.

In the current study, we address the challenge of sequence-based discovery of proteolytic sites in secreted proteins using machine learning. Results: The results revealed that only half of the extracellular proteolytic sites are currently annotated, leaving over 3600 unannotated ones. Furthermore, we have found that only 6% of the unannotated sites are similar to known proteolytic sites, whereas the remaining 94% do not share significant similarity with any annotated proteolytic site. The computational challenges in these two cases are very different. While the precision in detecting the former group is close to perfect, only a mere 22% of the latter group were detected with a precision of 80%.

However, the individual discrepancies of the current \\"one-size-fits-all\\" strategies for anticancer nanotherapeutics have heralded the need for \\"personalized therapy\\". Benefiting from the special inherency of various cells, diverse cell membrane-coated nanoparticles (CMCNs) were established on a patient-by-patient basis, which would facilitate the personalized treatment of individual cancer patients. CMCNs in a complex microenvironment can evade the immune system and target homologous tumors with a suppressed immune response, as well as a prolonged circulation time, consequently increasing the drug accumulation at the tumor site and anticancer therapeutic efficacy. This review focuses on the emerging strategies and advances of CMCNs to synergistically integrate the merit of source cells with nanoparticulate delivery systems for the orchestration of personalized anticancer nanotherapeutics, thus discussing their rationalities in facilitating chemotherapy, imaging, immunotherapy, phototherapy, radiotherapy, sonodynamic, magnetocaloric, chemodynamic and gene therapy. Furthermore, the mechanism, challenges and opportunities of CMCNs in personalized anticancer therapy were highlighted to further boost cooperation from different fields, including materials science, chemistry, medicine, pharmacy and biology for the lab-to-clinic translation of CMCNs combined with the individual advantages of source cells and nanotherapeutics.","output":"Orchestration of biomimetic membrane coating and nanotherapeutics in personalized anticancer therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Accessory genes occurring between the S and E genes of coronaviruses have been studied quite intensively during the last decades. In porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) the only gene at this location, ORF3, encodes a 224-residues membrane protein shown to exhibit ion channel activity and to enhance virus production. However, little is known about its intracellular trafficking nor about its function during PEDV infection. In this study, two recombinant PEDVs were rescued by targeted RNA recombination, one carrying the full-length ORF3 gene and one from which the gene had been deleted entirely. These viruses as well as a PEDV encoding a naturally truncated ORF3 protein were employed to study the ORF3 protein's subcellular trafficking. In addition, ORF3 expression vectors were constructed to study the protein's independent transport. Our results show that the ORF3 protein uses the exocytic pathway to move to and accumulate in the Golgi area of the cell, similarly in infected and transfected cells. Like the S protein, but unlike the other structural proteins M and N, the ORF3 protein was additionally observed at the surface of PEDV-infected cells. Also the C-terminally truncated ORF3 protein entered the exocytic pathway but it was unable to leave the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and ER-to-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). Consistently, an Yxx? motif essential for ER exit was identified in the C-terminal domain. Finally, despite the use of sensitive antibodies and assays no ORF3 protein could be detected in highly purified PEDV particles, indicating that the protein is not a structural virion component.IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses typically express several accessory proteins. They vary in number and nature, and only one is conserved among most of the coronaviruses, pointing at an important biological function for this protein. PEDV is peculiar in that it expresses just this one accessory protein, termed the ORF3 protein. While its analogues in other coronaviruses have been studied to different extents - indicating they share an ion channel property - little is still known about the features and functions of the PEDV ORF3 protein except for its association with virulence. Here we studied the intracellular trafficking of the ORF3 protein both in infected cells and when expressed independently. In addition, we analyzed the effects of mutations in five sorting motifs in its C-terminal domain and investigated whether the protein, found to follow the same exocytic route by which the viral structural membrane proteins travel, is also incorporated into virions.","output":"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) ORF3 protein is transported through the exocytic pathway."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We assessed if immune responses are enhanced in CD-1 mice by heterologous vaccination with two different nucleic acid-based COVID-19 vaccines: a next-generation human adenovirus serotype 5 (hAd5)-vectored dual-antigen spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) vaccine (AdS+N) and a self-amplifying and -adjuvanted S RNA vaccine (SASA S) delivered by a nanostructured lipid carrier. The AdS+N vaccine encodes S modified with a fusion motif to increase cell-surface expression. The N antigen is modified with an Enhanced T-cell Stimulation Domain (N-ETSD) to direct N to the endosomal/lysosomal compartment to increase the potential for MHC class I and II stimulation. The S sequence in the SASA S vaccine comprises the D614G mutation, two prolines to stabilize S in the prefusion conformation, and 3 glutamines in the furin cleavage region to increase cross-reactivity across variants. CD-1 mice received vaccination by prime > boost homologous and heterologous combinations. Humoral responses to S were the highest with any regimen including the SASA S vaccine, and IgG against wild type S1 and Delta (B.1.617.2) variant S1 was generated at similar levels. An AdS+N boost of an SASA S prime enhanced both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses to both S wild type and S Delta peptides relative to all other vaccine regimens.

More accessible treatment options (e.g., walking) are needed. Our objective is to determine the impact of walking on PPD severity. Methods: A structured search of seven electronic databases for randomized controlled trials published between 2000 and July 29, 2021 was completed. Studies were included if walking was the sole or primary aerobic exercise modality. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted for studies reporting PPD symptoms measured using a clinically validated tool. A simple count of positive/null effect studies was undertaken as part of a narrative summary. Results: Five studies involving 242 participants were included (mean age = a??28.9 years; 100% with mild-to-moderate depression). Interventions were 12 (n = 4) and 24 (n = 1) weeks long. Each assessed PPD severity using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and was included in the meta-analysis. The pooled effect estimate suggests that relative to controls walking yielded clinically significant decreases in mean EPDS scores from baseline to intervention end (pooled mean difference = -4.01; 95% CI: -7.18 to -0.84, I2 = 86%). The narrative summary provides preliminary evidence that walking-only, supervised, and group-based interventions, including 90-120+ minutes per week of moderate-intensity walking, may produce greater EPDS reductions. Conclusions: While limited by a relatively small number of included studies, pooled effect estimates suggest that walking may help mothers manage PPD.

National surveillance encompasses the period since 1 January 1970, with prospective surveillance occurring from 1 October 1993. Over this prospective surveillance period, considerable developments have occurred in pre-mortem diagnostics; in the delineation of new disease subtypes; and in a heightened awareness of prion diseases in healthcare settings. Surveillance practices of the ANCJDR have evolved and adapted accordingly. This report summarises the activities of the ANCJDR during 2020. Since the ANCJDR began offering diagnostic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 14-3-3 protein testing in Australia in September 1997, the annual number of referrals has steadily increased. In 2020, 510 domestic CSF specimens were referred for 14-3-3 protein testing and 85 persons with suspected human prion disease were formally added to the national register. As of 31 December 2020, just over half (44 cases) of the 85 suspect case notifications remain classified as 'incomplete'; 27 cases were excluded through either detailed clinical follow-up (9 cases) or neuropathological examination (18 cases); 18 cases were classified as 'definite' and eleven as 'probable' prion disease. For 2020, sixty percent of all suspected human-prion-disease-related deaths in Australia underwent neuropathological examination. No cases of variant or iatrogenic CJD were identified.

PURPOSE: To assess symptoms and functional impairment and residual pulmonary abnormalities on serial chest CT in COVID-19 survivors discharged from hospital at up to 1-year follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult patients with COVID-19 discharged between March 2020 and June 2020 were prospectively evaluated at 3 months and 1 year, through systematic assessment of symptoms, functional impairments, and thoracic CT as part of the PHENOTYPE study, an observational cohort study in COVID-19 survivors. Lung function testing was limited to participants with CT abnormalities and/or persistent breathlessness. All statistical analyses were performed using Graphpad PRISM Version 9.0 (86) for Mac, GraphPad Software, (www.graphpad.com); Bonferroni corrected p values are stated. RESULTS: Eighty participants (mean age, 59 13 years; 53 men) were assessed. Persistent breathlessness 37 (46%) and cough 17 (21%) were reported at outpatient review (median 97 days [IQR 86-121]). CT scans in 73 participants post-discharge (median 105 days [IQR 95-141]) revealed persistent abnormalities in 41/73 participants (56%), with ground-glass opacification (35/73 [48%]) and bands (27/73 [37%]) predominating. Unequivocal signs indicative of established fibrosis (i.e. volume loss +/- traction bronchiectasis) were present in 9/73 (12%) participants. Higher admission serum C-reactive protein (mg/L), fibrinogen (g/dl), urea (mmol/L) and creatinine (micromol/L), longer hospital stay (days), older age (years) and requirement for invasive ventilation were associated with CT abnormalities at 3-month follow-up. 32/41 (78%) of participants with abnormal 3-month follow-up CT underwent repeat imaging at a median of 364 (360-366) days, with 26/32 (81%) showing further radiological improvement (median 18% [IQR 10C40%]). CONCLUSION: CT abnormalities were common at 3 months after COVID-19 but with signs of fibrosis in a minority. More severe acute disease was linked with CT abnormalities at 3 months.

The discovery of its homologue, ACE2, 20 years ago has led to intensive comparisons of these two enzymes revealing surprising structural, catalytic and functional distinctions between them. ACE2 plays multiple roles not only as a vasopeptidase but also as a regulator of amino acid transport and serendipitously as a viral receptor, mediating the cellular entry of the coronaviruses causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and, very recently, COVID-19. Catalytically, ACE2 functions as a monocarboxypeptidase principally converting the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II to the vasodilatory peptide Ang-(1-7) thereby counterbalancing the action of ACE on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and providing a cardioprotective role. Unlike ACE, ACE2 does not metabolise bradykinin nor is it inhibited by classical ACE inhibitors. However, it does convert a number of other regulatory peptides in vitro and in vivo. Interest in ACE2 biology and its potential as a possible therapeutic target has surged in recent months as the COVID-19 pandemic rages worldwide. This review highlights the surprising discoveries of ACE2 biology during the last 20 years, its distinctions from classical ACE and the therapeutic opportunities arising from its multiple biological roles.","output":"Discovery and characterization of ACE2 - a 20-year journey of surprises from vasopeptidase to COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding the drivers of vaccine acceptance is crucial to the success of COVID-19 mass vaccination campaigns.

As healthcare organizations are labor-intensive, the role of social sustainability in hospitals is more crucial.

The results uncovered certain important facts, which were not expected per se. Job design, coworkers behavior towards work safety, and supervisors role in ensuring work safety are the key factors that influence social sustainability. However, surprisingly, in the eyes of employees, management practices and safety programs/policies do not contribute to the work safety of the hospital under study. Keeping in view the findings, we suggest that management must participate in work safety affairs directly and formulate indigenous policies and programs according to local needs.

However, sensitivities of tests in routine use are unsatisfactory, due to the characteristically low parasitaemias in naturally infected individuals. We have identified a conserved sequence in the repetitive insertion mobile element (RIME) of the sub-genus Trypanozoon and used it to design primers for a highly specific loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) test. The test was used to analyse Trypanozoon isolates and clinical samples from HAT patients. The RIME LAMP assay was performed at 62 C using real-time PCR and a water bath. DNA amplification was detectable within 25 min. All positive samples detected by gel electrophoresis or in real-time using SYTO-9 fluorescence dye could also be detected visually by addition of SYBR Green I to the product. The amplicon was unequivocally confirmed through restriction enzyme NdeI digestion, analysis of melt curves and sequencing. The analytical sensitivity of the RIME LAMP assay was equivalent to 0.001 trypanosomes/ml while that of classical PCR tests ranged from 0.1 to 1000 trypanosomes/ml. LAMP detected all 75 Trypanozoon isolates while TBR1 and two primers (specific for sub-genus Trypanozoon) showed a sensitivity of 86.9%. The SRA gene PCR detected 21 out of 40 Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense isolates while Trypanosoma gambiense-specific glycoprotein primers (TgsGP) detected 11 out of 13 T. b. gambiense isolates. Using clinical samples, the LAMP test detected parasite DNA in 18 out of 20 samples which included using supernatant prepared from boiled blood, CSF and direct native serum. The sensitivity and reproducibility of the LAMP assay coupled with the ability to detect the results visually without the need for sophisticated equipment indicate that the technique has strong potential for detection of HAT in clinical settings. Since the LAMP test shows a high tolerance to different biological substances, determination of the appropriate protocols for processing the template to make it a user-friendly technique, prior to large scale evaluation, is needed.","output":"African trypanosomiasis: Sensitive and rapid detection of the sub-genus Trypanozoon by loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) of parasite DNA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Digital transformation and emerging technologies open a horizon to a new method of teaching and learning and revolutionizes the e-learning industry.

In all these cases, the reported mechanism of antiviral inhibition indicates that the pool of IFITM proteins present in target cells blocks incoming viral particles in endosomal vesicles where they are subsequently degraded. RESULTS: In this study, we describe an additional mechanism through which IFITMs block HIV-1. In virus-producing cells, IFITMs coalesce with forming virions and are incorporated into viral particles. Expression of IFITMs during virion assembly leads to the production of virion particles of decreased infectivity that are mostly affected during entry in target cells. This mechanism of inhibition is exerted against different retroviruses and does not seem to be dependent on the type of Envelope present on retroviral particles. CONCLUSIONS: The results described here identify a novel mechanism through which IFITMs affect HIV-1 infectivity during the late phases of the viral life cycle. Put in the context of data obtained by other laboratories, these results indicate that IFITMs can target HIV at two distinct moments of its life cycle, in target cells as well as in virus-producing cells. These results raise the possibility that IFITMs could similarly affect distinct steps of the life cycle of a number of other viruses.

EVIDENCE OF ACQUISITION: A systematic review on MEDLINE and Embase was conducted up to May 15, 2021. All papers were sorted by abstract and full text by two independent authors. Systematic reviews, commentaries, and studies that did not distinguish status of COVID-19 infection were excluded from review. Patient demographics were recorded along with modality of treatment (endovascular and/or surgical). We analyzed 30-day outcomes, including mortality. Primary outcome was to evaluate clinical characteristic of ALI in patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 in term of location of ischemia, treatment options and 30-day outcomes. EVINDENCE SYNTHESIS: We selected 36 articles with a total of 194 patients. The majority of patients were male (80%) with a median age of 60 years old. The treatment most used was thromboembolectomy (31% of all surgical interventions). A total of 32 patients (19%) were not submitted to revascularization due to critical status. The rate of technical success was low (68%) and mortality rate was high (35%). CONCLUSIONS: This review confirms that Sars-Cov-2 is associated with a high risk of ALI. Further studies are needed to investigate the association and elucidate potential mechanisms, which may include a hypercoagulable state and hyperactivation of the immune response.

Treatment of patients with high-risk bladder cancer (HBC) is time-critical. They often also require adjunctive treatment following their index transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT) including intravesical immunotherapy or cystectomy, thus any delays may result in disease progression and adverse outcomes. We conducted a service improvement project to prioritise patients with newly diagnosed HBC on the waiting list. METHODS: We collected data on all patients with newly diagnosed bladder tumours at the Haematuria Clinic from July 2020 to January 2021 at our District General Hospital, paying particular attention to the following parameters: time interval from flexible cystoscopy (FC) to TURBT;quality of bladder tumour assessment at diagnostic FC;differences in time interval between low-risk bladder cancer (LBC) and HBC. We excluded patients operated on in the emergency setting, those with equivocal findings at FC and those with recurrent bladder cancer. We developed a risk stratification tool based on the NICE guidelines, in order to help triage patients at the Haematuria Clinic into low-risk and high-risk with a view to expediting treatment for those with suspected HBC. On the waiting list request form, those with suspected HBC are listed as Category 2A, and those with low/ intermediate risk as Category 2B. RESULTS: 45 patients had newly diagnosed bladder tumours during that seven-month period. There was a male preponderance overall, with a median age of 73 in the low-risk group, 79.5 in the intermediate-risk and 71.5 in the high-risk group. 60% of patients were inadequately risk-stratified at the time of their index FC. The mean interval from FC to TURBT was 30 days in the low-risk group, 26 in the intermediate-risk group and 31 days in the high-risk group. CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of newly diagnosed bladder cancer patients were inadequately risk-stratified at FC. Moreover, patients with HBC are waiting just as long if not longer than patients with LBC disease for their TURBT. By designing and implementing a simple risk stratification tool to be used at the Haematuria Clinic we have prioritised those with suspected high-risk disease to the top of the waiting list in order to avoid delays and optimise their care.

We verified the uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (EndoU) activity of IBV and found that the EndoU active sites were located in the C terminus of nsp15 and included His223, His238, Lys278, and Tyr334. We further constructed an infectious clone of the IBV-rSD strain (rSD-wild type [WT]) and EndoU-deficient IBVs by changing the codon for the EndoU catalytic residues to alanine. Both the rSD-WT and EndoU-deficient viruses propagated efficiently in embryonated chicken eggs. Conversely, EndoU-deficient viral propagation was severely impaired in chicken embryonic kidney cells, which was reflected in the lower viral mRNA accumulation and protein synthesis. After infecting chickens with the parental rSD-WT strain and EndoU-deficient viruses, the EndoU-deficient virus-infected chickens presented reduced mortality, tissue injury, and viral shedding.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Gram-negative bacteria and (1?3)--D-glucan (BG) of fungi are the two most abundant gut microbial molecules. Due to limited data on the impact of intestinal fungi in CKD mouse models, the influences of gut fungi and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus L34 (L34) on CKD were investigated using oral C. albicans-administered 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6Nx) mice. At 16 weeks post-5/6Nx, Candida-5/6Nx mice demonstrated an increase in proteinuria, serum BG, serum cytokines (tumor necrotic factor-; TNF- and interleukin-6), alanine transaminase (ALT), and level of fecal dysbiosis (Proteobacteria on fecal microbiome) when compared to non-Candida-5/6Nx. However, serum creatinine, renal fibrosis, or gut barrier defect (FITC-dextran assay and endotoxemia) remained comparable between Candida- versus non-Candida-5/6Nx. The probiotics L34 attenuated several parameters in Candida-5/6Nx mice, including fecal dysbiosis (Proteobacteria and Bacteroides), gut leakage (fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran), gut-derived uremic toxin (trimethylamine-N-oxide; TMAO) and indoxyl sulfate; IS), cytokines, and ALT. In vitro, IS combined with LPS with or without BG enhanced the injury on Caco-2 enterocytes (transepithelial electrical resistance and FITC-dextran permeability) and bone marrow-derived macrophages (supernatant cytokines (TNF- and interleukin-1 ; IL-1) and inflammatory genes (TNF-, IL-1, aryl hydrocarbon receptor, and nuclear factor-B)), compared with non-IS activation.

This paper compares telehealth responses to (COrona VIrus Disease 2019) COVID-19 across ten countries to identify lessons learned about the complexity of telehealth during critical response such as in response to a global pandemic. Our overall objective is to develop a health systems-based framework for telehealth implementation to support critical response. METHODS: We sought responses from the members of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Telehealth Working Group (WG) on their practices and perception of telehealth practices during the times of COVID-19 pandemic in their respective countries. We then analysed their responses to identify six emerging themes that we mapped to the World Health Organization (WHO) model of health systems. RESULTS: Our analysis identified six emergent themes. (1) Government, legal or regulatory aspects of telehealth; (2) Increase in telehealth capacity and delivery; (3) Regulated and unregulated telehealth; (4) Changes in the uptake and perception of telemedicine; (5) Public engagement in telehealth responses to COVID-19; and (6) Implications for training and education. We discuss these themes and then use them to develop a systems framework for telehealth support in critical response. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has introduced new challenges for telehealth support in times of critical response. Our themes and systems framework extend the WHO systems model and highlight that telemedicine usage in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is complex and multidimensional. Our systems-based framework provides guidance for telehealth implementation as part of health systems response to a global pandemic such as COVID-19.","output":"Telehealth and the COVID-19 Pandemic: International Perspectives and a Health Systems Framework for Telehealth Implementation to Support Critical Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Protein splicing is a self-catalyzed event where the intervening sequence intein cleaves off, joining the flanking exteins together to generate a functional protein.

Although metal-regulated protein splicing has been more captivating to researchers, metals were shown to only inhibit splicing reactions that confine their application. This is the first study to show the effect of nanoparticles (NPs) on protein splicing. We found that gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) of various sizes can increase the splicing efficiency by more than 50% and the N-terminal cleavage efficiency by more than 45% in Mycobacterium tuberculosis SufB precursor protein. This study provides an effective strategy for engineering splicing-enhanced intein platforms. UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed AuNP interaction with the native protein. Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) analysis suggested a significant reduction in the energy barrier at the N-terminal cleavage site in the presence of gold atom, strengthening our experimental evidence on heightened the N-terminal cleavage reaction. The encouraging observation of enhanced N-terminal cleavage and splicing reaction can have potential implementations from developing a rapid drug delivery system to designing a contemporary protein purification system.","output":"Gold Nanoparticles Augment N-Terminal Cleavage and Splicing Reactions in Mycobacterium tuberculosis SufB"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM AND OBJECTIVE: Emerging translational evidence suggests that epigenetic alterations (DNA methylation, miRNA expression, and histone modifications) occur after external stimuli and may contribute to exacerbated inflammation and the risk of suffering several diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and neurological disorders.

However, the macrocyclic lactone family of compounds has not previously been evaluated for activity against SARS-CoV-2. The present study aims at comparing their anti-viral activity in relevant pulmonary cell lines in vitro. Here, in vitro antiviral activity of the avermectins (ivermectin and selamectin) and milbemycins (moxidectin and milbemycin oxime) were assessed against a clinical isolate from a CHU Montpellier patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 in 2020. Ivermectin demonstrated anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in vitro in human pulmonary cells in comparison to VeroE6 (with EC50 of 1-3 M). Similarly, the other macrocyclic lactones moxidectin, milbemycin oxime and selamectin reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro (with EC50 of 2-5 M). Immunofluorescence assays with ivermectin and moxidectin showed a reduction in the number of infected and polynuclear cells suggesting a drug action on viral cell fusion. However, cellular toxicity of the avermectins and milbemycins during infection showed a very low selectivity index <10 for all compounds. In conclusion, none of these agents appears suitable for human use for its anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity per se, due to low selectivity index.

Here, we apply a new treatment for the microphysical behavior of respiratory fluid droplets to a droplet evaporation/sedimentation model and assess the impact on sedimentation distance, time scale, and particle phase. Above a 100 m initial diameter, the sedimentation outcome for a respiratory droplet is insensitive to composition and ambient conditions. Below 100 m, and particularly below 80 m, the increased settling time allows the exact nature of the evaporation process to play a significant role in influencing the sedimentation outcome. For this size range, an incorrect treatment of the droplet composition, or imprecise use of RH or temperature, can lead to large discrepancies in sedimentation distance (with representative values >1 m, >2 m, and >2 m, respectively). Additionally, a respiratory droplet is likely to undergo a phase change prior to sedimenting if initially <100 m in diameter, provided that the RH is below the measured phase change RH. Calculations of the potential exposure versus distance from the infected source show that the volume fraction of the initial respiratory droplet distribution, in this size range, which remains elevated above 1 m decreases from 1 at 1 m to 0.125 at 2 m.","output":"Accurate Representations of the Microphysical Processes Occurring during the Transport of Exhaled Aerosols and Droplets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global co-19 pandemic changed the various settings of life, including the implementation of the Hajj and related matters such as the pattern of providing guidance to the departing pilgrims The government is continually seeking to improve the quality of the implementation of the hajj, but it always leaves problems, one of which is the implementation of hajj manasik guidance that have not been optimal The level of understanding of pilgrims who are relatively low on fiqh / hajj manasik has not been able to deliver them into pilgrims who have independence and endurance and become a mabrur hajj For this reason, innovation is needed in implementation of the hajj manasik guidance that are trully effective for adequate understanding of the pilgrims to the fiqh / hajj manasik, without having to burden the budget to the governmen An alternative that can be done is independent manasik guidance Independent hajj manasik guidance is a manasik activities are carried out independently by prospective pilgrims, the budget is not provided by the government, and is carried out by the district religious affairs office in collaboration with a hajj officer alumni, alumni of certification hajj guidance participants, Hajj Guidance Group, Indonesian Hajj Fraternity Association, and other competent parties","output":"The Polemic Of Hajj Suspension And Autonomous Manasik Guidance Amid COVID-19 Pandemic As An Alternative To Obtain Mabrur Hajj"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Coagulopathy is one of the characteristics observed in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs) contribute to coagulopathy, though their role in COVID-19 remains unclear. This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence and characteristics of aPLs in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Sera collected from 66 COVID-19 patients who were critically ill and 13 COVID-19 patients who were not critically ill were tested by chemiluminescence immunoassay for anticardiolipin antibodies (aCLs), anti-?2 -glycoprotein I (anti-?2 GPI) (IgG, IgM, and IgA), and IgG anti-?2 GPI-domain 1 (anti-?2 GPI-D1) and IgM and IgG anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin (anti-PS/PT) antibodies were detected in the serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Of the 66 COVID-19 patients in critical condition, aPLs were detected in 31 (47% ). Antiphospholipid antibodies were not present among COVID-19 patients who were not in critical condition. The IgA anti-?2 GPI antibody was the most commonly observed aPL in patients with COVID-19 and was present in 28.8% (19 of 66) of the critically ill patients, followed by IgA aCLs (17 of 66, or 25.8%) and IgG anti-?2 GPI (12 of 66, or 18.2%). For multiple aPLs, IgA anti-?2 GPI + IgA aCLs was the most common antibody profile observed (15 of 66, or 22.7%), followed by IgA anti-?2 GPI + IgA aCL + IgG anti-?2 GPI (10 of 66, or 15.2%). Antiphospholipid antibodies emerge ~35-39 days after disease onset. A dynamic analysis of aPLs revealed 4 patterns based on the persistence or transient appearance of the aPLs. Patients with multiple aPLs had a significantly higher incidence of cerebral infarction compared to patients who were negative for aPLs (P = 0.023). CONCLUSION: Antiphospholipid antibodies were common in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Repeated testing demonstrating medium to high titers of aPLs and the number of aPL types a patient is positive for may help in identifying patients who are at risk of developing cerebral infarction. Antiphospholipid antibodies may be transient and disappear within a few weeks, but in genetically predisposed patients, COVID-19 may trigger the development of an autoimmune condition similar to the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), referred to as \\"COVID-19-induced APS-like syndrome.\\" Long-term follow-up of COVID-19 patients who are positive for aPLs would be of great importance in understanding the pathogenesis of this novel coronavirus.","output":"Antiphospholipid Antibodies in Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The habits of families are affected during the COVID-19 pandemic, with limitations to socialization or visits.

The analysis extends the understanding of intergenerational solidarity between grandparents and grandchildren on TikTok, by highlighting which characteristics or activities they find important to display to other users of the platform. The results suggest that grandparents and grandchildren value qualities of physical touch and family celebrations (i.e. affectual solidarity), and big life events (i.e. normative solidarity).

Diverse genomic- and proteomic databases have been developed to facilitate research using human and rodent models. Current porcine gene databases, however, lack the robust annotation to study pig models that are relevant to human studies and for comparative evaluation with rodent models. Furthermore, they contain a significant number of errors due to their primary reliance on machine-based annotation. To address these deficiencies, a comprehensive literature-based survey was conducted to identify certain selected genes that have demonstrated function in humans, mice or pigs. RESULTS: The process identified 13,054 candidate human, bovine, mouse or rat genes/proteins used to select potential porcine homologs by searching multiple online sources of porcine gene information. The data in the Porcine Translational Research Database ((http://www.ars.usda.gov/Services/docs.htm?docid=6065) is supported by >5800 references, and contains 65 data fields for each entry, including >9700 full length (5 and 3) unambiguous pig sequences, >2400 real time PCR assays and reactivity information on >1700 antibodies. It also contains gene and/or protein expression data for >2200 genes and identifies and corrects 8187 errors (gene duplications artifacts, mis-assemblies, mis-annotations, and incorrect species assignments) for 5337 porcine genes.

Solvation energies, stabilization energies, topological properties have been evaluated as function of acceptors and donors groups present in their structures. ACPS presents the higher reactivity in solution possibly because has the higher nucleophilicity and elecrophilicity indexes while KDH evidence the higher solvation energy probably due to the higher quantity of donors and acceptors groups. NBO studies show that KDH is the most stable in solution. Mapped MEP surfaces have evidenced stronger nucleophilic and electrophilic sites in ACPS, in agreement with the three C=O and two N-H and O-H groups present in this species while KDH has only a C=O group but a total of 19 acceptors and donors groups. From the above studies for six species we can propose that the better potential antiviral candidate to treatment of COVID-19 is ACPS and then, KDH. For a better prediction of the antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties of the proposed compounds, molecular docking calculations were performed by using four structures of COVID-19. Docking results were discussed basing on binding affinities and the interaction types among ligands and different amino acid residues, indicating the powerful ability of KDH and then ACPS ligands on front of the novel coronavirus disease especially for the first and the fourth species (6LU7, 7BTF).","output":"Searching potential antiviral candidates for the treatment of the 2019 novel coronavirus based on DFT calculations and molecular docking"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spatiotemporal organization of oligomeric protein complexes and translocons, such as the supramolecular organizing centers (SMOC) made of MyDDosome and MAVSome, are essential for transcriptional activation of host inflammatory responses and immune metabolisms.

METHODS: This cross-sectional hospital-based study included 2,408,819 patients presenting between August 2010 and February 2020. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of EKC in at least one eye were included as cases. A smaller cohort of patients with acute (1 week) presentation hailing from the district of Hyderabad during the calendar years 2016C2019 was used to perform correlation analysis with the local environmental temperature, rainfall, humidity, and wind speed (data obtained from the Telangana State Development and Planning Society). RESULTS: Overall, 21,196 (0.87%) patients were diagnosed with EKC, of which 19,203 (90.6%) patients had acute onset; among which the cohort from the district of Hyderabad included 1,635 (8.51%) patients. The mean monthly prevalence in this cohort was 0.89% with a peak prevalence in April (1.09%). The environmental parameters of rainfall (r(2) = 0.47/P = 0.0131), humidity (r(2) = 0.65/P = 0.0014), and wind speed (r(2) = 0.56/P = 0.0047) were significantly negatively correlated with the temporal pattern of EKC in the population. There was no visible trend or significant correlation seen with temperature (r(2) = 0.08/P = 0.3793). CONCLUSION: Contrary to popular belief, epidemic viral infections like EKC may not be affected by temperature, but rather by a complex interplay of other environmental factors such as humidity, rainfall, and wind speed. An increase in rainfall, wind speed, and humidity contributes to a lower prevalence of EKC cases during the year.","output":"Epidemic Keratoconjunctivitis in India: Trend Analysis and Implications for Viral Outbreaks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Heart failure (HF) affects an increasing number of geriatric patients.

This was due to the encouragement to stay at home, a lack of capacity at the general practitioner (GP) and an increased reluctance of patients to visit the GP. Moreover, from the 16th of March the Dutch breast cancer screening program was halted and gradually restarted from June onwards. Part of the follow-up visits for breast cancer survivors were also postponed or changed to an appointment by phone. However, it is not known how this affected the incidence of second primary breast cancer (SPBC) and pathologically confirmed breast cancer recurrences. Objective: To investigate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the diagnosis of SPBC and breast cancer recurrences. Methods: Women diagnosed with a pathological confirmed SPBC or recurrence (locoregional recurrences (LRR) + distant metastasis (DM)) between January 1st 2017 and February 28th 2021 were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry, based on diagnoses of the Nationwide Histopathology and Cytopathology Data Network and Archive (PALGA). Patients with a SPBC or recurrence who had their primary breast tumor diagnosed more than five years ago were excluded. March 1st 2020 till February 28th 2021 was regarded as the S COVID-19 period. Incidence was expressed per 100, 000 women, who were diagnosed with breast cancer less than 5 years ago, and who were still alive. Incidence of SPBCs and recurrences was calculated for the total COVID-19 period and for four subperiods, and compared with the corresponding periods in 2017/2019 (averaged). Results: A total of 393 patients were diagnosed with a SPBCs in 2017, 340 in 2018, 299 in 2019, 342 in 2020 and 71 up to February 2021. A total of 447 patients were diagnosed with a recurrence in 2017, 520 in 2018, 516 in 2019, 529 in 2020 and 80 up to February 2021. During the COVID-19 period a total of 449 patients were diagnosed with a SPBCs per 100, 000 breast cancer survivors, this was comparable to the 445 patients diagnosed per year per 100, 000 breast cancer survivors in 2017/2019 (p=0.91) (Table 1). The incidence of SPBCs was significantly lower during March-May 2020 compared to the same period in 2017/2019 (86 vs. 121) (p=0.03), leading to 50 less SPBCs diagnoses. The incidence was higher during June-August 2020 (124 vs. 95), however this was not significant (p=0.09). The incidence of recurrences in the COVID-19 period, and within all four subperiods, was comparable to the incidence in 2017/2019. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic led to a decrease in the detection of SPBCs at the beginning of the pandemic. However, this drop in incidence was caught up in the period thereafter. This might be related to the restart of the regular follow-up visits (partly in real-life consultations), the call to go to the GP in case of complaints and the improved accessibility of the GPs. The incidence of recurrences did not decrease since it includes also DM, which cause worrisome symptoms for which care is sought.","output":"Effect of the COVID outbreak on detection of second primary breast cancer and breast cancer recurrences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the objectives that the scientific community is setting itself is to understand whether acquired immunity and the presence of antibodies against acute coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies protect against reinfection.

Longitudinal data from an earlier time point involving an age-normative social challenge (transition out of high school) were used as a comparison. The comparisons between the transition from high school and the pandemic showed that whereas social anxiety and depressive symptoms increased, loneliness decreased. Participants also reported having slightly more friends and rated the overall quality of their friendships as somewhat higher. Regression analyses revealed that a greater number of friends over time and greater satisfaction with friend electronic communication during the pandemic were most robustly related to lower social and generalized anxiety as well as depressive symptoms, over and above earlier social-emotional wellbeing and a number of relevant correlates. Loneliness was protected by higher quality of friendships, greater contact with friends, as well as more frequent and satisfying electronic communication with friends.

However, they have been either virtually screened or tested so far against mono targets and the potent derivatives of virtually sorted lead molecules remain elusive. We aimed to identify the phytochemicals having potentials to inhibit SARS CoV-2 infection via multiple targets. The selected 132 phytochemicals were virtually screened using a structure based in silico technique against main protease (M(pro)) which is a potential target of SARS CoV-2. Six compounds were selected based on the LibDock scores and further subjected to induced fit docking using the CDOCKER module of DS.

As a result it was initially predicted that the COVID-19 epidemic in Denmark would overwhelm the healthcare system and thus both the diagnosis and treatment of other hospital patients were compromised for an extended period. Aim: To develop a robust method for reliable estimation of the epidemic and the healthcare system load in Denmark, both retrospectively and prospectively. To do this a new pandemic simulation had to be developed that accounts for the size and the infection impact of the infectious incubating and asymptomatic infected individuals (dark numbers). Methods: Our epidemic simulation is based on a SEIRS (Susceptible - Exposed - Infected - Recovered - Susceptible) model, coupled to a simple healthcare model that also includes deaths outside hospital settings. The SEIRS model has separate assessments of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases with different immunological memories. The main data used for parameter estimation in the models are hospital and ICU occupations, death data, serological data of antibody prevalence from the onset through August 2020 together with hospital data and clinical data about the viral infection. Optimal model parameters are in part identified by Monte Carlo based Least Square Error methods while micro-outbreaks are modeled by noise and explored in Monte Carlo simulations. Estimates for the infected population sizes are obtained by using a quasi steady state method. Results: The age adjusted antibody prevalence in the general population in May 2020 was 1.37%, which yields a relative frequency of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases of 1 to 5.2. Due to the large asymptomatic population found, the actual mortality rate to date is 0.4%. However, with no behavioral and policy restrictions the COVID-19 death toll would have more than doubled the national average yearly deaths within a year. The transmission rate Ro was 5.4 in the initial free epidemic period, 0.4 in the lock-down period and 0.8 -1.0 in the successive re-opening periods through August 2020. The estimated infected population size July 15 to August 15 was 2,100 and 12,200 for October 1 - 20, 2020. The efficiency of the applied daily testing strategy for both periods are estimated to be 40% of the PCR observable infected. Of more theoretical interest we demonstrate how the critical infection parameters for COVID-19 are tightly related in a so-called iso-symptomatic infection diagram. Conclusions: Our simulation may be useful if a major infection wave occurs in the winter season as it could make robust estimates both for the scale of an ongoing expanding epidemic and for the expected load on the healthcare system. Our simulation may also be useful to assess a future controlled epidemic, e.g. as a basis for evaluating different testing strategies based on estimated infected population sizes. Finally, we believe our simulation can be adjusted and scaled to other regions and countries, which we illustrate with Spain and the US.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics in Denmark, February through October 2020: Nature of the past epidemic and how it may develop in the future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses recognize a variety of receptors using different domains of their envelope-anchored spike protein. How these diverse receptor recognition patterns affect viral entry is unknown. Mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) is the only known coronavirus that uses the N-terminal domain (NTD) of its spike to recognize a protein receptor, CEACAM1a. Here we determined the cryo-EM structure of MHV spike complexed with mouse CEACAM1a. The trimeric spike contains three receptor-binding S1 heads sitting on top of a trimeric membrane-fusion S2 stalk. Three receptor molecules bind to the sides of the spike trimer, where three NTDs are located. Receptor binding induces structural changes in the spike, weakening the interactions between S1 and S2. Using protease sensitivity and negative-stain EM analyses, we further showed that after protease treatment of the spike, receptor binding facilitated the dissociation of S1 from S2, allowing S2 to transition from pre-fusion to post-fusion conformation. Together these results reveal a new role of receptor binding in MHV entry: in addition to its well-characterized role in viral attachment to host cells, receptor binding also induces the conformational change of the spike and hence the fusion of viral and host membranes. Our study provides new mechanistic insight into coronavirus entry and highlights the diverse entry mechanisms used by different viruses.","output":"Structure of mouse coronavirus spike protein complexed with receptor reveals mechanism for viral entry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the first case of COVID-19 in Ireland was recorded policy makers have introduced mitigation measures to control the spread of infection.

There is little or no knowledge of the scale of the hidden prevalence of all infections both asymptomatic and symptomatic in Ireland. Furthermore, as governments plan for the roll out of imminent immunisation programmes, the need to know the scale of the hidden prevalence and hence knowledge of the level of immunisation required is essential. We describe and analyse the numbers of reported cases of COVID-19 in Ireland from the first case in February 2020 to mid-December 2020. Using the method of back-calculation we provide estimates of the asymptomatic prevalence of cases from June to December 2020. The descriptive analysis highlighted two epidemic waves of known cases in the time period. Wave two from June to December included twice as many cases as wave one and cases were significantly younger. The back-calculation estimates of asymptomatic prevalence during this time period revealed that for every case known there was an additional unknown case and total prevalence in wave two was estimated to be approximately 95,000 as opposed to the reported 48,390 cases. As prevalence in wave two is known to be spreading within and from younger age groups the role of mixing patterns on spread needs to be disseminated to the wider public to adequately inform them how personal modifications in behaviour can contribute to the control of the epidemic. While universally imposed lockdowns and mitigation measures may be essential, personal behavioural mixing choices are powerful protectors.","output":"The second wave: estimating the hidden asymptomatic prevalence of COVID-19 in Ireland as we plan for imminent immunisation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) can complicate the clinical course of COVID-19 and are associated with a significant increase in mortality, especially in critically ill patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). This narrative review concerns 4099 cases of IFIs in 58,784 COVID-19 patients involved in 168 studies. COVID-19-associated invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) is a diagnostic challenge because its non-specific clinical/imaging features and the fact that the proposed clinically diagnostic algorithms do not really apply to COVID-19 patients. Forty-seven observational studies and 41 case reports have described a total of 478 CAPA cases that were mainly diagnosed on the basis of cultured respiratory specimens and/or biomarkers/molecular biology, usually without histopathological confirmation. Candidemia is a widely described secondary infection in critically ill patients undergoing prolonged hospitalisation, and the case reports and observational studies of 401 cases indicate high crude mortality rates of 56.1% and 74.8%, respectively. COVID-19 patients are often characterised by the presence of known risk factors for candidemia such as in-dwelling vascular catheters, mechanical ventilation, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. We also describe 3185 cases of mucormycosis (including 1549 cases of rhino-orbital mucormycosis (48.6%)), for which the main risk factor is a history of poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (>76%). Its diagnosis involves a histopathological examination of tissue biopsies, and its treatment requires anti-fungal therapy combined with aggressive surgical resection/debridement, but crude mortality rates are again high: 50.8% in case reports and 16% in observational studies. The presence of other secondary IFIs usually diagnosed in severely immunocompromised patients show that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of stunning the host immune system: 20 cases of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, 5 cases of cryptococcosis, 4 cases of histoplasmosis, 1 case of coccidioides infection, 1 case of pulmonary infection due to Fusarium spp., and 1 case of pulmonary infection due to Scedosporium.","output":"Invasive Fungal Infections Complicating COVID-19: A Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this work, we performed an analysis of the networks of interactions between drugs and their targets to assess how connected the compounds are. For our purpose, the interactions were downloaded from the DrugBank database, and we considered all drugs approved by the FDA. Based on topological analysis of this interaction network, we obtained information on degree, clustering coefficient, connected components, and centrality of these interactions. We identified that this drug-target interaction network cannot be divided into two disjoint and independent sets, i.e., it is not bipartite. In addition, the connectivity or associations between every pair of nodes identified that the drug-target network is constituted of 165 connected components, where one giant component contains 4376 interactions that represent 89.99% of all the elements. In this regard, the histamine H1 receptor, which belongs to the family of rhodopsin-like G-protein-coupled receptors and is activated by the biogenic amine histamine, was found to be the most important node in the centrality of input-degrees. In the case of centrality of output-degrees, fostamatinib was found to be the most important node, as this drug interacts with 300 different targets, including arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase or ALOX5, expressed on cells primarily involved in regulation of immune responses. The top 10 hubs interacted with 33% of the target genes. Fostamatinib stands out because it is used for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia in adults. Finally, 187 highly connected sets of nodes, structured in communities, were also identified. Indeed, the largest communities have more than 400 elements and are related to metabolic diseases, psychiatric disorders and cancer.

The results showed that the samples were composed mainly of P2O5 (18%), SiO2 (17%), Na2O (16%), CaO (14%) and SO3 (10%). Moreover, chemical analysis clearly demonstrated that medical waste (MW) contains large amounts of waste generated by domestic activities in the hospital, with a lack of sorting system in the monitoring of MW. Furthermore, the ashes contained high concentrations of heavy metals such as zinc, lead, chromium and nickel with a vast range of 0.5-25071 mg/kg. Leaching tests showed that the extracted amounts of all the heavy metals were lower, with concentrations < 2.85 mg/kg.

In most studies xeno-transplants of hAEC were conducted without providing immunosuppression to recipients, reflecting the tolerogenic properties of hAEC. For many cell types, successful cryopreservation is critical for providing a readily available, off-the-shelf product. In this study, hAEC were isolated from full-term human placenta from 14 different donors, cryopreserved using a protocol and reagents commonly adopted for epithelial cell preservation. The cells were analyzed in terms of survival, recovery, and homogeneity, profiled for surface markers characteristic of epithelial, mesenchymal, endothelial, or hematopoietic cells. There were no significant differences observed in the percentage of cells with epithelial cell markers before and after cryopreservation. The relative proportion of stromal and hematopoietic cells was significantly reduced in hAEC preparations after cryopreservation. The expression of stem cell and immunomodulatory molecules were confirmed in the final product.

In severe COVID-19 infection, many immune cells and their products are involved, making management difficult.

The complications associated with the cytokine storm include severe respiratory distress, intravascular coagulation, multi-organ failure, and death. The enormous formation of interleukin (IL)-6 and hemopoietic factors such as granulocyteCmacrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) are implicated in the severity of the infection. Moreover, these inflammatory cytokines and factors signal through the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway causing the activation of cytokine-related genes.

Nasopharyngeal swab sampling is a discomforting procedure sometimes with adverse effects, which also poses a risk for infection for the personnel performing the sampling. We have developed a new method for concentrating biological samples, which enabled us to use gargle and mouthwash samples to be used in RT-PCR, for the diagnosis of COVID-19, as an alternative to nasopharyngeal swab samples. We have analyzed nasopharyngeal and gargle and mouthwash samples, before and after concentration, of 363 patients by RT-PCR for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. Among 114 patients in which SARS-CoV-2 was identified in at least one of their samples, the virus was identified in 76 (66.7%), 67 (58.8%), and 101 (88.6%) of nasopharyngeal swab, gargle, and mouthwash samples before and after concentration, respectively. When concentrated by our new method, gargle and mouthwash samples can be used instead of nasopharyngeal samples in identification of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR, with the same or better sensitivity. Eliminating the need for nasopharyngeal sampling will save the patients from an invasive and painful procedure and will lower the risk of infection for the healthcare personnel taking the sample.

In particular, circular migration remains poorly captured as circular migrants move back and forth between source and destination regions. Based on survey data from rural Bihar, an important source region of migration in India, this paper finds that a vast majority of migrants work and live in precarity in predominantly urban and prosperous destinations across India. However, those at the lowest rungs of the social and economic ladder in source regions-the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, other backward classes I and the labouring class-are the worst off at destination; they are part of the most precarious shorter-term migration streams, earn the lowest incomes, have the poorest conditions of work, and live in the harshest circumstances. The paper shows that social and economic hierarchies, and in turn, precarity in source region is reproduced at destination, and, thus, there is little evidence that spatial mobility is associated with social mobility. Focusing on migrants' location, work, employment, income, housing, and access to basic services at destination, the paper foregrounds migrant precarity and adds to a small body of empirical literature that is significant in understanding the spatial and structural elements of circular migration in India and in turn, the migration crisis that emerged as a result of the economic shock of the COVID 19 pandemic.","output":"Circular Migration and Precarity: Perspectives from Rural Bihar"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We study celestial amplitudes in (super) Yang-Mills theory using a parameterisation of the spinor helicity variables where their overall phase is not fixed by the little group action.

Starting from the classical SEIR model, the model is modified so as to better describe characteristic features of the underlying pathogen and its infectious modes. In line with the large number of secondary infections not related to contact with documented infectious individuals, the model includes a cohort of asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic infectious individuals, not accounted for in the data of new daily counts of infections. A Bayesian particle filtering algorithm is used to update dynamically the relevant cohort and simultaneously estimate the transmission rate as the new data on the number of new infections and disease related death become available. The underlying assumption of the model is that the infectivity rate is dynamically changing during the epidemics, either because of a mutation of the pathogen or in response to mitigation and containment measures. The sequential Bayesian framework naturally provides a quantification of the uncertainty in the estimate of the model parameters, including the reproduction number, and of the size of the different cohorts. Moreover, we introduce a dimensionless quantity, which is the equilibrium ratio between asymptomatic and symptomatic cohort sizes, and propose a simple formula to estimate the quantity. This ratio leads naturally to another dimensionless quantity that plays the role of the basic reproduction number $R_0$ of the model. When we apply the model and particle filter algorithm to COVID-19 infection data from several counties in Northeastern Ohio and Southeastern Michigan we found the proposed reproduction number $R_0$ to have a consistent dynamic behavior within both states, thus proving to be a reliable summary of the success of the mitigation measures.","output":"Bayesian dynamical estimation of the parameters of an SE(A)IR COVID-19 spread model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rapid screening of infected people plays a crucial role in interrupting infection chains. However, the current methods for identification of bacteria are very tedious and labor intense. Fast on-site screening for pathogens based on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) could help to differentiate between healthy and potentially infected subjects. As a first step towards this, the feasibility of differentiating between seven different bacteria including resistant strains was assessed using IMS coupled to multicapillary columns (MCC-IMS). The headspace above bacterial cultures was directly drawn and analyzed by MCC-IMS after 90 min of incubation. A cluster analysis software and statistical methods were applied to select discriminative VOC clusters. As a result, 63 VOC clusters were identified, enabling the differentiation between all investigated bacterial strains using canonical discriminant analysis. These 63 clusters were reduced to 7 discriminative VOC clusters by constructing a hierarchical classification tree. Using this tree, all bacteria including resistant strains could be classified with an AUC of 1.0 by receiver-operating characteristic analysis. In conclusion, MCC-IMS is able to differentiate the tested bacterial species, even the non-resistant and their corresponding resistant strains, based on VOC patterns after 90 min of cultivation. Although this result is very promising, in vivo studies need to be performed to investigate if this technology is able to also classify clinical samples. With a short analysis time of 5 min, MCC-IMS is quite attractive for a rapid screening for possible infections in various locations from hospitals to airports. Key Points ? Differentiation of bacteria by MCC-IMS is shown after 90-min cultivation. ? Non-resistant and resistant strains can be distinguished. ?

This nanogold patterned support has several advantages. The Si(3)N(4) window provides a 50 nm thin, strong and flat support with a 0.7 mm(2) large electron-beam transparent window. The nanogold pattern has a user-defined size and density, is highly regular and stable. This facilitates accurate tracking during tilt series acquisition, provides sufficient contrast for accurate alignment during the image reconstruction step and avoids an uneven lateral distribution and movement of individual fiducials.

The condition was initially only linked with respiratory disorders. After the evolution of various variants of the SARS-CoV-2, the critical impact of the virus spread to multiple organs and soon, neurological disorder manifestations started to appear in the infected patients. The review is focused on the manifestation of various neurological disorders linked with both the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system. Disorders such as cytokine release syndrome, encephalitis, acute stroke, and Bells palsy are given specific attention and psychological manifestations are also investigated. For a clear conclusion, cognitive impairment, drug addiction disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder are all fully examined. The association of the SARS-CoV-2 with neurological disorders and pathway is yet to be clear. For better understanding, the explanation of the possible mechanism of viral infection influencing the nervous system is also attempted in the review.

The National and Regional Health System has been reorganized, and many oncological patients died during this period or had to interrupt their therapies. This study summarizes a single-centre experience, during the COVID-19 period in Italy, in the treatment of brain metastases with Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery (GKRS). METHODS: We retrospectively analysed our series of patients with brain metastases who underwent GKRS at the Niguarda Hospital from February 24 to April 24, 2020. RESULTS: We treated 30 patients with 66 brain metastases. A total of 22 patients came from home and 8 patients were admitted to the emergency room for urgent neurological symptoms. Duration of stay was limited to 0C1 day in 17 patients. We chose to treat a cluster of 9 patients, whose greater lesion exceeded 10 cm(3), with 2-stage modality GKRS to minimize tumour recurrence and radiation necrosis. CONCLUSION: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the whole world is at a critical crossroads about the use of health care resources. During the COVID-19 outbreak, the deferral of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and a work backlog in every medical specialty are the natural consequences of reservation of resources for COVID-19 patients. GKRS improved symptoms and reduced the need for open surgeries, allowing many patients to continue their therapeutic path and sparing beds in ICUs. Neurosurgeons have to take into account the availability of stereotactic radiosurgery to reduce hospital stay, conciliating safety for patients and operators with the request for health care coming from the oncological patients and their families.","output":"Gamma Knife Radiosurgery for Treatment of Brain Metastases during the COVID-19 Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and purpose: Protecting healthcare workers on the front line of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is very important. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of COVID-19 in hospital staff and its relationship with influenza vaccine in 2020. Materials and methods: A descriptive-analytical study was performed in 4446 staff working in public hospitals in Mazandaran province, Iran. The sample size was calculated using the Cochran's formula and the participants were selected by simple random sampling. Demographic and therapeutic information were collected using an electronic checklist. Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics and Chi-square test and analysis of variance using SPSS V21. Results: In this study, 1388 (31.21%) cases were infected with COVID-19 and 3058 (68.79%) had no history of the disease. In people with and without COVID-19, 384 (27.66%) and 761 (24.88%) were men, respectively. According to findings, the rate of COVID-19 infection was lower in individuals who received influenza vaccine compared to non-infected people, but there was no significant difference between these groups in receiving influenza vaccine within a year ago (P = 0.07). Conclusion: In present study, the influenza vaccine did not have a protective role against COVID-19.

Design/methodology/approach The paper employed a qualitative approach via an examination of industry analysis and discussion with industry experts in tourism, cruising and luxury yachting. Findings Based on industry analysis and discussion with key stakeholders, the finding is that the luxury yacht industry responded well to its market from the onset of the pandemic, and will continue on this path in both luxury and sporting yacht categories. To regain customer support after the long period of travel restrictions, cruise lines will have to significantly reduce their prices in order to stimulate demand. This, coupled with approximately 40% reductions in load capacity is a blow to the industry. Hence, this calls for the industry to commit itself to the present safety protocols, which are an added cost to their operations. In contrast, the luxury yacht industry is presented with a golden opportunity as a result of these constraints as it can stimulate revenue through charters and rentals. Practical implications There was never anticipation of a global pandemic that would bring tourism operations to a total halt. The question is, what recovery strategies have been employed by the small island states that have invested millions of US dollars over the last two decades in expanding or developing new cruise ports? Given the historical perspective for Errol Flynn Marina in Port Antonio, Jamaica, the Port Authority of Jamaica can reposition the Marina to take advantage of the new opportunity that has been created for the yacht industry by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Social implications It is likely that more Caribbean nationals will be employed on luxury yachts as compared with the less than 5% of Caribbean nationals employed on cruise ships prior to the pandemic. Originality/value The economies of most Caribbean Islands and many other small island developing states (SIDSs) are heavily dependent on tourism;specifically cruise tourism during the cruise season. Some of these countries continue to anticipate a quick recovery for the cruise industry. This anticipation may not yield an immediate result because of the protocols that are needed in response to the pandemic. This paper shows that in the mid to long-term, the returns from significant investment in port development must be realized and the luxury yacht industry presents one such opportunity. This paper is helpful because the present outlook for cruising is not good, and so a new approach and strategy must be put in place to develop new products.","output":"An analysis of the post-COVID-19 cruise industry: Could this be a new possibility for the luxury yacht sector in the Caribbean?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ivermectin is a broad-spectrum antiparasitic drug with anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, anti-bacterial, and anti-tumor effects.

Furthermore, previous research has indicated that psychiatrists are exposed to a number of unique stressors that may increase their risk for poor mental health. The aims of the present study were to assess the level of COVID-19 related concerns, psychological distress and life satisfaction among psychiatrists and other physicians during the first period of the pandemic and to examine whether individual differences in COVID-19 concerns, psychological flexibility, psychological resilience and coping behaviors account for differences in mental health indicators. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The sample consisted of N=725 physicians, among whom 22.8% were psychiatrists. This study was conducted online during the first lockdown in Croatia and collected data regarding COVID-19 related concerns, coping behaviors and mental health indicators (Psychological Distress and Life Satisfaction). RESULTS: Physicians of other specialties had higher scores on a measure of COVID-19 anxiety than psychiatrists (p=0.012). In addition, a number of differences in coping behaviors are evident. Specifically, psychiatrists were less likely than physicians of other specializations to believe that being informed about COVID-19 is an effective coping strategy (p=0.013), but more prone to using sedatives and drugs as a coping strategy (p=0.002; p=0.037).

Healthcare workers have previously been shown to have experienced higher rates of infection than the general population. We aimed to assess the extent of infection in staff working in our healthcare setting. DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of antibody results, compared with staff demographic data, and exposure to patients with COVID-19 infection. SETTING: A large teaching hospital in the North West of England. PARTICIPANTS: 4474 staff in diverse clinical and non-patient facing roles who volunteered for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing by the Roche Elecsys assay between 29 May and 4 July 2020. RESULTS: Seroprevalence was 17.4%. Higher rates were seen in Asian/Asian British (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.27 to 2.04) and Black/Black British (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.25 to 3.45) staff. Staff working in any clinical location were more likely to be seropositive (OR 2.68, 95% 2.27 to 3.15). Staff were at an increased risk of seropositivity as the 'per 100 COVID-19 bed-days change' increased in the clinical area in which they worked (OR 1.12, 95% 1.10 to 1.14). Staff working in critical care were no more likely to have detectable antibodies than staff working in non-clinical areas. Symptoms compatible with COVID-19 were reported in 41.8% and antibodies were detected in 30.7% of these individuals. In staff who reported no symptoms, antibodies were detected in 7.7%. In all staff who had detectable antibodies, 25.2% reported no symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Staff working in clinical areas where patients with COVID-19 were nursed were more likely to have detectable antibodies. The relationship between seropositivity in healthcare workers and the increase in 'per 100 COVID-19 bed-days' of the area in which they worked, although statistically significant, was weak, suggesting other contributing factors to the risk profile. Of staff with detectable antibodies and therefore evidence of prior infection, a quarter self-reported that they had experienced no compatible symptoms.

Physical activity has been shown to improve mental as well as physical health. Increasing activity levels should be prioritized as a treatment target, especially when the barriers to exercise are greater than ever. Promoting physical activity has not traditionally been the remit of psychologists. Yet psychological theory and therapeutic techniques can be readily applied to address physical inactivity. We present theoretical perspectives and therapy techniques relating to (1) beliefs about physical activity, (2) motivation to be physically active, and (3) the sense of reward achieved through being physically active. We outline strategies to initiate and maintain physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic, thereby benefitting mental and physical health.

Therefore, it is paramount to identify the views of the community regarding how to allocate such resources. This study aims to quantify Australian community preferences for ventilation allocation. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment was designed and administrated to an adult Australian online panel. Each survey respondent answered 12 choice sets from a total design of 120. Each choice set placed the respondent in the role of hypothetical decision maker, prioritising care between two patients. Conditional logit, mixed logit regression and latent class analysis were used to analyse the data. Additionally, we asked a series of attitudinal questions about different methods of making such decisions in practice, focusing on who should be responsible. RESULTS: A total of 1050 community members completed the survey and responded to each choice. Dimensions considered most important were age, likely effectiveness, smoking status, whether the person has dependents, whether they are a healthcare worker, and whether they have a disability or not. Estimating marginal rates of substitution between patient characteristics and chance of survival if ventilated yielded values of up to 30 percentage points if the patient was 70 years old relative to being 30. However, respondents typically said they would prefer such decisions to be made by medical professionals. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the preferences of the community to allocation of ventilators during the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of such information should be treated with some caution as the underlying reason for such preferences are unclear, and respondents themselves preferred the decision to be made by others.","output":"Public Preferences for Allocating Ventilators in an Intensive Care Unit: A Discrete Choice Experiment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundAs at end of July 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic has been less severe in sub-Saharan Africa than elsewhere. In Malawi, there have been two subsequent epidemic waves. We therefore aimed to describe the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in Malawi. MethodsWe measured the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among randomly selected blood donor sera in Malawi from January 2020 to February 2021. In a subset, we also assesed in vitro neutralisation against the original variant (D614G WT) and the Beta variant. FindingsA total of 3586 samples were selected from the blood donor database, of which 2685 (74.9%) were male and 3132 (87.3%) were aged 20-49 years. Of the total, 469 (13.1%) were seropositive. Seropositivity was highest in October 2020 (15.7%) and February 2021 (49.7%) reflecting the two epidemic waves. Unlike the first wave, both urban and rural areas had high seropositivity by February 2021, Balaka (rural, 37.5%), Blantyre (urban, 54.8%), Lilongwe (urban, 54.5%) and Mzuzu (urban, 57.5%). First wave sera showed potent in vitro neutralisation activity against the original variant (78%[7/9]) but not the Beta variant (22% [2/9]). Second wave sera potently neutralised the Beta variant (73% [8/11]). InterpretationThe findings confirm extensive SARS-CoV-2 exposure in Malawi over two epidemic waves with likely poor cross-protection to reinfection from the first on the second wave. Since prior exposure augments COVID-19 vaccine immunity, prioritising administration of the first dose in high SARS-CoV-2 exposure settings could maximise the benefit of the limited available vaccines in Malawi and the region. Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed on August 16, 2021, with no language restrictions, for titles and abstracts published between Jan 1, 2020, and August 16, 2021, using the search terms: \\"SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Africa\\"[Title/Abstract]) OR \\"SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in blood donors\\" [Title/Abstract] OR \\"SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Malawi\\", and found 15 records. There are limited SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence studies in sub Saharan Africa, however the few that are available report high seroprevalence than can be deduced from the respective national reported COVID-19 cases and deaths. Only two published SARS-CoV-2 serosurveys were done on blood donors, from Kenya and Madagascar. Blood donor serosurveys have been recommended by the WHO as an important tool for assessing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and estimating the burden of COVID-19 pandemic. Added value of this studyUnlike previous SARS-CoV-2 blood donor serosurveys in African populations that were conducted for a maximum period of 9 months, our study covers a full year from January 2020 to February 2021, capturing potential introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into Malawi as well as the two epidemic waves. This study provides evidence against the speculation that SARS-CoV-2 had been circulating more widely in sub-Saharan Africa before the first detected cases. It also provides supporting evidence suggesting that the Beta variant was the likely driver of the second wave that resulted in high SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in January to February 2021 in Malawi. Implications of all the available evidenceOur results show extensive community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Malawi as reflected in the blood donors serosurvey, with almost half the sample population being seropositive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by February 2021. This has implications for COVID-19 vaccination policy in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where there are limited available vaccine doses. Considering that prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 augments COVID-19 vaccine immunity, strategies to maximise administration of the first vaccine dose, while waiting for more vaccines to become available, could maximise the benefits of the limited available vaccines in high SARS-CoV-2 exposure settings in SSA such as Malawi.","output":"Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in Malawian blood donors: a retrospective seroprevalence analysis between January 2020 and February 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The virus receptors are key for the viral infection of host cells.

Identifying measures and when they appeared are critical questions to assess emergency response strategies. The objective of this study was to analyze the policy response to slow down the infection rate of COVID-19 cases in Portugal and Spain according to timing (related to death rates) and stringency. METHODS: A descriptive comparative study of non-pharmaceutical interventions was conducted through a content analysis of policies and records review of official government sources. Portugal and Spain were selected considering the similarities between national health systems, but different government organization and epidemic impact. The Autonomous Community of Madrid was also included as example of subnational systems. Death rates were retrieved from daily statistics of open secondary sources. RESULTS: Results show that countries responded with a complex mix of measures across policy sectors, following dynamic patterns established by the epidemic evolution and governance systems. Policies aimed to reduce the spread of the virus, enable individuals and businesses to comply with restrictions, and reinforce National Health System's capacity. The declaration of state of emergency was a critical tool to organize actions under clear leadership, especially in devolved contexts. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that, in early epidemic phases, a centralized command can be more effective at timely enacting nationwide stringent measures. Evidence from this study contributes to the argument that a fast, robust, and early response might have been more effective at containing spread at the initial stages of the pandemic.

Curbing the spread of COVID-19 and future pandemics may be accomplished through understanding the environmental context of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and adoption of effective detection tools and mitigation policies. This article aims to examine the latest investigations on SARS-CoV-2 plausible environmental transmission modes, employment of wastewater surveillance for early detection of COVID-19, and elucidating the role of solid waste, water, and atmospheric quality on viral infectivity. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via faecal-oral or bio-aerosols lacks robust evidence and remains debatable. However, improper disinfection and defected plumbing systems in indoor environments such as hospitals and high-rise towers may facilitate the transport of virus-laden droplets of wastewater causing infection. Clinical and epidemiological studies are needed to present robust evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is transmissible via aerosols, though quantification of virus-laden aerosols at low concentrations presents a challenge. Wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 can be an effective tool in early detection of outbreak and determination of COVID-19 prevalence within a population, complementing clinical testing and providing decision makers guidance on restricting or relaxing movement. While poor air quality increases susceptibility to diseases, evidence for air pollution impact on COVID-19 infectivity is not available as infections are dynamically changing worldwide. Solid waste generated by households with infected individuals during the lockdown period may facilitate the spread of COVID-19 via fomite transmission route but has received little attention from the scientific community. Water bodies receiving raw sewage may pose risk of infection but this has not been investigated to date. Overall, our understanding of the environmental perspective of SARS-CoV-2 is imperative to detecting outbreak and predicting pandemic severity, allowing us to be equipped with the right tools to curb any future pandemic.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 in the environment: Modes of transmission, early detection and potential role of pollutions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current investigation was conducted with the objective to develop an epidemiological case definition of possible severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) re-infection and assess its magnitude in India. The epidemiological case definition for SARS-CoV-2 re-infection was developed from literature review of data on viral kinetics. For achieving second objective, the individuals who satisfied the developed case definition for SARS-CoV-2 re-infection were contacted telephonically. Taking available evidence into consideration, re-infection with SARS-CoV-2 in our study was defined as any individual who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on two separate occasions by either molecular tests or rapid antigen test at an interval of at least 102 days with one negative molecular test in between. In this archive based, telephonic survey, 58 out of 1300 individuals (4.5%) fulfilled the above-mentioned definition; 38 individuals could be contacted with healthcare workers (HCWs) accounting for 31.6% of the cases. A large proportion of participants was asymptomatic and had higher Ct value during the first episode. While SARS-CoV-2 re-infection is still a rare phenomenon, there is a need for epidemiological definition of re-infection for establishing surveillance systems and this study contributes to such a goal. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) re-infection is an emerging concern and there is a need to define it. Therefore, working epidemiological case definition for re-infection was developed and its magnitude was explored via archive-based, telephonic survey.

The study involved 6 healthy international crew members of the SIRIUS-19 project aged 34  6.2 years (3 women and 3 men). Body Weight Unloading (BWU) conditions was created by the h/p/cosmos airwalk system. The locomotor test included walking (3.5  0.3 km/h) with a sequential change of BWU modes: 5-min walking with 0% BWU (1 G), 5-min walking with 65% BWU (0.35 G) and 5-min walking with 85% BWU (0.15 G). Ground Reaction Force was recorded by the h/p/cosmos treadmill device. Muscle Lab Model 4000e device was used to record the electromyographic signals of the hip and shin muscles. The locomotor test was performed twice before GBI, monthly during GBI and 1 week after leaving isolation. The results obtained before GBI demonstrate that the changes of support and proprioceptive afferentation signals play significant role in reorganizing of the biomechanical structure of motor acts and the development of new movement patterns. The results of the study are consistent with the previously obtained results of other studies in this direction. Despite the fact that during the GBI the participants of the experiment performed regular physical training, a decrease in the performance indicators values was detected, especially pronounced after 100 days of GBI. This is probably due to limited space of a space station model, as well as the development of a special motor stereotype in it.

The clinical picture varies from mild to critical cases; however, all of these signs already show neurological problems, from sensory loss to neurological diseases. Thus, patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) infected with the new coronavirus are more likely to develop severe conditions; in addition to worsening the disease, this is due to the high level of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which is closely associated with increased mortality both in COVID-19 and MS. This increase is uncontrolled and exaggerated, characterizing the cytokine storm, so a possible therapy for this neuronal inflammation is the modulation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, since acetylcholine (ACh) acts to reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines and acts directly on the brain for being released by cholinergic neurons, as well as acting on other cells such as immune and blood cells. In addition, due to tissue damage, there is an exacerbated release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), potentiating the inflammatory process and activating purinergic receptors which act directly on neuroinflammation and positively modulate the inflammatory cycle. Associated with this, in neurological pathologies, there is greater expression of P2X7 in the cells of the microglia, which positively activates the immune inflammatory response. Thus, the administration of blockers of this receptor can act in conjunction with the action of ACh in the anticholinergic inflammatory pathway. Finally, there will be a reduction in the cytokine storm and triggered hyperinflammation, as well as the level of mortality in patients with multiple sclerosis infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the development of possible neurological damage.

Finally, we found that state orders were only associated with small increases in staying home in low-income neighbourhoods. Our findings indicate that people in lower-income neighbourhoods have faced barriers to physical distancing, particularly needing to work outside the home, and that state physical distancing policies have not mitigated these disparities.","output":"Neighbourhood income and physical distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Patients who survived hospitalization for COVID-19 experienced varying durations of illness but the factors associated with prompt recovery are unknown. This study identifies factors differentiating hospitalized patients who recovered promptly vs. survived a prolonged course of illness due to COVID-19. Methods: This was a retrospective study from March-August 2020 of hospitalized adults with COVID-19 which were grouped based on time to recovery: short ( 3 days), intermediate (4-10 days), and prolonged (>10 days). Recovery was defined as resolution of fever, tachypnea, hypotension, extubation and return of mental status at baseline. Multivariate analysis was used to evaluate factors associated with prompt recovery. Results: Among 508 patients hospitalized for COVID-19, 401 (79%) survived. Of those, prompt recovery (within 3 days) was achieved in 43% (174/401) whereas 23% (92/401) recovered after a prolonged period of > 10 days. Overall, median age was 64 y with 73% admitted from home and 25% from a skilled nursing facility. Predictors for prompt recovery upon admission included female sex (OR, 1.8;95% CI, 1.1-2.7;p = 0.01), no fever (OR, 1.6;95% CI, 1.1-2.6;p = 0.03), longer time from symptom onset to hospitalization (OR, 1.1;95% CI, 1.0-1.1;p = 0.001), no supplemental oxygen (OR, 1.9;95% CI, 1.2-3.0;p = 0.004), no direct ICU admission (OR, 41.7;95% CI, 2.4-740.4;p = 0.01) and absence of bacterial co-infections (OR, 2.5;95% CI, 1.5-4.0, p = 0.0003). Conclusions: Our study provides relevant data that could help clinicians triage competing resources in health systems that are challenged by the ebb and flow of COVID-19 cases by identifying clinical features of COVID-19 patients who may require less intensive management including avoidance of unnecessary antibacterial therapy.","output":"Factors Associated with Prompt Recovery among Hospitalized Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Urban Heat Island (UHI), driven in part by urban green space transformation, and resulting in bioclimatic stress, is one of the major environmental problems facing cities today. A brief reprise in UHI severity is hypothesised to have occurred for many cities during COVID-19 lockdown, as a result of the marked reduction in individual and industrial activities. This study explores the UHI the city of Esfahan, one of the major metropolises of Iran, comparing the urban temperature for the period 20 March to 20 April 2020, the first lockdown period in Iran, with a long term mean for this month calculated from 2000-2019. During the lockdown period, the UHI effect covered a much smaller land area than in all prior years investigated. The land surface area which experienced heat stress reduced significantly during the lockdown period, and the total energy heating requirement (heat degree days) increased by 23,945.2 degree day calories compared to the long term average. These results demonstrate the significant changes in UHI and related variables during lockdown.

Codon usage bias not only plays an important regulatory role at the level of gene expression, but also helps in improving the accuracy and efficiency of translation. Meanwhile, codon usage pattern of Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome is important for interpreting evolutionary characteristics in species. In order to investigate the codon usage pattern of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome, 12 Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes from different area are downloaded from the GeneBank. The correlations between G(3), GC(12), whole GC content, codon adaptation index, codon bias index, and so on of Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes are calculated. The ENC-plot, relationship between A(3)/(A(3) + T(3)) and G(3)/(G(3) + C(3)), GC(12) versus GC(3) plot, and the RSCU of overall/separated genomes all show that the codon usage bias exists in all 12 Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes. Lastly, relationship between CBI and the equalization of ENC shows a strong negative correlation between them. The relationship between protein length and GC content (GC(3) and GC(12)) shows that more obvious differences in the GC content may be in shorter protein.

WNV infection of the brain leads to neuroinflammation characterized by activation of microglia, the resident phagocytic cells of the central nervous system (CNS). In this study, depletion of CNS microglia using the CSF1R antagonist PLX5622 increased the viral load in the brain and decreased the survival of mice infected with WNV (strain TX02). PLX5622 was also used in ex vivo brain slice cultures (BSCs) to investigate the role of intrinsic neuroinflammatory responses during WNV infection. PLX5622 effectively depleted microglia (>90% depletion) from BSCs resulting in increased viral titers (3 to 4-fold increase in PLX5622-treated samples) and enhanced virus-induced caspase 3 activity and cell death. Microglia depletion did not result in widespread alterations in cytokine and chemokine production in either uninfected or WNV infected BSCs. The results of this study demonstrated how microglia contribute to limiting viral growth and preventing cell death in WNV infected BSCs but were not required for the cytokine/chemokine response to WNV infection. This study highlighted the importance of microglia in the protection from neuroinvasive WNV infection and demonstrated that microglia responses were independent of WNV-induced peripheral immune responses. IMPORTANCE WNV infections of the CNS are rare but can have devastating long-term effects. There are currently no vaccines or specific antiviral treatments, so a better understanding of the pathogenesis and immune response to this virus is crucial. Previous studies have shown microglia to be important for protection from WNV, but more work is needed to fully comprehend the impact these cells have on neuroinvasive WNV infections. This study used PLX5622 to eliminate microglia in an ex vivo brain slice culture (BSC) model to investigate the role of microglia during a WNV infection. The use of BSCs provided a system in which immune responses innate to the CNS could be studied without interference from peripheral immunity. This study will allow for a better understanding of the complex nature of microglia during viral infections and will likely impact the development of new therapeutics that target microglia.","output":"Depletion of Microglia in an Ex Vivo Brain Slice Culture Model of West Nile Virus Infection Leads to Increased Viral Titers and Cell Death"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a market for sustainability investing is growing rapidly, understanding the impact of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) activities on firms financial performance is becoming increasingly important. In this study, we examine the effect of ESG performance on stock returns and volatility during the financial crisis resulting from the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. To quantify the impact, we use company-level daily ESG score data and United Nations Global Compact (GC) score data. In our dataset, ESG scores indicate ESG performance that is deemed important to financial materiality, and the GC score indicates the firm reputation for following UN rules. Our results indicate that during the pandemic, an increase in the ESG score, especially the E score component, is related to higher returns and lower volatility. Conversely, increasing GC scores is correlated with lower stock returns and higher volatility. In addition, we find that firms in lower return groups benefit more than other firms. Focusing on energy sector impacts, we show that although the non-energy sector benefits more than the energy sector from increasing E scores, energy sector firms can still reduce their stock price volatility by increasing these scores.

A major challenge is the added burden of coinfections such as viral hepatitis, tuberculosis and various sexually transmitted infections in terms of prevention, treatment and increased morbidity in individuals with HIV infection. A need for combination prevention strategies, tailored to high-risk key populations arises and technology-based interventions can be a valuable asset. The COVID-19 pandemic challenged the delivery of existing services and added stress to existing public health and clinical structures but also highlighted the potential of exploiting technical solutions for interventions regarding infectious diseases. In this paper we report the design process, results and evaluation findings from the pilots of RiskRadara web and mobile application aiming to support combination prevention, testing and linkage to care for HIV, viral hepatitis, various sexually transmitted infections and tuberculosis. METHODS: RiskRadar was developed for the INTEGRATE Joint Actions aim to improve, adapt and pilot innovative digital tools for combination prevention. RiskRadar was designed iteratively using informed end-user-oriented approaches. Emphasis was placed on the Risk Calculator that enables users to assess their risk of exposure to one or more of the four disease areas, make informed decisions to seek testing or care and adjust their behaviours ultimately aiming to harm/risk reduction. RiskRadar has been piloted in three countries, namely Croatia, Italy and Lithuania. RESULTS: RiskRadar has been used 1347 times across all platforms so far. More than 90% of users have found RiskRadar useful and would use it again, especially the Risk Calculator component. Almost 49.25% are men and 29.85% are in the age group of 25C34. The application has scored 5.2/7 in the User Experience Questionnaire, where it is mainly described as supportive and easy-to-use. The qualitative evaluation of RiskRadar also yielded positive feedback. CONCLUSIONS: Pilot results demonstrate above average satisfaction with RiskRadar and high user-reported usability scores, supporting the idea that technical interventions could significantly support combination prevention actions on Sexually Transmitted Infections.","output":"RiskRadar: development and pilot results of a technical intervention targeting combination prevention regarding HIV, viral hepatitis, sexually transmitted infections and tuberculosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this cross-national longitudinal study was to identify a change in mental health indicators: coronavirus-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), perceived stress, and fear of vaccination (FoVac).

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: During the COVID-19 Pandemic, utilizing virtual learning modalities is expanding rapidly. While the innovative methods must be considered to bridge the surgical education gap, a framework is needed to avoid expansion of virtual education without proper supporting evidence in some areas. METHODS: The Association for Surgical Education formed an ad-hoc research group to evaluate the quality and methodology of the current literature on virtual education and to build evidence-based guidelines by utilizing the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN) methodology. We identified PICO-style questions, conducted systematic literature reviews using PubMed, Embase, and ERIC databases. Then we formulated evidence-based recommendations, assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE, NOS-E and Kirkpatrick ratings, and conducted Delphi consensus to validate the recommendations. RESULTS: Eleven PICO-style questions were designed by the expert committees. After screening 4723 articles by the review committee, 241 articles met inclusion criteria for full article reviews, and 166 studies were included and categorized into three domains: cognition and curricula (n = 92), psychomotor, (n = 119) and faculty development (n = 119).

Among 142 primarily evaluated patients with documented COVID-19, 110 patients (men/women, 63/47; mean age, 62.3  15.3 years) met inclusion/exclusion criteria. More than 30 EchoCG parameters were analyzed, and baseline data (comorbidities, oxygen saturation, laboratory data, complications, outcomes, etc.) were evaluated. ROC-analysis was used for evaluating the diagnostic significance of different EchoCG parameters for prediction of a specific outcome and its probability. Dependence of the overall survival of patients on different EchoCG parameters was analyzed with the Cox proportional hazards model. For assessing the predictive value of EchoCG parameters for patient stratification by risk of an adverse outcome, a predictive model was developed using the CHAID method.Results The in-hospital death rate of patients included into the study was 15.5 %, and the death rate for this period of in-hospital observation was 12 %. Based on the single-factor analysis of EchoCG parameters, a multifactor model was developed using the method of Cox regression. The model included two predictors for an unfavorable outcome, estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (EPASP) and maximal indexed right atrial volume (RAi), and a preventive factor, right ventricular global longitudinal strain (LS RV). Base risks for fatal outcome were determined with an account of the follow-up time. According to the obtained values, an increase in EPASP by 1 mm Hg was associated with increases in the risk of fatal outcome by 8.6 % and in the RA(i) volume by 1 ml/5.8 %. LS RV demonstrated an inverse correlation; a 1% increase in LS RV was associated with a 13.4% decrease in the risk for an unfavorable outcome. According to the ROC analysis, the most significant determinants of the outcome were the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) (AUC, 0.84  0.06; cut-off, 18 mm) and EPASP (AUC, 0.86  0.05; cut-off, 42 mm Hg). Evaluating the effects of different EchoCG predictors, that characterized the condition of the right heart, provided a classification tree. Six final decisions were determined in the model, two of which were assigned to the category of reduced risk for fatal outcome and four were assigned to the category of increased risk. Sensitivity of the classification tree model was 94.1 % and specificity was 89.2 %. Overall diagnostic significance was 90.02.9 %.Conclusion The presented models for statistical treatment of EchoCG parameters reflect the requirement for a comprehensive analysis of EchoCG parameters based on a combination of standard methods for EchoCG evaluation and current technologies of noninvasive visualization. According to the study results, the new EchoCG marker, LS RV, allows identifying the signs of right ventricular dysfunction (particularly in combination with pulmonary hemodynamic indexes), may enhance the early risk stratification in patients with COVID-19, and help making clinical decisions for patients with different acute cardiorespiratory diseases.","output":"[Right ventricular systolic dysfunction as a predictor of adverse outcome in patients with COVID-19]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The molecular epidemiology of the virus and mapping helps understand the epidemics' evolution and apply quick control measures.

The etiology is still unknown. Typical clinical manifestations change with age, and symptoms are atypical in infants, thus the diagnosis could be late. This is based on increased opening pressure at lumbar puncture, papilloedema and normal cerebral MRI. The measurement of cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure in infants is an issue because many factors may affect it, and data about normal values are scanty. The mainstay of treatment is acetazolamide, which allows to relieve symptoms and to avoid permanent visual loss if promptly administered. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of an 8-month-old infant admitted because of vomit, loss of appetite and irritability; later, also bulging anterior fontanel was observed. Cerebral MRI and cerebrospinal fluid analysis resulted negative and after two lumbar punctures he experienced initial symptom relief. Once the diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension was made, he received oral acetazolamide, and corticosteroids, with progressive symptom resolution. CONCLUSIONS: Infantile idiopathic intracranial hypertension is extremely rare, and not well described yet. Bulging anterior fontanel in otherwise healthy infants with normal neuroimaging should be always considered suggestive, but can be a late sign, while irritability and anorexia, especially if associated with vomiting, may represent an early sign. In such cases, lumbar puncture should be always done, hopefully with cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure measurement, which is among coded diagnostic criteria, but whose threshold is controversial in infants.

The symptoms of COVID-19 include muscle pains, loss of taste and smell, coughs, fever, and sore throat, which can lead to severe cases of breathing difficulties, organ failure, and death. Thus, the early detection of the virus is very crucial. COVID-19 can be detected using clinical tests, making us need to know the most important symptoms/features that can enhance the decision process. In this work, we propose a modified multilayer perceptron (MLP) with feature selection (MLPFS) to predict the positive COVID-19 cases based on symptoms and features from patients electronic medical records (EMR). MLPFS model includes a layer that identifies the most informative symptoms to minimize the number of symptoms base on their relative importance. Training the model with only the highest informative symptoms can fasten the learning process and increase accuracy. Experiments were conducted using three different COVID-19 datasets and eight different models, including the proposed MLPFS. Results show that MLPFS achieves the best feature reduction across all datasets compared to all other experimented models. Additionally, it outperforms the other models in classification results as well as time. ? 2022 Tech Science Press.

Adopting a constructionist perspective, I investigate how Osakas criminal justice activism has, in the broader context of the development of celebrity culture, been subjectively motivated and inter-subjectively received by the public and in the news media. Theoretically this paper has the two-fold objective of developing a model of the conditions favorable to the successful reception of celebrity activism and, additionally, of suggesting how such criminologically relevant activism can be understood in terms of a process of celebritization of criminal justice and police reform as causes worthy of attention.

However, without consideration of the needs of specific populations, public health interventions can exacerbate health inequities. AIM: The purpose of this rapid review was to determine if and how health inequities were included in the design of contact tracing interventions in epidemic settings. METHODS: A search of the electronic databases MEDLINE and Web of Science was conducted. The following inclusion criteria were applied for article selection: (1) described the design of contact tracing interventions, (2) published between 2013 and 2020 in English, French, Spanish, Chinese, or Portuguese, (3) and included at least 50% of empiricism, according to the Automated Classifier of Texts on Scientific Studies (ATCER) tool. Various tools were used to extract data. RESULTS: Following screening of the titles and abstracts of 230 articles, 39 met the inclusion criteria. Only seven references were retained after full text review. None of the selected studies considered health inequities in the design of contact tracing interventions. CONCLUSIONS: The use of tools/concepts for incorporating health inequities, such as the REFLEX-ISS tool, and 'proportionate universalism' when designing contact tracing interventions, would enable practitioners, decision-makers, and researchers to better consider health inequities.","output":"Accounting for health inequities in the design of contact tracing interventions: A rapid review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Graphene and graphene-related materials (GRMs) exhibit a unique combination of electronic, optical, and electrochemical properties, which make them ideally suitable for ultrasensitive and selective point-of-care testing (POCT) devices.

However, the lives of children have been substantially disrupted by the pandemic through physical distancing measures and the impact on health systems and economies. In this study, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospital admissions for childhood respiratory infections, severe invasive infections, and vaccine preventable disease in England was assessed along with associated mortality outcomes.Methods: In this population-based observational study, we examined hospital admission data from every National Health Service hospital from Mar 1 2017 to Feb 28 2021. We report monthly and annual numbers of individuals hospitalised with 19 common childhood respiratory, severe invasive, and vaccine preventable infections. We compare the frequency of admissions for these conditions before and after the onset of the pandemic in England and calculate percentage changes since Mar 1 2020 for each infection overall and by demographic characteristics including age, region, deprivation, and comorbidity, and quantify mortality outcomes.Findings: In the 12 months from Mar 1 2020, there were significant reductions compared with the preceding 36 months in the numbers of children admitted for every infection studied except pyelonephritis. These reductions were seen in all geographic regions, Index of Multiple Deprivation categories, ethnic groups and in those with underlying comorbidities. Among the respiratory infections, the greatest percentage reductions were for influenza where the number of individuals admitted decreased by 94% (95% CI 88, 97) from 5,061 (annual mean from Mar 1 2017 - Feb 29 2020) to 290 in the 12 months after Mar 1 2020, and for bronchiolitis where the number of individuals admitted decreased by over 80% (95% CI 78, 83) from 41,777 (annual mean 2017C2020) to 7,883 in 2020-21. Among the severe invasive infections, percentage decreases ranged from 20% (95% CI 13, 26) for osteomyelitis to 54% (95% CI 51, 56) for meningitis. Among the vaccine preventable infections, the greatest reduction was for measles, where the number of individuals admitted in the 12 months after Mar 1 2020 (n=12) was 92% lower (95% CI 84, 96) than the average number admitted in the previous three years (n=143). Admissions for Neisseria meningitidis decreased by 70% (95% CI 55, 80), and admissions for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and mumps more than halved. Alongside the decreases in admissions, there were also decreases in the absolute numbers of 60-day fatalities after admission for sepsis, meningitis, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, viral wheeze and upper respiratory tract infection (RTI). For pneumonia, although the absolute number of 60-day fatalities decreased (from a 3-year average of 159 to 115 after Mar 1 2020), the proportion of individuals admitted who died within 60 days increased (age-sex adjusted odds ratio 1.73, 95% CI 1.42, 2.11).Interpretation: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a range of behavioural changes (adoption of non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs)) and societal strategies (school closures, lockdowns and restricted travel) were used to reduce transmission of SARS CoV2 which have also significantly reduced transmission of common and severe childhood infections. NPIs could be used in the future to better protect healthcare systems and the most vulnerable children in society.Funding Information: Public Health England, Health Data Research UK, and the National Institute for Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre.Declaration of Interests: None to declare.

Together, these imply approximately 96-98% cases in Delhi remained unreported (July 10, 2020). Updated calculations using training data during March 15-December 31, 2020 yield estimated underreporting factor for cases at 13-22 (deaths: 3-7) on January 23, 2021, which are again consistent with the latest (fifth) round of serosurveys for Delhi (done during January 15-23, 2021) with an estimated 56.13% IgG antibody prevalence, yielding an estimated range for the underreporting factor for cases at 17-21.

The ability to model its transmission characteristics is critical to minimize its impact. In fact, predicting how fast an infection is spreading could be a major factor in deciding on the severity, extent and strictness of the applied mitigation measures, such as the recent lockdowns. Even though modelling epidemics is a well studied subject, usually models do not include quarantine or other social measures, such as those imposed in the recent pandemic. The current work builds upon a recent paper by Maier and Brockmann (2020), where a compartmental SIRX model was implemented. That model included social or individual behavioral changes during quarantine, by introducing state [Formula: see text] , in which symptomatic quarantined individuals are not transmitting the infection anymore, and described well the transmission in the initial stages of the infection. The results of the model were applied to real data from several provinces in China, quite successfully. In our approach we use a Monte-Carlo simulation model on networks. Individuals are network nodes and the links are their contacts. We use a spreading mechanism from the initially infected nodes to their nearest neighbors, as has been done previously. Initially, we find the values of the rate constants (parameters) the same way as in Maier and Brockmann (2020) for the confirmed cases of a country, on a daily basis, as given by the Johns Hopkins University. We then use different types of networks (random Erd?s-Rnyi, Small World, and Barabsi-Albert Scale-Free) with various characteristics in an effort to find the best fit with the real data for the same geographical regions as reported in Maier and Brockmann (2020).
