The pandemic has been a tough test for all European national health systems and their capability to provide an adequate reaction. METHODS: The present work aims to reveal correlations between parameters such as COVID-19 incidence, ICU bed occupancy, ICU excess area, and mortality in Italian regions. Public data for the period of March 1 to July 16, 2020, were analyzed using several mathematical and statistical methods. RESULTS: The analysis defined two separate groups of Italian regions. The examined variables considered within these groups were interlinked and dependent on each other. The regions of the two groups shared the same kind of fitted model (linear) explaining mortality as a function of cumulative incidence, but with higher value of the constant in one group, so characterized by a high intrinsic \\"strength\\" of the pandemic, certainly playing a major role in the generation of a large number of severe and life-threatening cases. These results are confirmed at European level. Other factors may condition mortality and be linked to incidence, such as ICU saturation and excess. CONCLUSIONS: These quantitative results could be a very helpful tool to set up preventive measures and optimize biomedical interventions before the pandemic, in its recurrent waves, could overcome the reaction capacity of any public health system.","output":"COVID-19 cumulative incidence, intensive care, and mortality in Italian regions compared to selected European countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: The diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in an intensive care unit (ICU)remains a challenge and the COVID-19 epidemic makes it even harder Here, we evaluatedAspergillus PCR input to help classifying IA in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients (2) Methods: 45COVID-19 patients were prospectively monitored twice weekly for Aspergillus markers and anti-Aspergillus serology We evaluated the concordance between () Aspergillus PCR and culture inrespiratory samples, and () blood PCR and serum galactomannan Patients were classified asputative/proven/colonized using AspICU algorithm and two other methods (3) Results: Theconcordance of techniques applied on respiratory and blood samples was moderate (kappa = 0 58and kappa = 0 63, respectively), with a higher sensitivity of PCR According to AspICU, 9/45 patientswere classified as putative IA When incorporating PCR results, 15 were putative IA because theymet all criteria, probably with a lack of specificity in the context of COVID-19 Using a modifiedAspICU algorithm, eight patients were classified as colonized and seven as putative IA (4)Conclusion: An appreciation of the fungal burden using PCR and Aspergillus serology was addedto propose a modified AspICU algorithm This proof of concept seemed relevant, as it was inagreement with the outcome of patients, but will need validation in larger cohorts","output":"Is the COVID-19 Pandemic a Good Time to Include Aspergillus Molecular Detection to Categorize Aspergillosis in ICU Patients?

Given its inherent nature, social distancing measures are proposed as the primary strategies to curb the spread of this pandemic. Therefore, identifying situations where these protocols are violated, has implications for curtailing the spread of the disease and promoting a sustainable lifestyle. This paper proposes a novel computer vision-based system to analyze CCTV footage to provide a threat level assessment of COVID-19 spread. The system strives to holistically capture and interpret the information content of CCTV footage spanning multiple frames to recognize instances of various violations of social distancing protocols, across time and space, as well as identification of group behaviors. This functionality is achieved primarily by utilizing a temporal graph-based structure to represent the information of the CCTV footage and a strategy to holistically interpret the graph and quantify the threat level of the given scene. The individual components are tested and validated on a range of scenarios and the complete system is tested against human expert opinion. The results reflect the dependence of the threat level on people, their physical proximity, interactions, protective clothing, and group dynamics. The system performance has an accuracy of 76%, thus enabling a deployable threat monitoring system in cities, to permit normalcy and sustainability in the society.","output":"Holistic Interpretation of Public Scenes Using Computer Vision and Temporal Graphs to Identify Social Distancing Violations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The energy trade is an important pillar of each country's development, making up for the imbalance in the production and consumption of fossil fuels. Geopolitical risks affect the energy trade of various countries to a certain extent, but the causes of geopolitical risks are complex, and energy trade also involves many aspects, so the impact of geopolitics on energy trade is also complex. Based on the monthly data from 2000 to 2020 of 17 emerging economies, this paper employs the fixed-effect model and the regression-discontinuity (RD) model to verify the negative impact of geopolitics on energy trade first and then analyze the mechanism and heterogeneity of the impact. The following conclusions are drawn: First, geopolitics has a significant negative impact on the import and export of the energy trade, and the inhibition on the export is greater than that on the import. Second, the impact mechanism of geopolitics on the energy trade is reflected in the lagging effect and mediating effect on the imports and exports; that is, the negative impact of geopolitics on energy trade continued to be significant 10 months later. Coal and crude oil prices, as mediating variables, decreased to reduce the imports and exports, whereas natural gas prices showed an increase.

With arising concerns of sustainability, alternative sources of vegetal lecithin are urgently needed, and their metabolic effects must be characterized. OBJECTIVES We evaluated the impact of increasing doses of rapeseed lecithin (RL), rich in essential -linolenic acid (ALA), on postprandial lipid metabolism and ALA bioavailability in lymph-cannulated rats. METHODS Male Wistar rats (8 weeks old) undergoing a mesenteric lymph duct cannulation were intragastrically administered 1 g of an oil mixture containing 4% ALA and 0, 1, 3, 10, or 30% RL (5 groups). Lymph fractions were collected for 6 h. Lymph lipids and chylomicrons (CMs) were characterized. The expression of genes implicated in intestinal lipid metabolism was determined in the duodenum at 6 h. Data was analyzed using either sigmoidal or linear mixed-effects models, or one-way ANOVA, where appropriate. RESULTS RL dose-dependently increased the lymphatic recovery (AUC) of total lipids (1100 g/mLh per additional RL%; P = 0.010) and ALA (50 g/mLh per additional RL%; P = 0.0076). RL induced a faster appearance of ALA in lymph, as evidenced by the exponential decrease of the rate of appearance of ALA with RL (R2 = 0.26; P = 0.0064). Although the number of CMs was unaffected by RL, CM diameter was increased in the 30%-RL group, compared to the control group (0% RL), by 86% at 3-4 h (P = 0.065) and by 81% at 4-6 h (P = 0.0002) following administration. This increase was positively correlated with the duodenal mRNA expression of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (Mttp; = 0.63; P = 0.0052). The expression of Mttp and secretion-associated, ras-related GTPase 1 gene homolog B (Sar1b, CM secretion), carnitine palmitoyltransferase IA (Cpt1a) and acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 1 (Acox1, beta-oxidation), and fatty acid desaturase 2 (Fads2, bioconversion of ALA into long-chain n-3 PUFAs) were, respectively, 49%, 29%, 74%, 48%, and 55% higher in the 30%-RL group vs. the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS In rats, RL enhanced lymphatic lipid output, as well as the rate of appearance of ALA, which may promote its subsequent bioavailability and metabolic fate.","output":"Rapeseed Lecithin Increases Lymphatic Lipid Output and -Linolenic Acid Bioavailability in Rats."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Studies investigating the effects of cold-water immersion (CWI) on the recovery of athletic performance, perceptual measures and creatine kinase (CK) have reported mixed results in physically active populations. OBJECTIVES The purpose of this systematic review was to investigate the effects of CWI on recovery of athletic performance, perceptual measures and CK following an acute bout of exercise in physically active populations. STUDY DESIGN Systematic review with meta-analysis and meta-regression. METHODS A systematic search was conducted in September 2021 using Medline, SPORTDiscus, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EmCare and Embase databases. Studies were included if they were peer reviewed and published in English, included participants who were involved in sport or deemed physically active, compared CWI with passive recovery methods following an acute bout of strenuous exercise and included athletic performance, athlete perception and CK outcome measures. Studies were divided into two strenuous exercise subgroups: eccentric exercise and high-intensity exercise. Random effects meta-analyses were used to determine standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals. Meta-regression analyses were completed with water temperature and exposure durations as continuous moderator variables. RESULTS Fifty-two studies were included in the meta-analyses. CWI improved the recovery of muscular power 24 h after eccentric exercise (SMD 0.34 [95% CI 0.06-0.62]) and after high-intensity exercise (SMD 0.22 [95% CI 0.004-0.43]), and reduced serum CK (SMD - 0.85 [95% CI - 1.61 to - 0.08]) 24 h after high-intensity exercise. CWI also improved muscle soreness (SMD - 0.89 [95% CI - 1.48 to - 0.29]) and perceived feelings of recovery (SMD 0.66 [95% CI 0.29-1.03]) 24 h after high-intensity exercise. There was no significant influence on the recovery of strength performance following either eccentric or high-intensity exercise. Meta-regression indicated that shorter time and lower temperatures were related to the largest beneficial effects on serum CK (duration and temperature dose effects) and endurance performance (duration dose effects only) after high-intensity exercise. CONCLUSION CWI was an effective recovery tool after high-intensity exercise, with positive outcomes occurring for muscular power, muscle soreness, CK, and perceived recovery 24 h after exercise. However, after eccentric exercise, CWI was only effective for positively influencing muscular power 24 h after exercise. Dose-response relationships emerged for positively influencing endurance performance and reducing serum CK, indicating that shorter durations and lower temperatures may improve the efficacy of CWI if used after high-intensity exercise.

However, the complexity of data from cell-based and solid phase assays have led to potential confusion about how to use the results for clinical decision making. Aim: Aim of this study was to compare results of cell-based assay and solid phase assay, to evaluate the usefulness of L-XM for pretransplant detection of HLA class I and II donor-specific IgG antibodies, correlate the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values of class I and class II L-XM assay and with CDC-XM and L-PRA (panel reactive antibodies) results. Methods: In this retrospective study, 380 prospective renal transplant recipients were tested for the presence of HLA antibodies by CDC-XM, IgG-L-XM, IgG-L-PRA & L-SAB screening with their corresponding donor. Results: Fifty-one recipients (13.42%) had a positive CDC-XM. L-XM was positive in 125 recipients (32.89%); class I-L-XM was positive in 46 (36.80%) cases, and class II-L-XM was positive in 58 (46.4%) cases and 21 (16.8%) samples were positive for class I and class II. High background was present in 22 (5.87%) samples, the results of which were confirmed by retesting or by correlation with L-PRA and L-SAB assays. Conclusion: The introduction of more sensitive approaches for the detection of anti-HLA-IgG-antibodies, such as L-XM and L-PRA assay, has allowed the identification of anti-HLA-antibodies in recipient serum which is not usually identified by CDC-XM alone. However, L-XM has some limitations; they can be overcome if we combine this assay with L-PRA.","output":"Significance of Luminex-crossmatch assay and its mean fluorescence intensity - a retrospective observation in 380 renal transplant cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Hangman's fractures are one of the most frequent types of high cervical spine injuries Here, we present a quadriplegic patient due to a hangman's fracture treated during the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic Case Description: A 19-year-old male was quadriplegic and in spinal shock following a motor vehicle accident X-rays showed a C2 hangman's fracture with instability X-rays and CT studies both confirmed anterior dislocation at C2 on C3 with bilateral pedicle C2 fractures and 5 mm of subluxation In addition, he had an infiltrate in both lungs consistent with the diagnosis of COVID-19 The patient was intubated for respiratory failure and hemodynamically stabilized for his spinal shock Unfortunately, before surgical intervention could be undertaken, the patient sustained a fatal cardiorespiratory arrest Conclusion: Utilizing appropriate personal protective equipment, it was and should be possible to treat patients with spinal injuries in the presence of active COVID infection However, the risks of treating such spinal urgencies and emergencies should be thoroughly discussed with the entire nonsurgical and surgical treatment teams (e g , including anesthesiologists, physicians, nurses, and other caregivers) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Surgical Neurology International is the property of Scientific Scholar LLC and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Treatment of unusual hangman's fracture in cluster region during coronavirus 2019 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus (SARS-CoV-2) is a rapidly spreading virus that appeared at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China.

All consecutive patients presenting for delivery without coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms were offered testing over four 1-week phases. Phase I documented the rate of testing uptake. Phase II recorded patients' reasons for declining testing. Phase III used phase II findings to create and implement shared decision-making tools. Phase IV offered each patient who declined nasopharyngeal testing an oropharyngeal alternative. The primary outcome was rate of SARS-CoV-2 testing uptake by phase. RESULTS: Of 270 patients, 223 (83%) accepted testing and 47 (17%) declined. Maternal age and mode of delivery were similar between groups, whereas testing uptake was higher among nulliparous, White, Hispanic, or privately insured patients.

We used a text mining technique;Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), for textual data analysis to discover the satisfaction criteria from online customers' reviews. After analyzing the data using machine learning techniques, a theoretical model was developed to inspect the relationships between the restaurants quality factors and customers' satisfaction. In this stage, Partial Least Squares (PLS) technique was employed. We evaluated the proposed approach using a dataset collected from the TripAdvisor platform. The outcomes of the two-stage methodology were discussed and future research directions were suggested according to the limitations of this study.","output":"Customer satisfaction with Restaurants Service Quality during COVID-19 outbreak: A two-stage methodology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has required healthcare systems to transform the delivery of care.

For mathematical modeling and dynamic analyses, this paper uses the real data of spreading COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia. The dynamics of the proposed SEIR model are presented with the reproduction number and the extensive stability analysis. We discussed the domain of the solution and equilibrium situation based on the proposed SEIR model by using Jacobian's method of linearization. The condition of equilibrium and its uniqueness has been proved, and the stability analysis of disease-free equilibrium has been introduced. A sensitivity analysis of the reproduction number against its internal parameters has been done. The global stability of the equilibrium of this model has been proved by using Lyapunov's Stability theorem. A numerical verification and predictions of the proposed SEIR model have been made with comparing the results based on the SEIR model and the real data due to the spreading of the COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia.

While most trunk exoskeletons are rigid devices, more lightweight soft exoskeletons (exosuits) have recently been developed. One such exosuit is the HeroWear Apex, which achieved promising results in the developers' own work but has not been independently evaluated. This paper thus presents an evaluation of the Apex with 20 adult participants during multiple brief tasks: standing up from a stool with a symmetric or asymmetric load, lifting a unilateral or bilateral load from the floor to waist level, lifting the same bilateral load with a 90-degree turn to the right, lowering a bilateral load from waist level to floor, and walking while carrying a bilateral load. The tasks were performed in an ABA-style protocol: first with exosuit assistance disengaged, then with it engaged, then disengaged again. Four measurement types were taken: electromyography (of the erector spinae, rectus abdominis, and middle trapezius), trunk kinematics, self-report ratings, and heart rate. The exosuit decreased the erector spinae electromyogram by about 15% during object lifting and lowering tasks; furthermore, participants found the exosuit mildly to moderately helpful. No adverse effects on other muscles or during non-lifting tasks were noted, and a decrease in middle trapezius electromyogram was observed for one task. This confirms that the HeroWear Apex could reduce muscle demand and fatigue.

CASE DESCRIPTION: In this single-center retrospective observational study, we enrolled patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) who were emergently admitted from January 23 to April 8, 2020. Based on the COVID-19 triage, patients with SAH were divided into 3 categories: positive, negative, and under investigation. During 77 days, 90 patients with SAH were admitted at the center. The median age was 55 years (range, 18-80 years) and 40 patients (44.4%) were male. None was positive, 42 patients were negative, and 48 patients were under investigation for COVID-19 before surgery. During the same period, 9 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 without nosocomial infection.

Design/methodology/approach: To gain fresh insights on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on supply chain social sustainability and resilience issues, an extensive literature review was conducted. To this end, recent scholarly research articles, articles from practitioner journals, magazine articles and policy documents and reports, as well as blogs and briefings published by international organizations were critically reviewed. Findings: The findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with a major shake-up of global supply chain operations and has contributed to varied sustainability outcomes. While the pandemic caused reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, it has had serious social implications for the livelihoods and well-being of workers and their families. The findings further suggested that it is imperative for companies to build resilience in their global supply chain operations to better respond to future shocks and disruptions by adopting strategies such as employee protection schemes, advanced digital technologies, diversification, localization and regionalization and stakeholder collaboration. Originality/value: This review paper contributes to emerging global supply chain sustainability literature and practice by synthesizing and explicating the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on supply chain social sustainability and resilience.

While the world awaits for the outcome of the ongoing vaccinations, a more aggressive strain of coronavirus is killing many people in several countries, including the UK, the USA, Netherland, South Africa, and Australia. The ongoing pandemic has severely affected almost all aspects of our lives; education being one of them. As a result, majority of students in the world have completely lost access to the traditional way of institutional learning, while others have suffered in different ways and to a lesser degree. Many universities, colleges, and schools were closed during the initial pandemic lockdown during March-May, 2020. Luckily, some higher education institutions were better equipped to switch over to online teaching, either using a Learning Management System (LMS) or use some other online tools to connect with their students.

The objective of the work is to identify SARS-CoV2 spike variants that emerged during the pandemic and evaluate their binding affinity with ACE2. Evolutionary analysis of 2178 SARS-CoV2 genomes identifies RBD variants that are under selection bias. The binding efficacy of these RBD variants to the ACE2 has been analyzed by using protein-protein docking and binding free energy calculations. Pan-proteomic analysis reveals 113 mutations among them 33 are parsimonious. Evolutionary analysis reveals five RBD variants A348T, V367F, G476S, V483A, and S494P are under strong positive selection bias. Variations at these sites alter the ACE2 binding affinity. A348T, G476S, and V483A variants display reduced affinity to ACE2 in comparison to the Wuhan SARS-CoV2 spike protein. While the V367F and S494P population variants display a higher binding affinity towards human ACE2. Reorientation of several crucial residues at the RBD-ACE2 interface facilitates additional hydrogen bond formation for the V367F variant which enhances the binding energy during ACE2 recognition. On the other hand, the enhanced binding affinity of S494P is attributed to strong interfacial complementarity between the RBD and ACE2.","output":"Evolutionary and structural analysis elucidates mutations on SARS-CoV2 spike protein with altered human ACE2 binding affinity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, the development of basal insulin therapies has focused on insulin analogues that have longer durations of action and more predictable pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) profiles than their human insulin-based predecessors, such as neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin.

Insulin degludec (degludec) became available in Canada in 2017 and is the first basal insulin analogue to have a half-life exceeding the dosing interval. As well as offering the promise of an exceptionally flat PK/PD profile when at steady state, this characteristic means that insulin degludec can be dosed with some flexibility with regard to time of day and that it need not be taken at the same time each day.

Prions are proteins that possess a unique conformational conversion, with the ability to rapidly shift between multiple conformations due to residue hydrophobicity and net sequence charge, and viral prion-like proteins are known as potential regulators of viral infections. However, the prion-like domains (PrD) in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome have not been analyzed. In this in silico study, using the PLAAC algorithm, we identified the presence of prion-like domains in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Compared with other viruses, a striking difference was observed in the distribution of prion-like domains in the spike protein since SARS-CoV-2 is the only coronavirus with a prion-like domain found in the receptor-binding domain of the S1 region of the spike protein. The presence and unique distribution of prion-like domains in the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domains of the spike protein are particularly interesting since although the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV S proteins share the same host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates a 10- to 20-fold higher affinity for ACE2. We identified prion-like domains in the 1 helix of the ACE2 receptor that interact with the viral receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we found substantial differences in the prion-like domain of the S1 region of the spike protein across emerging variants including Omicron (B.1.1.529).

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) designed for IBS management can improve outcomes but further research of more accessible implementations of this treatment approach for IBS is needed. This study assessed the feasibility of a web-delivered CBT program among adults with IBS to apply to a future clinical trial. METHODS Twenty-five participants were randomized to receive an unguided web-based, CBT program for IBS. The primary outcome was changes in IBS symptom severity (IBS Symptom Severity Scale [IBS-SSS]). Secondary outcomes included IBS-specific CBT therapeutic mechanisms of change (GI-specific anxiety, unhelpful IBS behaviors, and GI-focused cognitions) and changes in depressive (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]) and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale [GAD-7]) symptom severity. KEY RESULTS Among participants randomized to receive web-based CBT, the average baseline IBS-SSS score was 296.3 (SD=100.9). IBS symptom severity significantly improved at 2-month (p < 0.001) and 3-month follow-up (p < 0.0001); the within-group effect size between baseline and 3-month follow-up IBS-SSS scores was large (d = 1.14) and 63.6% experienced a clinically meaningful improvement (ie, 50-point IBS-SSS score reduction). GI-specific anxiety symptoms and cognitions significantly improved at 2-month follow-up, as did unhelpful IBS safety behaviors. Additionally, clinically meaningful improvement was observed in depressive and anxiety symptoms at 3-month follow-up among participants with symptoms above the clinical threshold (ie, PHQ-9  10 and GAD-7  10, respectively) at baseline.

The behavioral data of 1048 e-bike riders related to helmet policy were collected by a questionnaire survey in Ningbo, China. A bivariate ordered probit (BOP) model was employed to account for the unobserved heterogeneity. The marginal effects of contributory factors were calculated to quantify their impacts, and the results show that the BOP model can explain the common unobserved features in the helmet policy and cycling behavior of e-bike riders, and that good safety habits stem from long-term safety education and training. The BOP model results show that whether wearing a helmet, using an e-bike after 19:00, and sunny days are factors that affect the helmet wearing rate. Helmet wearing, evenings during rush hour, and picking up children are some of the factors that affect e-bike accident rates. Furthermore, there is a remarkable negative correlation between the helmet wearing rate and e-bike accident rate.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: An open-label, parallel 3-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted between January 7, 2020 and July 17, 2020. Men who were at least 18 years of age, had condomless anal sex with men in the past year, reported not testing for syphilis in the last 6 months, and had a stable residence with mailing addresses were recruited from 124 cities in 26 Chinese provinces. Using block randomization with blocks of size 12, enrolled participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) into 3 arms: standard of care arm, standard SST arm, and lottery incentivized SST arm (1 in 10 chance to win US$15 if they had a syphilis test). The primary outcome was the proportion of participants who tested for syphilis during the trial period and confirmed with photo verification and between arm comparisons were estimated with risk differences (RDs). Analyses were performed on a modified intention-to-treat basis: Participants were included in the complete case analysis if they had initiated at least 1 follow-up survey. The Syphilis/HIV Duo rapid test kit was used. A total of 451 men were enrolled. In total, 136 (907%, 136/150) in the standard of care arm, 142 (940%, 142/151) in the standard of SST arm, and 137 (913%, 137/150) in the lottery incentivized SST arm were included in the final analysis. The proportion of men who had at least 1 syphilis test during the trial period was 63.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 55.5% to 71.3%, p = 0.001) in the standard SST arm, 65.7% (95% CI: 57.7% to 73.6%, p = 0.0002) in the lottery incentivized SST arm, and 14.7% (95% CI: 8.8% to 20.7%, p < 0.001) in the standard of care arm. The estimated RD between the standard SST and standard of care arm was 48.7% (95% CI: 37.8% to 58.4%, p < 0.001). The majority (78.5%, 95% CI: 72.7% to 84.4%, p < 0.001) of syphilis self-testers reported never testing for syphilis.

Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the virus triggered DEF cell membrane invagination as early as 10 min post-infection and that integrated endocytic vesicles formed at 20 min post-infection. The virus yield in EDSV-infected DEF cells treated with chlorpromazine (CPZ), sucrose, methyl--cyclodextrin (MCD), or NH4Cl was measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Compared with the mock treatment, CPZ and sucrose greatly inhibited the production of viral progeny in a dose-dependent manner, while MCD treatment did not result in a significant difference. Furthermore, NH4Cl had a strong inhibitory effect on the production of EDSV progeny. In addition, indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated that virus particles clustered on the surface of DEF cells treated with CPZ or sucrose.

Here, we examined whether the regulation of viral poly(A) tail length is cell-type independent and whether it is a common feature of coronaviruses to assess the significance of the regulation.

The disease is modelled in terms of the progression of viraemia reported in scientific studies. The emergence of symptoms in the model reflects the statistics of a nation-wide highly detailed database consisting of more than 62 000 cases (about a half of them confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests) with recorded symptoms in Argentina. The stochastic model displays several of the characteristics of COVID-19 such as a high variability in the evolution of the outbreaks, including long periods in which they run undetected, spontaneous extinction followed by a late outbreak and unimodal as well as bimodal progressions of daily counts of cases (second waves without ad-hoc hypothesis). We show how the relation between undetected cases (including the asymptomatic cases) and detected cases changes as a function of the public policies, the efficiency of the implementation and the timing with respect to the development of the outbreak. We show also that the relation between detected cases and total cases strongly depends on the implemented policies and that detected cases cannot be regarded as a measure of the outbreak, being the dependency between total cases and detected cases in general not monotonic as a function of the efficiency in the intervention method.

Method and results Briefly, from the recent literature, for high-risk PE presenting with shock or cardiac arrest, systemic thrombolysis or embolectomy is recommended, while for lowrisk PE, anticoagulation alone is proposed. Normo-tense patients with PE but with biological or imaging signs of right heart dysfunction constitute a group known as \\"at intermediate risk\\" for which the therapeutic strategy remains controversial. In fact, some patients may require more aggressive treatment in addition to the anticoagulant treatment, because approximately 10% will decompensate hemodynamically with a high risk of mortality. Systemic thrombolysis may be an option, but with hemorrhagic risks, particularly intra cranial. Various hybrid pharmacomechanical approaches are proposed to maintain the benefits of thrombolysis while reducing its risks, but the overall clinical experience of these different techniques remains limited. Patients with high intermediate and high risk pulmonary embolism should be managed by a multidisciplinary team combining the skills of cardiologists, resuscitators, pneumologists, interventional radiologists and cardiac surgeons. Such a team can determine which intervention - thrombolysis alone or assisted, percutaneous mechanical fragmentation of the thrombus or surgical embolectomy - is best suited to a particular patient.

ABCA1 regulates cellular cholesterol homeostasis. Here, we found that GW3965 inhibited NDV infection in DF-1 cells. It also inhibited NF-B activation and reduced the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines induced by the infection. Further studies showed that GW3965 exerted its inhibitory effects on virus entry and replication. NDV infection increased the mRNA levels of several lipogenic genes but decreased the ABCA1 mRNA level. Overexpression of ABCA1 inhibited NDV infection and reduced the cholesterol content in DF-1 cells, but when the cholesterol was replenished, NDV infection was restored. GW3965 treatment prevented cholesterol accumulation in the perinuclear area of the infected cells.

To date, there is lack of studies describing clinical characteristics of the people at high risk of infection. Hence, we aimed (i) to identify clinical predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection risk, (ii) to develop and validate a score predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection risk, and (iii) to compare it with unspecific scores. METHODS: Retrospective case-control study using administrative health-related database was carried out in Southern Italy (Campania region) among beneficiaries of Regional Health Service aged over than 30 years. For each person with SARS-CoV-2 confirmed infection (case), up to five controls were randomly matched for gender, age and municipality of residence. Odds ratios and 90% confidence intervals for associations between candidate predictors and risk of infection were estimated by means of conditional logistic regression. SARS-CoV-2 Infection Score (SIS) was developed by generating a total aggregate score obtained from assignment of a weight at each selected covariate using coefficients estimated from the model. Finally, the score was categorized by assigning increasing values from 1 to 4. Discriminant power was used to compare SIS performance with that of other comorbidity scores. RESULTS: Subjects suffering from diabetes, anaemias, Parkinsons disease, mental disorders, cardiovascular and inflammatory bowel and kidney diseases showed increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Similar estimates were recorded for men and women and younger and older than 65 years. Fifteen conditions significantly contributed to the SIS. As SIS value increases, risk progressively increases, being odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection among people with the highest SIS value (SIS = 4) 1.74 times higher than those unaffected by any SIS contributing conditions (SIS = 1). CONCLUSION: Conditions and diseases making people more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified by the current study.

Experts have speculated about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pregnancy desires, but existing research has major limitations, including being cross-sectional, relying on people's perceptions of their preference changes (rather than documenting actual changes), and lacking valid measures. Methods: Using longitudinal data collected from March 2019 to March 2021, we assessed changes in trajectories of pregnancy preferences among women aged 15-34 in Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas (N=630, n=2,860). At baseline and quarterly for one year, participants responded to a validated measure of feelings and desires around pregnancy within 3 months (Desire to Avoid Pregnancy [DAP] scale, range 0-4, 4=higher preference to avoid pregnancy). We used multivariable mixed effects segmented regression to examine changes in pregnancy preferences before and during the pandemic. Results: Over the 12-months prior to the first shelter-in-place order (April 2020), marginal DAP scores decreased steadily over time (coefficient.=-0.24/year [95% CI: -0.31- -0.17], p<0.001). When shelter-in-place went into effect, DAP scores stopped declining and became flat (coefficient.=0/year, change in slope: p<0.001). Scores remained flat until the resurgence in COVID-19 cases in November 2020, when DAP scores started to increase, but insignificantly (coefficient.=0.25/year).

Both direct and indirect mechanisms through COVID-19 have been described to explain this relationship. COVID-19 infection increases the risk of developing both arterial and venous thrombotic complications through systemic coagulation activation, leading to increased mortality. Chronic oral anticoagulation is essential to reduce the thromboembolic risk among AF patients. Switching to low-molecular-weight heparin has been recommended during hospitalization for COVID-19 infection. Of note, at discharge, the prescription of direct oral anticoagulants may offer some advantages over vitamin K antagonists. However, oral anticoagulants should only be prescribed after the consideration of drugCdrug interactions with antiviral therapies as well as of the risk of hepatotoxicity, which is common among individuals with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Not all anticoagulants have the same risk of hepatotoxicity; dabigatran has shown a good efficacy and safety profile and could have a lower risk of hepatotoxicity. Furthermore, its metabolism by cytochrome P450 is absent and it has a specific reversal agent. Therefore, dabigatran may be considered as a first-line choice for oral anticoagulation at discharge after COVID-19 infection.

Despite the high number of patients treated worldwide, data on respiratory mechanics are currently scarce and the optimal setting of MV remains to be defined. This scoping review aims to provide an overview of available data about respiratory mechanics, gas exchange and MV settings in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) for COVID-19-associated acute respiratory failure, and to identify knowledge gaps. MAIN TEXT: PubMed, EMBASE, and MEDLINE databases were searched from inception to October 30, 2020 for studies providing at least one ventilatory parameter collected within 24 h from the ICU admission. The quality of the studies was independently assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Form for Cohort Studies. A total of 26 studies were included for a total of 14,075 patients. At ICU admission, positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) values ranged from 9 to 16.5 cm of water (cmH2O), suggesting that high levels of PEEP were commonly used for setting MV for these patients. Patients with COVID-19 are severely hypoxemic at ICU admission and show a median ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ranging from 102 to 198 mmHg. Static respiratory system compliance (Crs) values at ICU admission were highly heterogenous, ranging between 24 and 49 ml/cmH2O. Prone positioning and neuromuscular blocking agents were widely used, ranging from 17 to 81 and 22 to 88%, respectively; both rates were higher than previously reported in patients with \\"classical\\" acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Resilience-training programs such as Bounce Back and Thrive! (BBT) can help families manage the realities of military life. OBJECTIVE: This pilot study aimed to evaluate suitability of BBT implementation by Military Family Resource Centers (MFRCs), including whether BBT: (1) fosters resilience-building among parents, (2) facilitates CMF resilience-building, (3) can be contextualized for CMFs, and (4) supports MFRCs in cultivating a culture of resilience. METHODS: An exploratory qualitative design was used. BBT was offered to parents face-to-face. Participants completed focus groups after the first 6 sessions, final 4 sessions, and one-year post-intervention. Data was thematically analyzed. RESULTS: Nine military parents participated. Four major themes resulted: (1) military parent resilience-building, (2) CMF resilience-building, (3) BBT program feedback and contextualization, and (4) MFRCs as community resilience hubs. DISCUSSION: BBT enabled parents to gain a new perspective on resilience, engage in dialogue and intentionally role model resilience skills. Military-specific BBT contextualization and online-delivery formats would increase suitability and access for CMFs. Access to resilience programs delivered through MFRCs would support CMFs. Further research is warranted.","output":"Resilient Parents Resilient Communities: A Pilot Study Trialing the Bounce Back and Thrive!

Using DeepABM allows scaling simulations to large agent populations in real-time and running them efficiently on GPU architectures. To demonstrate the effectiveness of DeepABM, we build DeepABM-COVID simulator to provide support for various non-pharmaceutical interventions (quarantine, exposure notification, vaccination, testing) for the COVID-19 pandemic, and can scale to populations of representative size in real-time on a GPU. Specifically, DeepABM-COVID can model 200 million interactions (over 100,000 agents across 180 time-steps) in 90 seconds, and is made available online to help researchers with modeling and analysis of various interventions. We explain various components of the framework and discuss results from one research study to evaluate the impact of delaying the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine in collaboration with clinical and public health experts. While we simulate COVID-19 spread, the ideas introduced in the paper are generic and can be easily extend to other forms of agent-based simulations. Furthermore, while beyond scope of this document, DeepABM enables inverse agent-based simulations which can be used to learn physical parameters in the (micro) simulations using gradient-based optimization with large-scale real-world (macro) data.

International travel is one recognized contributor. The purpose of this review is to summarize current knowledge regarding the acquisition, carriage and spread of AMR bacteria by international travelers. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have highlighted that travel is an important risk factor for the acquisition of AMR bacteria, with approximately 30% of studied travelers returning with an acquired AMR bacterium. Epidemiological studies have shown there are three major risk factors for acquisition: travel destination, antimicrobial usage and travelers diarrhea (TD). Analyses have begun to illustrate the AMR genes that are acquired and spread by travelers, risk factors for acquisition and carriage of AMR bacteria, and local transmission of imported AMR organisms. SUMMARY: International travel is a contributor to the acquisition and dissemination of AMR organisms globally. Efforts to reduce the burden of AMR organisms should include a focus on international travelers. Routine genomic surveillance would further elucidate the role of international travel in the global spread of AMR bacteria.","output":"Antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in international travelers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current pandemic caused by the deadly Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is called as Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). Rolling data indicate that it has affected 222 countries, areas or territories with cases, infected 77,862,704 individuals out of which 1,712,010 have died. Although, the virus has catastrophic effects, it has also indirectly nourished the nature by reducing pollution. Environmental factors such as air pollution cause diseases such as bronchitis, asthma and many other respiratory syndromes and acts as the main modulating factor for COVID-19. COVID-19 and air pollution cause mainly respiratory disorders and therefore, have intricate relations with each other. Particulate matters (PMs) have crucial contribution for air pollution. The surface areas of PM2.5 with radius (r1.25 m) and PM10 (r5 m) would be (using formula 4 r2) 19.63 and 314.16 m2, respectively. And, the diameter of SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 0.065 to 0.125 m (average radius 0.095 m) and would have an average surface area of 0.11 m. So, theoretically, a solid PM2.5 and PM10 can carry about 95 and 2856 SARS-CoV-2 particles, respectively. Liquid PMs may carry even more virus particles as they can occupy the internal space also. So, PMs increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Probably for this reason, COVID-19 cases are very high in few countries such as India and Italy where, air pollution is more as compared to countries that experiencing low or no air pollution. Therefore, use of appropriate mask even indoors is recommended where air pollution and COVID-19 together made their common hot spots. Use of home-made masks prepared with normal fabrics that cannot not filter aerosols or PMs are highly discouraged. Plausible data are available about the association of COVID-19 with temperature and humidity. A mega study indicates that environmental temperature and humidity show negative correlation with COVID-19 infection rate although data sometimes is opposite. Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 strains are also found in water circulation system especially in water discharged bodies. Therefore, multifactorial environmental implications epically controlling air quality is important for COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Chapter 3 - Role of environmental factors in transmission of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drugs that prolong QT may cause torsade de pointes (TdP).

Transient non-severe increased insulin requirement in patients hospitalized for medical conditions such as sepsis or myocardial infarction is a well-known phenomenon. However, extremely high-dose insulin requirement remains a very rarely reported entity. Here, we report the case of an extreme and transitory insulin requirement episode in a type 2 diabetic patient presenting an acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2. CASE PRESENTATION: A 57-year-old man resident in Geneva, Switzerland, previously known for type 2 diabetes for 3 years was admitted for an aggravation of his dyspnea. His type 2 diabetes was treated only with metformin and his latest Hb1Ac was 6.1%. Chest CT SCAN showed a bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacification. Twenty-four hours after his admission he presented a worsening of dyspnea and severe hypoxemia requiring a transfer to the intensive care unit rapidly followed by oro-tracheal intubation for mechanical ventilation support. A bronchoalveolar lavage was performed and test of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR assay was positive. At day 3, he presented a rapidly progressive insulin requirement at a rate of up to 50 units/hour intravenous insulin aspart. Despite the high insulin doses, he maintained an elevated plasma glucose level at 270 mg/dL on average. His extremely high-dose insulin requirement resolved at day 9, and the insulin infusion rate was rapidly reduced. CONCLUSIONS: This case may reflect a specific and profound impact of SARS-CoV-2 on metabolic homeostasis, in particular in diabetic patients that appear more prone to complications of COVID-19 infection. Yet, the mechanisms behind this remain to be elucidated. The optimal management of hyperglycemia of diabetic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 has yet not be defined, however insulin remain the mainstay of treatment approach. Report of extreme dysregulation of chronic conditions such as diabetes in patients with COVID-19 may help clinicians to better take care of patients during the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2. To the best of our knowledge this is the first description of extremely high-dose insulin requirement in patient with COVID-19.","output":"Extremely high-dose insulin requirement in a diabetic patient with COVID-19: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Traditional approaches to blood regulation emphasise the precautionary principle and pursue zero-risk for viral transmission; these traditional approaches have usually followed tragedy, such as the HIV and hepatitis C infections that followed the use of factor VIII concentrates. However, a much more haphazard haemovigilance system operates for general adverse events. Such imprecise assessment of hazards prevents sound benefit-risk assessment, and for blood products this is further confounded by the fact that their efficacy has attracted little systematic study. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has now prompted the proposal of a convalescent plasma (CP) blood product. Clearly, mere freedom from infectious agents will not suffice in assessing CP, and an objective measure of efficacy, so as to permit formal benefit-risk analysis, is essential. This is both a scientific and an ethical demand, as has been the case for other experimental COVID-19 treatments. With special reference to COVID-19 CP, the well-recognized adverse events of transfusion-associated lung injury (TRALI) and transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) will be important. Furthermore, not only efficacy but also product quality attributes (e.g., antibody titre) will have to be defined.

Bio-behavioural data from an annual, national surveillance survey of PWID (2011 to 2018) estimated trends in viraemic prevalence among HCV antibody-positive PWID. Multivariable logistic regression identified characteristics independently associated with viraemia. Trends in treatment access were examined for PWID with known infection. Between 2011 and 2016, viraemic prevalence among antibody-positive PWID remained stable (2011, 57.7%; 2016, 55.8%) but decreased in 2017 (49.4%) and 2018 (50.4%) (both p<0.001). After adjustment for demographic and behavioural characteristics, there remained significant reduction in viraemia in 2017 (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.79, 95%CI 0.65-0.94) and 2018 (aOR 0.79, 95%CI 0.66-0.93) compared to 2016.

Patients with fever (aOR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3-2.3) or cough (aOR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.9) and those with known contact with someone with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (aOR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.0-2.4.) were more likely have a positive test, but these features were not highly discriminating. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of mildly symptomatic or well children and adolescents referred to a community drive-through/walk-up SARS-CoV-2 testing site because of risk of exposure or clinical illness, 1 in 4 patients had a positive test. Children and young adults represent a considerable burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Assessment of their role in transmission is essential to implementing appropriate control measures.","output":"Results of Testing Children for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 Through a Community-based Testing Site"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Refuse-derived fuels (RDF) are rich in resources that make them an attractive feedstock for the production of energy and biofuels. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a promising thermochemical conversion technology to handle wet feedstocks and convert them to valuable bio-crude, bio-char and aqueous products. This study highlights the advantages of using glycerol as the co-solvent along with water in different proportions to produce bio-crude from RDF via HTL. The ratio of water:glycerol (vol.%:vol.%) was varied for each experiment (100:0, 90:10, 80:20, 70:30, 60:40, 50:50), and the product yields and their quality were studied. The results demonstrate that increasing the proportion of glycerol until 50 vol.% in the solvent enhances the bio-crude yield (36.2 wt.%) and its higher heating value (HHV) (30.9 MJ kg(?1)). Deoxygenation achieved in the bio-crude was 42%. The production of bio-char was minimum (9.5 wt.%) at 50 vol.% glycerol with HHV of 31.9 MJ kg(?1). The selectivity to phenolic compounds in the bio-crude increased, while that of cyclic oxygenates decreased when the glycerol content was more than 20 vol.%. The gas-phase analysis revealed that the major deoxygenation pathway was decarboxylation. The yield of aqueous products drastically increased with the addition of glycerol. The minimum amount of glycerol in the co-solvent that favours an energetically feasible process with low carbon footprint is 30 vol.%. Using 50 vol.% glycerol resulted in the highest energy recovery in the bio-crude and bio-char (80%), the lowest energy consumption ratio (0.43) and lowest environmental factor (0.1). The mass-based process mass intensity factor, calculated based on only bio-crude and bio-char as the valuable products, decreased with an increase in addition of glycerol, while it was close to unity when the aqueous phase is also considered as a valuable product.","output":"Optimal use of glycerol co-solvent to enhance product yield and its quality from hydrothermal liquefaction of refuse-derived fuel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the past 10 years since its introduction, phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) have uncovered novel genotype-phenotype relationships.

Along with severe pneumonia, this disease is notorious for extensive thromboembolic manifestations. That is why experts advocated aggressive anticoagulation as a part of the therapy since the beginning. However, from May 2020 onwards, cases of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) are being reported. HIT in itself is an autoimmune entity leading to life-threatening thrombosis in the setting of thrombocytopenia. Continuation of heparin can have disastrous consequences in case of unrecognized HIT. Hence, timely recognition of HIT is of utmost value to modify the anticoagulation strategy and salvaging lives. We performed a systemic review trying to find all reported cases of HIT in COVID-19. Methods: It involved extensive search of the databases including PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Embase in an attempt to find all reported literature in the last 1 year (November 1, 2019CDecember 25, 2020) using keywords in various combinations. Literature search resulted in a total of 27 articles and 12 articles were finally selected based on the study design and their relevance pertaining to the intervention done and the outcome of interest. Results: A total of 35 patients were included (mean age 56.7  12.8 years, male-to-female ratio = 2:1). The most frequent comorbidity was hypertension. Fifty-seven percent of cases were with low-molecular weight heparin and the rest with unfractionated heparin. Confirmatory functional assay was done in 85.7% of cases (67% by serotonin-release assay [SRA] and 33% by heparin-induced platelet aggregation [HIPA]). All cases tested with HIPA were positive, while with SRA, only 30% were positive. The most common alternate anticoagulation used was argatroban infusion. The new arterial thrombotic event was seen in only 5.7% of cases as repeat myocardial infarction, stroke, and splenic infarction, while clinically significant bleeding was seen in 17.1% of cases. Fifty percent of bleeding episodes were seen where conventional doses of argatroban were used, while no mortality was seen with low-dose argatroban infusion. However, only 45.7% of patients were discharged, 31.4% of patients died, while the outcome was pending for 23% of patients. Conclusion: Severe endotheliitis and immune dysregulation giving rise to HIT antibodies and antiphospholipid antibodies have been demonstrated in COVID-19 and modifying our therapy becomes indispensable when it is pathogenic with potentially fatal consequences. In the light of interim results of REMAP-CAP study in severe COVID-19 cases where heparin does not improve the outcome, the present anticoagulation strategy needs re-evaluation. Unrecognized HIT can be catastrophic and close clinical monitoring is required for patients on heparin therapy.","output":"Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia in COVID-19: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIM: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global health emergency. According to the findings, male patients with COVID-19 infection are at an increased risk for severe complications than females. The causes of this issue are unknown and are most probably multifactorial. Sexual hormones affect the immune system, so estrogen strengthens the immune system, and testosterone suppresses it. Due to the reports of the high prevalence of androgenic alopecia in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and a higher risk of respiratory disease and increased use of allergy/asthma medications among patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) as a hyperandrogenism condition compared with non-PCOS women, this review aimed to evaluate androgens role in COVID-19. METHODS: 42 related articles from 2008 to 2020 were reviewed with the keywords of androgens, hormonal factors, and hair loss in combination with COVID-19 in medical research databases. RESULTS: The evidence of transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) expression in lung tissue, which is an androgen-regulated gene and expressed mainly in the adult prostate may interpret the increased susceptibility of the male gender to severe COVID-19 complications. Moreover, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) acts as a functional receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and male hormones are effective in the ACE-2 passageway and simplify SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells.

METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study to assess the virus-specific antibody and memory T and B cell responses in COVID-19 patients up to 343 days after infection. Neutralizing antibodies and antibodies against the receptor-binding domain, spike, and nucleoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 were measured. Virus-specific memory T and B cell responses were analyzed. RESULTS: We enrolled 59 COVID-19 patients, including 38 moderate, 16 mild, and five asymptomatic patients; 31 (52.5%) were men, and 28 (47.5%) were women. The median age was 41 (interquartile range [IQR]: 30-55). The median day from symptom onset to enrollment was 317 days (range 257 to 343 days). We found that approximately 90% of patients still have detectable IgG antibodies against spike and nucleocapsid proteins and neutralizing antibodies against pseudovirus, whereas ~60% of patients had detectable IgG antibodies against receptor binding domain and surrogate virus-neutralizing antibodies. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG + memory B cell and IFN-?3 secreting T cell responses were detectable in over 70% of patients.

As SARS has the potential of becoming the first pandemic of the new millennium, a global warning by the WHO was issued on 12 March 2003. The disease, which is believed to have its origin in the Chinese Guangdong province, spread from Hong Kong via international airports to its current worldwide distribution. The concerted efforts of a globally united scientific community have led to the independent isolation and identification of a novel coronavirus from SARS patients by several groups. The extraordinarily rapid isolation of a causative agent of this newly emerged infectious disease constitutes an unprecedented scientific achievement. The main scope of the article is to provide the clinician with an overview of the natural history, epidemiology and clinical characteristics of SARS.

This study provides insight into patient concerns & information seeking (IS) behaviors. Methods: In January 2021, semistructured telephone interviews were conducted in the US with CC patients (diagnosed within 2 years) recruited through panels, social media & advocacy groups. The interview focused on rational & emotional drivers and barriers for IS. Transcripts were coded using NVivo qualitative analysis software to identify key themes. Results: 14 women of varied education status were interviewed (mean age 51 years (range: 37-70);8 White, 4 Black, & 2 Latina). Patients emphasized trust in their oncologist to provide sufficient information. IS was driven by the desires to confirm their oncologist's recommendation & find reassurance through the experience of other patients, and encouragement from family. Barriers to IS included: 1) hesitancy to undermine their oncologist's recommendations, 2) pessimism about ability to find individualized answers about prognosis or QoL, 3) feeling overwhelmed & fearing misinformation, 4) personal urgency to decide on a treatment plan, 5) already having sufficient information, 6) potential exposure to 'negative energy' from online patient communities, & 7) COVID-19 hindering opportunity for personal connections. Conclusions: While patients' oncologist, family, & common patient experience provide comfort, reluctance towards IS exists. As trusted gatekeepers, oncologists should recognize patients' desire for accessible, reliable, & personalized information. Better understanding this perspective and gaps in the availability of validated & relevant resources can enable clinicians/policy makers to develop strategies & tools for better communication.

However, only about 75% of people in Canada plan to receive one of the vaccines. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to determine the reasons why people in Canada feel hesitant toward receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: We screened 3915 tweets from public Twitter profiles in Canada by using the search words \\"vaccine\\" and \\"COVID.\\" The tweets that met the inclusion criteria (ie, those about COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy) were coded via content analysis. Codes were then organized into themes and interpreted by using the Theoretical Domains Framework. RESULTS: Overall, 605 tweets were identified as those about COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Vaccine hesitancy stemmed from the following themes: concerns over safety, suspicion about political or economic forces driving the COVID-19 pandemic or vaccine development, a lack of knowledge about the vaccine, antivaccine or confusing messages from authority figures, and a lack of legal liability from vaccine companies. This study also examined mistrust toward the medical industry not due to hesitancy, but due to the legacy of communities marginalized by health care institutions. These themes were categorized into the following five Theoretical Domains Framework constructs: knowledge, beliefs about consequences, environmental context and resources, social influence, and emotion. CONCLUSIONS: With the World Health Organization stating that one of the worst threats to global health is vaccine hesitancy, it is important to have a comprehensive understanding of the reasons behind this reluctance. By using a behavioral science framework, this study adds to the emerging knowledge about vaccine hesitancy in relation to COVID-19 vaccines by analyzing public discourse in tweets in real time.

OBJECTIVE: This article describes the development, performance and first results of an interprofessional blended learning concept called hospital paramedics, qualifying paramedics and additional medical personnel to support ICUs and ERs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Protestant Hospital of the Bethel Foundation (EvKB), University Hospital OWL, University of Bielefeld in cooperation with the Study Institute Westfalen-Lippe, developed a 2-stage blended learning concept (stage 1 e?learning with online tutorials, stage 2 practical deployment) comprising 3 modules: ICU, ER and in-hospital emergency medicine. At the beginning, the participants were asked about their sociodemographic data (age, gender, type of medical qualifications) and subjective feeling of confidence. At the end, a final discussion with the participant, the practice instructor and the supervising physician took place and an evaluation of the deployment by the head of the practice and the hospital paramedic was carried out using questionnaires. RESULTS: Within 6 weeks 58 (63%) of the 92 participants completed the online course and 17 (29%) additionally completed their traineeship. In the ICU they assisted with preparing catheter systems, medication and nursing, performed Manchester triage and initial care in the ER. After completion hospital paramedics were significantly more confident when working in a hospital, catheterization and tracheostoma care (p < 0.05). Of the supervisors 94% deemed the deployment as useful and 100% of the participants were prepared to be available at short notice in their areas as compensation for the COVID-19-pandemic in the event of a staff shortage. Through the provision of additional intensive care ventilators and monitoring units in the period from March to the beginning of May 2020 and the personnel management that was carried out, the EvKB was in a position to increase the number of previously provided ventilator beds by potentially >40 ventilation places. CONCLUSION: Blended learning concepts, such as hospital paramedics, can quickly qualify medical personnel for use in system-relevant settings, relieve nursing staff and thus create an expansion of intensive care capacities. Existing or pending pandemic and contingency plans should be complemented by such blended learning training so that they are immediately available in case of a second pandemic wave, future pandemics or other crisis situations.","output":"Kliniksanit?ter.

This study sought to identify clinical sequelae and its potential intrinsic mechanism among COVID-19 survivors in the follow-up. Methods: We conducted a prospective single-center study (NCT04689490) of previously hospitalized COVID-19 patients with and without dyspnea during mid-term follow-up, an outpatient asymptomatic control group was also evaluated. They underwent serial testing with cardio-pulmonary exercise test (CPET), transthoracic echocardiogram, pulmonary lung test, six-minute walking test, serum biomarker analysis and quality of life questionaries.Results: Patients with dyspnea (n=41, 58.6%), compared with asymptomatic (n=29, 41.4%), had a higher proportion of females (73.2% vs. 51.7%;p= 0.065), with comparable age and prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors. There were no significant differences in transthoracic echocardiogram and pulmonary function test, in either group.

The complete lockdown and the prohibition of certain services have led to an unstable employment situation. Only several studies investigated the job insecurity and its consequences during COVID-19 pandemic, and some of them highlight the fear of COVID-19 as a significant moderator of mental health. Other studies emphasize the huge effect that intolerance of uncertainty could have in explaining distress, especially during pandemic. In addition, intolerance of uncertainty was considered as a possible moderator of the relationship between the objective and subjective job threat, as well their consequences for mental health. This study aimed to examine the presence of job insecurity and work related distress in Serbia during the first wave of COVID-19. We wanted to measure the effect of the job insecurity on experienced work distress, as well the moderation potential of the intolerance of uncertainty as an individual-level and the fear of coronavirus as a situation-dependent variable. Five hundred and twenty five employed participants took part in an online study during the first wave of coronavirus infection in Serbia. To measure job insecurity, we used Perception of job insecurity scale (PJIS), while distress was assessed with Distress scale from 4DSQ. Fear of COVID-19 was measured on three items. The intolerance of uncertainty was measured by the IUS-11 scale. The results showed that 30.4% of the participants consider their employment as moderately or highly insecure, and 15.1% thought they can lose their jobs. 63.4% of participants expressed increased levels of distress. The moderation analysis revealed that the effect of job insecurity on distress can be moderated by interaction of intolerance of uncertainty and COVID-related fear. In general, distress scores were increasing with increasing job insecurity, intolerance of uncertainty and fear of COVID-19. This pattern is not observed only when fear and intolerance of uncertainty were both low, when job instability could not influence distress. This study also showed that emotional appraisal of the job threat had higher impact on distress than the perceived threat, that shed the light on the importance of considering general resilience capabilities as a protective factor in the work environment in the time of crisis.","output":"Intolerance of Uncertainty and Fear of COVID-19 Moderating Role in Relationship Between Job Insecurity and Work-Related Distress in the Republic of Serbia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An outbreak of enteric disease of unknown etiology with 60% morbidity and 8% mortality in weaning piglets occurred in November 2015 on a farm in Buryat Republic, Russia.

The rate of sputum+ in Nares+ patients was 36% (9/25). The rate of sputum+ in Nares- was 10% (12/115; P = .003). The sputum+ SICU length of stay (LOS) (18  12 days in 23 S+ patients) is longer than in sputum- (10  9 days in 69 S-patients, P = .0002). CONCLUSIONS This SICU has high rates of both nares and sputum MRSA cultures. Our data suggest eradicating nares colonization may prevent pneumonia and might decrease SICU LOS.","output":"Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus screening and eradication in the surgical intensive care unit: Is it worth it?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The work environment of emergency workers is an important factor related to stress. Coping with the COVID-19 emergency is a factor that is highly related to stress, and severe stress is a risk factor for developing secondary trauma. Coping and resilience can help rescue workers to better respond in emergency situations and could protect them from secondary trauma. We aimed to explore the relationship of emergency stress, hardiness, coping strategies, and secondary trauma among emergency workers and the mediating roles of coping strategies and hardiness on the effect of stress in producing secondary trauma. The study involved 513 emergency workers from the Red Cross Committee in Veneto, one of the Italian regions most affected by the COVID-19. Participants completed questionnaires online to measure emergency stress (physical, emotional, cognitive, organizational-relational, COVID-19, and inefficacy decisional), hardiness, coping strategies, and secondary trauma. Other variables analyzed were age, gender, weekly hours of service, and use of personal protective equipment (PPE). We performed t-tests, a correlational analysis, regressions, and a mediation analysis. Hardiness and coping strategies, in particular, which stop unpleasant emotions and thoughts and problem-focused, emerged as mediators in reducing the predicted effect of stress on secondary trauma. The mediating effects of hardiness and coping strategies were found to reduce the effect of stress on arousal by 15% and the effect on avoidance by 25%.","output":"Hardiness and coping strategies as mediators of stress and secondary trauma in emergency workers during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Use of telehealth for behavioral health services has increased since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Social Inclusion Questionnaire User Experience (SInQUE) is a new measure of social inclusion for mental health service users which assesses five domains (consumption, production, access to services, social integration and civil engagement). It has good psychometric properties and is acceptable to service users and mental health professionals. It is not clear whether individuals with different diagnostic conditions experience a similar reduction in social inclusion. AIMS: (1) Investigate whether current social inclusion differs between diagnostic groups (people with schizophrenia/other psychotic disorders, common mental disorder or personality disorder); (2) Identify factors associated with lower social inclusion; (3) Examine associations between social inclusion and stigma, quality of life and loneliness. METHOD: Mental health service users with psychotic disorder, personality disorder or common mental disorder, living in the community, completed the SInQUE, alongside other validated outcome measures. Multiple regression investigated associations. RESULTS: About 192 service users (55% with psychotic disorder; 26% with common mental disorder; 19% with personality disorder). Current social inclusion did not vary according to diagnosis, except for the sub-domain of productivity, where individuals with personality disorder were more socially included than the other two groups. Lower social inclusion was associated with older age (p = .008), lack of higher education (p < .001), more previous admissions (p = .005), severity of current symptoms and greater experienced stigma (p = .006) and anticipated stigma (p = .035). Greater social inclusion was associated with better quality of life (p < .001) and less loneliness (p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Barriers to social inclusion in individuals with severe mental health problems include factors related to the illness, such as symptom severity and external factors, such as stigma and discrimination. Social inclusion is a recovery goal and should be routinely assessed. Increasing people's social inclusion benefits service users in terms of improved mental health, better quality of life and reduced loneliness.","output":"'Modelling social exclusion in a diagnostically-mixed sample of people with severe mental illness'"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The C-type lectin DC-SIGN expressed on dendritic cells (DCs) facilitates capture and internalization of a plethora of different pathogens. Although it is known that DC-SIGN organizes in nanoclusters at the surface of DCs, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this well defined nanopatterning and role in viral binding remain enigmatic. By combining biochemical and advanced biophysical techniques, including optical superresolution and single particle tracking, we demonstrate that DC-SIGN intrinsic nanoclustering strictly depends on its molecular structure. DC-SIGN nanoclusters exhibited free, Brownian diffusion on the cell membrane. Truncation of the extracellular neck region, known to abrogate tetramerization, significantly reduced nanoclustering and concomitantly increased lateral diffusion. Importantly, DC-SIGN nanocluster dissolution exclusively compromised binding to nanoscale size pathogens. Monte Carlo simulations revealed that heterogeneity on nanocluster density and spatial distribution confers broader binding capabilities to DC-SIGN. As such, our results underscore a direct relationship between spatial nanopatterning, driven by intermolecular interactions between the neck regions, and receptor diffusion to provide DC-SIGN with the exquisite ability to dock pathogens at the virus length scale. Insight into how virus receptors are organized prior to virus binding and how they assemble into functional platforms for virus docking is helpful to develop novel strategies to prevent virus entry and infection.","output":"The neck region of the C-type lectin DC-SIGN regulates its surface spatiotemporal organization and virus-binding capacity on antigen-presenting cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease caused by Leishmania protozoa, which presents a large spectrum of clinical manifestations. In the present study, a quinoline derivative salt named N-(2-((7-chloroquinolin-4-yl)amino)ethyl)-N-(prop-2-yn-1-yl)prop-2-yn-1-aminium chloride or QDS3 was in vitro and in vivo tested against L. infantum by means of its incorporation in Poloxamer 407-based polymeric micelles (QDS3/M). The in vitro antileishmanial activity of QDS3 and QDS3/M was investigated in L. infantum promastigotes, axenic amastigotes and infected macrophages. BALB/c mice were infected with L. infantum, and parasitological parameters were evaluated 1 and 15 days post-treatment by determining the parasite load by a limiting dilution assay, besides a quantitative PCR (qPCR) method. Immunological response was assessed based on production of cellular cytokines, as well as by quantification of nitrite levels and specific antibodies. In vitro results showed that QDS3 free or in micelles presented effective antileishmanial action against both parasite stages, being more effective in amastigotes. In vivo data showed that treatment using QDS3 or QDS3/M reduced the parasite load in the livers, spleens, draining lymph nodes (dLN) and bone marrows of the treated animals, 1 and 15 days after treatment, when compared to values found in the control groups. Additionally, treated mice developed a polarized Th1-type immune response, with higher levels of IL-12, IFN-, GM-CSF and nitrite, besides high production of specific IgG2a antibodies, when compared to the controls. Parasitological and immunological data obtained using the micellar composition were better than the others.

The main approach to asymptomatic vascular disease is based on primary prevention with the adoption of a healthy lifestyle. Indeed, lifestyle influences most of the traditional risk factors. In recent years, important differences between the sexes regarding cardiovascular risk factors have emerged and in particular, risk factors specific for female sex have been identified. Women are more likely to be categorized into lower risk categories for cardiovascular disease and, as a result, receive less lifestyle counseling than men, as well as less intensive prevention.

It is a dyadic parent-child therapy with unique elements of in vivo parent coaching via a bug in the ear by the therapist who works from behind a one-way mirror. Most important, PCIT allows for individually tailored coaching that can address unique difficulties of particular parent-child dyads. Despite the effectiveness of PCIT, a high dropout rate (in some studies as high as 50%) prior to completion of the treatment remains a significant problem. The use of new technologies such as telehealth to remotely deliver real-time therapy to the patients home has shown to overcome the many barriers including treatment availability, accessibility, and acceptability. During the COVID-19 pandemic, internet-PCIT (I-PCIT) became the treatment of choice for many centers around the country. Methods: This presentation will introduce the basic concepts of I-PCIT. We will focus on the similarities and differences between standard PCIT delivered in the office setting and I-PCIT. We will show video clips of I-PCIT sessions to illustrate the novel aspects of the treatment. Results: Participants will learn how to conduct PCIT using remote technology. They will be able to discuss various aspects of the PCIT treatment done in the home environment. They will be able to review problem-solving strategies such as ways to keep the young child in the room, time-out routine practice, and siblings needing to be present in the session, and other challenging situations will be discussed.

METHODS: We conducted a 2-arm randomized controlled trial testing a theory-based, community-informed, Web-accessible computer role-playing game intervention. Control condition received a list of resources. Primary hypotheses were high levels of implementation success, game demand, and game acceptability. RESULTS: We randomized 240 SGMYs aged 14-18 years into the intervention (n = 120) or control (n = 120) conditions. Participants completed baseline (100%), 1-month follow-up (T2; 73.3%), and 2-month follow-up (T3; 64.4%) surveys. Among intervention participants, 55.8% downloaded and played the game. Of those who played, 46.2% reported a desire to play it again, and 50.8% would recommend it. Game acceptability exceeded hypothesized benchmarks, wherein participants reported high positive affect (M = 2.36; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.13, 2.58), low negative affect (M = 2.75; 95% CI: 2.55, 2.95), low tension/annoyance (M = 3.18; 95% CI: 2.98, 3.39), and high competence (M = 2.23; 95% CI: 2.04, 2.43) while playing the game.

The high expressing T-allele is a risk allele for the non-infectious aging lung disease idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We investigated if MUC5B rs35705950 associates with severe COVID-19. Methods: In this retrospective candidate gene case-control study we recruited 108 Dutch patients (69% male, median age 66 years, 77% white) requiring hospitalization for COVID-19 (22% ICU stay, 24% died). For validation, genotypes were obtained from the UK-Biobank (n = 436, 57% male, median age 70 years, 27% died), for replication data from the severe COVID-19 GWAS group from Italy (n = 835) and Spain (n = 775) was used, each with a control cohort (n = 356,735, n = 1,255, n = 950, respectively). MUC5B association analysis was performed including adjustment for age and sex. Results: The rs35705950 T-allele frequency was significantly lower in Dutch white patients (n = 83) than in controls (0.04 vs. 0.10; p = 0.02). This was validated in the UK biobank cohort (0.08 vs. 0.11; p = 0.001). While age and sex differed significantly between cases and control, comparable results were obtained with age and sex as confounding variables in a multivariate analysis. The association was replicated in the Italian (p = 0.04), and Spanish (p = 0.03) case-control cohorts.

The target protein was first recognized by a pair of DNACantibody conjugates, Ab-1 and Ab-2, to form a proximity-ligated complex, Ab-1/SARS-CoV-2/Ab-2, which contained a DNA sequence complemental to block DNA and thus induced a strand displacement reaction to release the primer from a block/primer complex. The released primer then triggered a rolling circle amplification to form abundant DNAzyme units in the presence of hemin, which produced a strong chemiluminescent signal for the detection of the target protein by catalyzing the oxidation of luminol by hydrogen peroxide. The proposed assay showed a detectable concentration range over 5 orders of magnitude with the detection limit down to 6.46 fg/mL. The excellent selectivity, simple procedure, acceptable accuracy, and intrinsic high throughput of the imaging technique for analysis of serum samples demonstrated the potential applicability of the proposed detection method in clinical screening and diagnosis.","output":"A Rolling Circle-Amplified G-Quadruplex/Hemin DNAzyme for Chemiluminescence Immunoassay of the SARS-CoV-2 Protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mastitis is one of the major diseases causing economic loss to the dairy industry by reducing the quantity and quality of milk. Thus, the objective of this scientific study was to find new biomarkers based on genes for the early prediction before its severity. METHODS: In the present study, advanced bioinformatics including hierarchical clustering, enrichment analysis, active site prediction, epigenetic analysis, functional domain identification, and protein docking were used to analyze the important genes that could be utilized as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for mastitis. RESULTS: Four differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in different regions of the mammary gland (teat cistern, gland cistern, lobuloalveolar, and Furstenbergs rosette) that resulted in 453, 597, 577, and 636 DEG, respectively. Also, 101 overlapped genes were found by comparing 27 different expressed genes. These genes were associated with eight immune response pathways including NOD-like receptor signaling pathway (IL8, IL18, IL1B, PYDC1) and chemokine signaling pathway (PTK2, IL8, NCF1, CCR1, HCK). Meanwhile, 241 protein-protein interaction networks were developed among overlapped genes. Fifty-seven regulatory events were found between miRNAs, expressed genes, and the transcription factors (TFs) through micro-RNA and transcription factors (miRNA-DEG-TF) regulatory network.

Providing the results of economic evaluation for mass vaccination is of paramount importance for all stakeholders worldwide. METHODS: We developed a Markov decision tree for the economic evaluation of mass vaccination against COVID-19. The effectiveness of reducing outcomes after the administration of three COVID-19 vaccines (BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), and AZD1222 (Oxford-AstraZeneca)) were modelled with empirical parameters obtained from literatures. The direct cost of vaccine and COVID-19 related medical cost, the indirect cost of productivity loss due to vaccine jabs and hospitalization, and the productivity loss were accumulated given different vaccination scenarios. We reported the incremental cost-utility ratio and benefit/cost (B/C) ratio of three vaccines compared to no vaccination with a probabilistic approach. RESULTS: Moderna and Pfizer vaccines won the greatest effectiveness among the three vaccines under consideration. After taking both direct and indirect costs into account, all of the three vaccines dominated no vaccination strategy. The results of B/C ratio show that one dollar invested in vaccine would have USD $13, USD $23, and USD $28 in return for Moderna, Pfizer, and AstraZeneca, respectively when health and education loss are considered.

Such reviews fail to assess states' actual capacity for meeting the challenges they may face during an emergency, as evidenced by activities undertaken during the various phases of a disaster. This article examines North Carolina's public health preparedness and response performance during two hurricanes, Hurricane Floyd in 1999 and Hurricane Isabel in 2003, as well as capacity building activities in the intervening years. North Carolina created new infrastructures, enhanced laboratory capacity, and strengthened communications after Hurricane Floyd. These activities facilitated implementation of functional capabilities through effective centralized communication, command and control incident management, and a rapid needs assessment and medical surveillance during Hurricane Isabel. North Carolina continues to implement these capabilities in public health emergencies. Measuring and implementing functional capabilities during exercises or real events facilitates achievement of preparedness performance standards, goals, and objectives.","output":"Evaluation of public health response to hurricanes finds North Carolina better prepared for public health emergencies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Meal delivery has become of increasing popularity in past years and of great importance in past months during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sustaining such services depends on maintaining provider profitability and reduced cost to consumers while continuing to support autonomy and independence for customers, restaurants, and delivery drivers (here crowdsourced drivers). This paper investigates the possible enactment of curbside regulations that limit the number of drivers simultaneously waiting at restaurants to pick up meals for delivery on both public safety and delivery efficiency. Curbside regulations would aim to increase safety by enabling social distancing between delivery personnel at pickup locations and have a secondary benefit of improving local traffic flows, which are sometimes impeded in busier, urban locations. Curbside space limits are studied in terms of their impacts on consumer-related performance measures: freshness of the food upon delivery and click-to-door time. This investigation is enabled through a proposed hybrid discrete-event and time-advanced simulation platform that replicates meal delivery service calls and pickup and delivery operations across a region built on data from a leading meal delivery company. Embedded within the simulation is an integer program that optimally assigns orders to drivers in a dynamically changing environment. Order assignments are constrained by imposed curbside capacity limits at the restaurants, and potential efficiencies and curbside violation reductions from bundling orders are assessed. Results of analyses from numerical experiments provide insights to state and local communities in designing curbside restrictions that reduce curbside crowding yet enable delivery companies to retain their profitability.","output":"Assessing the Effects of Limited Curbside Pickup Capacity in Meal Delivery Operations for Increased Safety during a Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The capital market plays a vital role in marketing operations for aerospace industry. However, due to the uncertainty and complexity of the stock market and many cyclical factors, the stock prices of listed aerospace companies fluctuate significantly. This makes the share price prediction challengeable. To improve the prediction of share price for aerospace industry sector and well understand the impact of various indicators on stock prices, we provided a hybrid prediction model by the combination of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Recurrent Neural Networks. We investigated two types of aerospace industries (manufacturer and operator). The experimental results show that PCA could improve both accuracy and efficiency of prediction. Various factors could influence the performance of prediction models, such as finance data, extracted features, optimisation algorithms, and parameters of the prediction model. The selection of features may depend on the stability of historical data: technical features could be the first option when the share price is stable, whereas fundamental features could be better when the share price has high fluctuation. The delays of RNN also depend on the stability of historical data for different types of companies. It would be more accurate through using short-term historical data for aerospace manufacturers, whereas using long-term historical data for aerospace operating airlines. The developed model could be an intelligent agent in an automatic stock prediction system, with which, the financial industry could make a prompt decision for their economic strategies and business activities in terms of predicted future share price, thus improving the return on investment. Currently, COVID-19 severely influences aerospace industries.

TCP inhibits secretion of sex hormones. Similar to CPF, TCP can bind to sex steroid hormone receptors and decrease the secretion of sex hormones. However, little attention has been paid to the ability of TCP and CPF to interfere with androgen receptor (AR) in Sertoli cells. This study aimed to explain how TCP promotes the inhibitory effect of CPF on the paracrine function of Sertoli cells. Western blotting indicated that after 20 weeks of exposure, expression of AR in testes was significantly reduced by CPF. An in vitro assay measured the cytotoxicity of CPF, TCP and diethylphosphate (DEP) on viability of Sertoli cells by Cell Counting Kit-8. CPF cytotoxicity was greater than that of TCP, and TCP cytotoxicity was greater than that of DEP at concentrations of 1000 mol/L. Western blotting indicated that TCP and CPF both decreased expression of AR and cAMP-response element binding protein phosphorylation, while DEP had no effect in Sertoli cells, which are important in regulating paracrine function of Sertoli cells. The fluorescence measurements and docking studies revealed that testosterone, CPF and TCP showed four types of intermolecular interactions with AR, highlighting alkyl bonds with some of the same amino acids. Compared with testosterone, CPF and TCP also showed significant synergistic interaction with AR. CPF interacted with more amino acids and interaction energy than TCP did. This research elucidates TCP in the antiandrogenic effect of CPF on the paracrine function and suggests that TCP or chemicals with a trichloropyridine structure must be considered during reproductive toxicity assessment of potential environmental pollutants.","output":"3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol intensifies the effect of chlorpyrifos on the paracrine function of Sertoli cells by preventing binding of testosterone and the androgen receptor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Online meal delivery platforms (OMDPs), like UberEats, have received more attention since quarantine was established to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

In this study, we have developed an in-silico models to identify infectious strains of Influenza A virus, which has the potential of getting transmitted to humans, from its whole genome/proteins. Firstly, machine learning based models were developed for predicting infectious strains using composition of 15 proteins of virus. Random Forest based model of protein Hemagglutinin, achieved maximum AUC 0.98 on validation data using dipeptide composition. Secondly, we obtained maximum AUC of 0.99 on validation dataset using one-hot-encoding features of each protein of virus. Thirdly, models build on DNA composition of whole genome of Influenza A, achieved maximum AUC 0.98 on validation dataset. Finally, a web-based service, named FluSPred(https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/fluspred/) has been developed which incorporate best 16 models (15 proteins and one based on genome) for prediction of infectious strains of virus.

People with mental health problems may suffer even more from its consequences. AIM Measuring mental health, experiences with outpatient care and government measures of 105 people in mental health care in the Northern Netherlands during the first wave of COVID-19. METHOD Anonymous, online survey among people in care with autism- or FACT-teams in the Northern Netherlands between July-September 2020. RESULTS Few participants reported recent COVID-19-related symptoms (n=2); no participant had lab-confirmed COVID-19. Both positive (clear world, tranquility, few stimuli: 28%) and negative experiences (missing face-to-face contact with mental health care professionals: 22%) were reported. Although there was some fluctuation in happiness, the average happiness score did not change due to the first wave. Three-quarters were satisfied with their mental health care. Although in-person contact with mental health care professionals was missed, the continuation of care through (video)calling was appreciated. One third reported an increased or new care need in mental health symptoms or daily functioning. The 'physical' government measures were considered pleasant and doable, but 'social' measures were harder. Newsletters with practical information about the consequences of the measures for personal healthcare were appreciated.

In Europe, brucellosis has been eradicated in domestic ruminants from most countries and wild ruminants have not been considered important reservoirs so far. However, a high prevalence of Brucella melitensis infection has been recently identified in a French population of Alpine ibex (Capra ibex), after the emergence of brucellosis was confirmed in a dairy cattle farm and two human cases. This situation raised the need to identify the factors driving the persistence of Brucella infection at high prevalence levels in this ibex population. In the present paper, we studied the shedding pattern of B. melitensis in ibex from Bargy Massif, French Alps. Bacteriological examinations (1C15 tissues/samples per individual) were performed on 88 seropositive, supposedly infected and euthanized individuals. Among them, 51 (58%) showed at least one positive culture, including 45 ibex with at least one Brucella isolation from a urogenital sample or a lymph node in the pelvic area (active infection in organs in the pelvic area). Among these 45 ibex, 26 (30% of the total number of necropsied animals) showed at least one positive culture for a urogenital organ and were considered as being at risk of shedding the bacteria at the time of capture. We observed significant heterogeneity between sex-and-age classes: seropositive females were most at risk to excrete Brucella before the age of 5 years, possibly corresponding to abortion during the first pregnancy following infection such as reported in the domestic ruminants. The high shedding potential observed in young females may have contributed to the self-sustained maintenance of infection in this population, whereas males are supposed to play a role of transmission between spatial units through venereal transmission during mating. This heterogeneity in the shedding potential of seropositive individuals should be considered in the future to better evaluate management scenarios in this system as well as in others.","output":"High Shedding Potential and Significant Individual Heterogeneity in Naturally-Infected Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) With Brucella melitensis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We study Susceptible-Exposed-Asymptomatic-Infectious-Recovered (SEAIR) epidemic spreading model of COVID-19.

The hypothesis was that capillary transit time heterogeneity in selected brain regions is greater during phenylephrine than during ephedrine, thus reducing cerebral oxygen tension. METHODS In this single-center, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial, 24 anesthetized brain tumor patients were randomly assigned to ephedrine or phenylephrine. Magnetic resonance imaging of peritumoral and contralateral hemispheres was performed before and during vasopressor infusion. The primary endpoint was between-group difference in capillary transit time heterogeneity. Secondary endpoints included changes in cerebral blood flow, estimated oxygen extraction fraction, and brain tissue oxygen tension. RESULTS Data from 20 patients showed that mean ( SD) capillary transit time heterogeneity in the contralateral hemisphere increased during phenylephrine from 3.0  0.5 to 3.2  0.7 s and decreased during ephedrine from 3.1  0.8 to 2.7  0.7 s (difference phenylephrine versus difference ephedrine [95% CI], -0.6 [-0.9 to -0.2] s; P = 0.004). In the peritumoral region, the mean capillary transit time heterogeneity increased during phenylephrine from 4.1  0.7 to 4.3  0.8 s and decreased during ephedrine from 3.5  0.9 to 3.3  0.9 s (difference phenylephrine versus difference ephedrine [95%CI], -0.4[-0.9 to 0.1] s; P = 0.130). Cerebral blood flow (contralateral hemisphere ratio difference [95% CI], 0.3 [0.06 to 0.54]; P = 0.018; and peritumoral ratio difference [95% CI], 0.3 [0.06 to 0.54; P = 0.018) and estimated brain tissue oxygen tension (contralateral hemisphere ratio difference [95% CI], 0.34 [0.09 to 0.59]; P = 0.001; and peritumoral ratio difference [95% CI], 0.33 [0.09 to 0.57]; P = 0.010) were greater during ephedrine than phenylephrine in both regions. CONCLUSIONS Phenylephrine caused microcirculation in contralateral tissue, measured by the change in capillary transit time heterogeneity, to deteriorate compared with ephedrine, despite reaching similar mean arterial pressure endpoints. Ephedrine improved cerebral blood flow and tissue oxygenation in both brain regions and may be superior to phenylephrine in improving cerebral macro- and microscopic hemodynamics and oxygenation.

A volumetric specimen imager (VSI) was developed to provide full-3D and thin-slice cross-sectional visualization at a 360 view angle. The purpose of this prospective trial was to compare VSI, 2D SR, and DBT interpretation of lumpectomy margin status with the final pathologic margin status of breast lumpectomy specimens. METHODS: The study enrolled 200 cases from two institutions. After standard imaging and interpretation was performed, the main lumpectomy specimen was imaged with the VSI device. Image interpretation was performed by three radiologists after surgery based on VSI, 2D SR, and DBT. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was created for each method. The area under the curve (AUC) was computed to characterize the performance of the imaging method interpreted by each user. RESULTS: From 200 lesions, 1200 margins were interpreted. The AUC values of VSI for the three radiologists were respectively 0.91, 0.90, and 0.94, showing relative improvement over the AUCs of 2D SR by 54%, 13%, and 40% and DBT by 32% and 11%, respectively. The VSI has sensitivity ranging from 91 to 94%, specificity ranging from 81 to 85%, a positive predictive value ranging from 25 to 30%, and a negative predicative value of 99%.

We previously showed a role for immune complexes (ICs) in the enhancement of antiviral T-cell responses through FcR-mediated activation of dendritic cells (DCs). Here we addressed how mAb therapy in retrovirus-infected mice affects the activation of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes, two FcR-expressing innate effector cells rapidly recruited to sites of infection. We found that both cell-types activated in vitro by viral ICs secreted chemokines able to recruit monocytes and neutrophils themselves. Moreover, inflammatory cytokines potentiated chemokines and cytokines release by IC-activated cells and induced FcRIV upregulation. Similarly, infection and mAb-treatment upregulated FcRIV on neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes and enhanced their cytokines/chemokines secretion. Notably, upon antibody therapy neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes displayed distinct functional activation states and sequentially modulated the antiviral immune response by secreting Th1-type polarizing cytokines and chemokines, which occurred in a FcRIV-dependent manner. Consistently, FcRIV- blocking in mAb-treated, infected mice led to reduced immune protection.

We used meta-ethnography to synthesize findings. This is a conceptual approach to qualitative evidence synthesis. We used the recent guidelines for reporting meta-ethnography. RESULTS: We screened 3103 titles and 255 abstracts and included 37 primary studies. These incorporated the experience of 777 women, (aged 18 to 95 years) from a range of countries. We organized 162 ideas into 27 conceptual categories and 10 themes. We developed a conceptual model that helps us to understand the experience of pelvic organ prolapse.

SUMMARY AND BACKGROUND DATA Despite a growing awareness that human factors, non-technical skills and wellbeing in healthcare affect patient outcomes, an area that has remained unexplored is surgical performance anxiety (SPA). METHODS A prospectively registered, cross-sectional study using mixed methods was conducted across the United Kingdom. Data captured included demographics, surgical specialty, trait anxiety, trait perfectionism, SPA, and surgical perfectionism scores. Wellbeing was assessed using The Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale, whereas qualitative data were collected regarding surgeons' experiences of SPA. RESULTS A total of 631 responses were collected. Mean age was 412 years and mean surgical experience 153 years. A total of 62% were male and 52% of consultant/attending grade. A total of 100% felt that SPA affected surgeons, with 87% having experienced it themselves. A total of 65% reported SPA negatively impacted surgical performance and 96% felt SPA negatively impacted surgeons' wellbeing. Male surgeons reported significantly better wellbeing than female surgeons. Surgeons with SPA reported significantly worse wellbeing compared with surgeons who did not experience SPA. Surgeons in general experienced significantly lower mental wellbeing compared with population norms. Thematic analysis highlighted a reticence to share SPA openly and need for cultural change. CONCLUSIONS Surgical performance anxiety is a very common and significant challenge among surgeons across all specialties at all levels of experience in the United Kingdom.

During this rebuild, the instructor also incorporated and developed all new lecture materials, quizzes, and homework based on the adoption of a new course textbook. The comprehensive approach included refining course/module objectives, establishing detailed grading rubrics, developing new procedures for unsupervised online exams, learning live video communication software/equipment, designing a new online course in Canvas, and delivering it to 100 studentsall without leaving his home. When compared with the previous five years of assessment data, the overall results in student project grades, course grades, and student evaluations of instructor effectiveness indicated a steady performance level through this significant change in material and life circumstances. The final student course scores increased in this offering when compared with the previous years.

There were numerous intramyelinic vacuoles in the brains of TP-affected birds. Many of these vacuoles contained particulate material compatible with precipitated protein from edema. Astrocyte processes often were distended with similar particulate material. Most intrameylinic vacuoles were either adjacent to the axolemma or within inner myelin lamellae. Myelin sheaths of affected axons, while being displaced, were relatively normal with no vesiculation. Most affected axons were also otherwise normal. Cell processes adjacent to occasional affected axons were distended by degenerating mitochondria, vacuoles, and amorphous material. Some of these processes appeared to be inner loops of oligodendrocyte cytoplasm. The cell bodies of most oligodendrocytes were normal, but a few contained vacuoles similar to those seen in processes adjacent to axons. There were scattered necrotic cells. While most of these could not be specifically identified, some appeared to be oligodendrocytes. Mononuclear inflammatory cells were present both perivascularly and within the parenchyma. Although these cells occasionally contacted myelinated axons and there was myelin phagocytosis, there was no indication that they initiated demyelination.

This lockdown continued, with a short period of blended learning, over the time of summer 2020. Distance learning had previously been rarely used within Polish medical schools, so such a sudden transfer was a major challenge. The aim of the study was to explore undergraduates perception of online teaching provided at Polish medical faculties during the pandemic and to analyze how these experiences may inform future curriculum development. METHODS: The online survey was addressed to undergraduates at Polish medical faculties in November 2020. The questions captured demographics, epidemiological data and students perception of various aspects of online teaching. Responses were subjected to thematic analysis and their distribution compared considering demographic parameters . RESULTS: Six hundred twenty students from thirteen medical faculties responded to the survey. Major benefits from online teaching perceived by respondents included increased convenience, enhanced quality, a sense of comfort and safety. Major complaints were associated with unsatisfactory content, technical issues, difficulties engaging, poor organization and lack of social life. Students claimed that online teaching required more self-directed learning and discipline and 57.9% considered this impact as negative. 44.5% of respondents took part in educational online activities beyond their scheduled classes. For 49.2% online examinations were reported as more stressful and for 24.8% - less stressful than traditional ones. Differences in the opinions on online teaching were found between men and women, students in early and senior years, Polish and non-Polish ones. CONCLUSIONS: The sudden move online inevitably was problematic for students. Their perspective afforded us the opportunity to consider shortcomings of pre-pandemic undergraduate curriculum. Online education requires a more self-directed learning, which was challenging for many students, so further enhancement of more autonomous study skills seems necessary. Distress expressed by students indicates the need for urgent support with mental health issues.

Unfortunately, postoperative opioids have decreased efficacy in AlBR, short-term complication profiles, and are fraught by long-term dependence. This systematic review aims to identify opioid-sparing pain management strategies in AlBR. Methods A systematic literature search of MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register was performed in September 2018. PRISMA guidelines were followed, and the review was prospectively registered in PROSPERO (CRD42018107911). The search identified 1184 articles. Inclusion criteria were defined as patients 18 years or older undergoing AlBR. Results Fourteen articles were identified assessing opioid-sparing strategies in AlBR. This literature included articles evaluating enhanced recovery protocols (two), intercostal blocks (two), paravertebral blocks (four), liposomal bupivacaine (three), diclofenac (one), and local anesthesia infusion pumps (two). The literature included five randomized trials and nine cohort studies. Study characteristics, bias (low to high risk), and reporting outcomes were extensively heterogeneous between articles. Qualitative analysis suggests reduced opioid utilization in enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathways, paravertebral blocks, and use of liposomal bupivacaine. Conclusions A variety of opioid-sparing strategies are described for pain management in AlBR. Multimodal analgesia should be provided via ERAS pathways as they appear to reduce pain and spare opioid use. Targeted paravertebral blocks and liposomal bupivacaine field blocks appear to be beneficial in sparing opioids and should be considered as essential components of ERAS protocols.

Objective This study aims to investigate how the social distancing measures that was taken by the Egyptian government during the COVID-19 health crisis, affect the family situation, and sexual relationship. Methods An international online survey was conducted to evaluate the sexual and reproductive health and wellbeing in times of the COVID-19 crisis in Egypt. An online informed consent was obtained from all participants. The survey was available in the Arabic language for only Egyptian citizens and/or residents who are speaking Arabic and older than 18 years old. This survey has been a part of the I-SHARE (International Sexual Health And REproductive Health) Survey that examines the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on sexual and reproductive health. Participation in this survey was anonymous. Results Total respondents were 1021 with 53.2% (544/1021) were males. Most participants were young age (age 21-30, 31-40 years were 41.9, 29.9 % respectively). Participants were mainly from the Large Cairo (24.5%) and Delta (15.2%) provinces with most of them were Muslim (91.2%). 40.5% were legally married and living together. As regards the COVID-19 social distancing measures, they follow them a lot and very strictly follow 37.3, 33 % respectively.77.4% never undergone testing for COVID-19 and only 9% was tested positive. More than half (56.5%) reported that the economic situation become worse during the social distancing measures. Alcohol and Cannabis intake were (6, 4.2% monthly or less, 5.6, 4% 2-4 times/month) respectively before the social distancing measures, and were increased during the distancing measures (8, 5.7% monthly or less, 7, 8.1% 2-4 times/month) respectively. Satisfaction about sexual life was changed from (45.1% very satisfied, 26.2% somewhat satisfied) before the COVID-19 measures to (38.2% very satisfied, 31.7% somewhat satisfied) during them. Also, frequency of sexual intercourse (25.2% 2-4/month, 17.9% 2-3/week) before the COVID-19 measures stayed the same 74% and decreased a lot in 19.7% during the COVID-19 measures. Frequency of Masturbation was (16.4% monthly or less, 11.6% 2-4/month) before the COVID-19 measures stayed the same 39.6%, decreased a lot 37.6% and increased a lot 6.4% during the COVID-19 measures. Also, watching pornography was (15% monthly or less, 10% 2-4/month) before the COVID-19 measures and decreased a lot 41.7%, stayed the same 35.9% and increased a lot 6.2% during the COVID-19 measures.

Lack of targeted therapeutics and vaccines for COVID-2019 have triggered the scientific community to develop new vaccines or drugs against this novel virus. Many synthetic compounds and antimalarial drugs are undergoing clinical trials. The traditional medical practitioners widely use Indian medicinal plant Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha) natural constituents, called withanolides for curing various diseases. The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 plays a vital role in disease propagation by processing the polyproteins which are required for its replication. Hence, it denotes a significant target for drug discovery. In the present study, we evaluate the potential of 40 natural chemical constituents of Ashwagandha to explore a possible inhibitor against main protease of SARS-CoV-2 by adopting the computational approach. The docking study revealed that four constituents of Ashwagandha; Withanoside II (-11.30 Kcal/mol), Withanoside IV (-11.02 Kcal/mol), Withanoside V (-8.96 Kcal/mol) and Sitoindoside IX (-8.37 Kcal/mol) exhibited the highest docking energy among the selected natural constituents. Further, MD simulation study of 100 ns predicts Withanoside V possess strong binding affinity and hydrogen-bonding interactions with the protein active site and indicates its stability in the active site. The binding free energy score also correlates with the highest score of -87.01  5.01 Kcal/mol as compared to other selected compounds. In conclusion, our study suggests that Withanoside V in Ashwagandha may be serve as a potential inhibitor against Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 to combat COVID-19 and may have an antiviral effect on nCoV.

Binding is initiated by a down-to-up conformational change in the spike protein, the change that presents the RBD to the receptor. To date, computational and experimental studies that search for therapeutics have concentrated, for good reason, on the RBD. However, the RBD region is highly prone to mutations, and is therefore a hotspot for drug resistance. In contrast, we here focus on the correlations between the RBD and residues distant to it in the spike protein. This allows for a deeper understanding of the underlying molecular recognition events and prediction of the highest-effect key mutations in distant, allosteric sites, with implications for therapeutics. Also, these sites can appear in emerging mutants with possibly higher transmissibility and virulence, and preidentifying them can give clues for designing pan-coronavirus vaccines against future outbreaks. Our model, based on time-lagged independent component analysis (tICA) and protein graph connectivity network, is able to identify multiple residues that exhibit long-distance coupling with the RBD opening. Residues involved in the most ubiquitous D614G mutation and the A570D mutation of the highly contagious UK SARS-CoV-2 variant are predicted ab initio from our model. Conversely, broad-spectrum therapeutics like drugs and monoclonal antibodies can target these key distant-but-conserved regions of the spike protein.","output":"Distant residues modulate conformational opening in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In mid-March 2020, as the novel coronavirus started making its way through the United States, Fiona Lowenstein (they/their) became ill.

Clinical and radiographical variables were registered up to 12 months of follow-up, including MBL. A total of 30 patients were included in the study. The main outcome variable, MBL 12 months after prosthesis delivery, was statistically different in both groups: ?0.25 (0.12) vs. ?0.70 (0.43) (conical vs. hexagonal; p = 0.033).

This cross-sectional study examined meat and poultry plants to assess possible risk factors. Companies completed a self-administered questionnaire on the work environment and protective measures taken to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusted for the possibility to distance at least 1.5 meters, break rules, and employment status was performed to identify risk factors associated with COVID-19 cases. Twenty-two meat and poultry plants with 19,072 employees participated. The prevalence of COVID-19 in the seven plants with more than 10 cases was 12.1% and was highest in the deboning and meat cutting area with 16.1%. A subsample analysis where information on maximal ventilation rate per employee was available revealed an association with the ventilation rate (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.996, 95% CI 0.993-0.999). When including temperature as an interaction term in the working area, the association with the ventilation rate did not change.

Following research evidence that global media coverage presents the benefits of testing healthy people far more frequently than harms, and gives little coverage to overdiagnosis, we sought to examine journalists' views on media reporting of tests, overdiagnosis, and strategies to improve critical reporting on tests. DESIGN: Qualitative study using semistructured telephone interviews. Interviews were conducted between February and March 2020 and were audiorecorded and transcribed verbatim. Framework thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Twenty-two journalists (mainly specialising in health reporting, average 14.5 years' experience) based in Australia. RESULTS: This sample of journalists acknowledged the potential harms of medical tests but felt that knowledge of harms was low among journalists and the public at large. Most were aware of the term overdiagnosis, but commonly felt that it is challenging to both understand and communicate in light of strong beliefs in the benefits of early detection. Journalists felt that newsworthiness in the form of major public health impact was the key ingredient for stories about medical tests. The journalists acknowledged that factors, like the press release and 'click bait culture' in particular, can influence the framing of coverage about tests. Lack of knowledge and training, as well as time pressures, were perceived to be the main barriers to critical reporting on tests. Journalists felt that training and better access to information about potential harms would enable more critical reporting.

The objective of this pilot study is to assess the acceptability and feasibility of a tiered intervention added to the NPS MedicineWise dose reminder app (MedicineWise app) in supporting medication adherence in HF. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This prospective, single-blinded, randomised controlled trial will recruit 55 Australian patients with HF to be randomly assigned to either intervention (MedicineWise app + usual care) or control (usual care alone) arm. Control participants will remain unaware of the intervention throughout the study. At baseline, intervention participants will be instructed in the MedicineWise app. A reminder will then prompt medication administration at each dosing interval. If non-adherence is suggested from 24 hourly reports (critical medications) or 72 hours (non-critical medications), the individual/s will be escalated through a tiered, pharmacist-led intervention. The primary outcome will be the acceptability and feasibility of this approach in supporting adherence. Between-group comparison of the Self-Efficacy for Appropriate Medication Use Scale (SEAMS) at baseline, 3 and 6 months will be used to measure the apps value in supporting adherence.

AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: Several lymph node staging strategies have been proposed as a response to the high morbidity seen after standard inguinal lymphadenectomy for penile cancer. A video-endoscopic (laparoscopic and robotic) approach has been proposed as a less morbid procedure in several retrospective studies. To date, none has evaluated the oncological adequacy with regard to whether all relevant nodes have been removed. To the authors' knowledge this is the first prospective study of a robotic or laparoscopic inguinal lymphadenectomy that evaluates the oncological adequacy of this approach for penile cancer. The study shows that robotic inguinal lymphadenectomy allowed adequate staging of disease in the inguinal region by removing all relevant lymph nodes as assessed by an independent evaluating urological oncologist. OBJECTIVE To prospectively determine the oncological adequacy of robotic assisted video-endoscopic inguinal lymphadenectomy (RAVEIL). PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with T1-3N0 penile cancer were enrolled into a prospective phase I trial at a tertiary care institution from March 2010 to January 2012. All patients underwent an initial RAVEIL approach. Verification of adequacy of dissection was performed by an independent surgeon via a separate open incision at the conclusion of the RAVEIL procedure. Out of 10 patients, if more than two superficial inguinal fields with 2 nodes or more than four with 1 node remained within the superficial dissection field, the study would not proceed to phase II. RESULTS Of 10 enrolled patients two had inguinal metastases and all positive nodes were detected by RAVEIL. The remaining eight patients had no metastases, with a mean of nine (range 5-21) left and nine (range 6-17) right nodes removed. One inguinal field RAVEIL was converted to an open dissection. The verifying surgeon confirmed that 18 of 19 inguinal fields (94.7% in nine patients) had an adequate dissection. Two benign nodes were found just beneath Scarpa's fascia above the inguinal dissection field. Limitations of the study include an inability to determine decisively what specific wound complications were related to RAVEIL because of the protocol-specified creation of a small inguinal incision for verification of adequate dissection. CONCLUSION RAVEIL allowed adequate staging of disease in the inguinal region among patients with penile cancer at risk for inguinal metastases.","output":"Phase 1 prospective evaluation of the oncological adequacy of robotic assisted video-endoscopic inguinal lymphadenectomy in patients with penile carcinoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents the adaptation of a multi-disciplinary project-based learning (PBL) model for study-abroad engineering program to an offshore, online delivery model due to Covid-19 pandemic travel restrictions that prevented the students from travelling to the host country. The main aim of this research was to evaluate the effectiveness of switching our existing model to an online, offshore delivery environment, where the accessibility to a physical space was interrupted. We asked learners to provide specific feedback in their reports and presentations regarding the online environment and working in a virtual team, and analysed this feedback by dividing it into themes around communication, teamwork and technical content. Overall, the project outcomes were similar to previous years in which instruction was in a face-to-face classroom environment. Overall feedback from the learners was positive. The majority (9 of 11) learners felt that although completing the project online brought extra difficulties, that the experience was valuable and would be beneficial for their future. Although learners had sufficient tools to carry out effective communication and coordinate their project contributions, limitations in the technology (for example difficulty in showing 3D details of objects and mechanisms using a laptop web-cam), or cultural habits (reticence in bothering others when unsure what they are doing) meant that this communication was not always as efficient or effective as it could have been. Including a fully online multidisciplinary project can be said to provide learners with experience in an environment that is becoming more important in the workplace. To make the most of this learning opportunity, it is important that we make every effort to give the learners a positive overall experience so that they carry this impression with them into future endeavours. ? 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"Online Offshore Delivery of a Multidisciplinary Study-Abroad Engineering Project"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Naive and memory CD4(+) T cells reactive with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) are detectable in unexposed, unimmunized individuals.

The benefits of exercise in patients with KOA are supported by high-level evidence and take their place in primary care therapy (2). Today, coronavirus disease 2019 has developed as a pandemic all over the world, creating difficulties in healthcare and highlighting home-based rehabilitation (HBR) (3). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard for evaluating the effects of clinical interventions, but poorly reported results can have negative consequences. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) evaluates the methodological quality of RCTs (4). The CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement has been developed to improve the reporting quality of RCTs (5).There are no studies examining the quality of RCTs related to HBR in patients with KOA. Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the reporting quality of HBR trials for KOA, and explore the factors associated with the reporting. Methods: Two independent researchers investigated HBR RCTs in patients with KOA published between 1999 and 2020 were sourced from PubMed, the Cochrane Reviews and Web of Science. Each researcher evaluated the methodological quality of the included studies using the PEDro scoring and reporting aspects using 9 items from CONSORT. The relationship between adherence to the CONSORT criteria and the PEDro score were evaluated. Results: Twenty-five RCTs met our eligibility criteria. The mean PEDro score of studies is 5.76  1.48. Only one study found high quality (PEDro score:  9). The PEDro scores were: randomization type (96%, 24/25) and baseline comparability (92%, 23/25);all studies described group comparisons and variablity measures. In contrast, concealed allocation (18%, 7/25), blinding of participants (16%, 4/25) and therapists (0%) were not included in most studies. The CONSORT criteria were: flow diagram (92%, 23/25), sample size, subgroup analysis and sources of funding (56%, 11/25 for all three), while the majority of studies the trial registration number (16%, 4/25) was not available. A high level of correlation was found between meeting the CONSORT criteria and PEDro scores (r=0.820, p<0.001). Conclusion: The majority of RCTs based on HBR for KOA are low-to-modarate quality studies based on the PEDro score. Adherence to the CONSORT criteria is linked to high quality scores.

Methods: A web survey invitation was sent to healthcare worker listservs at a NYC medical center (April, 2020). The Primary Care (PC)-PTSD questionnaire was used to screen for PTSD symptoms at baseline and then every 2 weeks for 10 weeks. Incidence and prevalence of PTSD symptoms were determined at each time point. Multivariable generalized estimating equation models were performed to investigate the factors associated with a positive PC-PTSD screen at follow-up. Results: Median age (interquartile range) of N = 230 participants was 36 (31C48) years; 79.6% were women; 82.6% worked in COVID-19-focused settings.

MATERIALS AND METHODS In total, 5545 patients enrolled in 34 prospective clinical studies were evaluated in an integrated analysis of safety. Of all enrolled patients, 4549 received gadobutrol at a dose of  0.09 mmol/kg body weight to a maximum of 0.51 mmol/kg body weight, with most patients (53.5%) receiving the recommended dose of >0.09 to 0.11 mmol/kg body weight. Data include comparisons with other extracellular contrast agents and subgroup analyses in pediatric patients, and patients with allergic disposition, renal impairment, hepatic impairment, or cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, worldwide postmarketing safety surveillance results, including nephrogenic systemic fibrosis reports, based on more than 5.7 million estimated applications are described. RESULTS One or more adverse events (AEs) assessed as related to the administration of gadobutrol were reported by 182 (4.0%) of the 4549 patients who participated in clinical trials. This is comparable to the incidence observed with the comparator contrast agents (74/1844 patients, 4.0%). The most common AEs, independent of drug relationship, were headache, nausea, feeling hot, and dysgeusia. The favorable safety profile of gadobutrol was also demonstrated in the following specific subpopulations in whom similar incidence rates were seen: pediatric patients aged 2 to 17 years (8/138 patients, 5.8%), patients with severe or moderate renal impairment (9/366 patients, 2.5%), patients with severe or moderate hepatic impairment (9/214 patients, 4.2%), and patients with cardiovascular disorders (42/1506 patients, 2.8%). Having been established in controlled clinical trials, this safety profile was also confirmed by postmarketing surveillance data. With more than 5.7 million estimated administrations of gadobutrol, a total of 1175 (0.02%) suspected adverse drug reactions have been reported. The most serious adverse reactions seen in postmarketing surveillance included rare reports of cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, anaphylactoid shock, and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. Incidence and type of AEs from postmarketing surveillance were consistent with the established safety profile. CONCLUSION The comprehensive analysis of safety data obtained from 34 clinical studies demonstrates that gadobutrol has an excellent safety profile and a positive benefit risk profile when used in patients in need of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. Gadobutrol was well tolerated by adults, by children, by patients with impaired liver or kidney function, and by patients with cardiovascular disease. The favorable safety profile is confirmed by the available postmarketing surveillance data and is compared with that of other gadolinium-based contrast agents.","output":"Safety of gadobutrol, a new generation of contrast agents: experience from clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A coherent account of the reaction mechanistic details, structural modifications, and inhibition potentials of antineoplastic drug carmofur and its modified analogs to inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)) is reported. The survey is performed by integrating the density functional based tight binding (DFTB3) with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The inhibition process commences with nucleophilic attack from the sulfur atom on the carbonyl group, yielding a C-S bond formation, followed by a bond formation of the H-O9 by 2.07 ?, which results in a transition state contains a ring of six atoms. We found that although the direct addition of sulfhydryl group hydrogen to the N3 position is likely to happen, the proper position of the hydrogen to O9 decreases its accessibility. The thermodynamic stability of the complex was calculated to be highly sensitive to the substituent on the N11 position. Compounds with CH(2)NH(2) and CH(2)F at N11 positions of carmofur revealed high thermodynamic stability to complexation with M(pro) but induced no change in substrate-binding pocket comparable to carmofur. Replacing the N11 of carmofur with carbon (C-carmofur) was effective in terms of complexation stability at CH(2)CH(2)CH(2)F and CH(2)CH(2)CH(2)OH substitutions and occupation of S1 subsite by these structures in addition to the S2 subsite. Based on the resulted data, increasing the length of the carbon chain at introduced substitutions in N-carmofur almost decreases the complexation stability while in C-carmofur the trend is reversed. Throughout these information outputs, it was suggested that compounds d, e, i', and k might be novel and more efficacious drug candidates instead of carmofur.

The amount of time spent varies from day to day, yet little is known about the temporal nature of daily activity patterns in adults. The aim of this review is to identify the annual rhythms of daily activity behaviours in healthy adults and explore what temporal factors appear to influence these rhythms. METHODS Six online databases were searched for cohort studies exploring within-year temporal patterns (e.g. season effects, vacation, cultural festivals) in sleep, sedentary behaviour or physical activity in healthy 18 to 65-year-old adults. Screening, data extraction, and risk of bias scoring were performed in duplicate. Extracted data was presented as mean daily minutes of each activity type, with transformations performed as needed. Where possible, meta-analyses were performed using random effect models to calculate standardised mean differences (SMD). RESULTS Of the 7009 articles identified, 17 studies were included. Studies were published between 2003 and 2019, representing 14 countries and 1951 participants, addressing variation in daily activities across season (n = 11), Ramadan (n = 4), vacation (n = 1) and daylight savings time transitions (n = 1). Meta-analyses suggested evidence of seasonal variation in activity patterns, with sleep highest in autumn (+ 12 min); sedentary behaviour highest in winter (+ 19 min); light physical activity highest in summer (+ 19 min); and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity highest in summer (+ 2 min) when compared to the yearly mean. These trends were significant for light physical activity in winter (SMD = - 0.03, 95% CI - 0.58 to - 0.01, P = 0.04). Sleep appeared 64 min less during, compared to outside Ramadan (non-significant). Narrative analyses for the impact of vacation and daylight savings suggested that light physical activity is higher during vacation and that sleep increases after the spring daylight savings transition, and decreases after the autumn transition. CONCLUSIONS Research into temporal patterns in activity behaviours is scarce. Existing evidence suggests that seasonal changes and periodic changes to usual routine, such as observing religious events, may influence activity behaviours across the year. Further research measuring 24-h time use and exploring a wider variety of temporal factors is needed.","output":"Annual, seasonal, cultural and vacation patterns in sleep, sedentary behaviour and physical activity: a systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gut microbiota takes part in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

In this study, we assessed the administration of Bacillus subtilis in remission and its possible mechanism in mice with IBD. Oral administration of B. subtilis was implemented for 6 weeks (dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-P6w group), 2 weeks (DSS-P2w group) or 0 weeks (DSS-control(CT) group) in the remission phase in rodents with (DSS)-induced IBD. The body weight, colon length and disease activity index (DAI) were recorded, and colon H&E staining was performed. The expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1 and occludin) mRNA and epithelium proliferation-related Ki67 was detected. Gut microbiota were tested by 16S rRNA sequencing. Administration of B. subtilis in remission effectively increased the body weight and colon length and decreased DAI in the DSS-P6w group compared with the DSS-CT group, but there is no significant difference between the DSS-P2w and DSS-CT groups. The epithelial integrity was improved, and the expression of ZO-1 and occludin increased due to administration of B. subtilis in remission, which was more evident in the DSS-P6w group.

Incubation of Comirnaty with pig serum in vitro showed significant elevations of C3a anaphylatoxin and sC5b-9, the C-terminal complex. These data raise the possibility that C activation plays a causal or contributing role in the rare HSRs to Comirnaty and other vaccines with similar side effects. Further studies are needed to uncover the factors controlling these vaccine reactions in pigs and to understand their translational value to humans.","output":"A naturally hypersensitive porcine model may help understand the mechanism of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine-induced rare (pseudo) allergic reactions: complement activation as a possible contributing factor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Waterpipe tobacco smoking is becoming increasingly popular in the West among young people. Given the associated health risks of this behaviour, we aimed to investigate why young adults take up waterpipe tobacco smoking and their attitudes to the associated risks. Methods: This was a qualitative study, with a phenomenological perspective. Focus groups and face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted among waterpipe smokers aged 20C30 years living in London, UK. Transcripts were analysed using constant comparison and cycling between the data and analysis. Data collection continued until thematic saturation was achieved. Results: Sixteen smokers attended focus groups and face-to-face interviews. Seven main themes emerged encompassing four main dimensions relating to: lack of knowledge, perceived risk, affordability, and social addiction. Waterpipe was perceived to be safer than cigarette smoking due to the pleasant odour, fruity flavours, and belief that water filtered the toxins. The waterpipe had become a social addiction enhancing group atmosphere, was cheap and did not have the dangers of violence or hallucinations associated with other addictions like alcohol and drugs. Because of their intermittent smoking patterns and the lack of statutory warnings, none felt they were not at risk of any adverse side effects. Conclusions: Waterpipe smoking is a growing public health problem; the social environment associated with its use is perceived to be a positive outlet by smokers who do not consider it harmful to their health. These perceptions need to be addressed urgently by anti-smoking policies.","output":"Perceptions of Waterpipe Smoking among Young Adults: A Phenomenological Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: At an academic digital library of a graduate business school in Berlin, Germany, the librarian reflects on the new normal following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with its increased faculty and student engagement with digital resources and heightened awareness of and activity in diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives Design/methodology/approach: This paper details the concepts and practices of an academic library that is a center for information resources and services, as well as a contact point for DEI advocacy and student conflict mediation The librarian is the only information professional at the school, and this is a reflective essay written from her perspective Findings: This case study suggests that a librarian cross-trained as a conflict mediator or coach can offer both information literacy and support services to further the development of an inclusive campus environment Educators in both roles build students competence and confidence, focus on their achievements and progress and contribute to their sense of belonging Combining these activities in a central institution builds on the strengths of both disciplines and is consistent with inclusion as a core principle of librarianship Originality/value: The findings will be useful for librarians wishing to expand their existing mandate to provide inclusive information access and services to include DEI initiatives ? 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited","output":"An academic digital library advancing an equitable and inclusive educational environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Older adults experience increased risk for suicide compared to the general population, and the circumstances surrounding the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) may potentiate this risk.

growing number of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections forced ongoing monitoring of the epidemic situation, which entailed an introduction of a number of restrictions and solutions intended to isolate the infected persons on the one hand, and to minimize the risk of development of an epidemic in Poland on the other. Activity of the Polish legislator is also essential, which tried to introduce solutions that would correspond with current expectations and needs. Given the multiplicity of the introduced regulations, interpretation of provisions of statutes has not always been easy. In this paper, the author points to the issues of communication with a public authority by specific reflections on the principles of serving documents on beneficiaries of EU programs under which they were awarded funding for their implementation on the basis of EU regulations addressing the use of the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund for programs implemented as part of the cohesion policy (Regulations of the European Parliament and of the Council (EU) of 17 December 2013: no. 1303/2013, no. 1301/2013, no. 1304/2013, no 1300/2013, and no. 1299/2013). The author focuses on the issues of communication with an authority in a situation where administrative proceedings are initiated against a beneficiary of EU funds, e.g., for returning the granted funding. The author points to the dynamics of the legislator's work in this respect by analyzing the rules for serving documents by a public authority on beneficiaries who are public entities and those who are not. The author's main research aim is to analyze existing provisions establishing the possibility of electronic communication with a public authority, and also to assess them critically due to the extraordinary situation caused by Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). This is intended to verify the main research hypothesis focusing on the attempt to answer a question whether existing regulations, and those created at the time of the epidemic threat and the state of epidemic in Poland facilitate citizens' electronic communication with a public authority. The author aims to answer a question about whether the Polish legislator responds appropriately to the numerous emerging challenges associated with the pandemic and whether it created regulations that effectively ensure the possibility of continuity of contact with a public authority for citizens who are the beneficiaries of public funds. This analysis may contribute to the understanding of whether and how it is possible to improve citizens' contact with public authorities, which in the future may eliminate barriers and obstacles arising in this regard. The author bases her reflections on the experience resulting from providing legal services for one of the Polish Managing Authorities of the Regional Operational Programme using at the same time a number of research methods (i.e., the method of interpretation of applicable laws to establish applicable provisions of the law that regulate admissibility of electronic communication with a public authority and to establish efficiency of such communication, the analytical method, applied in reference to the relevant state of the art in the achievements of legal scholarship, and the empirical method, based on observation and analysis of practical issues resulting from the author's cooperation with a Polish managing authority). In her conclusions, the author points to the lack of introduction of comprehensive regulations (also at the EU level-for all EU Member States) in terms of de-formalizing the principles of communication in the course of pending administrative proceedings. The author notices an absence of unambiguous regulations that allow for a scanned document signed by hand and sent my email to be qualified into the category of documents served by electronic means, through use of means of electronic communication. The author assesses this absence negatively due to the fact that such action seems the simplest in a situation caused by COVID-19.","output":"Electronic Communication with Public Administration in the Time of COVID-19-Poland's Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The V protein of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) has been shown to inhibit the secretion of interferon (IFN) during infection, which is responsible for the promotion of NDV pathogenicity.

Using rNDVs as a model, we examined the efficiency of infection, IFN responses, and apoptosis of host cells during infection. We found that viral propagation occurred smoothly when V protein from lentogenic NDV is inserted instead of the V protein from the velogenic strain. The infection of lentogenic V protein-inserted rNDV induced less expression of IFNs and downstream antiviral proteins via efficient degradation of p-STAT1 and MDA5. Moreover, velogenic V protein triggered a higher apoptosis rate during infection thereby restricting the replication of NDV. Conversely, lentogenic V protein inhibits IFN responses efficiently and induces less apoptosis compared to the velogenic strain. Our findings provide a novel understanding of the role of V protein in NDV pathogenicity.","output":"Lentogenic NDV V protein inhibits IFN responses and represses cell apoptosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUNDNatural SARS-CoV-2 infection elicits strong protection against reinfection with the Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), and Delta (B.1.617.2) variants. However, the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant harbors multiple mutations that can mediate immune evasion. We estimated effectiveness of prior infection in preventing reinfection (PES) with Omicron and other SARS-CoV-2 variants in Qatar. METHODSPES was estimated using the test-negative, case-control study design, employing a methodology that was recently investigated and validated for derivation of robust estimates for PES. Cases (PCR-positive persons with a variant infection) and controls (PCR-negative persons) were exact-matched by sex, 10-year age group, nationality, and calendar time of PCR test, to control for known differences in the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection in Qatar. RESULTSPES against symptomatic reinfection was estimated at 90.2% (95% CI: 60.2-97.6) for Alpha, 84.8% (95% CI: 74.5-91.0) for Beta, 92.0% (95% CI: 87.9-94.7) for Delta, and 56.0% (95% CI: 50.6-60.9) for Omicron. Only 1 Alpha, 2 Beta, 0 Delta, and 2 Omicron reinfections progressed to severe COVID-19. None progressed to critical or fatal COVID-19.

Advisories across the world have appealed to people to stay at home and observe social distancing to slow down the pandemic. However it is important to realize as to how this is affecting acute cardiovascular care. Recent studies from Europe and USA have reported > 50% reduction in hospital admissions for ACS and declining rates of coronary interventions. The possible reasons for this noticeable reduction in patients with ACS/STEMI during the COVID-19 pandemic are multi-factorial. On one hand, it is due to change in thresholds for referring patients of ACS/STEMI for cardiac catheterization, with fibrinolysis being acceptable for many stable STEMI patients and conservative management being preferred for NSTEMI patients. Theories abound on how \\"staying at home\\" strategy may have led to an reduction in acute coronary events due to healthier lifestyle, better compliance and reduced stress. Realistically however, a more disquieting reason would be a \\"pseudo-reduction\\" ie. the incidence of ACS/STEMI is actually the same, but these patients are staying away from hospitals due to fear of contracting the infection. Lockdown restrictions have also limited transport options for patients seeking to reach hospitals in time. Healthcare systems need to be prepared for an anticipated downstream deluge of such untreated patients who may present with sequelae like heart failure, reinfarction, arrhythmias, mechanical complications etc. Scientific societies should have proactive campaigns to alleviate patient concerns, and encourage them to seek timely medical attention despite the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Will the hidden specter of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) emerge from the avalanche of COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Intraocular pressure (IOP) increases due to pneumoperitoneum and the Trendelenburg position during laparo-scopic surgery. Apart from ketamine and suxamethonium, anesthetic agents generally reduce IOP by various extents. The present study investigated the effects of combinations of four anesthetic agents on IOP during laparoscopic gynecological surgery. METHODS Patients (n=100) were assigned to one of the four groups: Group 1 (n=25; pentothal induction + desflurane/remifen-tanil maintenance), Group 2 (n=25; propofol induction + sevoflurane/remifentanil maintenance), Group 3 (n=25; propofol induction + desflurane/remifentanil maintenance), and Group 4 (n=25; pentothal induction + sevoflurane/remifentanil maintenance). The IOPs recorded before anesthesia induction, after intubation, after carbon dioxide insufflation, in the Trendelenburg position, and after ex-tubation were compared among the groups. Hemodynamic parameters were also evaluated. RESULTS Induction in Group 2 and Group 3 used propofol. When the IOP in the Trendelenburg position was compared with the IOP before induction, there was no statistically significant difference in Groups 2 and 3 (p>0.05). In Groups 1 and 4, pentothal was used for induction. The IOP in Groups 1 and 4 was statistically significantly higher in the Trendelenburg position than it was before induction (0.027-0.001).

DESIGN: We developed decision analytical models to estimate the consequences of delayed elective surgical procedures (eg, total hip replacement, bariatric surgery or septoplasty). SETTING: The framework was applied to a large hospital in the Netherlands. OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality measures impacts on quality of life and costs were taken into account and combined to calculate net monetary losses per week delay, which quantifies the total loss for society expressed in monetary terms. Net monetary losses were weighted by operating times. RESULTS: We studied 13 common elective procedures from four specialties. Highest loss in quality of life due to delayed surgery was found for total hip replacement (utility loss of 0.27, ie, 99 days lost in perfect health); the lowest for arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (utility loss of 0.05, ie, 18 days lost in perfect health). Costs of surgical delay per patient were highest for bariatric surgery (31/pp per week) and lowest for arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (?2/pp per week). Weighted by operating room (OR) time bariatric surgery provides most value (1.19/pp per OR minute) and arthroscopic partial meniscectomy provides the least value (0.34/pp per OR minute). In a large hospital the net monetary loss due to prolonged waiting times was 700 840 after the first COVID-19 wave, an increase of 506% compared with the year before. CONCLUSIONS: This surgical prioritisation framework can be tailored to specific centres and countries to support priority setting for delayed elective operations during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, both in and between surgical disciplines.

We tested this model using the data collected from 392 hospitality sector employees in Pakistan. The results reveal that cut in salaries and work from home positively moderate CSRs impact on employees identification and commitment. On the other hand, employee layoff and leave without pay do not impact the positive relationship between CSR and employees attitudes. Furthermore, the study finds that CSR during this pandemic has a significant positive impact on employees attitudes. However, this relationship becomes insignificant for employees who reported unfavorable HR practices in their organizations. The finding further reveals that CSRs impact during COVID-19 on employees attitudes is moderated by the different levels of CSR importance in employees minds. This evidence is significant since HR practices implemented during this crisis need to be identified and framed to understand the effects of CSR on employee commitment and identification.

Here, we present the final analysis outcomes. METHODS A prospective, multicenter, non-interventional study involving patients who received tolvaptan for the treatment of liver cirrhosis with hepatic edema with an insufficient response to conventional diuretics. The observation period was up to 6 months. Effectiveness evaluation included changes in body weight and clinical symptoms. Safety analysis included evaluation of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). RESULTS Case reports of 1111 patients were collected. Of these, 1109 were included in the safety analysis and 1098 in the effectiveness analysis. The mean age was 69.4  11.5 years and 695 (62.7%) patients were male. After tolvaptan treatment, a decrease in body weight from baseline was - 2.6  2.7 kg on day 7 and - 3.8  4.1 kg on day 14. Moreover, clinical symptoms significantly improved over the 14-day treatment. Frequently reported ADRs were thirst (6.6%), hepatic encephalopathy (2.3%), dehydration (1.5%), and hypernatremia (1.2%). A serum sodium level of  150 mEq/L was reported in five patients (0.5%). Multivariate analyses showed that the baseline blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level (cut-off value: 22.4 mg/dL) was the predictive factor for tolvaptan treatment response.

Interferon-beta 1a (IFN- 1a) has been used to treat patients with COVID-19. We aimed to compare the effectiveness of high-dose IFN- 1a compared to low dose IFN- 1a in severe COVID-19 cases. METHODS: In this randomized, controlled, and clinical trial, eligible patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections were randomly assigned to receive one of the two following therapeutic regimens: The intervention group was treated with high-dose IFN- 1a (Recigen) (Subcutaneous injections of 88 g (24 million IU) on days 1, 3, 6) + lopinavir /ritonavir (Kaletra) (400 mg/100 mg twice a day for 10 days, orally) and the control group was treated with low-dose IFN- 1a (Recigen) (Subcutaneous injections of 44 g (12 million IU) on days 1, 3, 6) + lopinavir /ritonavir (Kaletra) (400 mg/100 mg twice a day for 10 days, orally). RESULT: A total of 168 COVID- 19 confirmed patients underwent randomization; 83 were assigned to the intervention group and 85 were assigned to the control group. Median Time To Clinical Improvement (TTIC) for cases treated with low-dose IFN-1a was shorter than that for cases treated with high-dose IFN-1a (6 vs 10 days; P = 0.018).

A 2019 Cochrane Review summarised the diagnostic accuracy of LF\\\\LAM for tuberculosis in people living with HIV. This systematic review assesses the impact of the use of LF\\\\LAM (AlereLAM) on mortality and other patient\\\\important outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of the use of LF\\\\LAM (AlereLAM) on mortality in adults living with HIV in inpatient and outpatient settings. To assess the impact of the use of LF\\\\LAM (AlereLAM) on other patient\\\\important outcomes in adults living with HIV, including time to diagnosis of tuberculosis, and time to initiation of tuberculosis treatment. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE (PubMed); Embase (Ovid); Science Citation Index Expanded (Web of Science), BIOSIS Previews, Scopus, LILACS; ProQuest Dissertations and Theses; ClinicalTrials.gov; and the WHO ICTRP up to 12 March 2021. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials that compared a diagnostic intervention including LF\\\\LAM with diagnostic strategies that used smear microscopy, mycobacterial culture, a nucleic acid amplification test such as Xpert MTB/RIF, or a combination of these tests. We included adults ( 15 years) living with HIV. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility, extracted data, and analysed risk of bias using the Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias in randomized studies. We contacted study authors for clarification as needed. We used risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used a fixed\\\\effect model except in the presence of clinical or statistical heterogeneity, in which case we used a random\\\\effects model. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: We included three trials, two in inpatient settings and one in outpatient settings. All trials were conducted in sub\\\\Saharan Africa and assessed the impact of diagnostic strategies that included LF\\\\LAM on mortality when the test was used in conjunction with other tuberculosis diagnostic tests or clinical assessment for clinical decision\\\\making in adults living with HIV. Inpatient settings In inpatient settings, the use of LF\\\\LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy likely reduces mortality in people living with HIV at eight weeks compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF\\\\LAM (pooled RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.94; 5102 participants, 2 trials; moderate\\\\certainty evidence). That is, people living with HIV who received LF\\\\LAM had 15% lower risk of mortality. The absolute effect was 34 fewer deaths per 1000 (from 14 fewer to 55 fewer). In inpatient settings, the use of LF\\\\LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy probably results in a slight increase in the proportion of people living with HIV who were started on tuberculosis treatment compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF\\\\LAM (pooled RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.69; 5102 participants, 2 trials; moderate\\\\certainty evidence). Outpatient settings In outpatient settings, the use of LF\\\\LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy may reduce mortality in people living with HIV at six months compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF\\\\LAM (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.11; 2972 participants, 1 trial; low\\\\certainty evidence). Although this trial did not detect a difference in mortality, the direction of effect was towards a mortality reduction, and the effect size was similar to that in inpatient settings. In outpatient settings, the use of LF\\\\LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy may result in a large increase in the proportion of people living with HIV who were started on tuberculosis treatment compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF\\\\LAM (RR 5.44, 95% CI 4.70 to 6.29, 3022 participants, 1 trial; low\\\\certainty evidence). Other patient\\\\important outcomes Assessment of other patient\\\\important and implementation outcomes in the trials varied. The included trials demonstrated that a higher proportion of people living with HIV were able to produce urine compared to sputum for tuberculosis diagnostic testing; a higher proportion of people living with HIV were diagnosed with tuberculosis in the group that received LF\\\\LAM; and the incremental diagnostic yield was higher for LF\\\\LAM than for urine or sputum Xpert MTB/RIF. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In inpatient settings, the use of LF\\\\LAM as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic testing strategy likely reduces mortality and probably results in a slight increase in tuberculosis treatment initiation in people living with HIV. The reduction in mortality may be due to earlier diagnosis, which facilitates prompt treatment initiation. In outpatient settings, the use of LF\\\\LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy may reduce mortality and may result in a large increase in tuberculosis treatment initiation in people living with HIV. Our results support the implementation of LF\\\\LAM to be used in conjunction with other WHO\\\\recommended tuberculosis diagnostic tests to assist in the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis in people living with HIV.","output":"Impact of diagnostic strategies for tuberculosis using lateral flow urine lipoarabinomannan assay in people living with HIV"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is highly infectious in clinical settings, SARS has not been well examined in household settings.

Heterogeneity in transmission risk is a known phenomenon in infectious diseases and was also seen in SARS and MERS outbreaks since 2003. The pandemic has led countries to control the pandemic spread using unprecedented severe mitigation strategies that include quarantine and lock-down. This has has been highly successful in terms of halting the spread, but had enormous socioeconomic cost. We set out to theoretically explore whether a model that includes the phenomenon of superspreaders may guide us towards a cost-effective mitigation strategy. Methods: We developed an agent-based model that includes persons that spread the disease far more readily than other persons. This allow us to investigate effect of containment strategies in both a random SEIR like scenario, and in a transmission model that work with structured society. Our model considered even contact patterns in three settings: home, work and a category of \\"other\\" settings representing diffuse social contacts. We introduced superspreaders either as a fixed proportion of the population, or as a broad spectrum of infectivity. For each choice, the model was then calibrated to an overall realistic daily growth rate of 23 percentage. As sensitivity analyses we varied the fraction of superspreaders as well the distribution of their infectivity. To compare the simulation findings for each mitigation scenario we considered the maximum daily ICU utility. Results: As expected, without mitigation imposed, the inclusion of superspreaders does not meaningfully change the epidemic trajectory. However when introducing mitigation strategies imposed on each of the three settings, we find that the presence of superspreaders made a substantial difference. The simulations demonstrate that the best strategy is to focus on limiting contacts in the other category. This in particular suggests that limiting diffuse social contacts in settings such as bars, transportation, restaurants, parties, concerts and lecture halls is far more effective than limiting the same amount of contact events in the home and work setting. Conclusions: To appreciate effect of heterogeneity in various social spheres we need to rethink disease transmission models. Doing so, we found that wide distribution of infectivity favours strategies that reduces the max, while leaving the typical behaviour undisturbed. We found that most workplaces may be opened without much influence on the epidemic, while one could snuff out transmission with an effective avoidance of other contacts. Interestingly, including a consideration of superspreaders can help explain the dramatic success of even moderate lock-down strategies as that practiced in Denmark and Sweden. And it points to the need to avoid mass gatherings until either flock immunity has been achieved or an effective vaccine is available.","output":"Impact of Superspreaders on dissemination and mitigation of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to assess anakinra's safety and efficacy for treating severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

The goal of these models is to account for rate variation among lineages, such that they are assumed to be adequate descriptions of the processes that generated the data. A common approach for selecting a clock model for a data set of interest is to examine a set of candidates and to select the model that provides the best statistical fit. However, this can lead to unreliable estimates if all the candidate models are actually inadequate. For this reason, a method of evaluating absolute model performance is critical. We describe a method that uses posterior predictive simulations to assess the adequacy of clock models. We test the power of this approach using simulated data and find that the method is sensitive to bias in the estimates of branch lengths, which tends to occur when using underparameterized clock models. We also compare the performance of the multinomial test statistic, originally developed to assess the adequacy of substitution models, but find that it has low power in identifying the adequacy of clock models. We illustrate the performance of our method using empirical data sets from coronaviruses, simian immunodeficiency virus, killer whales, and marine turtles.

We used TEM to perform kinetic analysis of the ultrastructure of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Early infection events were characterized by the presence of clusters of single-membrane vesicles and stacks of membrane containing nuclear pores called annulate lamellae (AL). A large network of host cell-derived organelles transformed into virus factories was subsequently observed in the cells. As previously described for other RNA viruses, these replication factories consisted of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) located close to the nucleus.

This disease is often contracted through inhalation of fungal propagules. The Central Nervous System (CNS) may be infected through local extension (nasal and frontal sinuses) or via hematogenous route. Similarly to CNS bacterial infection, the clinical signs of neurological dysfunction may be attributed to mass effect (gelatinous mass of fungal microorganisms and fungal granuloma formation) or to a more disseminated inflammatory response to invading microorganisms. The objective of this study is to report one case of a patient with cryptococcal granulomas in the central nervous system and one case of a patient with neurological signs associated to a cryptococcosis. Cases: Case 1. A 3-year-old male mixed breed feline was admitted to a veterinary clinic, located in Porto Alegre, RS, Southern Brazil. The patient presented unsourced behavioral changes, vestibular ataxia and dysphagia caused by inability of coordination. The following tests were performed: complete blood count test, biochemical analysis, computed tomography scan (CT scan), fluid analysis, radiography and toxoplasmosis test. The following medicine were administrated for treatment: fluconazole, dexamethasone, mannitol, phenobarbital and levetiracetam. Fluid therapy was also part of the treatment. Immediately after death, the cat was submitted for necropsy, and a fungal granulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis was diagnosed.

The increase in the prevalence of childhood obesity seems to play an important role in this phenomenon. DESIGN: we undertook a retrospective, longitudinal evaluation of the average age of thelarche and menarche to evaluate the relationship between BMI and weight change during the first years of life and the timing and tempo of puberty. METHODS: we evaluated data for 577 Italian girls born between 1995 and 2003. We collected the main auxological and clinical parameters, including age at B2 and at menarche, BMI SDS at B2 and menarche, gestational age and birth weight and Z-score change from birth weight (BW) to BMI at B2 and menarche. RESULTS: the mean age of B2 was 10.06  1.03 years and the mean age of menarche was 12.08  1.02 years. Age at B2 and menarche were inversely correlated with BMI SDS (p < 0.0001). Both age at menarche and at thelarche have an inverse relationship with the Z-score change from birth weight and BMI at menarche and thelarche respectively (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: our data confirm a significant relationship between BMI and age of B2 and menarche.

Frequency, determinants, and outcomes of tPA use were compared among patients aged 90 and 3 younger age groups (18-64, 65-79, and 80-89 years). RESULTS Among 35 708 patients from 1178 sites who arrived within 2 hours of time last known well and received tPA, 2585 (7.2%) were 90 years. Compared with younger patients, the rate of tPA use among patients without a documented contraindication was lower among patients aged 90 years (67.4% versus 84.1% in 18-89-year olds; P<0.0001). Discharge outcomes among individuals aged 90 years included discharge to home or acute rehabilitation in 31.4%, independent ambulation at discharge in 13.4%, symptomatic hemorrhage in 6.1%, and in-hospital mortality or hospice discharge in 36.4%. On multivariable analysis, good functional outcomes generally occurred less often and mortality more often among patients aged 90 years. The risk of symptomatic hemorrhage was increased compared with patients <65 years but was not significantly different than the risk in 66- to 89-year olds.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary analysis was an evaluation of cardiovascular conditions and diabetes in relation to ethnicity and social deprivation, with the end-point of inpatient death or death within 30 days of discharge. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to calculate HRs while adjusting for confounders. RESULTS: 361/907 (39.8%) died in hospital or within 30 days of discharge. The presence of diabetes and hypertension together appears to confer the greatest mortality risk (OR 2.75; 95% CI 1.80 to 4.21; p<0.001) compared with either condition alone. Age >65 years (OR 3.32; 95% CI 2.15 to 5.11), male sex (OR 2.04; 95% CI 1.47 to 2.82), hypertension (OR 1.69; 95% CI 1.10 to 2.61) and cerebrovascular disease (OR 1.87; 95% CI 1.31 to 2.68) were independently associated with increased risk of death. The mortality risk did not differ between the quintiles of deprivation. High-sensitivity troponin I was the best predictor of mortality among biomarkers (OR 4.43; 95% CI 3.10 to 7.10).

The article deals with the study of bioactivity of two plant extracts as Rhaponticum uniflorum (L.) DC. and Serratula centauroides L. with a high content of ecdysteroids and phenolic compounds. The models of acute and chronic emotional stress in white rats were used to estimate the stress-protective activity of R. uniflorum and S. centauroides extracts. Both extracts showed the stress-protective effect via inhibiting the development of signs induced by single and long-term effects of stress factors. In acute stress, the development of Selye's triad signs was less pronounced against the background of the plant remedies introduction. In chronic stress, the extracts prevented the development of anxiety-depressive syndrome. Besides, R. uniflorum and S. centauroides extracts banned the development of stress-induced injuries in the brain cortex and had a neuroprotective effect on ischemia against chronic stress. The stress-protective effects of both plant extracts were based on a decrease of hyperactivation of the central stress-promoting systems (sympathoadrenal, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal) due to their GABA-mimetic effects.

As a necessity, there is a need to track users who came in contact with users having travel history, asymptomatic and not yet symptomatic, but they can be in the future. To solve this problem, the present work proposes a solution for contact tracing based on assisted GPS and cloud computing technologies. An application is developed to collect each user's assisted GPS coordinates once all the users install this application. This application periodically sends assisted GPS data to the cloud. To determine which devices are within the permissible limit of 5m, we perform clustering over assisted GPS coordinates and track the clusters for about t mins to allow the measure of spread. We assume that it takes around 3 or 5 mins to get the virus from an infected object. For clustering, the proposed M way like tree data structure stores the assisted GPS coordinates in degree, minute, and second format. Thus, every user is mapped to a leaf node of the tree. We split the \\"seconds\\" part of the assisted GPS location into m equal parts, which amount to d meter in latitude(longitude). Hence, two users who are within d meter range will map to the same leaf node. Thus, by mapping assisted GPS locations every t mins, we can find out how many users came in contact with a particular user for at least t mins. Our work's salient feature is that it runs in linear time O(n) for n users in the static case, i.e., when users are not moving. We also propose a variant of our solution to handle the dynamic case, that is, when users are moving.

The analysis was carried out using an in-line intensity- and wavelength-calibrated Raman spectroscopy system. This allows for continuous monitoring of the composition of the circulating gas during the self-equilibration or catalytic evolution phases. During all procedures, effects, such as exchange reactions with wall materials, were considered with care. Together with measurement statistics, these and other systematic effects were included in the determination of composition uncertainties of the generated reference gas samples. Measurement and calibration accuracy at the level of 1% was achieved.","output":"Accurate Reference Gas Mixtures Containing Tritiated Molecules: Their Production and Raman-Based Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected more than 42.5 million people globally resulting in the death of over 1.15 million subjects. It has inflicted severe public health and economic hardships across the world. In addition to acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, sepsis, and acute kidney injury, COVID-19 also causes heart failure (HF). COVID-19-induced HF is manifested via different mechanisms, including, but not limited to, (1) virus-induced infiltration of inflammatory cells, which could impair the function of the heart; (2) pro-inflammatory cytokines (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin-1?; interleukin-6; tumor necrosis factor-&#945;) that could cause necrosis and death of the myocardium; (3) endothelial injury coupled with micro-thrombosis which could damage the endocardium; and (4) acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure that could lead to heart failure due to severe hypoxia. It is concluded that the etiology of COVID-19-induced HF is multifactorial and mitigation of the development of HF in patients with COVID-19 will require different approaches such as social distancing, drug therapy, and the urgent development of a vaccine to eradicate the disease.","output":"Mechanisms of COVID-19-induced heart failure: a short review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To evaluate age-dependent productivity loss caused by menstruation-related symptoms, measured in absenteeism (time away from work or school) and presenteeism (productivity loss while present at work or school). METHODS Design/setting: internet-based, cross-sectional survey conducted in the Netherlands from July to October 2017. PARTICIPANTS 32 748 women aged 15-45 years, recruited through social media. OUTCOME MEASURES self-reported lost productivity in days, divided into absenteeism and presenteeism; impact of menstrual symptoms; reasons women give when calling in sick; and women's preferences regarding the implications of menstruation-related symptoms for schools and workplaces. RESULTS A total of 13.8% (n=4514) of all women reported absenteeism during their menstrual periods with 3.4% (n=1108) reporting absenteeism every or almost every menstrual cycle. The mean absenteeism related to a woman's period was 1.3 days per year. A total of 80.7% (n=26 438) of the respondents reported presenteeism and decreased productivity a mean of 23.2 days per year. An average productivity loss of 33% resulted in a mean of 8.9 days of total lost productivity per year due to presenteeism. Women under 21 years were more likely to report absenteeism due to menstruation-related symptoms (OR 3.3, 95% CI 3.1 to 3.6). When women called in sick due to their periods, only 20.1% (n=908) told their employer or school that their absence was due to menstrual complaints. Notably, 67.7% (n=22 154) of the participants wished they had greater flexibility in their tasks and working hours at work or school during their periods. CONCLUSIONS Menstruation-related symptoms cause a great deal of lost productivity, and presenteeism is a bigger contributor to this than absenteeism. There is an urgent need for more focus on the impact of these symptoms, especially in women aged under 21 years, for discussions of treatment options with women of all ages and, ideally, more flexibility for women who work or go to school.","output":"Productivity loss due to menstruation-related symptoms: a nationwide cross-sectional survey among 32 748 women."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to COVID-19, universities across Canada were forced to undergo a transition from classroom-based face-to-face learning and invigilated assessments to online-based learning and non-invigilated assessments.

In most cases, SARS-CoV-2 infection results in the development of viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, known as \\"coronavirus disease 2019\\" or COVID-19. Intriguingly, besides the respiratory tract, COVID-19 affects other organs and systems of the human body. COVID-19 patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease have a higher risk of death, and SARS-CoV-2 infection itself may cause myocardial inflammation and injury. One possible explanation of such phenomena is the fact that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor required for viral entry. ACE2 is expressed in the cells of many organs, including the heart. ACE2 functions as a carboxypeptidase that can cleave several endogenous substrates, including angiotensin II, thus regulating blood pressure and vascular tone. It remains largely unknown if the SARS-CoV-2 infection alters the enzymatic properties of ACE2, thereby contributing to cardiovascular complications in patients with COVID-19. Here, we demonstrate that ACE2 cleavage of des-Arg9-bradykinin substrate analog is markedly accelerated, while cleavage of angiotensin II analog is minimally affected by the binding of spike protein. These findings may have implications for a better understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding selectively accelerates substrate-specific catalytic activity of ACE2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this case series is to describe our experience in diagnosis and management of oncological asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 who underwent (18)F-FDG PET/CT.

Replicating such structural features in artificial materials is of great significance yet remains a big challenge. Here, a facile strategy is reported to fabricate hydrogels with elaborate ordered structures of nanosheets (NSs) oriented under a distributed electric field. Multiple electrodes are distributed with various arrangements in the precursor solution containing NSs and gold nanoparticles. A complex electric field induces sophisticated orientations of the NSs that are permanently inscribed by subsequent photo-polymerization. The resultant anisotropic nanocomposite poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) hydrogels exhibit rapid deformation upon heating or photoirradiation, owing to the fast switching of permittivity of the media and electric repulsion between the NSs. The complex alignments of NSs and anisotropic shape change of discrete regions result in programmed deformation of the hydrogels into various configurations. Furthermore, locomotion is realized by a spatiotemporal light stimulation that locally triggers time-variant shape change of the composite hydrogel with complex anisotropic structures. Such a strategy on the basis of the distributed electric-field-generated ordered structures should be applicable to gels, elastomers, and thermosets loaded with other anisotropic particles or liquid crystals, for the design of biomimetic/bioinspired materials with specific functionalities.","output":"Distributed Electric Field Induces Orientations of Nanosheets to Prepare Hydrogels with Elaborate Ordered Structures and Programmed Deformations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we have considered a mathematical model that deals with the effectiveness of the measures that may be helpful for reducing the spread of the COVID-19 virus in the society.

The requirement for valid quality measurement to gauge improvements and monitor performance is echoed in the Australian prehospital care setting. The aim of this study was to use an evidence-informed expert consensus process to identify valid quality indicators (QIs) for Australian prehospital care provided by ambulance services. METHODS A modified RAND/UCLA appropriateness method was conducted with a panel of Australian prehospital care experts from February to May 2019. The proposed QIs stemmed from a scoping review and were systematically prepared within a clinical and non-clinical classification system, and a structure/process/outcome and access/safety/effectiveness taxonomy. Rapid reviews were performed for each QI to produce evidence summaries for consideration by the panellists. QIs were deemed valid if the median score by the panel was 7-9 without disagreement. RESULTS Of 117 QIs, the expert panel rated 84 (72%) as valid. This included 26 organisational/system QIs across 7 subdomains and 58 clinical QIs within 10 subdomains.Most QIs were process indicators (n=62; 74%) while QIs describing structural elements and desired outcomes were less common (n=13; 15% and n=9; 11%, respectively).

METHODS: Impacts of lifestyle changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic on 100 patients with PD and their caregivers/spouses were assessed. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to assess anxiety and depression. The physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores of the short form (SF)-8 were used to evaluate health-related QOL. RESULTS: Regarding health-related QOL, physical function, role physical, general health, vitality and the PCS score were significantly worse in PD patients than in caregivers. Worsening of PD-related symptoms, increased stress, and decreased physical activity were observed in 29.0%, 37.0% and 44.0% of PD patients, respectively.

These techniques began with transanal endoluminal surgical removal of rectal masses and have progressed to transanal radical proctectomy for rectal cancer. The first transanal total mesorectal excision (taTME) was performed in 2009 by Sylla, Rattner, Delgado, and Lacy. The improved visibility and working space associated with the taTME technique is intriguing. This video manuscript outlines the training pathway followed by pioneers in the taTME technique, the process of implementation into clinical practice, and initial case report. METHODS A double board-certified colorectal surgeon with expertise in rectal cancer, minimally invasive total mesorectal excision, transanal endoscopic surgery (TES), and intersphincteric dissection, underwent taTME training in male cadaver models. Institutional review board (IRB) approval for a phase I clinical trial was achieved. The entire operative team including surgeons, nurses, and operative staff underwent taTME cadaver training the day prior to the first clinical case. The case was proctored by an expert in taTME. RESULTS A 66-year-old male with uT3N1M0 rectal cancer located in the posterior distal rectum, underwent taTME with laparoscopic abdominal assistance, hand sewn coloanal anastomosis, and diverting loop ileostomy. The majority of the TME was performed transanally with laparoscopic assistance for exposure, splenic flexure mobilization, and high ligation of the vascular pedicles. Operative time was 359 min. There were no intraoperative complications. Pathology revealed a ypT2N1 moderately differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma, grade I TME, 1 cm circumferential radial margin, and 2/13 positive lymph nodes. CONCLUSION Implementation of taTME into practice can be achieved by surgeons with expertise in minimally invasive TME, TES, pre-clinical taTME training in cadavers, case observation, proctoring, and ongoing mentorship.

Randomized controlled trials investigating the efficacy of radiation therapy in patients with locally advanced unresectable PDA have reported mixed results, with effects ranging from modest benefit to worse outcomes compared with control therapies. We investigated whether radiation causes inflammatory cells to acquire an immune-suppressive phenotype that limits the therapeutic effects of radiation on invasive PDAs and accelerates progression of preinvasive foci. METHODS We investigated the effects of radiation therapy in p48(Cre);LSL-Kras(G12D) (KC) and p48(Cre);LSLKras(G12D);LSL-Trp53(R172H) (KPC) mice, as well as in C57BL/6 mice with orthotopic tumors grown from FC1242 cells derived from KPC mice. Some mice were given neutralizing antibodies against macrophage colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1 or MCSF) or F4/80. Pancreata were exposed to doses of radiation ranging from 2 to 12 Gy and analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS Pancreata of KC mice exposed to radiation had a higher frequency of advanced pancreatic intraepithelial lesions and more foci of invasive cancer than pancreata of unexposed mice (controls); radiation reduced survival time by more than 6 months. A greater proportion of macrophages from radiation treated invasive and preinvasive pancreatic tumors had an immune-suppressive, M2-like phenotype compared with control mice. Pancreata from mice exposed to radiation had fewer CD8(+) T cells than controls, and greater numbers of CD4(+) T cells of T-helper 2 and T-regulatory cell phenotypes. Adoptive transfer of T cells from irradiated PDA to tumors of control mice accelerated tumor growth. Radiation induced production of MCSF by PDA cells. A neutralizing antibody against MCSF prevented radiation from altering the phenotype of macrophages in tumors, increasing the anti-tumor T-cell response and slowing tumor growth. CONCLUSIONS Radiation treatment causes macrophages murine PDA to acquire an immune-suppressive phenotype and disabled T-cell-mediated anti-tumor responses. MCSF blockade negates this effect, allowing radiation to have increased efficacy in slowing tumor growth.","output":"Radiation Therapy Induces Macrophages to Suppress T-Cell Responses Against Pancreatic Tumors in Mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"By analyzing newly collected SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 genomes and comparing them with our previous study about SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) before June 2020, we found that the SNV clustering had changed remarkably since June 2020.

At post-test and follow-up, the workers in the experimental group reported higher mean scores in psychological flexibility and self-compassion and lower mean scores in depression compared to the workers in the waitlist control group. Although the experimental group also showed lower mean scores than the waitlist control group in anxiety and stress at both post-test and follow, the differences were not statistically significant. The findings suggest that a brief mindfulness-based intervention can improve psychological flexibility, self-compassion, and depression in social workers working during the COVID-19 crisis, leading to protected mental health, adding support to continuing development of such efficient mindfulness-based programs. Future studies should use larger samples and examine brief interventions working mechanisms.

In this context, conditions typical of low-resource settings surfaced also in high-resource ones (e.g., the lack of essential medical equipment, of resources etc.), while exacerbating in the already resource-scarce settings, because of COVID-19. This is the case of oxygen concentrators that are one of the first-line medical devices for treating COVID-19 patients. Since the beginning of 2020, their demand has been rapidly growing worldwide, aggravating the situation for low-resource settings, where the availability of devices providing oxygen-enriched air was already scarce. In fact, due to their delicacy, the lack of spare parts and of an appropriate health technology management system, oxygen concentrators can often be found broken or not working properly in these settings. The underlying problems have deep roots. The current regulatory frameworks and standards, which are set by high-income countries, are too stringent, and do not take into account the limited resources of poorer settings. Thus, they are often inapplicable in such settings. One of the main issues affecting the oxygen concentrators, is that related to the filters, which are designed to filter out dust, particles, bacteria, and to be used in medical locations complying with international standards (e.g., the air filtration level in a surgical theatre in Italy is at 99.97%). When used in low-resource settings, which do not comply with these standards and face several challenges (e.g., dust), these filters have a much-reduced lifespan. For these reasons, this paper aims to present the redesign of the inlet filter of an oxygen concentrator, which is used to prevent gross particles to enter the device. The redesign is based on a reverse engineering approach, and on the use of 3D-printing along with activated charcoal. After testing the filtration efficiency with a particle counter, the filter design has been refined through several iterations. The final prototype performs particularly well when filtering particles above 1 m (with a filtration efficiency of 64.2%), and still has a satisfactory performance with any particle size over 0.3 m (with a filtration efficiency of 38.8%). Following the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, this project aims to empower local communities, and start a positive trend of self-sustained supply chain of simple spare parts for medical devices, leveraging on frugal engineering, 3D-printing, locally produced activated charcoal, and circular economy.","output":"3D-printed activated charcoal inlet filters for oxygen concentrators: A circular economy approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the clinical syndrome of COVID19 resulted in a major decrease in transplant volumes during the first months of the pandemic followed by a change in practice, with strict screening and SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing prior to transplant.

The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the effect of PMIs compared to no PMI for children with ASD aged 2-17 years. The primary outcome was adaptive functioning rated by a parent or clinician. The secondary outcomes were long-term adaptive functioning rated by the parents, adverse events, core symptoms of ASD, disruptive behavior, parental well-being, quality of life of the child rated by the parents and anxiety. The MEDLINE, PsycInfo, Embase, and CINAHL databases were searched in March 2020. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool was used to rate the individual studies, and the certainty in the evidence was evaluated using GRADE. We identified 30 relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including 1,934 participants. A clinically relevant effect of PMIs on parent-rated adaptive functioning was found with a low certainty of evidence [Standard mean difference (SMD): 0.28 (95% CI: -0.01, 0.57)] on Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS), whereas no clinically relevant effect was seen for clinician-rated functional level, with a very low certainty of evidence [SMD on Clinical Global Impressions (CGI)-severity scale: SMD -0.45 [95% CI: -0.87, -0.03)]. PMIs may slightly improve clinician-rated autism core symptoms [SMD: -0.35 (95% CI: -0.71, 0.02)]. Additionally, no effect of PMIs on parent-rated core symptoms of ASD, parental well-being or adverse effects was identified, all with a low certainty of evidence. There was a moderate certainty of evidence for a clinically relevant effect on disruptive behavior [SMD: 0.55 (95% Cl: 0.36, 0.74)]. The certainty in the evidence was downgraded due to serious risk of bias, lack of blinding, and serious risk of imprecision due to few participants included in meta-analyses. The present findings suggest that clinicians may consider introducing PMIs to children with ASD, but more high-quality RCTs are needed because the effects are not well-established, and the results are likely to change with future studies.

Here, we compare the performance of a conventional lateral flow assay (LFA) with a surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-based LFA test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM/IgG in sera of COVID-19 patients. Sensitive detection of IgM might enable early serological diagnosis of acute infections. Rapid detection in serum using a custom-built SERS reader is at least an order of magnitude more sensitive than the conventional LFAs with naked-eye detection. For absolute quantification and the determination of the limit of detection (LOD), a set of reference measurements using purified (total) IgM in buffer was performed. In this purified system, the sensitivity of SERS detection is even 7 orders of magnitude higher: the LOD for SERS was ca. 100 fg/mL compared to ca. 1 g/mL for the naked-eye detection. This outlines the high potential of SERS-based LFAs in point-of-care testing once the interference of serum components with the gold conjugates and the nitrocellulose membrane is minimized.","output":"Rapid and Sensitive SERS-Based Lateral Flow Test for SARS-CoV2-Specific IgM/IgG Antibodies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The Coronavirus Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected many social organisations with the workplace being amongst those most affected. Organisation faced the challenge of continued productivity during a global health crisis. Employees have shown signs of fatigue caused by living with the persistent fear and anxiety of falling sick and this which can consequently resulted in a reduction in productivity and frequently reduced income. Measures that were introduced to keep people safe such as social distancing, lockdowns, new working styles together with necessary lifestyle changes such as social isolation have reinforced feelings of uncertainty and fear amongst the workforce. These factors have influenced the mental health of workers and will continue to do so as society reorganise and make the changes necessary to accommodate new systems. Purpose: The purpose of this literature review is to conceptualize the psychological aspects linked to workplace factors following the rise of COVID-19 to epidemic proportions and in order to address upcoming psychological critical issues in the workplaces. Method: This literature study proceeded a search engine using Google Scholar, PubMed, and Scopus, using keywords SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 pandemic, occupational health and safety, mental health, psychological disorders, COVID 19 and working people, workplace organization and selected 30 articles out of thirty 20 articles were analyzed corroding to researchers need. The literature information is further narrated and draws on insights of the researcher. Conclusion: The review study conceptualizes the pandemic spread of COVID-19 and reviews its effect in the workplace as companies reorganize and establish new patterns of operations in response the COVID-19 virus and to ensure precautionary measure against further spread of the disease. The adaptations necessary in the wake of this disease have novel reorganization in both structural and functional areas. The workforce at the workplace underwent loss of its psychological homeostasis. The mitigation which ensured has led to multiple organizational and work-related interventions intended to be instrumental in defending health-related safety in the workplaces. ?

Unfortunately, COVID-19 vaccines have some side effects. In phase studies of currently-approved COVID-19 vaccines, patients with a known allergy or a history of anaphylaxis were excluded from the studies. This situation creates doubts about the course of atopy and the presence of allergic disease related to the side effects of COVID-19 vaccines in patients with allergic diseases. Therefore, our aim with this study was to evaluate local side effects (LSE) and systemic side effects (SSE) after COVID-19 vaccines in patients with allergic diseases and to determine possible risk factors. Materials and MethodsSix hundred forty-eight adult patients who received any COVID-19 vaccine between April 1, 2021 and September 30, 2021 and agreed to participate in the study were included in this case-control retrospective study. ResultsSix hundred forty-eight adult patients [Female: 446 (68.8%), Male: 202 (32.2%)] participated in the study. After the 1st dose of COVID-19 vaccine, 24.1% of patients reported SSE. After the 2nd dose of COVID-19 vaccine, 67 patients (12.3%) developed SSE. Female gender (OR: 1.757, 95%Cl: 1.143-2.702, p: 0.010), history of previous COVID-19 infection (OR: 1.762, 95%Cl: 1.068-2.906, p: 0.026), and COVID-19 vaccine type administered (OR: 4.443, 95% CI: 2.640-7.476, p<0.001) were found to be independent risk factors for SSE after COVID-19 vaccines. Premedication (OR: 0.454, 95% Cl: 0.281-0.733, p<0.001), was found to be a protective factor for SSE developing after COVID-19 vaccines. ConclusionCoronoVac and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines are shown to be well tolerated. Patients with allergic disease do not have an increased risk for SSE that may develop after COVID-19 vaccines.

The hypothesis is that milder symptoms indicating altered thrombocyte function may affect a larger proportion of vaccinated individuals than the recently reported severe cases with thrombosis and thrombocytopenia. Design: Large, population-based cohort study. Setting: Norway, nationwide. Participants More than 80 000 cohort participants responding to electronic questionnaires about covid-19 vaccination and potential side effects during weeks 11-13, 2021. Response rate 58% (81267/138924), 83% were female, 85% health care workers and 80% were aged 40-55 years. Main outcome measures Self-reported episodes of skin, nose and gingival bleedings. Variation in rates by registered vaccine type, age, sex, occupation, previous covid-19 infection and chronic disease. Results: Four of the 3416 subjects (0.2%) who were vaccinated with a single dose of mRNA vaccine reported skin bleeding as a side effect, as opposed to 163 of 5132 subjects (3.2%) vaccinated with a single dose of the adenovirus-vectored vaccine, OR (odds ratio)=16.0 (95% confidence interval (CI) 7.5-34.1). Corresponding ORs for nose and gingival bleeding were 8.0 (4.0-15.8) and 9.3 (4.3-20.0), respectively. Conclusions: These findings could potentially indicate that the adenovirus-vectored vaccine may lead to mild bleeding episodes in a larger proportion of vaccinated individuals, and not only in rare cases with documented thrombosis and thrombocytopenia. Studies are needed to understand the possible mechanisms behind these observations, and to establish or refute whether they share similarities with the severe thromboembolic bleeding complications.","output":"Association between ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination and bleeding episodes: large population-based cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 pneumonia is globally concerning.

METHODS: Clinical and CT data of 59 patients with COVID-19 from January 27 to February 14, 2020 were retrospectively reviewed, including 14 laboratory-confirmed non-pregnant adults, 16 laboratory-confirmed and 25 clinically-diagnosed pregnant women, and 4 laboratory-confirmed children. The clinical and CT features were analyzed and compared. FINDINGS: Compared with the non-pregnant adults group (na?=a?14), initial normal body temperature (9 [56%] and 16 [64%]), leukocytosis (8 [50%] and 9 [36%]) and elevated neutrophil ratio (14 [88%] and 20 [80%]), and lymphopenia (9 [56%] and 16 [64%]) were more common in the laboratory-confirmed (na?=a?16) and clinically-diagnosed (na?=a?25) pregnant groups. Totally 614 lesions were detected with predominantly peripheral and bilateral distributions in 54 (98%) and 37 (67%) patients, respectively. Pure ground-glass opacity (GGO) was the predominant presence in 94/131 (72%) lesions for the non-pregnant adults. Mixed consolidation and complete consolidation were more common in the laboratory-confirmed (70/161 [43%]) and clinically-diagnosed (153/322 [48%]) pregnant groups than 37/131 (28%) in the non-pregnant adults (Pa?=a?0007, Pa?<a?0001). GGO with reticulation was less common in 9/161 (6%) and 16/322 (5%) lesions for the two pregnant groups than 24/131 (18%) for the non-pregnant adults (Pa?=a?0001, Pa?<a?0001). The pulmonary involvement in children with COVID-19 was mild with a focal GGO or consolidation. Twenty-three patients underwent follow-up CT, revealing progression in 9/13 (69%) at 3 days whereas improvement in 8/10 (80%) at 6-9 days after initial CT scans. INTERPRETATION: Atypical clinical findings of pregnant women with COVID-19 could increase the difficulty in initial identification. Consolidation was more common in the pregnant groups. The clinically-diagnosed cases were vulnerable to more pulmonary involvement. CT was the modality of choice for early detection, severity assessment, and timely therapeutic effects evaluation for the cases with epidemic and clinical features of COVID-19 with or without laboratory confirmation.

In the UK, ~50% of survivors will require additional rehabilitation. Despite this, there is currently no evidence-based guideline available in England and Wales that addresses the identification, timing and nature of effective interventions to manage the morbidity associated following COVID-19. It is now timely to accelerate the development and evaluation of a rehabilitation service to support patients and healthcare services. Nuffield Health have responded by configuring a scalable rehabilitation pathway addressing the immediate requirements for those recovering from COVID-19 in the community. Methods and Analysis: This long-term evaluation will examine the effectiveness of a 12-week community rehabilitation programme for COVID-19 patients who have been discharged following in-patient treatment. Consisting of two distinct 6-week phases; Phase 1 is an entirely remote service, delivered via digital applications. Phase 2 sees the same patients transition into a gym-based setting for supervised group-based rehabilitation. Trained rehabilitation specialists will coach patients across areas such as goal setting, exercise prescription, symptom management and emotional well-being. Outcomes will be collected at 0, 6, and 12 weeks and at 6- and 12-months. Primary outcome measures will assess changes in health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) and COVID-19 symptoms using EuroQol Five Dimension Five Level Version (EQ-5D-5L) and Dyspnea-12, respectively. Secondary outcome measures of the Duke Activity Status Questionnaire (DASI), 30 s sit to stand test, General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Patient Experience Questionnaire (PEQ) and Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY) will allow for the evaluation of outcomes, mediators and moderators of outcome, and cost-effectiveness of treatment. Discussion: This evaluation will investigate the immediate and long-term impact, as well as the cost effectiveness of a blended rehabilitation programme for COVID-19 survivors. This evaluation will provide a founding contribution to the literature, evaluating one of the first programmes of this type in the UK.

Multiple linear regression models indicated that most syndrome variations (up to 86%) can be explained by counts of respiratory pathogens. Absenteeism and pharmacy syndromes might reflect nonrespiratory conditions as well. We also observed systematic syndrome elevations in the fall, which were unexplained by pathogen counts but likely reflected rhinovirus activity.

Previously, we compared the peripheral blood transcriptomes of two macaque species (Macaca mulatta and Macaca fascicularis) in response to acute primary infection by Plasmodium knowlesi. Although these two species are very closely related, the infection in M. mulatta is fatal, unless aggressively treated, whereas M. fascicularis develops a chronic, but tolerable infection in the blood. As a reason for this stark difference, our analysis suggests delayed pathogen detection in M. mulatta followed by extended inflammation that eventually overwhelms this monkeys immune response. By contrast, the natural host M. fascicularis detects the pathogen earlier and controls the inflammation. Additionally, M. fascicularis limits cell proliferation pathways during the log phase of infection, presumably in an attempt to control inflammation. Subsequent cell proliferation suggests a cell-mediated adaptive immune response. Here, we focus on molecular mechanisms underlying the key differences in the host and parasite responses and their coordination. SICAvar Type 1 surface antigens are highly correlated with pattern recognition receptor signaling and important inflammatory genes for both hosts. Analysis of pathogen detection pathways reveals a similar signaling mechanism, but with important differences in the glutamate G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathway. Furthermore, differences in inflammasome assembly processes suggests an important role of S100 proteins in balancing inflammation and cell proliferation. Both differences point to the importance of Ca(2+) homeostasis in inflammation. Additionally, the kynurenine-to-tryptophan ratio, a known inflammatory biomarker, emphasizes higher inflammation in M. mulatta during log phase. Transcriptomics-aided metabolic modeling provides a functional method for evaluating these changes and understanding downstream changes in NAD metabolism and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling, with enhanced NAD metabolism in M. fascicularis and stronger AhR signaling in M. mulatta. AhR signaling controls important immune genes like IL6, IFN and IDO1. However, direct changes due to AhR signaling could not be established due to complicated regulatory feedback mechanisms associated with the AhR repressor (AhRR). A complete understanding of the exact dynamics of the immune response is difficult to achieve.

On oceanic islands, the ecology of IAV could be affected by the relative diversity, abundance and density of seabirds and ducks. Seabirds are the most abundant and widespread avifauna in the Western Indian Ocean and, in this region, oceanic islands represent major breeding sites for a large diversity of potential IAV host species. Based on serological assays, we assessed the host range of IAV and the virus subtype diversity in terns of the islands of the Western Indian Ocean. We further investigated the spatial variation in virus transmission patterns between islands and identified the origin of circulating viruses using a molecular approach. Our findings indicate that terns represent a major host for IAV on oceanic islands, not only for seabird-related virus subtypes such as H16, but also for those commonly isolated in wild and domestic ducks (H3, H6, H9, H12 subtypes). We also identified strong species-associated variation in virus exposure that may be associated to differences in the ecology and behaviour of terns.

For reasons yet to be fully understood the COVID-19 outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been significantly more widespread than the 2003 SARS epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-1, despite striking similarities between the two viruses. One of the most variable genes differentiating SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 is the S gene that encodes the spike glycoprotein. This protein mediates a crucial step in the infection, i.e., host cell recognition and viral entry, which starts with binding to the host cell angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein for both viruses. Recent structural and functional studies have shed light on the differential binding behavior of the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. In particular, cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies show that ACE2 binding is preceded by a large-scale conformational change in the spike protein to expose the receptor binding domain (RBD) to its binding partner. Unfortunately, these studies do not provide detailed information on the dynamics of this activation process. Here, we have used an extensive set of unbiased and biased microsecond-timescale all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein ectodomains in explicit solvent to determine the differential behavior of spike protein activation in the two viruses. Our results based on nearly 50 microseconds of equilibrium and nonequilibrium MD simulations indicate that the active form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is considerably more stable than the active SARS-CoV-1 spike protein. Unlike the active SARS-CoV-2 spike, the active SARS-CoV-1 spike spontaneously undergoes a large-scale conformational transition to a pseudo-inactive state, which occurs in part due to interactions between the N-terminal domain (NTD) and RBD that are absent in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Steered MD (SMD) simulations indicate that the energy barriers between active and inactive states are comparatively lower for the SARS-CoV-1 spike protein. Based on these results, we hypothesize that the greater propensity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to remain in the active conformation contributes to the higher transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS-CoV-1. These results strongly suggest that the differential binding behavior of the active SARS-CoV-1 and 2 spike proteins is not merely due to differences in their RBDs as other domains of the spike protein such as the NTD could play a crucial role in the effective binding process, which involves the prebinding activation. Therefore, our hypothesis predicts that mutations in regions such as the NTD, which is not directly involved in binding, may lead to a change in the effective binding behavior of the coronavirus.","output":"Differential Dynamic Behavior of Prefusion Spike Glycoproteins of Sars Coronaviruses 1 and 2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This case series describes clinical, radiographic, and histopathological features of mandibular swellings in 5 immature, large breed dogs.

The renal protective effects of Quercetin on COVID-19-induced AKI may be associated with the blockade of the activation of inflammatory, cell apoptosis-related signaling pathways. Quercetin may also serve as SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor by binding with the active sites of SARS-CoV-2 main protease 3CL and ACE2, therefore suppressing the functions of the proteins to cut the viral life cycle.

The COVID-19 pandemic offers a unique opportunity to test how message framing affects risky decision-making when millions of real lives are at stake worldwide. In a sample of US adults (N = 294), we investigated the effects of message framing and personality (Dark Triad traits) in relation to risky decision-making during the COVID-19 crisis.

People were more risk-averse in the loss condition of the current study compared to the benchmark established by Tversky and Kahneman (1981). Among the Dark Triad traits, psychopathy emerged as the significant predictor of risk taking, suggesting that people who score high in psychopathy are more likely to gamble with other people's lives during the COVID-19 crisis. We suggest that both voters and pandemic-related public awareness campaigns should consider the possibility that decision-makers with psychopathic tendencies may take greater risks with other people's lives during a pandemic.

PURPOSE: Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) therapy is used in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia to lower the risk of infections. IVIG and subcutaneous IVIG (SCIG) therapy have been to shown to be safe and effective when administered as clinic-based infusions. Concern from both patients and providers for increased transmission of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus to immunosuppressed patients with scheduled medical visits and procedures made it necessary for us to reassess our process of how we manage patient care in general and chronic clinic infusions in particular. Here we describe our experience of transitioning patients from clinic-based to home based IVIG and/or SCIG infusions to decrease the risk of COVID-19 exposure. METHODS: Criteria were developed to identify high-risk immunosuppressed patients who would be appropriate candidates for potential conversion to home based IVIG infusions. Data were collected via chart review, and cost analysis was performed using Medicare Part B reimbursement data. A patient outcome questionnaire was developed for administration through follow-up phone calls. RESULTS: From March to May 2020, 45 patients met criteria for home-based infusion, with 27 patients (60%) agreeing to home-based infusion. Posttransition patient outcomes assessment, conducted in 26 patients (96%), demonstrated good patient understanding of the home-based infusion process. No infusion-related complications were reported, and 24 patients (92%) had no concerns about receiving future IVIG and/or SCIG doses at home. No patient tested positive for COVID-19 during the study period. Clinic infusion visits decreased by 26.6 visits per month, resulting in a total of 106 hours of additional available infusion chair time per month and associated cost savings of $12,877. CONCLUSION: Transition of clinic based to home based IVIG/SCIG infusion can be successfully done to decrease potential exposure during a pandemic in a high-risk immunosuppressed population, with no impact on patient satisfaction, adherence, or efficacy. The home-based infusion initiative was associated with a reduction in costs to patients and an increase in available chair time in the infusion clinic.","output":"Mitigating the risk of COVID-19 exposure by transitioning from clinic-based to home-based immune globulin infusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) devastation on the central nervous system (CNS) is ascertained by the present clinical findings and the noticeable signs and symptoms.

Here, we present our pilot results of a new technique for the incorporation of spatial information of transactions and a vital registry of COVID-19 to evaluate the disease spread. METHODS: We merged two databases of laboratory-confirmed national COVID-19 registry of Iran and financial transactions of point-of-sale devices from February to March 2020 as our training data sources. Spatial information was used for the visualization of maps and movements of sick individuals. We used the point-of-sale devices-related guild to check for the dynamics of financial transactions and effectiveness of quarantines. FINDINGS: In the study period, 174,428 confirmed cases were in the COVID-19 registry with accompanying transactions information. In total, 13,924,982 financial transactions were performed by them, with a mean of 1.2 per day for each person. All guilds had a decreasing pattern of risky transactions except for grocery stores and pharmacies. The latter showed a decreasing pattern by impose of lockdowns. Different cities were the hotspot of disease transmission as many high-risk transactions were performed in them, among which Tehran (mainly its central neighborhoods) and southern cities of Lake Urmia predominated.

Family presence in intensive care units (ICUs), especially in the acute phase of the disease is controversial. This study has been carried out in order to determine the effect of the family presence on anxiety and agitation in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a clinical trial, 70 patients were randomly allocated into groups of experimental and control. In the experimental group, during the weaning process from the mechanical ventilation, a family member was present at the bedside. The degree of anxiety and Richmonds Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) were compared in seven consecutive time stages, including the time of entry into the ICU, the first respiratory drive, the family entrance, 20 min and 1 h after the presence of the family member, the time of extubation, and 1 h after extubation. RESULTS: There was a significant difference between the two groups in the mean scores of the anxiety scale in the first (P =0.008), second (P=0.002), and third stages (P =0.005). This difference was not significant in the fourth to seventh stages (P>0.05). As the baseline anxiety levels were different, a covariate adjustment was used for comparisons between treatments, adjusting the main analyses for baseline anxiety levels. Analysis showed that groups were not different. Also, there was no significant difference in the mean scores of RASS between the two experimental and control groups at any of the seven stages (P> 0.05). CONCLUSION: According to the findings of the present study, the presence of a family member does not reduce the level of anxiety and agitation of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. However, it can be concluded that this intervention is feasible in acute and complex situations after open heart surgeries.

From the richest and most advanced nations to the poorest and least developed ones, it exposed all of our vulnerabilities. The loss of life, health disparities and economic adversities, aggravated by political and ideological tensions, added multiple layers of stress and anxieties to an already stressed American society. METHODS: The educational institutions in the United States from the central to the local units demonstrated coherence in leadership, guided with flexibility and compassion, which paved the way for smooth operations. However, anxiety among students and faculty of university and college campuses is undeniable. In-person instruction was halted. Research labs and offices were locked down or operating with limited personnel. Thus, the challenges to have timely instruction and to move the research enterprise forward have been enormous. Provided here is a perspective based on a literature search using PubMed and Google with search words COVID-19, stress, college students, COVID-19, stress, US graduate students, and COVID-19, stress, postdoc researchers. RESULTS: This article is an opinion piece, part personal and part peer experiences. It is presented in light of studies suggesting that the COVID-19 pandemic has imposed significant mental stress and anxiety upon students and faculty members within the academy. CONCLUSION: Loss of face-to-face interactions as a result of virtual instructions, lack of in-person mentoring, and loss of research productivity have affected mental health and well-being of the academic community.

However, few previous studies have examined the effects of daily support between parents and children on their well-being during public health emergencies. To fill in this gap, we examined the association between daily support and well-being in mothers and their adult children during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Seventy-seven pairs of mothers (aged 44-80 years, M = 53.78, SD = 9.57) and adult children (aged 18-54 years, M = 26.61, SD = 9.46; 19% male) in mainland China participated in a 14-day daily diary study during a 14-day stay-at-home period. All of the participants reported the daily emotional and instrumental support they had given to and received from their mother/child each day for 14 consecutive days. Their daily positive affect and negative affect were also measured. RESULTS: Receiving more support on a given day was associated with providing more support on that day, suggesting a daily reciprocity. This finding was consistent across mothers and children. A lower level of being under-benefitted on a day was associated with better daily well-being of children, but not that of mothers. Providing support, but not receiving support, was positively associated with mothers' daily well-being, whereas receiving support, but not providing support, was positively associated with children's daily well-being. DISCUSSION: This study provides evidence of daily intergenerational support during a global public health emergency.

Results A significant inverse relationship was observed with respect to resilience and burnout in both the professional nurse and student groups. However, the inpatient psychiatric nurse group was not found to have a higher level of resilience than the student group, when controlling for age.

Laparoscopic splenectomy (LS) is considered the operation of choice on elective basis for managing patients with certain hematological disorders. Hemostatic control of the splenic pedicle is one of the crucial steps in LS. This study compares the safety and efficacy of using endoscopic staplers and vessel sealing devices to control the splenic pedicle in patients with nonsevere splenomegaly. Methods. Fifty-one consecutive patients with different blood disorders including idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), hypersplenism, and lymphoma were randomized for elective LS. Traditional steps of LS, via lateral approach, were followed, and pedicle control was done with either endovascular gastrointestinal anastomosis stapler (n = 26) or vessel sealing device (Ligasure) (n = 25). Results. No difference was noted with different splenic spans when using either methods of pedicle control (P = .145). The volume of blood loss was higher in the Ligasure group compared to the staplers group (182 mL vs 131 mL, respectively), but was not statistically significant (P = .249). Conversion to open was notably higher in the Ligasure group (P = .034), but the intraoperative complications were comparable in both groups (P = .357). Conclusion. The use of vessel sealing devices for splenic pedicle control has comparable surgical outcomes compared with the use of endoscopic staplers for LS, but with higher rate of conversion to open surgery.","output":"Safety and Efficacy of Using Staplers and Vessel Sealing Devices for Laparoscopic Splenectomy: A Randomized Controlled Trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Exosomes are a subset of extracellular vesicles essential for cellCcell communication in health and disease with the ability to transport nucleic acids, functional proteins and other metabolites.

How genetic deficits in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) lead to these defects remains unknown. Rapid advances in genomic editing such as the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system provide new tools for scientific study. We aimed to create a stable CFTR knockout (KO) in human macrophages in order to study how CFTR regulates macrophage function. Peripheral blood monocytes were isolated from non-CF healthy volunteers and differentiated into monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). MDMs were transfected with a CRISPR Cas9 CFTR KO plasmid. CFTR KO efficiency was verified and macrophage halide efflux, phagocytosis, oxidative burst, apoptosis, and cytokine functional assays were performed. CFTR KO in human MDMs was efficient and stable after puromycin selection. CFTR KO was confirmed by CFTR mRNA and protein expression. CFTR function was abolished in CFTR KO MDMs. CFTR KO recapitulated known defects in human CF MDM (CFTR class I/II variants) dysfunction including (1) increased apoptosis, (2) decreased phagocytosis, (3) reduced oxidative burst, and (4) increased bacterial load. Activation of the oxidative burst via nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase assembly was diminished in CFTR KO MDMs (decreased phosphorylated p47phox). Cytokine production was unchanged or decreased in response to infection in CFTR KO MDMs. In conclusion, we developed a primary human macrophage CFTR KO system. CFTR KO mimics most pathology observed in macrophages obtained from persons with CF, which suggests that many aspects of CF macrophage dysfunction are CFTR-dependent and not just reflective of the CF inflammatory milieu.","output":"Consequences of CRISPR-Cas9-Mediated CFTR Knockout in Human Macrophages."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Prior literature examining the impact of social distancing on US COVID-19 mortality predominantly examines this relationship at the national level in addition to not separating nursing home COVID-19 deaths from total COVID-19 deaths. This approach may obscure differences in social distancing behaviors by county in addition to the actual effectiveness of social distancing in preventing COVID-19 deaths. OBJECTIVE: To determine the influence of county level social distancing behavior on COVID-19 mortality (deaths/100,000 people) for counties throughout the US over the timespan that stay at home orders were implemented in most US states (March 2020-May 2020). METHODS: Using social distancing data from tracked mobile phones in all US counties, we estimated the relationship between social distancing (average % of mobile phone use outside the home between March 2020-May 2020) and COVID-19 mortality (when the state a county is in had its first confirmed case and up to May 31st, 2020) with a mixed-effects negative binomial model while separating nursing home COVID-19 deaths from total COVID-19 deaths as well as accounting for social distancing and COVID-19 related factors (days between when the first confirmed case was reported and May 31st, 2020, population density, social vulnerability, and hospital resource availability). Results from the mixed-effects negative binomial model were then used to generate marginal effects at the mean which allowed for the separation of the influence of social distancing on COVID-19 deaths from other covariates while calculating COVID-19 deaths/100,000 people. RESULTS: We observed that a 1% increase in average mobile phone use outside the home between March 2020-May 2020 led to a significant increase in COVID-19 mortality by a factor of 1.18 (p < .001) while every 1% increase in average % of mobile phone use outside the home in February was found to significantly decrease COVID-19 mortality by a factor of 0.90 (p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: As stay-at-home orders have been lifted in many US states, continued adherence to other social distancing measures such as avoiding large gatherings and maintaining physical distance in public are key to preventing additional COVID-19 deaths in counties across the country.","output":"The influence of social distancing on COVID-19 mortality in US counties: Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Since December 2019, a respiratory pandemic, named as coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) caused by a new coronavirus named as SARS-CoV-2, has taken the world by storm. The symptoms are fever, malaise, and cough which resolve in a few days in most cases; but may progress to respiratory distress and organ failure. Transmission is through droplet infection or fomites, but other modes such as airborne transmission and oro-fecal transmission is also speculated. Research is underway to develop effective vaccines and medicines for the disease. In such a scenario, we present the measures described in Unani system of medicine for health protection during epidemics. Unani is a traditional system of medicine developed during the middle ages, which employs natural drugs of herbal, animal and mineral origin for treatment. In Unani medicine, during an epidemic, apart from isolation and quarantine, three measures are of utmost importance, (i) purification of surroundings using certain herbal drugs as fumigants or sprays, (ii) health promotion and immune-modulation, and (iii) use of health-protecting drugs and symptom-specific drugs. Drugs such as loban (Styrax benzoides W. G. Craib), sandroos (Hymenaea verrucosa Gaertn.) za'fran (Crocus sativus L.), vinegar etc. are prescribed in various forms.

This study assesses COVID-19 knowledge and case management of informal providers (IPs), trained practitioners of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy (AYUSH) and Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) medical doctors providing primary care services in rural Bihar, India. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study of primary care providers conducted via telephone between 1 and 15 July 2020. SETTING: Primary care providers from 224 villages in 34 districts across Bihar, India. PARTICIPANTS: 452 IPs, 57 AYUSH practitioners and 38 doctors (including 23 government doctors) were interviewed from a census of 1138 primary care providers used by community members that could be reached by telephone. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Providers were interviewed using a structured questionnaire with choice-based answers to gather information on (1) change in patient care seeking, (2) source of COVID-19 information, (3) knowledge on COVID-19 spread, symptoms and methods for prevention and (4) clinical management of COVID-19. RESULTS: During the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, 72% of providers reported a decrease in patient visits. Most IPs and other private primary care providers reported receiving no COVID-19 related engagement with government or civil society agencies. For them, the principal source of COVID-19 information was television and newspapers. IPs had reasonably good knowledge of typical COVID-19 symptoms and prevention, and at levels similar to doctors. However, there was low stated compliance among IPs (16%) and qualified primary care providers (15% of MBBS doctors and 12% of AYUSH practitioners) with all WHO recommended management practices for suspect COVID-19 cases. Nearly half of IPs and other providers intended to treat COVID-19 suspects without referral. CONCLUSIONS: Poor management practices of COVID-19 suspects by rural primary care providers weakens government pandemic control efforts.

We propose an interpretable statistical model to identify spatiotemporal variation in the association between mobility and infection rates. Using 1 year of US county-level data, we found that sharp drops in mobility often coincided with declining infection rates in the most populous counties in spring 2020. However, the association varied considerably in other locations and across time. Our findings are sensitive to model flexibility, as more restrictive models average over local effects and mask much of the spatiotemporal variation.

In order to apply the results of a study, we should be able to assess its population external validity. We performed an investigator-initiated randomized controlled trial (RCT) (AIDA study), which compared colistin-meropenem combination therapy to colistin monotherapy in the treatment of patients infected with carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. In order to examine the studys population external validity and to substantiate the use of AIDA study results in clinical practice, we performed a concomitant observational trial. METHODS: The study was conducted between October 1st, 2013 and January 31st, 2017 (during the RCTs recruitment period) in Greece, Israel and Italy. Patients included in the observational arm of the study have fulfilled clinical and microbiological inclusion criteria but were excluded from the RCT due to receipt of colistin for > 96 h, refusal to participate, or prior inclusion in the RCT. Non-randomized cases were compared to randomized patients. The primary outcome was clinical failure at 14 days of infection onset. RESULTS: Analysis included 701 patients. Patients were infected mainly with Acinetobacter baumannii [78.2% (548/701)]. The most common reason for exclusion was refusal to participate [62% (183/295)]. Non-randomized and randomized patients were similar in most of the demographic and background parameters, though randomized patients showed minor differences towards a more severe infection. Combination therapy was less common in non-randomized patients [31.9% (53/166) vs. 51.2% (208/406), p = 0.000]. Randomized patients received longer treatment of colistin [13 days (IQR 10C16) vs. 8.5 days (IQR 0C15), p = 0.000]. Univariate analysis showed that non-randomized patients were more inclined to clinical failure on day 14 from infection onset [82% (242/295) vs. 75.5% (307/406), p = 0.042]. After adjusting for other variables, non-inclusion was not an independent risk factor for clinical failure at day 14. CONCLUSION: The similarity between the observational arm and RCT patients has strengthened our confidence in the population external validity of the AIDA trial. Adding an observational arm to intervention studies can help increase the population external validity and improve implementation of study results in clinical practice.

Micronutrients play a critical role in the coordinated recruitment of innate and adaptive immune responses to viral infections, particularly in the regulation of pro-and anti-inflammatory host responses. Furthermore, inadequate amounts of micronutrients not only weaken the immune system in combating viral infections, but also contribute to the emergence of more virulent strains via alterations of the genetic make-up of the viral genome. This study aimed to evaluate the evidence which suggests the contribution of micronutrients in the spread as well as the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19.

Exercise could be beneficial for young people living with depression, but robust, large-scale trials of effectiveness and the impact of exercise intensity are lacking. This study aims to test whether a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of an intervention targeting young people living with depression is feasible by determining whether it is possible to recruit and retain young people, develop and deliver the intervention as planned, and evaluate training and delivery. METHODS: The design is a three-arm cluster randomised controlled feasibility trial with embedded process evaluation. Participants will be help-seeking young people, aged 13C17 years experiencing mild to moderate low mood or depression, referred from three counties in England. The intervention will be delivered by registered exercise professionals, supported by mental health support workers, twice a week for 12 weeks. The three arms will be high-intensity exercise, low-intensity exercise, and a social activity control. All arms will receive a healthy living behaviour change session prior to each exercise session and the two exercise groups are energy matched. The outcomes are referral, recruitment, and retention rates; attendance at exercise sessions; adherence to and ability to reach intensity during exercise sessions; proportions of missing data; adverse events, all measured at baseline, 3, and 6 months; resource use; and reach and representativeness. DISCUSSION: UK National Health Service (NHS) policy is to provide young people with advice about using exercise to help depression but there is no evidence-based exercise intervention to either complement or as an alternative to medication or talking therapies. UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines suggest that exercise can be an effective treatment, but the evidence base is relatively weak. This feasibility trial will provide evidence about whether it is feasible to recruit and retain young people to a full RCT to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an exercise intervention for depression.

In the study, we investigate the presence of viruses in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with AE using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)/PCR and shotgun metagenomics. METHODS: CSF samples collected from 200 patients with encephalitis were tested for the presence of antibodies against antiglutamate receptor (NMDAR), contactin-associated protein 2 (CASPR2), glutamate receptors (type AMPA1/2), leucine-rich glioma-inactivated protein 1 (LGI1), dipeptidyl aminopeptidase-like protein 6 (DPPX), and GABA B receptor, and those found positive were further analyzed with real-time RT-PCR/PCR for common viral neuroinfections and shotgun DNA- and RNA-based metagenomics. RESULTS: Autoantibodies against neuronal cells were detected in CSF from 8 individuals (4% of all encephalitis patients): 7 (3.5%) had anti-NMDAR and 1 (0.5%) had anti-GABA B. RT-PCR/PCR identified human herpes virus type 1 (HSV-1; 300 copies/mL) and the representative of Enterovirus genus (550 copies/mL) in 1 patient each. Torque teno virus (TTV) was found in another patient using metagenomic analysis, and its presence was confirmed by specific PCR. CONCLUSIONS: We detected the presence of HSV, TTV, and Enterovirus genus in CSF samples from 3 out of 8 AE patients.

In order to investigate the molecular determinants of BTV virulence, we used a BTV8 strain minimally passaged in tissue culture (termed BTV8(L) in this study) and a derivative strain passaged extensively in tissue culture (BTV8(H)) in in vitro and in vivo studies. BTV8(L) was pathogenic in both IFNAR(?/?) mice and in sheep, while BTV8(H) was attenuated in both species. To identify genetic changes which led to BTV8(H) attenuation, we generated 34 reassortants between BTV8(L) and BTV8(H). We found that partial attenuation of BTV8(L) in IFNAR(?/?) mice was achieved by simply replacing genomic segment 2 (Seg2, encoding VP2) or Seg10 (encoding NS3) with the BTV8(H) homologous segments. Fully attenuated viruses required at least two genome segments from BTV8(H), including Seg2 with either Seg1 (encoding VP1), Seg6 (encoding VP6 and NS4), or Seg10 (encoding NS3). Conversely, full reversion of virulence of BTV8(H) required at least five genomic segments of BTV8(L). We also demonstrated that BTV8(H) acquired an increased affinity for glycosaminoglycan receptors during passaging in cell culture due to mutations in its VP2 protein. Replication of BTV8(H) was relatively poor in interferon (IFN)-competent primary ovine endothelial cells compared to replication of BTV8(L), and this phenotype was determined by several viral genomic segments, including Seg4 and Seg9. This study demonstrated that multiple viral proteins contribute to BTV8 virulence. VP2 and NS3 are primary determinants of BTV pathogenesis, but VP1, VP5, VP4, VP6, and VP7 also contribute to virulence. IMPORTANCE Bluetongue is one of the major infectious diseases of ruminants, and it is listed as a notifiable disease by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). The clinical outcome of BTV infection varies considerably and depends on environmental and host- and virus-specific factors. Over the years, BTV serotypes/strains with various degrees of virulence (including nonpathogenic strains) have been described in different geographical locations. However, no data are available to correlate the BTV genotype to virulence. This study shows that BTV virulence is determined by different viral genomic segments. The data obtained will help to characterize thoroughly the pathogenesis of bluetongue. The possibility to determine the pathogenicity of virus isolates on the basis of their genome sequences will help in the design of control strategies that fit the risk posed by new emerging BTV strains.","output":"Multiple Genome Segments Determine Virulence of Bluetongue Virus Serotype 8"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: There is limited data on the serologic antibody responses after the ChAdOx1 vaccine in patients with hematological malignancies and hematopoietic cell transplantation recipients.

All study patients received CC that included primary care providers (PCPs) and specialists in the same clinic, 24/7 direct phone access to PCPs, low patient\\\\to\\\\PCP ratio (100:1), hospital consultation from PCPs during hospitalizations, and multiple other features to promote prompt effective care at all hours. The TM group also received audio\\\\visual communication (via Zoom for Healthcare) with the PCPs. The study outcomes were the Bayesian posterior probability of reducing days of care outside the home (in a clinic, ED, or hospital;primary outcome), the rate of children developing a serious illness (causing death, pediatric intensive care unit [PICU] admission, or hospital stay >7 days), and health system costs.Population StudiedHigh\\\\risk CMC (with a chronic disease and  2 hospitalizations or  1 PICU admission in the year before enrolling in our CC program) treated in the High\\\\Risk Children's Clinic at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Texas.Principal FindingsBetween August 22, 2018 and March 23, 2020, we randomized 422 CMC, 209 to CC with TM and 213 to CC alone before meeting the predefined stopping rule (75% probability of reduced care days outside the home).

The objective of this survey was to assess the change in neurosurgical training in India following the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Between May 7, 2020, and May 16, 2020, a validated questionnaire was circulated among neurosurgical residents across India by social media, regarding changes in the department's functioning, patient interaction, surgical exposure, changes in academics, and fears and apprehensions associated with the pandemic. The responses were kept anonymous and were analyzed for changes during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to before the pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 118 residents from 29 neurosurgical training programs across 17 states/union territories of the country gave their responses to the survey questionnaire. The survey revealed that the surgical exposure of neurosurgical residents has drastically reduced since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, from an average of 39.86 surgeries performed/assisted per month (median 30) to 12.31 per month (median 10), representing a decrease of 67.50%. The number of academic sessions has fallen from a median of 5 per week to 2 per week. The survey uncovered the lack of universal guidelines and homogeneity regarding preoperative COVID-19 testing. The survey also reveals reluctance toward detailed patient examinations since the COVID-19 outbreak. The majority of respondents felt that the COVID-19 pandemic will hamper their operative and clinical skills. Fear of rescheduling or deferring of licensing examinations was significantly higher among those closest to the examination (p = 0.002).

Noninvasive tissue perfusion monitoring offers a clinical benefit by detecting low systemic perfusion. In this study, we tried to evaluate whether regional tissue perfusion saturation reflects systemic hypoperfusion during CPB. METHODS This retrospective study included 29 patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status II-III, who required cardiac surgery with CPB. We evaluated the correlations of serum lactate and delivery oxygen with organ perfusion values of peripheral tissue oxygen saturation and cerebral oxygen saturation. Data were recorded at different stages of CPB: T1 (pre-CPB), T2 (cooling), T3 (hypothermia), T4 (rewarming), and T5 (post-CPB). RESULTS Lactate levels were elevated after CPB and up to weaning (P < 0.05). The levels of peripheral and tissue oxygen saturation decreased after the start of CPB (P < 0.05). Lactate levels were negatively correlated with peripheral tissue oxygen saturation levels at T4 (R = -0.384) and T5 (R = -0.370) and positively correlated with cerebral oxygen saturation at T3 (R = 0.445). Additionally, delivery oxygen was positively correlated with peripheral tissue oxygen saturation at T4 (R = 0.466).

This is very important for the investigation of thermal stability and energy oxidation characteristics, because evaluation of energy or fuel quality assurance and use safety are necessary. The main components of turpentine are -pinene and ?-pinene, which have unsaturated double bonds and high chemical activity. By investigating their thermal stability and oxidation reaction characteristics, we know the chemical thermal properties and thermal explosion hazard of turpentine. In this present study, the thermal stability and oxidation characteristics of -pinene, ?-pinene and -pinene/?-pinene mixture were investigated using a high sensitivity accelerating rate calorimeter (ARC) and C80 calorimeter. The important parameters of oxidation reaction and thermal stability were obtained from the temperature, pressure and exothermic behavior in chemical reaction. The results show that -pinene and ?-pinene are thermally stable without chemical reaction under a nitrogen atmosphere even when the temperature reaches 473 K.

Many patients with lymphoid malignancies receive immunosuppressive therapies, including B-cell depleting agents, that may negatively impact humoral response to vaccination. METHODS: We recruited patients with lymphoid malignancies and healthy participants who planned to receive two doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273). Blood was drawn at baseline, prior to second dose of vaccine, and 28 days after last vaccination. Disease characteristics and therapies were extracted from patients electronic medical record. An ultrasensitive, single molecule array (Simoa) assay detected anti-Spike (S), anti-S1, anti-receptor binding domain (RBD), and anti-Nucleocapsid (N) IgG from plasma at each timepoint. RESULTS: 23 healthy participants and 37 patients with lymphoid malignancies were enrolled (Table 1). Low titers of anti-N (Fig 1A) demonstrate no prior exposure or acquisition of COVID-19 before vaccination or during the study. 37.8% of the lymphoid malignancy cohort responded to the vaccine, using an internally validated AEB cutoff of 1.07. A significantly higher magnitude of anti-S (p< 0.0001), anti-S1 (p< 0.0001) and anti-RBD (p< 0.0001) are present in the healthy as compared to lymphoid malignancy cohort at the second dose and day 28 post-series (Fig 1B, Fig 1C and Fig 1D). Anti-S IgG titers were compared between the healthy cohort, treatment na?ve, and treatment experienced groups (Fig 2). The treatment na?ve cohort had high titers by series completion which were not significantly different from the healthy cohort (p=0.2259), although the treatment experienced group had significantly decreased titers (p< 0.0001). Of the 20 patients who had received CD20 therapy, there was no clear correlation of anti-S IgG response with time from CD20 therapy, although most patients who received CD20 therapies within 12 months from the vaccine had no response (Figure 3).

METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of all planned gynecologic oncology surgeries at University Health Network (UHN) in Toronto, Canada and Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) in Boston, USA, between March 22,020 and July 302,020. Surgical treatment delays and modifications at both centers were compared to standard recommendations. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to adjust for confounders. RESULTS: A total of 450 surgical gynecologic oncology patients were included; 215 at UHN and 235 at BWH. There was a significant difference in median time from decision-to-treat to treatment (23 vs 15 days, p < 0.01) between UHN and BWH and a significant difference in treatment delays (32.56% vs 18.29%; p < 0.01) and modifications (8.37% vs 0.85%; p < 0.01), respectively.

But, there is still a lack of systematic review of registered clinical trials. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of the clinical trials of COVID-19 to summarize the characteristics of the COVID-19 registered clinical trials. Methods: This study is based on the recommendations of the PRISMA in the Cochrane handbook. The databases from the Chinese Clinical Registration Center and the ClinicalTrials.gov were searched to collect the registered clinical trials of COVID-19. The retrieval inception date is February 9, 2020. Two researchers independently selected the literature based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, extracted data and evaluated the risk of bias. Results: A total of 75 registered clinical trials (63 interventional studies and 12 observational studies) of COVID-19 were obtained. A majority of clinical trials were sponsored by Chinese hospitals. Only 11 trials have begun to recruit patients, and none of the registered clinical trials had been completed; 34 trials were early clinical exploratory trials or in a pre-experiment stage, 15 trials belonged to phrase  and 4 trials were phrase . The methods of intervention included traditional Chinese medicine involving 26 trials, Western medicine involving 30 trials, and integrated traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine involving 19 trials. The subjects were mainly non-critical adult patients ( 18 years old). The median sample size of the trials was 100 (IQR: 60 - 200), and the median execute time of the trials was 179 d (IQR: 94 - 366 d). The main outcomes were clinical observation and examinations. Overall, both the methodology quality of interventional trials and observational studies were low. Conclusions: Disorderly and intensive clinical trials of COVID-19 using traditional Chinese medicine and western medicine are ongoing or will being carried out in China. However, based on the low methodology quality and small sample size and long studies execute time, we will not be able to obtain reliable, high-quality clinical evidence about COVID-19 treatment in the near future.

Chronic pain patients require long-term multidisciplinary management even during a pandemic. Fear of abandonment, anxiety and depression may increase during this period of social isolation and aggravate pain conditions. Whilst physical consults for chronic pain patients were reduced, considerations including continuity of support and analgesia, telemedicine, allied health support and prioritising necessary pain services and interventions, were also taken to ensure biopsychosocial care for them. Chronic pain patients are mostly elderly with multiple comorbidities, and are more susceptible to morbidity and mortality from COVID-19.

Patients were randomly distributed into 3 groups: surgical dressing untouched until first follow up (SDU); surgical dressing changed twice a week in a health maintenance organization (HMO); and surgical dressing removed at first postoperative day (SDR). Data collected included patient characteristics, pre-and post-operative functional (QuickDASH) and autonomy (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living performance (IADL)) scores, Vancouver scar scale (VSS) and potential complications.

Researchers working at the intersection of COVID-19 and autoimmunity recently gathered at an American Autoimmune Related Disease Association (AARDA) Noel R. Rose Colloquium to address the current state of knowledge regarding two important questions: Does established autoimmunity predispose to severe COVID-19? And, at the same time, can SARS-CoV-2 infection trigger de novo autoimmunity? Indeed, work to date has demonstrated that 10 to 15% of patients with critical COVID-19 pneumonia exhibit autoantibodies against type I interferons, suggesting that preexisting autoimmunity underlies severe disease in some patients. Other studies have identified functional autoantibodies following infection with SARS-CoV-2, such as those that promote thrombosis or antagonize cytokine signaling. These autoantibodies may arise from a predominantly extrafollicular B cell response that is more prone to generating autoantibody-secreting B cells.

Here, we aim to identify a new panel of biomarkers including IgG subclasses, Rheumatoid Factor (RF), and Free Light Chains (FLC) that may result useful and reliable for clinical evaluation of HBV-related cryoglobulinemia. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed clinical data from 44 HBV positive patients. Patients were stratified on the presence/absence of mixed cryoglobulinemia in two group: 22 with cryoglobulins (CGs) and 22 without CGs. Samples from 20 healthy blood donors (HD) were used as negative controls. Serum samples were tested for IgG subclasses, RF (IgM, IgG, and IgA type), and FLC. RESULTS: We detected a strikingly different serum IgG subclasses distribution between HD and HBV positive patients together with different RF isotypes; FLC were significantly increased in HBV-patients if compared with HD while no significant difference was shown between HBV with/without MC. CONCLUSION: The immune-inflammatory response triggered by HBV may be monitored by a peculiar profile of biomarkers. Our results open new perspective in precision medicine era; in these challenging times, they could be also employed to monitor the clinical course of COVID-19 patients, at high risk of HBV reactivation due to liver impairment and/or immunosuppressive therapies.","output":"Solving the mystery of HBV-related mixed cryoglobulinemia: potential biomarkers of disease progression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Metastatic breast cancer remains an incurable disease, and new therapies are needed.

Systemic inflammatory markers are prognostic markers for a variety of thrombotic conditions; however, their potential value in predicting portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is unknown. This study aimed to establish an easy-to-use nomogram based on systemic inflammatory markers to predict portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in patients with liver cirrhosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 478 patients with cirrhosis between January 2013 and January 2021. Reputed systemic inflammatory markers (systemic immune-inflammation index [SII], neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio [NLR], monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio [MLR], and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR)) were measured, and the clinical data were recorded. The independent risk factors for PVT were determined using univariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression analyses, and a nomogram to predict the occurrence of PVT was established. The concordance index, receiver operating characteristic curves, and calibration plots were used to evaluate the performance of the model. RESULTS: A total of 239 patients with PVT and 239 patients without PVT were selected. In the univariate analysis, high SII, NLR, PLR, and MLR were significantly associated with PVT. NLR and PLR were independent risk factors for PVT (P < 0.05) by multivariate analysis. The nomogram had good predictive efficiency for PVT in patients with cirrhosis, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves of 0.891 (95% CI 0.862C0.919) and the calibration curves fit as well, indicating that the nomogram had good clinical application value. CONCLUSIONS: PVT in patients with cirrhosis is associated with increased levels of systemic inflammatory markers. We successfully developed a practical nomogram based on NLR and PLR to accurately predict PVT, which is a practical method helping clinicians rapidly and conveniently diagnose and guide the treatment of PVT in patients with cirrhosis. KEY MESSAGES: The present study is the first report on a nomogram based on systemic inflammatory markers in patients with portal vein thrombosis (PVT). The nomogram had good predictive efficiency and a good clinical application value for predicting PVT in patients with cirrhosis.","output":"A practical nomogram based on systemic inflammatory markers for predicting portal vein thrombosis in patients with liver cirrhosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diabetic nephropathy (DN), a serious complication of hyperglycemia, is one of the most common causes of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Glomerular podocyte injury is a major mechanism that leads to DN. However, the mechanisms underlying podocyte injury are ambiguous. In this study, we sought to investigate the contribution of SET domain-containing protein 6 (SETD6) to the pathogenesis of podocyte injury induced by glucose (GLU) and palmitic acid (PA), as well as the underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that GLU and PA treatment significantly decreased SETD6 expression in mouse podocytes. Besides, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and flow cytometry assay demonstrated that silencing of SETD6 silence obviously enhanced cell viability, and suppressed apoptosis in GLU and PA-induced podocytes. We also discovered that downregulation of SETD6 suppressed GLU and PA-induced ROS generation and podocyte mitochondrial dysfunction. Nrf2-Keap1 signaling pathway was involved in the effect of SETD6 on mitochondrial dysfunction. Taken together, silencing of SETD6 protected mouse podocyte against apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction through activating Nrf2-Keap1 signaling pathway. Therefore these data provide new insights into new potential therapeutic targets for DN treatment.","output":"Down-regulation of SETD6 protects podocyte against high glucose and palmitic acid-induced apoptosis, and mitochondrial dysfunction via activating Nrf2-Keap1 signaling pathway in diabetic nephropathy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Advanced and continuing education is essential for maintaining competence.

OBJECTIVES This study assessed preferred teaching/learning strategies for graduate students enrolled in at least 1 asynchronous nursing course. Correlational data assessed the relationship between preferred teaching/learning strategies and selected demographic information. METHODS All graduate nursing students enrolled in at least 1 asynchronous course at the University of Pittsburgh School of Nursing during a 3-month period were invited to participate in a survey to assess preferred teaching/learning methods. RESULTS Sixty-six graduate students completed the survey. Most participants were comfortable with computer skills, had previously enrolled in a web-enhanced course, and did not enjoy group work. Preferred teaching/learning strategies included voice-over PowerPoints, simulation, case studies, guest speakers, and faculty communication.

The RalGEF pathway is one of the three major K-RAS signaling pathways. Ral GTPases do not possess a cysteine nucleophile to develop a covalent inhibitor following the strategy that led to a K-RAS G12C therapeutic agent. However, several cysteine amino acids exist on the surface of guanine exchange factors that activate Ral GTPases, such as Rgl2. Here, we screen a library of cysteine electrophile fragments to determine if covalent bond formation at one of the Rgl2 surface cysteines could inhibit Ral GTPase activation. We found several chloroacetamide and acrylamide fragments that inhibited Ral GTPase exchange by Rgl2. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that covalent bond formation at Cys-284, but not other cysteines, leads to inhibition of Ral activation by Rgl2. Follow-up time- and concentration-dependent studies of derivatives identified by substructure search of commercial libraries further confirmed Cys-284 as the reaction site and identified the indoline fragments as the most promising series for further development. Cys-284 is located outside of the Rala?Rgl2 interface on a loop that has several residues that come in direct contact with Ral GTPases.

We show a distinct task-dependent engagement of S1 and lateral OFC: while the lateral OFC responds saliently and transiently to rule-switches, activity in S1 reflects initial task learning and persistent engagement after each rule-switch event. Unlike the contralateral S1, which represents the sensory input, activity in ipsilateral S1 mirrors the outcome value during re-learning.

Women with chronic hypertension are easily-recognized and in touch with a wide variety of healthcare providers before, during, and after pregnancy, mandating that chronic hypertension in pregnancy be within the scope of many practitioners. We reviewed recent data on management to inform current care and future research. STUDY DESIGN: Narrative review of published literature. RESULTS: Compared with normotensive women, women with chronic hypertension are at increased risk of maternal and perinatal complications. Women wish to be involved in their care and are capable of measuring blood pressure (BP) at home. Accurate devices for home BP monitoring are now available. The diagnostic criteria for superimposed preeclampsia remain problematic, as most guidelines continue to include deteriorating BP control in the definition. It has not been established how angiogenic markers may aid in confirmation of the diagnosis of superimposed preeclampsia when suspected, over and above information provided by routinely-available clinical data and laboratory results. While chronic hypertension is a strong risk factor for preeclampsia and aspirin decreases preeclampsia risk, the effectiveness specifically among women with chronic hypertension has been questioned. It is unclear whether calcium has an independent effect in preeclampsia prevention in such women. Treating hypertension with antihypertensive therapy halves the risk of progression to severe hypertension, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes, but a reduction in preeclampsia or serious maternal complications has not been demonstrated; however, the latter lack of evidence is possibly due to few events. Also, treating chronic hypertension neither reduces nor increases fetal/newborn death or morbidity, regardless of the gestational age at which the antihypertensive treatment is started. Antihypertensive agents are not teratogenic, but there may be an increase in malformations associated with chronic hypertension itself. At present, BP treatment targets used in clinic are the same as those used at home; although BP values tend to be inconsistently lower at home among hypertensive women. While starting all women on the same antihypertensive medication is usually effective in reducing BP, it remains unclear whether there is an optimal agent for such an approach, or how best to use combinations of antihypertensive medications. An alternative approach is to individualize care, using maternal characteristics and BP features beyond BP level (e.g., variability) that are of prognostic value. Outcomes may be improved by timed birth between 38+0-39+6 weeks based on observational literature; confirmatory trial evidence is pending. Postnatal care is facilitated by the acceptability of most antihypertensives (included angiotensin converting enzymes inhibitors) for use in breastfeeding.

To better understand COVID-19 vaccination disparities across the urban-rural continuum, CDC analyzed county-level vaccine administration data among adults aged &#8805;18 years who received their first dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, or a single dose of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine (Johnson & Johnson) during December 14, 2020-April 10, 2021 in 50 U.S. jurisdictions (49 states and the District of Columbia [DC]). Adult COVID-19 vaccination coverage was lower in rural counties (38.9%) than in urban counties (45.7%) overall and among adults aged 18-64 years (29.1% rural, 37.7% urban), those aged &#8805;65 years (67.6% rural, 76.1% urban), women (41.7% rural, 48.4% urban), and men (35.3% rural, 41.9% urban). Vaccination coverage varied among jurisdictions: 36 jurisdictions had higher coverage in urban counties, five had higher coverage in rural counties, and five had similar coverage (i.e., within 1%) in urban and rural counties; in four jurisdictions with no rural counties, the urban-rural comparison could not be assessed. A larger proportion of persons in the most rural counties (14.6%) traveled for vaccination to nonadjacent counties (i.e., farther from their county of residence) compared with persons in the most urban counties (10.3%). As availability of COVID-19 vaccines expands, public health practitioners should continue collaborating with health care providers, pharmacies, employers, faith leaders, and other community partners to identify and address barriers to COVID-19 vaccination in rural areas (2).","output":"Disparities in COVID-19 Vaccination Coverage Between Urban and Rural Counties - United States, December 14, 2020-April 10, 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article presents the strategies and actions adopted by the Brazilian Ministry of Health to hold back COVID-19.

The CD9 - EWI-F complex displays a tetrameric arrangement with two centrally positioned EWI-F molecules, dimerized through their ectodomains, and two CD9 molecules, one bound to each EWI-F single-pass transmembrane helix through CD9-helices h3 and h4. In the crystal structures, nanobodies 4C8 and 4E8 bind CD9 at the C and D loop, in agreement with 4C8 binding at the ends of the CD9 - EWI-F cryo-EM complex. Overall, the 4C8 - CD9 - EWI-F - EWI-F - CD9 - 4C8 complexes varied from nearly two-fold symmetric (i.e. with the two CD9 - 4C8 copies in nearly anti-parallel orientation) to ca. 50 bent arrangements. Since membrane helices h1 and h2 and the EC2 D-loop have been previously identified as sites for tetraspanin homo-dimerization, the observed linear but flexible arrangement of CD9 - EWI-F with potential CD9 - CD9 homo-dimerization at either end provides a new concatenation model for forming short linear or circular assemblies, which may explain the occurrence of tetraspanin-enriched microdomains.","output":"Implications for tetraspanin-enriched microdomain assembly based on structures of CD9 with EWI-F"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Why we only infrequently detect or report two or more respiratory viruses co-infecting an adult host is poorly understood.

High mutation rates, large population sizes, and short generation times contribute to their typically fast evolutionary rates. However, many additional processes operate on their genomes, often in opposite directions, driving their evolution and allowing them to adapt to diverse host populations and antiviral drugs. Until recently, the high levels of genetic variation of most viruses have been explored only at a few genes or genome regions. The recent advent and increasing affordability of next-generation sequencing techniques have allowed obtaining complete genome sequences of large numbers of viruses, mainly HIV, HCV, influenza A, and others associated with emerging infections, such as Zika, chikungunya, or dengue virus. This opens the possibility to explore the effects of the different processes affecting viral diversity and evolution at the genome level. Consequently, population genomics provides the conceptual and empirical tools necessary to interpret genetic variation in viruses and its dynamics and drivers and to transform these results into information that may complement the epidemiological surveillance of the virus and its disease.

METHODS: We included 278 preschool children hospitalized because of lower respiratory tract infection. White blood cell count and C-reactive protein values were determined and chest X-ray was performed in most patients. Polymerase chain reaction assay was used for the detection of viral pathogens from nasopharyngeal swab. RESULTS: Pneumonia was present in 71.4 % of all coronavirus infections, 35.1 % of all respiratory syncytial virus infections, and 13.0 % of all rhinovirus infections. Coronavirus (p = 0.03) and respiratory syncytial virus (p < 0.01) were retrospectively shown to be associated with the presence of pneumonia and rhinovirus (p < 0.01) with the absence of pneumonia. Wheezing was present in 81.5 % of all rhinovirus infections and in only 33.3 % of all adenovirus infections.

METHODS: This study was planned to examine the demographical, clinical features, and outcomes of the first 500 suspected patients of COVID-19 with SARI admitted in the COVID-19 suspect ICU at a tertiary care center. Between March 7 and July 20, 2020, 500 patients were admitted to the COVID-19 suspect ICU. We analyzed the demographical, clinical features, and outcomes between COVID-19 positive and negative SARI cases. The records of all the patients were reviewed until July 31, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 500 suspected patients admitted to the hospital, 88 patients showed positive results for COVID-19 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of the nasopharyngeal swabs. The mean age in the positive group was higher (55.31  16.16 years) than in the negative group (40.46  17.49 years) (P < 0.001). Forty-seven (53.4%) of these patients in the COVID-19 positive group and 217 (52.7%) from the negative group suffered from previously known comorbidities.

Current perceptions of small health care businesses toward remote care, particularly perceptions of whether RVC adoption will synergistically improve business sustainability, would highlight the pros and cons of rapidly adopting RVC technology among policy makers. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the perceptions of small health care businesses regarding the impact of RVC on their business sustainability during COVID-19, gauge their perceptions of their current levels of adoption of and satisfaction with RVC models and analyze how well that aligns with their perceptions of the current business scenario (SCBS), and determine whether these perceptions influence their view of their midterm sustainability (SUST). METHODS: We randomly sampled small clinics, physician offices, and pharmacies across Colorado and sought assistance from a consulting firm to collect survey data in July 2020. Focal estimated study effects were compared across the three groups of small businesses to draw several insights. RESULTS: In total, 270 respondents, including 82 clinics, 99 small physician offices, and 89 pharmacies, across Colorado were included. SRVC and SCBS had direct, significant, and positive effects on SUST. However, we investigated the effect of the interaction between SRVC and SCBS to determine whether RVC adoption aligns with their perceptions of the current business scenario and whether this interaction impacts their perception of business sustainability. Effects differed among the three groups. The interaction term SRVCSCBS was significant and positive for clinics (P=.02), significant and negative for physician offices (P=.05), and not significant for pharmacies (P=.76). These variations indicate that while clinics positively perceived RVC alignment with the current business scenario, the opposite held true for small physician offices. CONCLUSIONS: As COVID-19 continues to spread worldwide and RVC adoption progresses rapidly, it is critical to understand the impact of RVC on small health care businesses and their perceptions of long-term survival. Small physician practices cannot harness RVC developments and, in contrast with clinics, consider it incompatible with business survival during and after COVID-19. If small health care firms cannot compete with RVC (or synergistically integrate RVC platforms into their current business practices) and eventually become nonoperational, the resulting damage to traditional health care services may be severe, particularly for critical care delivery and other important services that RVC cannot effectively replace. Our results have implications for public policy decisions such as incentive-aligned models, policy-initiated incentives, and payer-based strategies for improved alignment between RVC and existing models.","output":"Impact of Remote and Virtual Care Models on the Sustainability of Small Health Care Businesses: Perceptual Analysis of Small Clinics, Physician Offices, and Pharmacies in Colorado"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Airborne/droplet infection is caused by infected agents in the air around a person.

Untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) can worsen AHRF, and the use of positive airway pressure (PAP) leads to improvement in these selected patients. Obtaining inpatient sleep testing for qualification of ambulatory PAP therapy is challenging. We report the successful use of home sleep testing (i.e. WatchPAT?) in the hospital setting for a patient with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and undiagnosed severe OSA. Case A 32-year-old woman with medical history of morbid obesity (BMI 51) presented with hypoxia secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia. Initial oxygen saturation was 88% on room air, and chest radiograph showed bilateral patchy infiltrates and consolidations. On admission, she was treated with IV remdesivir, dexamethasone, azithromycin, and IV ceftriaxone. Overnight, supplemental oxygen requirements escalated to 10 liters per minute via nasal pendent, and she was transferred to the ICU. Given her body habitus and nocturnal desaturations, co-existing OSA was suspected, and the patient was empirically started on auto-titrating continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with inline oxygen supplementation. This resulted in improvement in her oxygen desaturations, and she was transferred out of the ICU the next day. Subsequently, a portable home sleep apnea test (i.e. WatchPAT?) was performed, showing an elevated AHI of 31.4/hour, and confirming a severe OSA diagnosis. The patient was prescribed home-going CPAP and discharged home without supplemental oxygen. At her two-month follow-up visit, the patient had a residual AHI of 0.3. Discussion In our patient with increased risk for sleep-disordered breathing, CPAP use with inline oxygen supplementation before trial of HFNC stabilized her respiratory status and shortened her intensive care stay. Performing a portable sleep study in the hospital expedited this patient's workup and facilitated the immediate ambulatory treatment of her underlying sleep-disordered breathing. Without initiation of this treatment in the hospital and during her recovery at home, this patient's severe untreated OSA would likely have prolonged her hospital course and negatively influenced her recovery. Portable sleep studies are an accurate tool to diagnose sleep apnea in selected hospitalized patients and lead to earlier treatment initiation compared to outpatient in-lab polysomnography, especially for COVID-19 patients where safety regulations might prohibit their presence in the lab. Utilizing a portable sleep study in the hospital setting for COVID-19 positive patients can be an efficient and effective intervention, as shown in our unique case.","output":"Use of Portable Sleep Testing to Diagnose Obstructive Sleep Apnea in a Patient with Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia and Worsening Nocturnal Hypoxemia, an Individualized Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Deep understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 effects on host molecular pathways is paramount for the discovery of early biomarkers of outcome of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the identification of novel therapeutic targets.

While there is a well developed body of literature for clustering of time series, these approaches tend to generate clusters independently of model training which can lead to poor model fit. We propose a novel distributed approach that simultaneously clusters and fits autoregression models for groups of similar individuals. We apply a Wishart mixture model so as to cluster individuals while modeling the corresponding autocovariance matrices at the same time. The fitted Wishart scale matrices map to cluster-level autoregressive coefficients through the Yule-Walker equations, fitting robust parsimonious autoregressive mixture models. This approach is able to discern differences in underlying autocorrelation variation of time series in settings with large heterogeneous datasets. We prove consistency of our cluster membership estimator, asymptotic distributions of coefficients and compare our approach against competing methods through simulation as well as by fitting a COVID-19 forecast model.","output":"Autoregressive Mixture Models for Serial Correlation Clustering of Time Series Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Video game addiction in young children is relevant, but it is especially important for children with ADHD.

The authors assessed students' reactions and comparative performance. Materials and Methods: OSCE and telehealth educators used draft Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) telehealth competencies to create educational materials and adapt OSCE cases. Students anonymously answered queries about the challenges of the telehealth encounters, confidence in basic telehealth competencies, and educational value of the experience. Cohort-level performance data were compared between the January in-person and June telehealth OSCEs. Results: One hundred sixty students participated in 29 Zoom? two-case telehealth OSCEs, equaling 58 h of assessment time. Survey response rate: 59%.

This longitudinal study evaluates anti-RBD and neutralizing antibody (NAb) response to COVID-19 vaccines in patients on treatment and post stem cell transplant (SCT).Methods: For mRNA vaccines, anti-RBD and NAb were assessed before vaccination (T0), prior to 2nd dose (T1), 1 month after the 2nd dose (T2), and 3 months after the 2nd dose (T3). For J&J, T1 was 1 month, T2, 2 months and T3, 4 months after vaccine. Primary objective was GMTs of anti-RDB and NAb (%) at above timepoints. Other objectives were a) proportion of patients with anti-RBD 100 U/mL, b) correlation between anti-RBD and NAb, c) antibody responses of the 2 mRNA vaccines, and d) anti-RBD in breakthrough COVID-19 cases.Findings: Between 3/2/2021 and 7/30/2021, 438 cancer patients were enrolled. 108 (25%) were post-SCT and 330 (75%) on treatment: 176 (40%) on chemotherapy (C), 21 (5%) on chemoimmunotherapy (C+I), 72 (19%) on immunotherapy (I), and 58 (13%) on targeted oral agents (TOA). 60 % received Pfizer, 36 % Moderna, and 4% J&J. 1182% of patients had anti-RBD 100 U/mL at T0, 2515% at T1, 7544 % at T2, and 8138% at T3. At T3, 8491% of patients on C, 8189% on C+I, 8667% on I, 7818% post-SCT, and 7750% on TOA had anti-RBD  100 U/mL. GMTs were 159 at T0, 1291 at T1, 4808 at T2 and 4391 at T3. Neutralization (30%) was observed in 1471%, 3889%, 8056% and 8133% of patients at T0, T1, T2, and T3. There was no difference between the mRNA vaccines. Five patients had breakthrough infection. Four with anti-RBD available had pre-infection anti-RBD <100 U/mL. Interpretation: Four months after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, ~ 80% of patients on cancer therapy or post-SCT have anti-RBD 100 U/mL and 30% NAb.

Crude case fatality ratio (CFR) with dividing the number of known deaths by the number of confirmed cases does not represent the true CFR and might be off by orders of magnitude. We aim to provide a precise estimate of the CFR of COVID-19 using statistical models at the early stage of the epidemic. Methods: We extracted data from the daily released epidemic report published by the National Health Commission P. R. China from 20 Jan 2020, to 1 March 2020. Competing risk model was used to obtain the cumulative hazards for death, cure, and cure-death hazard ratio. Then the CFR was estimated based on the slope of the last piece in joinpoint regression model, which reflected the most recent trend of the epidemic. Results: As of 1 March 2020, totally 80,369 cases were diagnosed as COVID-19 in China. The CFR of COVID-19 were estimated to be 70.9% (95% CI: 66.8%-75.6%) during Jan 20-Feb 2, 20.2% (18.6%-22.1%) during Feb 3-14, 6.9% (6.4%-7.4%) during Feb 15-23, 1.5% (1.4%-1.6%) during Feb 24-March 1 in Hubei province, and 20.3% (17.0%-25.3%) during Jan 20-28, 1.9% (1.8%-2.1%) during Jan 29-Feb 12, 0.9% (0.8%-1.1%) during Feb 13-18, 0.4% (0.4%-0.5%) during Feb 19-March 1 in other areas of China, respectively. Conclusions: Based on analyses of public data, we found that the CFR in Hubei was much higher than that of other regions in China, over 3 times in all estimation. The CFR would follow a downwards trend based on our estimation from recently released data. Nevertheless, at early stage of outbreak, CFR estimates should be viewed cautiously because of limited data source on true onset and recovery time.","output":"Estimating the case fatality ratio of the COVID-19 epidemic in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which is a novel human coronavirus strain (HCoV) was initially reported in December 2019 in Wuhan City, China.

We randomized and assigned patients to the development and validation groups at a 70% to 30% ratio. Each point scored for selected risk factors helped build a new mortality scoring system using Cox regression analysis. We evaluated the accuracy of the new scoring system in the development and validation groups using the area under the curve. RESULTS: The development group included 1232 patients, whereas the validation group included 528 patients. In the development group, predictors for the new scoring system as selected by Cox proportional hazards model were age 70 years, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, dementia, C-reactive protein levels >4 mg/dL, infiltration on chest X-rays at the initial diagnosis, and the need for oxygen support on admission.

In this study, we reported the safety and immunogenicity of a heterologous boost with a recombinant COVID-19 vaccine (CHO cells), named NVSI-06-07, as a third dose in participants who have previously received two doses of the inactivated vaccine (BBIBP-CorV) at pre-specified time intervals. Using homologous boost with BBIBP-CorV as control, the safety and immunogenicity of the heterologous boost with NVSI-06-07 against various SARS-CoV-2 strains, including Omicron, were characterized. MethodsThis study is a single-center, randomised, double-blinded, controlled phase 2 trial for heterologous boost of NVSI-06-07 in BBIBP-CorV recipients from the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Healthy adults (aged []18 years) were enrolled and grouped by the specified prior vaccination interval of BBIBP-CorV, i.e., 1-3 months, 4-6 months or []6 months, respectively, with 600 individuals per group. For each group, participants were randomly assigned at 1:1 ratio to receive either a heterologous boost of NVSI-06-07 or a homologous booster dose of BBIBP-CorV. The primary outcome was to comparatively assess the immunogenicity between heterologous and homologous boosts at 14 and 28 days post-boosting immunization, by evaluation of the geometric mean titers (GMTs) of IgG and neutralizing antibodies as well as the corresponding seroconversion rate ([]4-fold rise in antibody titers). The secondary outcomes were the safety profile of the boosting strategies within 30 days post vaccination. The exploratory outcome was the immune efficacy against Omicron and other variants of concern (VOCs) of SARS-CoV-2. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05033847. FindingsA total of 1800 individuals who have received two doses of BBIBP-CorV were enrolled, of which 899 participants received a heterologous boost of NVSI-06-07 and 901 received a homologous boost for comparison. No vaccine-related serious adverse event (SAE) and no adverse events of special interest (AESI) were reported. 184 (20{middle dot}47%) participants in the heterologous boost groups and 177 (19{middle dot}64%) in the homologous boost groups reported at least one adverse reaction within 30 days. Most of the local and systemic adverse reactions reported were grades 1 (mild) or 2 (moderate), and there was no significant difference in the overall safety between heterologous and homologous boosts. Immunogenicity assays showed that the seroconversion rates in neutralizing antibodies against prototype SARS-CoV-2 elicited by heterologous boost were 89{middle dot}96% - 97{middle dot}52% on day 28 post-boosting vaccination, which was much higher than what was induced by homologous boost (36{middle dot}80% - 81{middle dot}75%). Similarly, in heterologous NVSI-06-07 booster groups, the neutralizing geometric mean titers (GMTs) against the prototype strain increased by 21{middle dot}01 - 63{middle dot}85 folds from baseline to 28 days post-boosting vaccination, whereas only 4{middle dot}20 - 16{middle dot}78 folds of increases were observed in homologous BBIBP-CorV booster group. For Omicron variant, the neutralizing antibody GMT elicited by the homologous boost of BBIBP-CorV was 37{middle dot}91 (95%CI, 30{middle dot}35-47{middle dot}35), however, a significantly higher level of neutralizing antibodies with GMT 292{middle dot}53 (95%CI, 222{middle dot}81-384{middle dot}07) was induced by the heterologous boost of NVSI-06-07, suggesting that it may serve as an effective boosting strategy combating the pandemic of Omicron. The similar results were obtained for other VOCs, including Alpha, Beta and Delta, in which the neutralizing response elicited by the heterologous boost was also significantly greater than that of the homologous boost. In the participants primed with BBIBP-CorV over 6 months, the largest increase in the neutralizing GMTs was obtained both in the heterologous and homologous boost groups, and thus the booster vaccination with over 6 months intervals was optimal. InterpretationOur findings indicated that the heterologous boost with NVSI-06-07 was safe, well-tolerated and immunogenic in adults primed with a full regimen of BBIBP-CorV. Compared to homologous boost with a third dose of BBIBP-CorV, incremental increases in immune responses were achieved by the heterologous boost with NVSI-06-07 against SARS-CoV-2 prototype strain, Omicron variant, and other VOCs. The heterologous BBIBP-CorV/NVSI-06-07 prime-boosting vaccination may be valuable in preventing the pandemic of Omicron. The optimal booster strategy was the heterologous boost with NVSI-06-07 over 6 months after a priming with two doses of BBIBP-CorV. Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for clinical trials or prospective/cohort studies involving heterologous booster vaccination in non-immunocompromised population published up to Dec 25, 2021, using the term \\"(COVID) AND (vaccin*) AND (clinical trial OR cohort OR prospective) AND (heterologous) AND (booster OR prime-boost OR third dose)\\" with no language restrictions. Nine studies of heterologous prime-boost vaccinations with adenovirus-vector vaccines (ChAdOx1 nCov-19, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Ad26.COV2.S, Janssen) and mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2, Pfizer-BioNtech; mRNA1273, Moderna) were identified. The adenovirus-vector and mRNA heterologous prime-boost vaccination was found to be well tolerated and immunogenic. In individuals primed with adenovirus-vector vaccine, mRNA booster vaccination led to greater immune response than homologous boost. However, varied results were obtained on whether heterologous boost was immunogenically superior to the homologous mRNA prime-boost vaccination. Besides that, A preprint trial in population previously immunized with inactivated vaccines (CoronaVac, Sinovac Biotech) showed that the heterologous boost with adenovirus-vector vaccine (Convidecia, CanSino Biologicals) was safe and induced higher level of live-virus neutralizing antibodies than by the homogeneous boost. A pilot study reported that boosting with BNT162b2 in individuals primed with two doses of inactivated vaccines (BBIBP-CorV) was significantly more immunogenic than homologous vaccination with two-dose of BNT162b2. In addition, a preprint paper demonstrated that heterologous boost of ZF2001, a recombinant protein subunit vaccine, after CoronaVac or BBIBP-CorV vaccination potently improved the immunogenicity. But only a small size of samples was tested in this study and the live-virus neutralization was not detected. Till now, it is still lacking a formal clinical trial to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the heterologous prime-boost vaccination with an inactivated vaccine followed by a recombinant protein subunit-based vaccine. Added value of this studyTo our knowledge, this is the first reported result of a large-scale randomised, controlled clinical trial of heterologous prime-boost vaccination with an inactivated vaccine followed by a recombinant protein subunit vaccine. This trial demonstrated that the heterologous prime-booster vaccination with BBIBP-CorV/NVSI-06-07 is safe and immunogenic. Its immunoreactivity is similar to that of homologous vaccination with BBIBP-CorV. Compared to homologous boost, heterologous boost with NVSI-06-07 in BBIBP-CorV recipients elicited significantly higher immunogenicity not only against the SARS-CoV-2 prototype strain but also against Omicron and other variants of concern (VOCs). Implications of all the available evidenceBooster vaccination is considered an effective strategy to improve the protection efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines and control the epidemic waves of SARS-CoV-2. Data from our trial suggested that the booster vaccination of NVSI-06-07 in BBIBP-CorV recipients significantly improved the immune responses against various SARS-CoV-2 strains, including Omicron. Due to no Omicron-specific vaccine available currently, the BBIBP-CorV/NVSI-06-07 heterologous prime-boost might serve as an effective strategy combating Omicron variant. Besides that, BBIBP-CorV has been widely inoculated in population, and thus further boosting vaccination with NVSI-06-07 is valuable in preventing the COVID-19 pandemic. But further studies are needed to assess the long-term protection of BBIBP-CorV/NVSI-06-07 prime-booster vaccination.","output":"Safety and immunogenicity of a heterologous boost with a recombinant vaccine, NVSI-06-07, in the inactivated vaccine recipients from UAE: a phase 2 randomised, double-blinded, controlled clinical trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In his second week of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) illness, a patient developed an unusually complicated course of acute coronary syndrome.

Donor-derived cell-free DNA (-cfDNA) is increasingly recognized as a valuable biomarker for acute transplant injury, with possible indications in the detection of cellular or humoral rejection and the guidance of immunosuppressive therapy. There is an ongoing debate on whether relative or absolute quantification of -cfDNA is more reliable for the detection of acute transplant injury. METHODS. We retrospectively reviewed all 22 kidney transplant recipients who underwent -cfDNA measurements (percentage and absolute) between April 2020 and April 2021 at our institution. Of these, 9 (41%) showed discrepancies between absolute (cutoff: 50 copies/mL) and relative (cutoff: 0.5%) quantification in at least 1 -cfDNA measurement. RESULTS. We report on 9 of 22 cases with discrepancies in relative and absolute quantification of -cfDNA, which were predominantly late posttransplant patients. We found bacterial and viral infections, as well as low leukocyte count from chronic myeloid leukaemia treatment, to be reasons for variability in total cell-free DNA (cfDNA), leading to inter- and intraindividual variability in relative -cfDNA quantification. When correlating -cfDNA quantification and biopsy results, as well as clinical course, our data indicate that relying solely on relative -cfDNA can lead to false-negative and false-positive results. CONCLUSIONS. In summary, these cases argue that absolute quantification of -cfDNA is better suited in patients with underlying conditions affecting total cfDNA levels and suggest using both absolute and relative -cfDNA together for higher reliability and interindividual comparability in the clinical setting. Especially for patients with chronic active antibodyCmediated rejection, further studies on the use of -cfDNA are desirable.","output":"Absolute or Relative Quantification of Donor-derived Cell-free DNA in Kidney Transplant Recipients: Case Series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Thanks to artificial intelligence, chatbots have been applied to many consumer-facing applications, especially to online travel agencies (OTAs).

In addition, the recent COVID-19 outbreak has been creating challenges for various countries and their respective health care organizations in managing and controlling the pandemic. One of the most important observations during the recent outbreak is the lack of effective eHealth frameworks for managing and controlling pandemics. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are to review the current National eHealth Strategy of Saudi Arabia and to propose an integrated eHealth framework that can be effective for managing health care operations and services during pandemics. METHODS: A questionnaire-based survey was administered to 316 health care professionals to review the current national eHealth framework of Saudi Arabia and identify the objectives, factors, and components that are key for managing and controlling pandemics. Purposive sampling was used to collect responses from diverse experts, including physicians, technical experts, nurses, administrative experts, and pharmacists. The survey was administered at five hospitals in Saudi Arabia by forwarding the survey link using a web-based portal. A sample population of 350 was achieved, which was filtered to exclude incomplete and ineligible samples, giving a sample of 316 participants. RESULTS: Of the 316 participants, 187 (59.2%) found the current eHealth framework to be ineffective, and more than 50% of the total participants stated that the framework lacked some essential components and objectives. Additional components and objectives focusing on using eHealth for managing information, creating awareness, increasing accessibility and reachability, promoting self-management and self-collaboration, promoting electronic services, and extensive stakeholder engagement were considered to be the most important factors by more than 80% of the total participants. CONCLUSIONS: Managing pandemics requires an effective and efficient eHealth framework that can be used to manage various health care services by integrating different eHealth components and collaborating with all stakeholders.","output":"Applying eHealth for Pandemic Management in Saudi Arabia in the Context of COVID-19: Survey Study and Framework Proposal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the study was to examine the prevalence of suicide thoughts and attempts during the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak and examine pandemic-related factors associated with suicide thoughts in the general Norwegian population.

This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in fecal specimens of these patients according to their clinical characteristics. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and three Chinese biomedical databases were searched up to 25 March, 2020 with no language restriction. We included original observational studies that reported the detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in fecal specimens of COVID-19 patients. Two separate reviewers conducted the review. Metaprop was adopted to conduct a meta-analysis of prevalence with variances stabilized by Freeman-Tukey Double Arcsine Transformation. A random-effects model was used. Heterogeneity across different studies was computed using Cochran's Q test and chi square statistics. RESULTS: From 17 studies, the pooled detection rate of fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA was 43.7% (95% CI 32.6%-55.0%) and 33.7% (95% C.I. 33.7%, 95% C.I. 20.1%-48.8%) by patient and number of specimens as a unit count, respectively. Female individuals (59.6% vs. 53.5%), those who presented with gastrointestinal symptoms (77.1% vs. 57.7%), and patients with more severe disease (68.3% vs. 34.6%) tended to have a higher detection rate. DISCUSSION: A significant proportion of COVID-19 patients carry SARS-CoV-2 in their intestinal tract. Feces being a self-collected specimen bears a potential to improve case identification in community, especially for young children where proper respiratory sampling at home is difficult. Specific infection control strategies focusing on spread via fecal contamination and faulty toilet drainage are urgently needed.","output":"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in fecal specimens of patients with confirmed COVID-19: a meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wirtschaftsaufschwung, Korruptionsbek?mpfung und eine eiserne Hand gegen Gewaltkriminalit?t hat Jair Bolsonaro im Wahlkampf versprochen - heute bilden sie die schwachen Flanken des Pr?sidenten: Brasilien ist ein Epizentrum der Covid?19-Pandemie geworden.

In very different ways, the immune and taste systems both fulfill this function, with growing evidence suggesting a relationship between the two, through shared signaling pathways, receptors, and feedback loops. The purpose of this review was to explore recent reports on taste and immunity in model animals and in humans to explore our understanding of the interplay between these systems. RECENT FINDINGS: Acute infections in the upper airway, as with SARS-CoV-2, are associated with a proinflammatory state, and blunted taste perception. Further, recent findings highlight taste receptors working as immune sentinels throughout the body. Work in humans and mice also points to inflammation from obesity impacting taste, altering taste bud abundance and composition. There is accumulating evidence that taste cells, and particularly their receptors, play a role in airway and gut immunity, responsive to invading organisms.

Venous blood was drawn before the first vaccine dose, immediately before the second vaccine dose, and then at 1, 3 and 6 months after the second vaccine dose. Serological testing employed the total antiSARS-CoV-2 antibodies measurement with Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S chemiluminescent immunoassay. RESULTS: The median serum levels of total anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies reached the peak (1762 kU/L) 1 month after the second vaccine dose, but tended to progressively decline at the 3-month (1086 kU/L) and 6-month (802 kU/L) follow-up points.

PURPOSE: Hematology/oncology clinical pharmacists' work activities have been described in previous literature, but time spent on pharmacist tasks has not been well characterized. Random work sampling (WS) is a form of activity assessment to determine the proportion of time spent in various types of work. Based on results from previous WS evaluations at University of Utah and its Huntsman Cancer Hospital, activities were changed to maximize time dedicated to clinical activities and pharmacists' benefit to providers and patients in both inpatient and ambulatory care settings. Therefore, updated random WS evaluations were completed during spring 2019 and fall 2020. METHODS: Personal digital assistant (PDA) devices were used to record hematology/oncology clinical pharmacists' onsite or remote location and work activity data. Data were collected 8 times per hour on weekdays, with a goal of 275 observations per pharmacist. Results were then classified as clinical, professional, or technical activities. RESULTS: In 2019, 9,079 observations were recorded by 31 onsite pharmacists. In 2020, 28 pharmacists recorded 8,803 observations (5,524 during onsite work and 3,279 during remote work). The overall distribution of pharmacists' work activities remained stable between 2019 and 2020, with 89% of activities classified as clinical or professional. Pharmacists spent a smaller proportion of time on in-person communication in 2020, balanced by increases in chart review and text-based communication. Onsite pharmacists reported a larger proportion of clinical activities, while remote pharmacists reported a larger proportion of professional activities. CONCLUSION: Continued WS assessment of work activity patterns will allow identification of opportunities to streamline workflows, maximize pharmacist engagement in clinical activities, and development of remote work policy.","output":"Evaluating hematology/oncology clinical pharmacist activities via self-reported work sampling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to gain a deeper understanding of the recently emerged and highly divergent Omicron variant of concern (VoC), a study of amino acid substitution (AAS) patterns was performed and compared with those of the other four successful variants of concern (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta) and one closely related variant of interest (VoILambda). The Spike ORF consistently emerges as an AAS hotspot in all six lineages, but in Omicron this enrichment is significantly higher. The progenitors of each of these VoC/VoI lineages underwent positive selection in the Spike ORF. However, once they were established, their Spike ORFs have been undergoing purifying selection, despite the application of global vaccination schemes from 2021 onwards. Our analyses reject the hypothesis that the heavily mutated receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Omicron Spike was introduced via recombination from another closely related Sarbecovirus. Thus, successive point mutations appear as the most parsimonious scenario. Intriguingly, in each of the six lineages, we observed a significant number of AAS wherein the new residue is not present at any homologous site among the other known Sarbecoviruses. Such AAS should be further investigated as potential adaptations to the human host. By studying the phylogenetic distribution of AAS shared between the six lineages, we observed that the Omicron (BA.1) lineage had the highest number (8/10) of recurrent mutations.","output":"Comparative Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern, Including Omicron, Highlights Their Common and Distinctive Amino Acid Substitution Patterns, Especially at the Spike ORF"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory, gastrointestinal and skin diseases represent the most common diseases in infants and young children. Causal factors of these diseases are important infectious agents and causes of pathological conditions in children, but they are also very important for their parents, as well as for people in their close environment. Greater incidence of infections in infants and young children can be explained in different ways. A cause can be insufficient maturity of their immune system, but also their exposure to infections within collective accommodations (cribs, nurseries, pre-school institutions), where they are, at the same time, exposed to a number of unknown agents. Today, a great emphasis is devoted to the ways and kinds of children's nutrition. The problem of relation between infected young organism and infectious agent itself, is also reflected in a long resistance and excretion of microorganisms in their exterior environment. It is well-known that microorganisms resist and excrete much longer in younger organisms, compared to adults, where their resistance and excretion is much shorter or very rare. Actually, adults have already formed protective immunity against particular infectious agents. It doesn't prevent infections in adults, colonization of pathogens, nor eventual development of disease. Established immunity can shorten the time necessary for excretion of microorganisms in their exterior environment and, if disease gets developed, it is of shorter duration and slower progress.","output":"Causal factors of acute gastroenteritis in infants and young children."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Intensive care unit (ICU) complications affect outcomes but it remains unknown if the diaphragm thickness affects rehabilitation outcomes after ICU. We conducted a pilot study to evaluate the effect of diaphragm thickness on rehabilitation outcomes of post-ICU patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) and to evaluate factors that may be associated with diaphragm atrophy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-one patients (26 SCI, 25 TBI) who admitted to the rehabilitation clinic from the ICU included in this study. All demographic data were recorded. All participants underwent diaphragmatic ultrasonography evaluation before and after 12 weeks of neurologic rehabilitation program. The diaphragm thickness and outcome parameters were compared in all patient groups and in each patient subgroups. Evaluation parameters of patients before and after treatment were compared in patient subgroups. RESULTS: Diaphragm atrophy was found in 14 patients (64%) in TBI group and 12 patients (46%) in SCI group. The diaphragm thickness negatively correlated with the ICU length of stay and positively correlated with the before/after rehabilitation functional scores and the change in functional independence measure scores (p < 0.05). According to the regression analysis; the change in functional independence measure scores was found to be affected by the diaphragm thickness (p < 0.05).

OBJECTIVES: The objectives were the creation of a risk assessment score for pulmonary sequelae at high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) through the assessment of laboratory data, lung function, and radiological changes in patients after the onset of COVID-19 interstitial pneumonia and the identification of predictive factors. METHODS: We enrolled 121 subjects hospitalized due to COVID-19 pneumonia in our study. Clinical features, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score, HRCT score, and blood chemistry data at hospital admission, as well as HRCT score, pulmonary function testing values, exercise capacity by means of a 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), and dyspnea perception by the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) at 4-month follow-up, were all recorded. The variables were elaborated in order to create a predictive model to identify patients at high risk of pulmonary sequelae at HRCT. RESULTS: At the time of follow-up visit, 63% of patients had functional abnormality (diffusion lung capacity and/or total lung capacity <80% of predicted). Age, BMI, CCI, D-dimer, 6MWT, and mMRC were included in the COVID-19 Sequelae Score (COSeSco, ranging 0C15), which was able to individuate COVID-19 patients with radiologic sequelae (HRCT score >10%) at follow-up. The most revelatory COSeSco value that was found to intercept the highest sensitivity (100%) and specificity (77%) was 2.

METHODS: A rapid review was undertaken in PubMed, Europe PubMed Central and EMBASE from 1 January 2020 to 26 August 2020. RESULTS: We identified 15 relevant studies, including 13 virus culture and 2 contact tracing studies. For 5 virus culture studies, the last day on which SARS-CoV-2 was isolated occurred within 10 days of symptom onset. For another 5 studies, SARS-CoV-2 was isolated beyond day 10 for approximately 3% of included patients. The remaining 3 virus culture studies included patients with severe or critical disease; SARS-CoV-2 was isolated up to day 32 in one study. Two studies identified immunocompromised patients from whom SARS-CoV-2 was isolated for up to 20 days. Both contact tracing studies, when close contacts were first exposed greater than 5 days after symptom onset in the index case, found no evidence of laboratory-confirmed onward transmission of SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients with mild-to-moderate illness are highly unlikely to be infectious beyond 10 days of symptoms.

They incorporate important mental readiness concepts at its core with an appropriate balance of operational readiness (i.e., technical, physical, mental readiness). The aim of this exploratory study was to investigate the importance of mental readiness for optimal performance in the daily challenges faced by dentists using an Operational Readiness Framework. One-on-one interviews were conducted with a select group of seasoned dentists to determine their mental readiness before, during and after successfully performing in challenging situations. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of mental readiness were applied. Study findings were compared with a Wheel of Excellence based on results from other high-performance domains such as surgery, policing, social services and Olympic athletics. The analysis revealed that specific mental practices are required to achieve peak performance, and the balance between physical, technical and mental readiness underpins these dentists competency. Common elements of success were foundcommitment, confidence, visualization, mental preparation, focus, distraction control, and evaluation and coping. This exploration confirmed many similarities in mental readiness practices engaged across high-risk professions. Universities, clinics and hospitals are looking for innovative ways to build teamwork and capacity through inter-professional collaboration. Results from these case studies warrant further investigation and may be significant enough to stimulate innovative curriculum design.

Ten NoV genogroups have been reported so far. Of these, genogroup II (GII) is the most prevalent, and it causes serious infections worldwide. The complete genome sequences of NoV GII isolates from different geographical regions were retrieved from the public database. The model-based clustering approach, implemented in the STRUCTURE resource, was employed for assessment of genetic composition. The MEGA X and IQ Tree tools were used for phylogenetic analysis. Genome-wide natural selection analysis was performed using maximum-likelihood-based methods. The demographic features of NoV GII genome sequences were assessed using the BEAST package. All of the NoV GII sequences initially clustered into two main subpopulations at significant K = 2, where the genotype GII.4 samples clearly split from the rest of the genotypes. This indicates a marked genetic distinction between norovirus GII.4 and non-GII.4 samples. Phylogenetic analysis showed the presence of five distinct subclades for genotype GII.2 and seven subclades for GII.4 samples. Several isolates with admixed ancestry were identified that constituted distinct subclusters in the phylogenetic tree. No continental-specific genetic distinctions were observed among the NoV GII samples. Significant genomic signatures of both positive and negative natural selection were identified across the NoV GII genes. A differential pattern of positive selection signals was inferred between the GII.4 and non-GII.4 genotypes. The demographic analysis revealed an increase in the effective population size of NoV GII during 2009-2010, followed by a rapid fall in 2015.

Self-reported race and ethnicity were extracted from electronic health records. Weighted analyses were used to evaluate the association between racial and ethnic category and prenatal depression and anxiety; the prevalence of each stressor by race and ethnicity; and the relationship between each stressor and prenatal depression and anxiety in each racial and ethnic category. RESULTS: The sample was 22% Asian, 3% Black, 20% Hispanic, 5% Other/Multiracial/Unknown, and 49% White. Compared to White people, Black and Hispanic people had a higher prevalence of prenatal depression (aPR: 1.85, 95% CI: 1.45, 2.35 and aPR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.37, respectively) and anxiety (aPR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.34, 2.18 and aPR: 1.10, 95% CI: 0.94, 1.29, respectively). Compared to White people, Black and Hispanic people had a higher prevalence of moderate/severe distress due to changes in prenatal care (24 vs. 34 and 31%), and food insecurity (9 vs. 31 and 24%). Among Black and Hispanic people, distress due to changes in prenatal care was associated with a greater prevalence of prenatal depression (aPR: 2.27, 95% CI: 1.41, 3.64 and aPR: 2.76, 95% CI: 2.12, 3.58, respectively) and prenatal anxiety (aPR: 3.00, 95% CI: 1.85, 4.84 and aPR: 2.82, 95% CI: 2.15, 3.71, respectively).

CONCLUSIONS: This study identified racial and ethnic disparities in mental health for pregnant Black and Hispanic people. Distress due to prenatal care changes contributed to the observed disparities in prenatal depression and anxiety for Black and Hispanic people and food insecurity additionally contributed to the observed disparities for Hispanic people. Addressing distress due to changes to prenatal care and food insecurity specifically in Black and Hispanic people may help reduce the high burden of poor mental health and reduce observed disparities in these communities.","output":"Contributions of COVID-19 Pandemic-Related Stressors to Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Mental Health During Pregnancy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global confrontation with COVID-19 has not only diverted current healthcare resources to deal with the infection but has also resulted in increased resources in the areas of testing and screening, as well as educating most of the global public of the benefits of vaccination.

The hospitalized children under 18 years old who met the criteria for CAP were enrolled. The throat swabs or nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were collected which were then screened 18 respiratory viruses using multiplex PCR assay. Viral pathogens were present in 56.6% (1539/2721) of the enrolled cases, with the detection rate of single virus in 39.8% of the cases and multiple viruses in 16.8% of the cases.

Methods: We reported on 90 COVID-19 and 130 non-COVID-19 ALI patients in the ICUs of multiple centers. Demographic data, medical histories, laboratory findings, and radiological images were analyzed and compared between the two cohorts and within each cohort between survivors and non-survivors. For ALI survivors, clinical characteristics before and after treatment were also compared. Findings: Aberrations in blood parameters, such as leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and thrombocytopenia, were observed in both cohorts. More characteristic abnormalities, including significantly higher red cell distribution width (RDW), C-reactive proteins, and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) but lower troponin (TnT) and procalcitonin, were observed in the COVID-19 cohort than in the non-COVID-19 cohort, whereas D-dimer levels showed a similar elevation in both cohorts. The COVID-19 cohort also showed more diversified CT patterns where severe features such as consolidations and crazy paving patterns were more frequently observed. Multivariate analysis indicated that age, fever symptom, prothrombin time, procalcitonin, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, oxygenated hemoglobin, and crazy paving patterns in CT scans were independent risk factors associated with COVID-19. Interpretation: Comparison of ALI characteristics between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients in the ICU setting provided insight into the pathogenesis of ALI induced by different risk factors, suggesting distinct treatment plans.","output":"Comparative Study of Acute Lung Injury in COVID-19 and Non-COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to unprecedented worries and challenges for pregnant women due to social restrictions and changes in maternity care provision. We aimed to investigate the mental health impact of COVID-19 pandemic on pregnant women in Sweden and explore factors associated with poor perinatal mental health in this specific context. METHOD: This was a nation-wide cross-sectional survey of pregnant women living in Sweden. Validated questionnaires were distributed through non-profit organizations websites and social media channels from May 2020 to February 2021. Perinatal depression, anxiety, and acute stress reaction were assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Impact Event Scale (Revised) (IES-R), respectively. Sociodemographic characteristics and self-perceived mental well-being were also obtained. Factors associated with mental health outcomes were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression model. RESULTS: Among a total of 470 participants, 43.2% (n = 203) reported depression (EPDS 13), 25.7% (n = 121) moderate to severe anxiety (GAD-7 score  10), and 23.7% (n = 110) moderate to severe acute stress reaction (IES-R  33). 27.4% participants (n = 129) expressed concerns regarding their mental well-being during the pandemic. Pregnant mothers who had sick family members reported poorer mental health outcomes than those who did not (median [Interquartile range (IQR)] EPDS scores: 14.0 [8.75C18.0] vs 11.0 [6.25C15.0], p < .001; median (IQR) GAD7 scores: 7.0 [4.0C12.25] vs 6.0 [3.0C9.0], p = .003); median (IQR) IES-R scores: 20.0 [9.0C38.0] vs 15.0 [7.0C30.0], p = .048). Logistic regression analyses revealed that risk factors for poor mental health outcomes were having a sick family member with any illness, unemployment, and experiencing a substantially stressful life event. Having a higher educational level and a younger age during the pandemic were protective. CONCLUSION: Depression and anxiety were highly prevalent among pregnant women in Sweden during the COVID-19 pandemic, indicating a need for professional mental health support for this vulnerable group of population. Unemployment was an associated risk factor whereas younger age and higher educational level were protective suggesting an important role of socio-economic factors in modulating the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on perinatal mental health.

Disruption in care may be a barrier to identifying COVID-19 associated sequelae, such as mental health symptoms, among the immunocompromised. Our objectives were to evaluate COVID-19-related preventive behaviors, with a focus on canceling doctor's appointments as a proxy for continuity of care, and to compare COVID-19-related mental health symptoms among the immunocompromised with the general population. We used nationally-representative data of 10,760 U.S. adults from the publicly-available COVID-19 Household Impact Survey. We defined immunocompromised as adults with a self-reported diagnosis of \\"a compromised immune system\\" (n = 854, 7.6%). We adherence to self-reported COVID-19 preventive behaviors among immunocompromised adults to others using &#967;2-tests. We focused on continuity of care and estimated determinants of canceling doctor's appointments among the immunocompromised using multivariable Poisson regression to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). We evaluated associations of mental health symptoms with being immunocompromised using multinomial logistic regression and estimated conditional odds ratios (cOR) with 95% CIs. Immunocompromised adults were more likely to adhere to recommended COVID-19 preventive behaviors, including washing or sanitizing hands (96.3% vs. 89.8%, &#967;2 <0.001), maintaining social distance (91.9% vs. 83.7%, &#967;2 <0.001), and canceling a doctor's appointment (47.1% vs. 29.7%, &#967;2 <0.001). Hispanic immunocompromised adults (aPR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.12-1.92) and immunocompromised women (aPR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.00-1.56) were more likely to cancel doctor's appointments compared to non-Hispanic White immunocompromised adults and men, respectively.

The prognosis of disease varies depending on patients specialties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation of CBC parameters and ferritin levels at the time of diagnosis with the prognosis of patients hospitalized due to COVID 19. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, 1320 patients hospitalized at the Aksaray University Training and Research Hospital between July 2020 and December 2020 were evaluated. Results: All of the patients were hospitalized because of symptoms associated with COVID 19. There were 688 males and 632 females with a median age of 70 (19-98) at the time of hospitalization with COVID 19 symptoms. The median follow-up time was 7 (range, 1-57) days in hospital for all patients. Median age was significantly higher in patients who do not respond to treatment and have mortality (p<0.001). Most of the patients with mortality were males (p=0.001). There was a statistically significant difference in the parameters other than monocyte and basophil among the hemogram parameters checked at the time of presentation. Neutrophil / lymphocyte ratio was significantly higher in patients with mortality (p<0.001). Conclusion: In conclusion, this study indicates that by using the most simple and routine hematological tests at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis, it may be possible to predict a patients prognosis.

Potentially, these procedures may be useful in COVID-19 treatment. The NO level in complexes with hemoglobin in blood decreases as the gNO concentration in the gas flow produced by the Plazon system increases from 100 to 2100 ppm, so that at 2000 ppm more than one-half of the gas can be incorporated into dinitrosyl complexes formed in tissues of the lungs and respiratory tract. Thus, the effect of gNO inhalation may be similar to that observed after administration of solutions of dinitrosyl iron complexes, namely, to the presence of dinitrosyl iron complexes with thiol-containing ligands in lung and airway tissues. With regard to the hypothesis posited earlier that these complexes can suppress coronavirus replication as donors of nitrosonium cations (Biophysics 65, 818, 2020), it is not inconceivable that administration of gNO or chemically synthesized dinitrosyl iron complexes with thiol-containing ligands may help treat COVID-19. In tests on the authors of this paper as volunteers, the tolerance concentration of gNO inhaled within 15 min was approximately 2000 ppm. In tests on rats that inhaled sprayed aqueous solutions of dinitrosyl iron complexes, their tolerance dose was approximately 0.4 mmol/kg body weight.","output":"Gaseous Nitric Oxide and Dinitrosyl Iron Complexes with Thiol-Containing Ligands as Potential Medicines that Can Relieve COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of flexible capacitive pressure sensors has wide application prospects in the fields of electronic skin and intelligent wearable electronic devices, but it is still a great challenge to fabricate capacitive sensors with high sensitivity. Few reports have considered the use of interdigital electrode structures to improve the sensitivity of capacitive pressure sensors. In this work, a new strategy for the fabrication of a high-performance capacitive flexible pressure sensor based on MXene/polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) by an interdigital electrode is reported. By increasing the number of interdigital electrodes and selecting the appropriate dielectric layer, the sensitivity of the capacitive sensor can be improved. The capacitive sensor based on MXene/PVP here has a high sensitivity (~1.25 kPa(?1)), low detection limit (~0.6 Pa), wide sensing range (up to 294 kPa), fast response and recovery times (~30/15 ms) and mechanical stability of 10000 cycles. The presented sensor here can be used for various pressure detection applications, such as finger pressing, wrist pulse measuring, breathing, swallowing and speech recognition.

Already many molecular mechanisms of innate immune evasion by +ssRNA viruses have been identified. However, research addressing the effect of host innate immune evasion on the pathology caused by viral infections is less prevalent in the literature, though very relevant and interesting. Since interferons have been implicated in inflammatory diseases and immunopathology in addition to their protective role in infection, antagonizing the immune response may have an ambiguous effect on the clinical outcome of the viral disease.

METHODS We conducted a realist review and searched PubMed, Embase, Global Health, CINAHL, PsychInfo, PILOTS and grey literature through January 2022. Eligible studies included children age 6-12 years, were conducted in humanitarian contexts in low-income or middle-income countries, and focused on universal MPHSS prevention in an educational setting, using any study design. Data were extracted and analysed using narrative synthesis and realist analysis techniques to create 'context-mechanism-outcome' configurations that were iteratively developed to modify, refine and substantiate programme theories. RESULTS Twenty-seven articles, representing 19 studies, were included in the review. We analysed data from 26 articles. Eleven evidenced-informed programme theories were developed at the levels of the child (n=4), teacher (n=3), caregiver (n=2), school environment (n=1) and school managers/administrators (n=1). At the child level, mechanisms related to strengthening coping skills, emotion regulation, interpersonal relationships led to improved psychosocial well-being or learning outcomes. At the teacher level, coping skills and the provision of support to students were linked to psychosocial well-being and learning outcomes. At the caregiver level, strengthening interpersonal bonds trigger improved psychosocial well-being, and at the school environment level, fostering feelings of security was linked to psychosocial well-being and learning outcomes. We did not find any evidence supporting the programme theory at the school managers/administrators level. We found limited evidence of positive impacts of the included interventions to support these programme theories. CONCLUSIONS These programme theories are a promising start towards ensuring school-based MHPSS interventions in humanitarian contexts better address the well-being and learning needs of children.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 1029 adults recruited online through social media, website and newsletter of the Spanish Society of Community Nutrition (SENC) in a snowball procedure. The protocol used a 10-section questionnaire, including sociodemographic characteristics of participants (gender, age group, occupation), reported changes in dietary habits (22 Likert type items), and physical activity (PA), self-reported body weight and height as well as reported change in body weight. Body Mass Index (BMI) was computed to estimate prevalence of overweight (BMI  25) and obesity (BMI  30). A score of dietary change was computed compared to the Spanish Dietary Guidelines (DG) (Score  6: greater adherence to DGs). Binomial logistic regression analysis was used to explore the association between sociodemographic factors, dietary change score, change in PA, and overweight or obesity with weight gain during confinement. Responses were collected during the de-escalation phase towards the so-called new normal, June 7C26, 2020 (weeks 13C15 since COVID-19 lockdown restrictions started in Spain). RESULTS: In this study, 1029 individuals (74% female) accepted to participate and provided valid responses. 37.7% (95%CI 34.8C40.8) reported weight gain during confinement, mean weight gain 2.8  1.4 kg, significantly higher among overweight (3.1  1.5 kg) and obese (3.5  1.5 kg) subjects. Adjusted for age and occupation, increased body weight was more likely in women OR 1.50 (95%IC 1.03C2.19), overweight OR 3.12(IC95% 2.23C4.36) or obese subjects OR 3.13 (IC95% 1.89C5.18) less active than usual in confinement OR 2.16 (1.60C2.92), but less likely for those with dietary change score 6, OR 0.60 (IC95% 0.42C0.85). CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of adults in Spain reported weight gain during confinement, significantly higher in overweight subjects.

From all the strains isolated (N = 77), nine showed poor xylan-degrading activities in two semi-quantitative plate assays testing different activities for xylan degradation. Upon induction on d-xylose, transcript levels of xlnR were decreased in the xlnR-silenced strains, compared to a wild-type background. Under these conditions, the transcript levels of xyrA and xynB (two genes regulated by XlnR) were also decreased for these xlnR-silenced strains. These results indicate that the newly developed system for rapid generation of silencing vectors is an effective tool for A. niger, and this can be used to generate strains with a tailored spectrum of enzyme activities or product formation by silencing specific genes encoding, e.g., regulators such as XlnR.","output":"Efficient cloning system for construction of gene silencing vectors in Aspergillus niger"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Over the past decade, rates of drug poisoning deaths have increased dramatically in Canada. Current evidence suggests that the non-medical use of synthetic opioids, stimulants and patterns of polysubstance use are major factors contributing to this increase. METHODS: Counts of substance poisoning deaths involving alcohol, opioids, other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, cocaine, and CNS stimulants excluding cocaine, were acquired from the Canadian Vital Statistics Death Database (CVSD) for the years 2014 to 2017. We used joinpoint regression analysis and the Cochrane-Armitage trend test for proportions to examine changes over time in crude mortality rates and proportions of poisoning deaths involving more than one substance. RESULTS: Between 2014 and 2017, the rate of substance poisoning deaths in Canada almost doubled from 6.4 to 11.5 deaths per 100,000 population (Average Annual Percent Change, AAPC: 23%, p < 0.05). Our analysis shows this was due to increased unintentional poisoning deaths (AAPC: 26.6%, p < 0.05) and polysubstance deaths (AAPC: 23.0%, p < 0.05). The proportion of unintentional poisoning deaths involving polysubstance use increased significantly from 38% to 58% among males (p < 0.0001) and 40% to 55% among females (p < 0.0001). Polysubstance use poisonings involving opioids and CNS stimulants (excluding cocaine) increased substantially during the study period (males AAPC: 133.1%, p < 0.01; females AAPC: 118.1%, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Increases in substance-related poisoning deaths between 2014 and 2017 were associated with polysubstance use. Increased co-use of stimulants with opioids is a key factor contributing to the epidemic of opioid deaths in Canada.

Treatment toxicities can impact quality of life [1], impose financial hardship and cause cancer related distress[2]. Symptom monitoring using electronic technology can facilitate early detection of complications[3], reduce symptom burden[4], cost of care[5] and improve survival[6]. Cancer treatment also increases risk of mortality from infections such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and routine screening has been recommended[7]. METHODS We developed an application that periodically delivers toxicity questionnaires to patients during treatment. Based on NCI- PRO-CTCAE?, the questions are delivered through SMS or e-mail. Patient responses crossing prespecified thresholds trigger automated alerts on a dashboard, resulting in additional interventions as needed. Nature and time to intervention is tracked. Patient experience is measured using a Likert-scale and free-text box. Centers for Disease Control recommended COVID-19 screening questions were incorporated. Finally, a distress thermometer for cancer distress screening has been recently added. The app was offered to patients with hematological cancers in a community-based cancer center. RESULTS Since introduction in April 2020, we have enrolled 37 patients. 9 patients had chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 6 diffuse large B cell, 5 mantle cell, 4 Hodgkin's and 3 follicular lymphoma. 2 each had chronic myelogenous, multiple myeloma and Richter's syndrome. 1 each had hairy cell leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia and T Cell lymphoma. Median age was 64 years (range 24-85). Patient experience has been favorable. On a scale of 1-5, 85.5% rated the experience as 3 or higher. Median patient engagement, calculated by dividing the number of forms completions by number of days enrolled was 34.2% (0.9-66.2 %). Symptom tracker captured 536 responses. Fatigue (153), no symptoms (152), shortness of breath (57), nausea/vomiting, diarrhea (46) and numbness/tingling (28) were the most common response categories. Of 1107 completed check ins, 75 triggered flags. There were 2 hospitalizations for neutropenic fever with the remainder managed as outpatients. Average time between patient generated response and provider intervention was 90.9 minutes. 88% follow-ups were completed within 1 business day. COVID-19 screening module captured 1096 responses. 988 were no symptoms. All positive responses (44 diarrhea, 39 cough, 23 shortness of breath and 2 fever) were false positives. Distress thermometer implemented a week before data cut-off captured 2 responses, 1 in the physical and 1 in the psychological domain. CONCLUSION We demonstrate feasibility of electronic capture of treatment toxicities and offer proof of concept that a mobile app can be used for infection screening. Additionally, the quick response time by care team indicated a high adoption rate. REFERENCES 1.

Neurotrophin-4 (NT-4) is essential for the survival of vagal smooth muscle afferents of the small intestine, but not the stomach. Here we took advantage of near-complete labeling of GI vagal mucosal afferents in Nav1.8cre-Rosa26tdTomato transgenic mice to determine whether these afferents depend on NT-4 for survival. We quantified the density and distribution of vagal afferent terminals in the stomach and small intestine mucosa and their central terminals in the solitary tract nucleus (NTS) and area postrema in NT-4 knockout (KO) and control mice. NT-4KO mice exhibited a 75% reduction in vagal afferent terminals in proximal duodenal villi and a 55% decrease in the distal ileum, whereas, those in the stomach glands remained intact. Vagal crypt afferents were also reduced in some regions of the small intestine, but to a lesser degree. Surprisingly, NT-4KO mice exhibited an increase in labeled terminals in the medial NTS. These findings, combined with previous results, suggest NT-4 is essential for survival of a large proportion of all classes of vagal afferents that innervate the small intestine, but not those that supply the stomach. Thus, NT-4KO mice could be valuable for distinguishing gastric and intestinal vagal afferent regulation of GI function and feeding. The apparent plasticity of central vagal afferent terminals - an increase in their density - could have compensated for loss of peripheral terminals by maintaining near-normal levels of satiety signaling.","output":"Neurotrophin-4 is essential for survival of the majority of vagal afferents to the mucosa of the small intestine, but not the stomach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although there are a large number of thesauri for the biomedical domain many of them lack coverage in terms and their variant forms. Automatic thesaurus construction based on patterns was first suggested by Hearst [1], but it is still not clear how to automatically construct such patterns for different semantic relations and domains. In particular it is not certain which patterns are useful for capturing synonymy. The assumption of extant resources such as parsers is also a limiting factor for many languages, so it is desirable to find patterns that do not use syntactical analysis. Finally to give a more consistent and applicable result it is desirable to use these patterns to form synonym sets in a sound way. RESULTS: We present a method that automatically generates regular expression patterns by expanding seed patterns in a heuristic search and then develops a feature vector based on the occurrence of term pairs in each developed pattern. This allows for a binary classifications of term pairs as synonymous or non-synonymous. We then model this result as a probability graph to find synonym sets, which is equivalent to the well-studied problem of finding an optimal set cover. We achieved 73.2% precision and 29.7% recall by our method, out-performing hand-made resources such as MeSH and Wikipedia. CONCLUSION: We conclude that automatic methods can play a practical role in developing new thesauri or expanding on existing ones, and this can be done with only a small amount of training data and no need for resources such as parsers.

Pre- and postoperative OSA were assessed through a detailed history (of nighttime symptoms (NS) and daytime symptoms (DS)), physical examination, and polysomnography. RESULTS Age ranged 5-18 years (mean 9.7  3.4). Fourteen of 26 had trisomy 21 (51%).

This study, made possible by the participation of members of the Philadelphia Orchestra, brings insight on the modes of production and early life of aerosols of human origin emitted by wind instruments. We find that these instruments produce aerosol levels that are comparable to normal speech in quantity and size distribution. However, the exit jet flow speeds are much lower than violent expiratory events (coughing, sneezing). For most wind instruments, the flow decays to background indoor-air levels at approximately 2 meters away from the instrument's opening.

Specifically, short-term predictors and correlates of suicide risk remain largely unknown. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) may be used to assess how suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) unfold in real-world contexts. We conducted a systematic literature review of EMA studies in suicide research to assess (1) how EMA has been utilized in the study of STBs (i.e., methodology, findings), and (2) the feasibility, validity and safety of EMA in the study of STBs. We identified 45 articles, detailing 23 studies. Studies mainly focused on examining how known longitudinal predictors of suicidal ideation perform within shorter (hourly, daily) time frames. Recent studies have explored the prospects of digital phenotyping of individuals with suicidal ideation. The results indicate that suicidal ideation fluctuates substantially over time (hours, days), and that individuals with higher mean ideation also have more fluctuations. Higher suicidal ideation instability may represent a phenotypic indicator for increased suicide risk. Few studies succeeded in establishing prospective predictors of suicidal ideation beyond prior ideation itself. Some studies show negative affect, hopelessness and burdensomeness to predict increased ideation within-day, and sleep characteristics to impact next-day ideation. The feasibility of EMA is encouraging: agreement to participate in EMA research was moderate to high (median = 77%), and compliance rates similar to those in other clinical samples (median response rate = 70%). More individuals reported suicidal ideation through EMA than traditional (retrospective) self-report measures. Regarding safety, no evidence was found of systematic reactivity of mood or suicidal ideation to repeated assessments of STBs. In conclusion, suicidal ideation can fluctuate substantially over short periods of time, and EMA is a suitable method for capturing these fluctuations. Some specific predictors of subsequent ideation have been identified, but these findings warrant further replication. While repeated EMA assessments do not appear to result in systematic reactivity in STBs, participant burden and safety remains a consideration when studying high-risk populations. Considerations for designing and reporting on EMA studies in suicide research are discussed.","output":"Don't Miss the Moment: A Systematic Review of Ecological Momentary Assessment in Suicide Research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chickens, turkeys, and other poultry in a production environment can be exposed to stressors and infectious diseases that impair innate and acquired immunity, erode general health and welfare, and diminish genetic and nutritional potential for efficient production. Innate immunity can be affected by stressful physiologic events related to hatching and to environmental factors during the first week of life. Exposure to environmental ammonia, foodborne mycotoxins, and suboptimal nutrition can diminish innate immunity. Infectious bursal disease (IBD), chicken infectious anemia (CIA), and Marek's disease (MD) are major infectious diseases that increase susceptibility to viral, bacterial, and parasitic diseases and interfere with acquired vaccinal immunity. A shared feature is lymphocytolytic infection capable of suppressing both humoral and cell-mediated immune functions. Enteric viral infections can be accompanied by atrophic and depleted lymphoid organs, but the immunosuppressive features are modestly characterized. Some reoviruses cause atrophy of lymphoid organs and replicate in blood monocytes. Enteric parvoviruses of chickens and turkeys merit further study for immunosuppression. Hemorrhagic enteritis of turkeys has immunosuppressive features similar to IBD. Other virulent fowl adenoviruses have immunosuppressive capabilities. Newcastle disease can damage lymphoid tissues and macrophages. Avian pneumovirus infections impair the mucociliary functions of the upper respiratory tract and augment deeper bacterial infections. Recognition of immunosuppression involves detection of specific diseases using diagnostic tests such as serology, etiologic agent detection, and pathology. Broader measurements of immunosuppression by combined noninfectious and infectious causes have not found general application. Microarray technology to detect genetic expression of immunologic mediators and receptors offers potential advances but is currently at the developmental state. Control methods for immunosuppressive diseases rely largely on minimizing stress, reducing exposure to infectious agents through biosecurity, and increasing host resistance to infectious immunosuppressive diseases by vaccination.

Self-report scales were used to assess attachment insecurity (anxiety and avoidance) and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies (self-blame, rumination, catastrophizing) in adults at 50 % risk for Huntingtons Disease (HD), Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), and Hereditary Cerebral Hemorrhage With Amyloidosis - Dutch type (HCHWA-D), when they presented for predictive testing.

Pearson correlations and linear regression were used to analyze whether attachment style and emotion regulation strategies indicated distress. In 98 persons at risk for HD, CADASIL, or HCHWA-D, attachment anxiety and catastrophizing were associated with distress before predictive testing.

Geochemical and mineralogical assessments indicate that environmental conditions within this timeframe would have been suitable for sustaining life, if it ever were present. Fluids simultaneously circulated in the subsurface and likely existed through the dry phases of lake bed exposure and aeolian deposition, conceivably creating a continuously habitable subsurface environment that persisted to less than 3 Ga in the early Amazonian. A diversity of organic molecules has been preserved, though degraded, with evidence for more complex precursors. Solid samples show highly variable isotopic abundances of sulfur, chlorine, and carbon. In situ studies of modern wind-driven sediment transport and multiple large and active aeolian deposits have led to advances in understanding bedform development and the initiation of saltation.

This observation suggests that genetic alterations leading to a decreased level of IGFBP-5 may also contribute to breast cancer. In the current review, we focus on Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein A (PAPP-A), a protease involved in the degradation of IGFBP-5. PAPP-A is overexpressed in the majority of breast cancers but its role in cancer has only begun to be explored. More specifically, this review aims at highlighting the role of post-partum involution in the oncogenic function of PAPP-A. Notably, we summarize recent studies indicating that PAPP-A plays a role not only in the degradation of IGFBP-5 but also in the deposition of collagen and activation of the collagen receptor discoidin 2 (DDR2) during post-partum involution. Finally, considering the immunosuppressive microenvironment of post-partum involution, we also discuss the unexpected finding made in Ewing Sarcoma that PAPP-A plays a role in immune evasion. While the immunosuppressive role of PAPP-A in breast cancer remains to be determined, collectively these studies highlight the multifaced role of PAPP-A in cancer that extends well beyond its effect on IGF-signaling.","output":"The Multi-Faced Role of PAPP-A in Post-Partum Breast Cancer: IGF-Signaling is Only the Beginning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated neurological, mental health disorders, and neurocognitive issues. However, there is a lack of inexpensive and efficient brain evaluation and screening systems. As a result, a considerable fraction of patients with neurocognitive or psychobehavioral predicaments either do not get timely diagnosed or fail to receive personalized treatment plans. This is especially true in the elderly populations, wherein only 16% of seniors say they receive regular cognitive evaluations. Therefore, there is a great need for development of an optimized clinical brain screening workflow methodology like what is already in existence for prostate and breast exams. Such a methodology should be designed to facilitate objective early detection and cost-effective treatment of such disorders. In this paper we have reviewed the existing clinical protocols, recent technological advances and suggested reliable clinical workflows for brain screening. Such protocols range from questionnaires and smartphone apps to multi-modality brain mapping and advanced imaging where applicable. To that end, the Society for Brain Mapping and Therapeutics (SBMT) proposes the Brain, Spine and Mental Health Screening (NEUROSCREEN) as a multi-faceted approach. Beside other assessment tools, NEUROSCREEN employs smartphone guided cognitive assessments and quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) as well as potential genetic testing for cognitive decline risk as inexpensive and effective screening tools to facilitate objective diagnosis, monitor disease progression, and guide personalized treatment interventions. Operationalizing NEUROSCREEN is expected to result in reduced healthcare costs and improving quality of life at national and later, global scales.","output":"A Proposed Brain-, Spine-, and Mental- Health Screening Methodology (NEUROSCREEN) for Healthcare Systems: Position of the Society for Brain Mapping and Therapeutics."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: Anastomotic leakage (AL) in left-sided colorectal cancer is a serious complication, with an incidence rate of 6-18%.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 256 patients who underwent curative surgery for left-sided colorectal cancer between 2017 and 2021 were included. In addition to conventional clinicopathological factors, we included the type of circular stapler using DST, conventional double-row circular stapler (DCS) or EEA? circular stapler with Tri-Staple? technology, 28 mm Medium/Thick (Covidien, New Haven, CT, USA) which had triple-row circular stapler (TCS) as a covariate. Auto-AI software Prediction One (Sony Network Communications Inc.) was used to predict AL with 5-fold cross validation. Predictive accuracy was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Prediction One also evaluated the 'importance of variables' (IOV) using a method based on permutation feature importance. RESULTS: The area under the curve of the AI model was 0.766. The type of circular stapler used was the most influential factor contributing to AL (IOV=0.551). CONCLUSION: This auto-AI predictive model demonstrated an improvement in accuracy compared to the conventional model.

There is limited data available on pregnancy sequelae of maternal infection in the first or second trimester. STUDY DESIGN: We present a patient with monochorionic-diamniotic twins that develops coronavirus disease 2019 infection at 15 weeks of gestation. The pregnancy is further complicated by stage II twin-twin transfusion syndrome. She undergoes laser ablation, which is complicated by development of a subchorionic hematoma. The patient then develops Escherichia coli bacteremia, resulting in septic shock and preterm labor followed by previable delivery at 21 weeks of gestation. Amniotic fluid and placenta were negative for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time polymerase chain reaction. CONCLUSION: This case of SARS-CoV-2 argues against transplacental transmission after a second-trimester infection but brings attention to the possible downstream complications that may arise following early infection. KEY POINTS:  Vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is not evident after a second-trimester infection..

The very rare cases of dissociated crossed speech areas were accidentally found based on the clinical symptomatology. Today functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-based imaging can be employed to non-invasively localise the eloquent areas in brain tumour patients for therapy planning. A 41-year-old, left-handed man with a low-grade glioma in the left frontal operculum extending to the insular cortex, tension headaches, and anomic aphasia over 5 months underwent a pre-operative speech area localisation fMRI measurement, which revealed the evidence of the transhemispheric disposition, where the dominant Wernicke speech area is located on the left and the Broca's area is strongly lateralised to the right hemisphere. The outcome of the Wada test and the intraoperative cortico-subcortical stimulation mapping were congruent with this finding. After tumour removal, language area function was fully preserved. Upon the occurrence of brain tumours with a risk of impaired speech function, the rare dissociate crossed speech areas disposition may gain a clinically relevant meaning by allowing for more extended tumour removal. Hence, for its identification, diagnostics which take into account both brain hemispheres, such as fMRI, are recommended.","output":"Dissociated Crossed Speech Areas in a Tumour Patient."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper analyses the influence that the Covid-19 pandemic has had on the functioning of the European asylum system. The analysis is divided into three parts and addresses problematic issues associated with different stages of the pandemic. In the first part of the paper, the author outlines the asylum practices of EU Member States in the initial stage of the Covid-19 pandemic during which the pandemic was perceived as a state of emergency. By exploring the legal possibilities to derogate both from the EU asylum rules and international human rights standards, the author offers conclusions as regards limits of derogations and the legality of Member States' practices, especially their failure to differentiate between rules that are susceptive of being derogated in emergency situations and those that are not. The second part of the paper analyses the current phase of the pandemic in which it is perceived as a 'new normal' and focuses on making the EU asylum system immune to Covid-19 influence to the greatest extent possible and in line with relevant EU and human rights rules. The author insists on the vulnerability as an inherent feature of persons in need of international protection and researches upon the relationship between the two competing interests involved - protection of asylum seekers and ensuring public health as a legitimate reason for restricting certain asylum seekers' rights. The final part of the paper analyses the prospects of the future EU asylum system, as announced by the New Pact on Migration and Asylum in September 2020, to adapt to the exigencies of both the current Covid-19 crisis and pandemics that are yet to come. With an exclusive focus on referral to Covid-19 and provisions relevant for the current and future pandemics, the author criticizes several solutions included in the instruments that make up the Pact. It is concluded that the Pact failed to offer solutions for problems experienced during the Covid-19 pandemic and that, under the pretext of public health, it prioritizes the interests of Member States over the interests of applicants for international protection.","output":"Eu Asylum System in and after the Covid-19 Pandemic: Disclosing the Weaknesses of the Current Rules and Assessing the Prospects of the New Pact on Migration and Asylum *"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Some free fatty acids derived from milk and vegetable oils are known to have potent antiviral and antibacterial properties.

In vitro, ViroSAL inhibited the enveloped viruses Epstein-Barr, measles, herpes simplex, Zika and orf parapoxvirus, together with Ebola, Lassa, vesicular stomatitis and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) pseudoviruses, in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Evaluation of the components of ViroSAL revealed that caprylic acid was the main antiviral component; however, the ViroSAL formulation significantly inhibited viral entry compared with caprylic acid alone. In vivo, ViroSAL significantly inhibited Zika and Semliki Forest virus replication in mice following the inoculation of these viruses into mosquito bite sites. In agreement with studies investigating other free fatty acids, ViroSAL had no effect on norovirus, a non-enveloped virus, indicating that its mechanism of action may be surfactant disruption of the viral envelope.

Transforming clinical text into structured data can enable large-scale research studies with electronic health records (EHR) data. Natural language processing (NLP) can be used for text information retrieval, reducing the need for labor-intensive chart review. Here we present an application of NLP to large-scale analysis of medical records at 2 large hospitals for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: Our study goal was to develop an NLP pipeline to classify the discharge disposition (home, inpatient rehabilitation, skilled nursing inpatient facility [SNIF], and death) of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 based on hospital discharge summary notes. METHODS: Text mining and feature engineering were applied to unstructured text from hospital discharge summaries. The study included patients with COVID-19 discharged from 2 hospitals in the Boston, Massachusetts area (Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital) between March 10, 2020, and June 30, 2020. The data were divided into a training set (70%) and hold-out test set (30%). Discharge summaries were represented as bags-of-words consisting of single words (unigrams), bigrams, and trigrams. The number of features was reduced during training by excluding n-grams that occurred in fewer than 10% of discharge summaries, and further reduced using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regularization while training a multiclass logistic regression model. Model performance was evaluated using the hold-out test set. RESULTS: The study cohort included 1737 adult patients (median age 61 [SD 18] years; 55% men; 45% White and 16% Black; 14% nonsurvivors and 61% discharged home). The model selected 179 from a vocabulary of 1056 engineered features, consisting of combinations of unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams. The top features contributing most to the classification by the model (for each outcome) were the following: \\"appointments specialty,\\" \\"home health,\\" and \\"home care\\" (home); \\"intubate\\" and \\"ARDS\\" (inpatient rehabilitation); \\"service\\" (SNIF); \\"brief assessment\\" and \\"covid\\" (death).

In Malawi, MDA is widely carried out annually since 2009 for prevention and control of schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminths (STH). No study has been carried out to assess effectiveness of the MDA approach and to document perceptions of health providers and beneficiaries regarding use of MDA. This study was done to understand how well MDA is being implemented and to identify opportunities for improvement in MDA delivery in Malawi. METHODS: Designed as a cross-sectional and multi-methods research, the study was carried out in three southern Malawi districts of Chiradzulu, Mangochi and Zomba. In each district, four health centres and 16 villages were randomly selected to participate. A mixed-methods approach to data collection focusing on quantitative data for coverage and knowledge, attitudes and practices assessments; and qualitative data for assessing perceptions of health providers and beneficiaries regarding MDA was used. Quantitative data were processed and analyzed using IBM SPSS software version 26 while qualitative data were analysed using NVivo 12 for Windows. RESULTS: Knowledge levels about schistosomiasis and STH in the districts varied according to disease aspects asked about. Majority are more knowledgeable about what schistosomiasis is (78%) and whether STH are treatable with drugs (97%); with least knowledgeable about the organism that transmits schistosomiasis (18%), types of schistosomiasis (11%) and what causes STH (20%). In 2018 and 2019 the districts registered high coverage rates for praziquantel and albendazole using community-based MDA (73C100%) and using school-based MDA (75C91%). Both the health authorities and community members perceived the MDA approach as good because it brings treatment closer to people. CONCLUSION: With the high MDA coverage obtained in communities and schools, the effectiveness of MDA in the target districts is satisfactory. There are, however, several challenges including disproportionate knowledge levels, which are hampering progress towards attainment of the 2030 global NTD goals. There is a need for promotion of community participation and partnerships as well as implementation of other recommended interventions for sustainable prevention and control of schistosomiasis and STH.

This study was proposed to quantify the magnitude of the problem. METHODS Fifteen patients undergoing gastric bypass had oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) recorded continuously, but not displayed, for 24h postoperatively; eight also had arterial blood analysis every 4h. All received narcotic PCA. SpO(2)<90% lasting more than 10 s was reviewed. Results are mean+/-SEM. RESULTS Mean age was 44+/-4 y, and mean BMI was 48+/-2kg/m(2); 77% had OSA. Every patient had more than one episode with SpO(2)<90% for longer than 30s undetected by routine monitoring; most had multiple episodes. Nadir SpO(2) averaged 75% +/- 8%. Mean longest duration of desaturation below 90% averaged 21+/-15min. Mean PaCO(2) was 37+/-3mm Hg; maximum PaCO(2) was 47mm Hg. CONCLUSIONS Severe and prolonged episodes of hypoxemia were a consistent finding, despite aggressive preoperative diagnosis and treatment of OSA, including use of CPAP postoperatively. Although some postoperative hypoventilation was expected, the degree and frequency of desaturation were surprising. No patient exhibited arterial PaCO(2) evidence of hypoventilation.

However, efficacy depends on proper usage. We set out to determine the prevalence of wearing masks to prevent COVID-19 and compliance with appropriate measures for the correct use of face masks among the general public in Japan where wearing medical masks is a \\"cultural\\" normality. This cross-sectional study was based on an internet-based survey completed by 2141 people (50.8% men, aged 20-79 years) who were selected among registrants of an Internet research company between 1 April and 6 April 2020. Participants were asked to indicate how often they wore masks for prevention and to what extent they practiced appropriate measures suggested by the World Health Organization. The prevalence of wearing masks was 80.9% and compliance rates with appropriate measures ranged from 38.3% to 83.5%. Only 23.1% complied with all recommendations. Compliance rates were overall low in men and persons with low household incomes. Our results, hence show that many citizens implement inaccurate measures when using face masks. Therefore, providing guidance on correct usage is essential when encouraging the use of face masks to prevent COVID-19.","output":"Incorrect Use of Face Masks during the Current COVID-19 Pandemic among the General Public in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, supporting effectivecommunication between patients and their families has been arecognised challenge in the healthcare environment. Virtualcommunication via telecommunication and video-calling is moreimportant than ever, but with minimal clinician education,preparation and relevant technological infrastructure available inthe context of a global pandemic, we have recognisedcommunication as an area for improvement as junior doctorsworking on a COVID-19 ward. Methods We interviewed via telephone 22 nominated next of kin relatives of patients admitted to a COVID-19 ward in the University Hospital of Llandough during May 2020 using a pre-prepared survey. We thenprovided relatives with the opportunity to engage with video-callupdates from a doctor (with the patient's permission). Inappropriate scenarios, we used video calling to break bad news andto facilitate difficult communications with family members. Thesevideo calls were provided via Accurx, an NHS approved videocommunication system. Results Initial survey results showed an average understanding score of their relative's current clinical plan of 5.5/10, with 63% of respondents saying they did not feel well informed. Nearly aquarter of respondents (22%) had received difficult news over thephone during the COVID-19 pandemic, and 86% said they wouldfind video communication useful. Post-intervention survey results suggested a unanimous improvement in relative satisfaction, withrelatives reporting an increased understanding around theadmission, reassurance around the quality of care being given and less isolation from the patient. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has provided novel communicationchallenges to physicians, promoting flexibility and adaptation tosome of the core inter-personal skills we develop throughouttraining. Technology plays a huge role in this, and the use of videocalling in particular can preserve non-verbal communicationwithin the doctor-relative relationship and improve emotionalconnection between patients and their loved ones.","output":"Face time' for the first time: Patients,families and junior doctors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A pandemic (in Greek, pan \\"all\\", demos \\"people\\") is a term used to describe an epidemic of an infectious disease that causes significant mortality over a large area, including countries and continents.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the extent to which the OHSA was implemented at an academic hospital in Johannesburg, from the senior professional nurses and nursing managers perspective, and to describe recommendations in order to facilitate the implementation of the Act. METHODS: A contextual, quantitative, exploratory and descriptive survey was conducted. A purposive sampling method was used to select the participants that met the inclusion criteria. A structured Likert-scale questionnaire was used to collect data (Brink 2011). Stata version 12 was used to analyse the data. Cronbachs alpha, with a cut-off point of 0.7 was used to test for internal consistency. Ethical considerations were strictly adhered to. Results are presented in the form of graphs, frequency distributions and tables. RESULTS: The study revealed that overall there is 93.3% non-implementation of the selected sections and regulations of the OHSA.

Eight studies were retrieved using the search criteria. Seven studies met the inclusion criteria, and a further study was found citing several articles from the initial search. Combined, there were 528 patients who underwent 600 free flaps. A total of 10.3% (62) arterial and venous thromboses were reported in the studies, and the combined flap failure rate was 5.2% (26). A total of 67% (4/6) of the studies supported the use of TEG as a predictive tool to detect thromboses, including three retrospective case series and one prospective cohort, which were all statistically significant. There is low-quality evidence (level IV) that a pre-operative TEG and functional fibrinogen to platelet ratio of 42 can identify patients at risk of adverse post-operative thrombotic events following free flap surgery; however, further validation is required. Higher quality, standardised prospective or randomised control trials are required to further evaluate the predictive value of TEG. As a pre-operative screening tool, TEG can help to detect pathological changes in coagulation, aid in the transfusion of blood products, target anticoagulation therapy and predict possible adverse events aiding to further reduce patient morbidity.","output":"Thromboelastography in Microsurgical Reconstruction: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although many digital mental health interventions are available, clinicians do not routinely use them in clinical practice. In this pilot survey, we review the factors that supported the rapid transition to televisits during the COVID-19 pandemic, and we explore the barriers that continue to prevent clinicians from using other digital mental health interventions, such as mindfulness applications, mood trackers, and digital therapy programs. We conducted a pilot survey of mental health clinicians in different practice environments in the USA. Survey respondents (n = 51) were primarily psychiatrists working in academic medical centers. Results indicated that systemic factors, including workplace facilitation and insurance reimbursement, were primary reasons motivating clinicians to use televisits to provide remote patient care. The shift to televisits during the pandemic was not accompanied by increased use of other digital mental health interventions in patient care. Nine clinicians reported that they have never used digital interventions with patients. Among the 42 clinicians who did report some experience using digital interventions, the majority reported no change in the use of digital applications since transitioning to televisits. Our preliminary findings lend insight into the perspective of mental health clinicians regarding the factors that supported their transition to televisits, including institutional support and insurance reimbursement, and indicate that this shift to virtual patient care has not been accompanied by increased use of other digital mental health interventions. We contend that the same systemic factors that supported the shift toward virtual visits in the COVID-19 pandemic may be applied to support the incorporation of other digital interventions in mental healthcare.

The main objective of this study was to verify whether one intervention to reduce added salt during cooking changed knowledge, attitudes and behavior (KAB) towards salt, and to analyze changes in the main sources of salt. (2) Methods: The intervention study was an 8-week randomized controlled trial with 97 workers from a public university. KAB in relation to salt were obtained through the WHO STEPwise questionnaire, and the main sources of salt were obtained by 24-h food recall and 24 h urinary sodium excretion over two days. (3) Results: After the intervention, participants in the intervention group reported a decrease in the addition of salt when cooking (p = 0.037), an increase in the percentage of subjects who avoided the consumption of processed foods (from 54.2% to 83.3%, p = 0.001), who looked for salt on food labels (from 18.8% to 39.6%, p = 0.013), and who bought low-salt food alternatives (from 43.8% to 60.4%, p = 0.039). However, there were no significant differences between the intervention group and the control group at baseline and post-intervention assessments. In the intervention group, after the intervention, the added salt decreased by 5%; food sources of salt such as the snacks and pizza group decreased by 7%, and the meat, fish and eggs group increased by 4%, but without statistical significance.

This led to the establishment of a third dose vaccination in several countries, known as a booster. To date, there has been little real-world data about the immunological effect of this strategy. MethodsWe compared the humoral- and cellular immune response before and after the third dose of BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine BNT162b2, following different prime-boost regimes. Humoral immunity was assessed by determining anti-SARS-CoV-2 binding antibodies using a standardized quantitative assay. In addition, neutralizing antibodies were measured using a commercial surrogate ELISA-assay. Interferon-gamma release was measured after stimulating blood-cells with SARS-CoV-2 specific peptides using a commercial assay to evaluate the cellular immune response. ResultsThe median antibody level increased significantly after the third dose to 2663.1 BAU/ml vs. 101.4 BAU/ml (p < 0.001) before administration of the boosting dose. This was also detected for neutralizing antibodies with a binding inhibition of 99.68% {+/-} 0.36% vs. 69.06% {+/-} 19.88% after the second dose (p < 0.001). 96.3% of the participants showed a detectable T-cell-response after the third dose with a mean interferon-gamma level of 2207.07 mIU/ml {+/-} 1905 mIU/ml.

Like training programs nationwide, telemedicine training and assessment had not been systematically incorporated into our residency. In response, a scheduled Internal Medicine (IM) Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) was adapted to a remote modality to become virtual care-focused learning experience for trainees and to provide valuable feedback to educators. METHODS: Standardized Patients (SPs) rated residents on their communication (including information gathering, relationship development and patient education), patient activation and satisfaction, and telemedicine skills. Analyses included a comparison of domain scores for residents who participated in both the 2020 remote and 2019 in-person OSCEs, and a review of written resident comments about the virtual OSCE. RESULTS: During 2020s video visit OSCE (VOSCE), residents (n = 23) excelled at nonverbal communication but struggled with virtual physical exams and information gathering. In debrief, residents expressed substantial interest in more opportunity to practice virtual visit skills going forward. In comparing scores of the virtual care (2020) OSCE with the in-person (2019) version, the small subset of residents who participated in both assessments (n = 9) performed similarly on communication skills, patient satisfaction and activation. Patient education scores were significantly lower during the virtual care OSCE (P = .008). CONCLUSION: Our reformulated OSCE accomplished 3 goals including; (1) physically distancing residents from SPs per COVID regulations, (2) providing residents with the opportunity to practice critical virtual visit skills, and (3) alerting our educators to curricular improvement areas.

OBJECTIVES: Our study investigated the correlation between global online interest in COVID-19 and interest in CDC-recommended routine vaccines. DESIGN, SETTINGS, MEASUREMENTS: This infodemiology study used Google Trends data to quantify worldwide interest in COVID-19 and CDC-recommended vaccines using the unit search volume index (SVI), which estimates volume of online search activity relative to highest volume of searches within a specified period. SVIs from December 30, 2019 to March 30, 2020 were collected for coronavirus (Virus) and compared with SVIs of search terms related to CDC-recommended adult vaccines. To account for seasonal variation, we compared SVIs from December 30, 2019 to March 30, 2020 with SVIs from the same months in 2015 to 2019. We performed country-level analyses in ten COVID-19 hotspots and ten countries with low disease burden. RESULTS: There were significant positive correlations between SVIs for coronavirus (Virus) and search terms for pneumococcal (R=0.89, p<0.0001) and influenza vaccines (R=0.93, p<0.0001) in 2020, which were greater than SVIs for the same terms in 2015-2019 (p= 0.005, p<0.0001, respectively). Eight in ten COVID-19 hotspots demonstrated significant positive correlations between SVIs for coronavirus and search terms for pneumococcal and influenza vaccines. LIMITATIONS: SVIs estimate relative changes in online interest and do not represent for people with no Internet access. CONCLUSION: A peak in worldwide interest in pneumococcal and influenza vaccines coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic in February and March 2020. Trends are likely not seasonal in origin and may be driven by Covid-19 hotspots. Global events may change public perception about the importance of vaccines.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study comparing the frequency of unplanned extubations resulting in reintubations in a group of coronavirus disease 2019 patients to a historical (noncoronavirus disease 2019) control group. SETTING: This study was conducted at Henry Ford Hospital, an academic medical center in Detroit, MI. The historical noncoronavirus disease 2019 patients were treated in the 68 bed medical ICU. The coronavirus disease 2019 patients were treated in the coronavirus disease ICU, which included the 68 medical ICU beds, 18 neuro-ICU beds, 32 surgical ICU beds, and 40 cardiovascular ICU beds, as the medical ICU was expanded to these units at the peak of the pandemic in Detroit, MI. PATIENTS: The coronavirus disease 2019 cohort included patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 who were intubated for respiratory failure from March 12, 2020, to April 13, 2020. The historic control (noncoronavirus disease 2019) group consisted of patients who were admitted to the medical ICU in the year spanning from November 1, 2018 to October 31, 2019, with a need for mechanical ventilation that was not related to surgery or a neurologic reason. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: To identify how many patients in each cohort had unplanned extubations, an electronic medical records query for patients with two intubations within 30 days was performed, in addition to a review of our institutional quality and safety database of reported self-extubations. Medical charts were manually reviewed by board-certified anesthesiologists to confirm each event was an unplanned extubation followed by a reintubation within 24 hours. There was a significantly greater incidence of unplanned extubations resulting in reintubation events in the coronavirus disease 2019 cohort than in the noncoronavirus disease 2019 cohort (coronavirus disease 2019 cohort: 167 total admissions with 22 events13.2%; noncoronavirus disease 2019 cohort: 326 total admissions with 14 events4.3%; p < 0.001).

A cone-shaped 10  15 cm Proceed Mesh was tacked to the promontory or sacrum and sutured to the pelvic sidewalls and the anterior peritoneum. RESULTS Twelve patients underwent laparoscopic repair of their perineal hernia. Four men and eight women presented with a symptomatic perineal hernia after abdominoperineal excision between 2008 and 2013 and underwent a laparoscopic repair with a Proceed mesh. The median age at presentation was 53 years (range 39-68 years). The mean total theater time was 119 min (range 75-200 min). No conversion to an open procedure was needed. No early complications where seen. The mean hospital stay was 2.25 days (range 1-4 days). Three patients showed recurrence, of whom two had a defect in the middle of the proceed mesh, one had a defect anterior to the previous perineal hernia.

This work aimed to examine whether and how the COVID-19 pandemic has changed practice around IOL in the UK. METHOD: We used an online questionnaire to survey senior obstetricians and midwives at all 156 UK NHS Trusts and Boards that currently offer maternity services. Responses were analysed to produce descriptive statistics, with free text responses analysed using a conventional content analysis approach. FINDINGS: Responses were received from 92 of 156 UK Trusts and Boards, a 59% response rate. Many Trusts and Boards reported no change to their IOL practice, however 23% reported change in methods used for cervical ripening; 28% a change in criteria for home cervical ripening; 28% stated that more women were returning home during cervical ripening; and 24% noted changes to women's response to recommendations for IOL. Much of the change was reported as happening in response to attempts to minimise hospital attendance and restrictions on birth partners accompanying women.

Cardiomyopathy has been reported in patients with COVID-19; however, prognosis of peripartum cardiomyopathy in a patient with COVID-19 is still unexplored. More knowledge is required to understand the incidence of cardiomyopathy due to novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of peripartum cardiomyopathy gravida 2 parity 2 COVID-19 confirmed patient who underwent an emergency preterm lower segment caesarean section (LSCS) for severe pre-eclampsia and intra-uterine growth retardation (IUGR) and landed up in acute congestive cardiac failure with pulmonary oedema. A postpartum 32 years female presented to our institute, a dedicated COVID-19 hospital with tachycardia, hypertension, anasarca, tachypnea with desaturation on room air. She had undergone emergency caesarean section for severe preeclampsia with intrauterine growth retardation. On post-operative day 2 (POD2), she complained of shortness of breath. On POD 3 she tested positive RT-PCR for COVID-19 infection. She responded to treatment with steroids. However, on POD6, She developed severe pulmonary oedema with poor ejection fraction necessitating endotracheal intubation and pressure control ventilation. Congestive cardiac failure was managed with diuretics and digoxin. Gradually oxygenation improved. She was electively ventilated for 3 days. Gradually, ejection fraction improved with the resolution of B lines. On the 9th POD, after a successful spontaneous breathing trial, she was extubated and non-invasive ventilation with bi-level positive airway pressure was attached. The patient was gradually tapered off of the non-invasive ventilation over 2 days. On the 11th post-operative day, she was maintaining oxygen saturation on nasal prongs and was sent to the ward. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend early use of bedside lung ultrasonography; echocardiography and close cardiovascular monitoring in severe COVID-19 infected pregnant patients who present with shortness of breath, tachypnea, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and previous cardiac abnormalities for expedite management and improved prognosis.

The mean age of participants was 31.85  4.95 years, and the mean number of years of work experience was 7.71  4.44. Eleven participants were women. Among all participants, nine had a bachelor's degree and five had a master's degree. Four nurses had fixed shifts, while ten nurses had rotating shifts. The causes of missed nursing care were categorized into 4 groups. The category unfulfilled care comprised the reasons for forgetting care, neglecting care, arbitrary elimination of care, and compulsory elimination of care. The category of care at improper time consisted of interference of the care in patients' daily activities and interference with other healthcare providers' activities. The incomplete cares category comprised failure to complete the care period in hospital, interruption in care, and discontinuance of care after patient discharge. The last category, incorrect care, consisted of providing care regardless of the nursing process, providing care by unqualified professionals, and providing trial-and-error care. CONCLUSION: This study illustrates an understanding of the causes of missed nursing care during the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspective of nurses. The increasing demand for care caused by the pandemic and problems in the work environment has led to the failure of nurses to provide complete, correct care and sometimes miss parts of care to patients. Therefore, nursing policymakers and managers should develop and implement appropriate care protocols and instructions to minimize missed nursing care.","output":"Causes of Missed Nursing Care During COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Study in Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To describe the clinical features of liver involvement in children and adolescent with 2019-nCoV infection. Methods: The clinical data of 77 hospitalized cases admitted to the Children's Hospital of Fudan University were collected from January 19 to November 28, 2020. The characteristics and risk factors of abnormal liver chemistries in children with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection were analyzed. Results: Of the 77 cases, 44 were male (57.1%) and 33 were female (42.9%), with a median age of 10 years. 27(35.1%) were asymptomatic, 28(36.4%) had mild illness, 22(28.6%)had non-severe pneumonia. Hydroxychloroquine was used in 7 cases. Of the 75 children without underlying diseases, alanine aminotransferase was elevated in 1 case (1.5%, during hydroxychloroquine therapy), aspartate aminotransferase was elevated in 7 cases (10.3%), alkaline phosphatase was elevated in 7 cases (28%), and total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, albumin, international normalized ratio were in normal range. There was no statistical difference between the pneumonia group and the non-pneumonia group in term of liver chemistries (P > 0.05), same as between the elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate group and the normal group. There was no aggravation of liver injury in the child with biliary atresia. The child with epilepsy showed no abnormal liver chemistries after infection. Conclusion: Children with 2019-nCoV infection had mild clinical symptoms with few cases of liver injury. The abnormal liver chemistries in children with COVID-19 infection may be related to the underlying disease and the use of antiviral drugs.","output":"[Clinical analysis of liver chemistries in children and adolescent with 2019-nCoV infection]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper presents the results of research on the use of ultrafiltration, using membranes of 200 and 400 kDa separation, for disinfection of municipal treated wastewater. The research was conducted on a fractional technical scale using real municipal treated wastewater from two large wastewater treatment plants treating most of the wastewater over the one-million polycentric Gdask agglomeration (1.2 million inhabitants). UF 200 kDa and UF 400 kDa processes enabled further improvement of the physical and chemical parameters of treated wastewater. Total phosphorus (to below 0.2 mg/LCUF 200 kDa, 0.13 mg/LCUF 400 kDa) and turbid substances (to below 0.2 mg/L, both membranes) were removed in the highest degree. COD was reduced efficiently (to below 25.6 mgO(2)/LCUF 200 kDa, 26.8 mgO(2)/LCUF 400 kDa), while total nitrogen was removed to a small extent (to 7.12 mg/LCUF 200 kDa and 5.7 mg/LCUF 400 kDa. Based on the reduction of indicator bacteria; fecal coliforms including E. coli (FC) and fecal enterococci (FE) it was found that the ultrafiltration is an effective method of disinfection. Not much indicator bacterial were observed in the permeate after processes (UF 200 kDa; FC5 CFU/L; FE1 CFU/L and UF 400 kDa; FC70 CFU/L; FE10 CFU/L.

This phenotype is induced by viral endoribonucleases, including SOX in KSHV, muSOX in MHV68, BGLF5 in EBV and vhs in HSV-1. Here, we performed comparative RNA-seq upon expression of these herpesviral endonucleases in order to characterize their effect on the host transcriptome. Consistent with previous reports, we found that approximately two thirds of transcripts are downregulated in cells expressing any of these viral endonucleases. Among transcripts spared from degradation, we uncovered a cluster of transcripts that systematically escape degradation from all tested endonucleases. Among these escapees, we identified C19ORF66 and reveal that like the previously identified escapees, this transcript is protected from degradation by its 3UTR. We then show that C19ORF66, a known anti-viral protein, is a potent KSHV restriction factor, suggesting that its ability to escape viral cleavage may be an important component of the host response to viral infection. Collectively, our comparative approach is a powerful tool to pinpoint key regulators of the viral-host interplay and led us to uncover a novel KSHV regulator.","output":"C19ORF66 broadly escapes viral-induced endonuclease cleavage and restricts Kaposis Sarcoma Associated Herpesvirus (KSHV)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Mobile health (mHealth) is the use of mobile communication devices such as smartphones, wireless patient monitoring devices and tablet computers to deliver health services. Paediatric surgery patient care could potentially benefit from these technologies. This systematic review summarises the current literature on the use of mHealth for postoperative care after children's surgery. METHODS: Seven databases were searched by a senior medical librarian. Studies were included if they reported the use of mHealth systems for postoperative care for children <18 years old. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were performed in duplicate. RESULTS: A total of 18 studies were included after screening. mHealth use was varied and included appointment or medication reminders, postoperative monitoring and postoperative instruction delivery. mHealth systems included texting systems and mobile applications, and were implemented for a wide range of surgical conditions and countries. DISCUSSION: Studies showed that mHealth systems can increase the postoperative follow-up appointment attendance rate (p < 0.001), decrease the rate of postoperative complications and returns to the emergency department and reliably monitor postoperative pain. mHealth systems were generally appreciated by patients. Most non-randomised and randomised studies had many methodological problems, including lack of appropriate control groups, lack of blinding and a tendency to devote more time to the care of the intervention group. mHealth systems have the potential to improve postoperative care, but the lack of high-quality research evaluating their impact calls for further studies exploring evidence-based mHealth implementation.","output":"Use of mobile health technologies for postoperative care in paediatric surgery: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical presentations of patients with endogenous Cushing's syndrome (CS) affected by Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who were referred to our clinic with active CS from 31st March to 15th May 2020 were screened for COVID-19 using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Late-night serum cortisol (64-327 nmol/L), late-night salivary cortisol (LNSC) (0.5-9.4 nmol/L), or 24-h urinary free cortisol (24 hUFC) (100-379 nmol/24 h) were measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. RESULTS: Among 22 patients with active CS we found three cases affected by COVID-19. Nonspecific inflammation markers were within the reference range or slightly elevated in these patients. A 71-year-old woman with newly diagnosed CS (late-night serum cortisol >1750 nmol/L, LNSC 908.6 nmol/L) developed dyspnea as an only symptom and died from bilateral polysegmantal hemorrhagic pneumonia 7 days later. A 38-year-old woman with a 5-year medical history of active Cushing's disease (CD) (late-night serum cortisol 581.3 nmol/L, 24 hUFC 959.7 nmol/24-h) suffered from dyspnea, cough, fever (39.3 C) and chest pain.

Thus, severe hypercortisolism is a warning sign that CS affected by COVID-19 could require emergency care despite a lack of clinical presentations and low inflammation biomarkers.","output":"Clinical course and outcome of patients with ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome infected with novel coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19): case presentations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, noncontact vital sign monitors have attracted attention because of issues related to the transmission of contagious diseases. We developed a real-time vital sign monitor using impulse-radio ultrawideband (IR-UWB) radar with embedded processors and software; we then evaluated its accuracy in measuring heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) and investigated the factors affecting the accuracy of the radar-based measurements. In 50 patients visiting a cardiology clinic, HR and RR were measured using IR-UWB radar simultaneously with electrocardiography and capnometry. All patients underwent HR and RR measurements in 2 posturessupine and sittingfor 2 min each. There was a high agreement between the RR measured using radar and capnometry (concordance correlation coefficient [CCC] 0.925 [0.919C0.926]; upper and lower limits of agreement [LOA], ? 2.21 and 3.90 breaths/min). The HR measured using radar was also in close agreement with the value measured using electrocardiography (CCC 0.749 [0.738C0.760]; upper and lower LOA, ? 12.78 and 15.04 beats/min). Linear mixed effect models showed that the sitting position and an HR < 70 bpm were associated with an increase in the absolute biases of the HR, whereas the sitting position and an RR < 18 breaths/min were associated with an increase in the absolute biases of the RR. The IR-UWB radar sensor with embedded processors and software can measure the RR and HR in real time with high precision.

METHODS: Cross-sectional study based on an online snowball recruiting questionnaire. The survey consisted of an ad hoc questionnaire comprising clinical and sociodemographic information and the Spanish versions of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and the Impact of Event Scale (IES). RESULTS: The final sample included 21,207 individuals [mean age (SD) = 39.7 (14.0); females: 14,768 (69.6%)]. Up to 2867 (13.5%) of participants reported using alcohol, 2545 (12%) tobacco and 1384 (6.5%) both substances as a strategy to cope with the pandemic.

Many plans for rationing critical care resources during crises are based on the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. The COVID-19 pandemic created an emergent need to develop and validate a novel electronic health record (EHR)-computable tool to predict mortality. Research Questions: To rapidly develop, validate, and implement a novel real-time mortality score for the COVID-19 pandemic that improves upon SOFA. Study Design and Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study of a regional health system with 12 hospitals in Colorado between March 2020 and July 2020. All patients >14 years old hospitalized during the study period without a do not resuscitate order were included. Patients were stratified by the diagnosis of COVID-19. From this cohort, we developed and validated a model using stacked generalization to predict mortality using data widely available in the EHR by combining five previously validated scores and additional novel variables reported to be associated with COVID-19-specific mortality. We compared the area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) for the new model to the SOFA score and the Charlson Comorbidity Index. Results: We prospectively analyzed 27,296 encounters, of which 1,358 (5.0%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2, 4,494 (16.5%) included intensive care unit (ICU)-level care, 1,480 (5.4%) included invasive mechanical ventilation, and 717 (2.6%) ended in death. The Charlson Comorbidity Index and SOFA scores predicted overall mortality with an AUROC of 0.72 and 0.90, respectively. Our novel score predicted overall mortality with AUROC 0.94. In the subset of patients with COVID-19, we predicted mortality with AUROC 0.90, whereas SOFA had AUROC of 0.85.

Taking into consideration that the main route of virus transmission is via respiratory particles, the face mask represents a simple and efficient barrier between potentially infected and healthy individuals, thus reducing transmissibility per contact by reducing transmission of infected respiratory particles. However, long-term usage of a face mask leads to the accumulation of significant amounts of different pathogens and viruses onto the surface of the mask and can result in dangerous bacterial and viral co-infections. Zeolite imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) has recently emerged as an efficient water-stable photocatalyst capable of generating reactive oxygen species under light irradiation destroying dangerous microbial pathogens. The present study investigates the potential of using ZIF-8 as a coating for face masks to prevent the adherence of microbial/viral entities. The results show that after 2 h of UV irradiation, a polypropylene mask coated with ZIF-8 nanostructures is capable of eliminating S. Aureus and bacteriophage MS2 with 99.99% and 95.4% efficiencies, respectively. Furthermore, low-pathogenic HCoV-OC43 coronavirus was eliminated by a ZIF-8-modified mask with 100% efficiency already after 1 h of UV irradiation. As bacteriophage MS2 and HCoV-OC43 coronavirus are commonly used surrogates of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the revealed antiviral properties of ZIF-8 can represent an important step in designing efficient protective equipment for controlling and fighting the current COVID-19 pandemic.

Here, by combining observational data and simulations, this work aims to understand the diverse air quality response in two city clusters, Yangtze River Delta region (YRD) and Pearl River Delta region (PRD), China. Though there was a noticeable drop in primary pollutants in both the regions, differently, the maximum daily 8 h average ozone (O3) soared by 20.6-76.8% in YRD but decreased by 15.5-28.1% in PRD. In YRD, nitrogen oxide (NOx) reductions enhanced O3 accumulation and hence increased secondary aerosol formation. Such an increment in secondary organic and inorganic aerosols under stationary weather reached up to 36.4 and 10.2%, respectively, which was further intensified by regional transport. PRD was quite the opposite. The emission reductions benefited PRD air quality, while regional transport corresponded to an increase of 17.3 and 9.3% in secondary organic and inorganic aerosols, respectively. Apart from meteorology, the discrepancy in O3-VOCs-NOx relationships determined the different O3 responses, indicating that future emission control shall be regionally specific, instead of one-size-fits-all cut. Overall, the importance of regionally coordinated and balanced control strategy for multiple pollutants is highly emphasized.","output":"Air Quality During COVID-19 Lockdown in the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta: Two Different Responsive Mechanisms to Emission Reductions in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: Acute respiratory distress syndrome is the primary clinical problem that requires follow-up at the intensive care units. High Flow Nasal Cannula Oxygen Therapy has become an increasingly popular method by reducing the need for intubation but determining which patient will benefit from High Flow Nasal Cannula Oxygen Therapy is an important issue. Methods Seventy patients who followed up with acute respiratory distress syndrome related COVID-19 treated with High Flow Nasal Cannula Oxygen Systems as initial treatment at the intensive care units were retrospectively review. The primary endpoint of this study is to identify factors correlating with failure (mortality and invasive mechanical ventilator requirement) of High Flow Nasal Cannula Oxygen Therapy in the treatment of COVID-19-related severe ARDS. The secondary aim of this study is to determine the ROX index measured at the 12th hour, which will indicate the need for intubation in critically ill patients followed up with HFNC. Results Advanced age, male gender, and low ROX index were independent variables affecting High Flow Nasal Cannula Oxygen Therapy failure. While mortality was lowest in patients who completed the process with High Flow Nasal Cannula Oxygen Therapy treatment, patients who were intubated early (12-24h) had lower mortality than those who were intubated later (>24h) (Mortality rates were %4,3,%65,6,%93,3 respectively). The cut-off value for ROX index, which will indicate the need for intubation, was found to be 2.84. Conclusion High Flow Nasal Cannula Oxygen Therapy can be an effective treatment method in the follow-up of patients with COVID-19-related severe respiratory failure. Despite this, the requirement for intubation develops in two third of the patients. Early intubation reduces mortality in patients who fail High Flow Nasal Cannula Oxygen Therapy, and the easily calculated ROX index is a useful parameter to determine the need for intubation.","output":"Factors affecting the failure of high flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy in intensive care follow-up of COVID-19 severe respiratory failure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral respiratory infections are a leading cause of acute morbidity in the community.

Moreover, unlike with other viruses, severity of influenza infection is high at all ages, but especially in older individuals. Influenza vaccine, which has been available for half a century, has proved effective in preventing hospitalizations for pneumonia and influenza during outbreaks of influenza types A and B. The antiviral agents amantadine and rimantadine provide approximately equivalent, and significant, efficacy in protection against clinical illness resulting from influenza type A only. However, the potential for side effects is more marked with amantadine. Some studies have shown that the rate of treatment withdrawal is no greater with rimantadine than with placebo.

Design/methodology/approach: Law students (n = 417) filled in an anonymous questionnaire on their relative satisfaction with the four methods and their preferences. Participation was voluntary. The questionnaire was administered at the end of term, in class, prior to the Covid-19 restrictions. The results were calculated using Statistical Package for Social Sciences. Findings: The students preferred face-to-face T&L in class and ranked online T&L last. Notably, 84% preferred blended learning combining all four methods. These results suggest that the online T&L for this Contract Law course setting was unsuccessful and that teachers should experiment with blending various T&L methods to maximize learning effectiveness and students' satisfaction. Research limitations/implications: The results only reflect one course in one year among law students, thus affecting the generalizability of the findings. This is further exacerbated by the convenience sample and the fact that only one type of blending was evaluated. Overall, the findings indicated that the survey participants were not yet ready to embrace online T&L as a primary component of blended T&L. Practical implications: This study Alternative online solutions should be sought to foster social learning when face-to-face learning is not feasible for reasons, such as geographic distance, students' disabilities or the current pandemic that prohibits social gatherings. This conclusion is particularly pertinent with respect to the impact of Covid-19 on face-to-face learning. Designers of blended learning programs should listen more carefully to students' voices, and bear in mind that minimizing face-to-face T&L for various reasons might jeopardize students' satisfaction, which is likely to decrease learning effectiveness. Social implications: It is important that students' perceptions be considered when building future T&L programs, especially students' need for collaborative and social learning. Originality/value: This study assessed four T&L methods administered in one course during the pre-Covid-19 era. This setting, which is rare, enabled a real-life assessment of the effectiveness of these popular methods as perceived by students.

BACKGROUND LAA exclusion has been used to prevent thrombus formation within the LAA in AF patients and is believed to decrease the risk of cardioembolic events. METHODS LAA ligation with the Lariat device was performed in 139 patients with nonvalvular AF. LAA closure was verified during the procedure by LA angiography and transesophageal echocardiography. A follow-up transesophageal echocardiography was performed at 30 to 45 days post-procedure. After the procedure, patients received aspirin only, clopidogrel only, aspirin plus clopidogrel, or no antithrombotic drugs. Patients did not receive transition oral anticoagulation therapy post-LAA ligation. Patients were followed for LAA closure and adverse events, including stroke, systemic events, and death. RESULTS Acute closure was accomplished in 138 of 139 treated patients (99%). In 1 patient, a posterior lobe was partially closed. At the day-30 to day-45 transesophageal echocardiography (n = 127), 114 (90%) had complete LAA closure, and 13 (10%) had a 2- to 4-mm leak. There were no leaks 5 mm. The periprocedural adverse event rate was 11.5%, including 2 cardiac perforations and 1 death due to pulmonary embolus. Over a mean follow-up of 2.9  1.1 years, the event rate for the composite endpoint of stroke and systemic embolism was 1.0% per year (n = 4). The combined stroke, embolism, and death of any cause event rate was 2.8% (n = 11) per year. CONCLUSIONS The findings from this analysis of post-procedure event rates suggest that LAA ligation with the Lariat device effectively closes the LAA and may be a beneficial approach to reduce the risk of embolic events in AF patients ineligible to oral anticoagulation therapy. However, future randomized clinical trials are needed to verify these results and to determine device and procedural safety.","output":"Left Atrial Appendage Ligation in Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation Patients at High Risk for Embolic Events With Ineligibility for Oral Anticoagulation: Initial Report of Clinical Outcomes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of adult coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), with assessment of respiratory clinical severity and outcomes when cared for by pediatric intensivists utilizing specific care processes.

Originality: As far as we know, no metaheuristics has been developed for vaccine distribution, and specifically, to support the Brazilian government. Research method: A metaheuristic is developed based on the combination and adaptation of GRASP (Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure) with VND (Variable Neighborhood Descent), considering different refinement operators. Finally, as a way of validating the model, a numerical application in the state of Pernambuco (Brazil) was performed. Main findings: Metaheuristic proved to be effective for developing adequate planning for the allocation of ampoules with vaccines to combat COVID-19. Effective analysis was obtained in the evaluation of the proposed algorithm, both in terms of computational effort and the quality of the final solution. An efficiency of approximately 75% was obtained in relation to the current distribution procedure adopted by the state of Pernambuco. Implications for theory and practice: To mitigate disease, adequate logistics for transporting and distributing vaccines is essential, especially in emergency situations to face pandemic crises. Thus, the developed metaheuristic can support governments and companies in any situation demanded, making the decision of how the distribution of the ampoules will be more agile. ? 2021.

In an effort to better understand the mechanisms involved in protection from coronavirus infection, we are studying the role of the idiotypic network in the modulation of viral infectivity. We have explored the feasibility of using single-chain antibodies displayed on phage surfaces for the isolation of recombinant anti-idiotypic antibodies (anti-Ids) with antigen-mimicking properties, which has proven to be difficult with conventional hybridoma approaches. A phage-display library containing more than 10(8) different antibody specificities was screened for the presence of anti-Ids by successive rounds of panning with three different in vitro neutralizing and in vivo protective antiviral monoclonal antibodies. After five rounds of panning, between 32% and 84% of all individual clones tested showed antibody-binding in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Although several clones showed identical antibody sequences, a number of different clones were identified and further characterized. None of the selected clones induced the production of antiviral or neutralizing antibodies or conferred reproducible protection from viral challenge in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. These results demonstrate that anti-Ids can be isolated from a phage-display library, although high-affinity antigen-mimicking phages with antiviral protective capacities were apparently not represented in this library. This argues for the development of more diverse phage-display libraries.","output":"Characterization of phage-displayed recombinant anti-idiotypic antibody fragments against coronavirus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Telemedicine and related e-health facilities facilitate care from a distance through electronic information systems.

More than two hundred countries around the world have already been affected by this severe virus as it spreads by human interaction. Moreover, the symptoms of novel coronavirus are quite similar to the general seasonal flu. Screening of infected patients is considered as a critical step in the fight against COVID-19. As there are no distinctive COVID-19 positive case detection tools available, the need for supporting diagnostic tools has increased. Therefore, it is highly relevant to recognize positive cases as early as possible to avoid further spreading of this epidemic. However, there are several methods to detect COVID-19 positive patients, which are typically performed based on respiratory samples and among them, a critical approach for treatment is radiologic imaging or X-Ray imaging. Recent findings from X-Ray imaging techniques suggest that such images contain relevant information about the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Application of Deep Neural Network (DNN) techniques coupled with radiological imaging can be helpful in the accurate identification of this disease, and can also be supportive in overcoming the issue of a shortage of trained physicians in remote communities. In this article, we have introduced a VGG-16 (Visual Geometry Group, also called OxfordNet) Network-based Faster Regions with Convolutional Neural Networks (Faster R-CNN) framework to detect COVID-19 patients from chest X-Ray images using an available open-source dataset. Our proposed approach provides a classification accuracy of 97.36%, 97.65% of sensitivity, and a precision of 99.28%.

Remdesivir has been authorized for the treatment of COVID-19. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the incidence of AKI in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The incidence of AKI in different subgroups was also investigated. METHODS: A thorough search was performed to find relevant studies in PubMed, Web of Science, medRxiv and EMBASE from 1 Jan 2020 until 1 June 2020. The systematic review was performed using the meta package in R (4.0.1). RESULTS: A total of 16,199 COVID-19 patients were included in our systematic review. The pooled estimated incidence of AKI in all hospitalized COVID-19 patients was 10.0% (95% CI: 7.0C12.0%). The pooled estimated proportion of COVID-19 patients who needed continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was 4% (95% CI: 3C6%). According to our subgroup analysis, the incidence of AKI could be associated with age, disease severity and ethnicity. The incidence of AKI in hospitalized COVID-19 patients being treated with remdesivir was 7% (95% CI: 3C13%) in a total of 5 studies. CONCLUSION: We found that AKI was not rare in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The incidence of AKI could be associated with age, disease severity and ethnicity. Remdesivir probably did not induce AKI in COVID-19 patients. Our systematic review provides evidence that AKI might be closely associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, which should be investigated in future studies.

The state of China in the 1990s is focussed on and possible effects of provincial income inequality on individual health status are explored. METHODS A multilevel regression model is used to analyse the data collected in 1991, 1993 and 1997 from nine provinces included in the China Health and Nutrition Survey. The effects of provincial Gini coefficients on self-rated health in each year are evaluated by two logistic regressions estimating the odds ratios of reporting poor or fair health. The patterns of this effect are compared among the survey years and also among different demographic groups. RESULTS The analyses show an independent effect of income inequality on self-reported health after adjusting for individual and household variables. Furthermore, the effect of income distribution is not attenuated when household income and provincial gross domestic product per capita are included in the model. The results show that there is an increased risk of about 10-15% on average for fair or poor health for people living in provinces with greater income inequalities compared with provinces with modest income inequalities.

AIMS This 48-week open-label extension study primarily investigated long-term safety of tofacitinib 5 and 10 mg b.d. and secondarily investigated efficacy as maintenance therapy in patients with Crohn's disease. METHODS Patients who had completed the phase 2b maintenance study, or withdrawn due to treatment failure, were enrolled. Patients in remission (Crohn's disease activity index <150) at baseline received tofacitinib 5 mg b.d.; all others received 10 mg b.d. A single dose adjustment was allowed after 8 weeks' fixed, open-label treatment. RESULTS Sixty-two patients received tofacitinib 5 mg b.d.; 88 received 10 mg b.d. Both groups had similar rates of adverse events and serious infections. Crohn's disease worsening was the most frequent adverse event for tofacitinib 5 (33.9%) and 10 mg b.d. (19.3%). Patients not in remission at baseline, receiving 10 mg b.d., had higher rates of serious adverse events (19.3%) and discontinuation attributed to insufficient clinical response (30.7%) vs 5 mg b.d. (8.1% and 9.7%, respectively). At week 48, of patients with baseline remission receiving 5 mg b.d., 87.9% maintained remission and 75.0% sustained remission as observed (46.8% and 38.7%, respectively, by non-responder imputation). Study design prevented between-dose efficacy comparisons. CONCLUSIONS No new safety signals emerged. Although both doses showed generally similar safety outcomes for overall adverse events, serious adverse events were more frequent for tofacitinib 10 than 5 mg b.d.

Quantitative PCR is the gold standard tool for qNAATs; however, there is a need to develop point-of-care (POC) qNAATs to manage infectious diseases in outpatient clinics, low- and middle-income countries, and the home. Isothermal amplification methods are an emerging tool for POC NAATs as an alternative to traditional PCR-based workflows. Previous works have focused on relating isothermal amplification bulk fluorescence signals to input copies of target nucleic acids for sample quantification with limited success. In this work, we show that recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) reactions on paper membranes exhibit discrete fluorescent amplification nucleation sites. We demonstrate that the number of nucleation sites can be used to quantify HIV-1 DNA and RNA in less than 20 minutes. An image-analysis algorithm quantifies nucleation sites and determines the input nucleic acid copies in the range of 67-3,000 copies per reaction. We demonstrate a mobile phone-based system for image capture and onboard processing, illustrating that this method may be used at the point-of-care for qNAATs with minimal instrumentation.","output":"Quantitative Isothermal Amplification on Paper Membranes using Amplification Nucleation Site Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the worldwide spreading of the dreaded COVID-19 epidemic, wearing masks becomes the most effective approach to prevent infectious respiratory diseases from transmission, for continuous monitoring of respiratory signals acts as a significant status in the treatment of respiratory diseases.

However, the relationship between COVID-19 and acute cerebrovascular diseases is unclear. AIMS: We aimed to characterize the incidence, risk factors, clinicalCradiological manifestations, and outcome of COVID-19-associated stroke. METHODS: Three medical databases were systematically reviewed for published articles on acute cerebrovascular diseases in COVID-19 (December 2019CSeptember 2020). The review protocol was previously registered (PROSPERO ID = CRD42020185476). Data were extracted from articles reporting 5 stroke cases in COVID-19. We complied with the PRISMA guidelines and used the NewcastleCOttawa Scale to assess data quality. Data were pooled using a random-effect model. SUMMARY OF REVIEW: Of 2277 initially identified articles, 61 (2.7%) were entered in the meta-analysis. Out of 108,571 patients with COVID-19, acute CVD occurred in 1.4% (95%CI: 1.0C1.9). The most common manifestation was acute ischemic stroke (87.4%); intracerebral hemorrhage was less common (11.6%). Patients with COVID-19 developing acute cerebrovascular diseases, compared to those who did not, were older (pooled median difference = 4.8 years; 95%CI: 1.7C22.4), more likely to have hypertension (OR = 7.35; 95%CI: 1.94C27.87), diabetes mellitus (OR = 5.56; 95%CI: 3.34C9.24), coronary artery disease (OR = 3.12; 95%CI: 1.61C6.02), and severe infection (OR = 5.10; 95%CI: 2.72C9.54). Compared to individuals who experienced a stroke without the infection, patients with COVID-19 and stroke were younger (pooled median difference = ?6.0 years; 95%CI: ?12.3 to ?1.4), had higher NIHSS (pooled median difference = 5; 95%CI: 3C9), higher frequency of large vessel occlusion (OR = 2.73; 95%CI: 1.63C4.57), and higher in-hospital mortality rate (OR = 5.21; 95%CI: 3.43C7.90). CONCLUSIONS: Acute cerebrovascular diseases are not uncommon in patients with COVID-19, especially in those whom are severely infected and have pre-existing vascular risk factors. The pattern of large vessel occlusion and multi-territory infarcts suggests that cerebral thrombosis and/or thromboembolism could be possible causative pathways for the disease.","output":"Stroke in COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Testing for SARS-CoV-2 using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests is a significant part of the effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

Factors associated with the outbreak and lockdown can exacerbate CHF. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed the answers of 124 randomly selected CHF outpatients (mean age 71.0  14.0 years, 60.5% male) interviewed by phone during the sixth and seventh weeks of the lockdown. Most patients were treated for New York Heart Association class II (38.7%) and reduced ejection fraction HF (70.2%). Psychological distress (Kessler 6 score &#8805; 5) was common (18.5%), and 21.8% felt worse than before the lockdown. Few patients (n = 10) adjusted their intake of HF medications, always on medical prescription. Decreased physical activity was common (41.9%) and more frequent in women (P = 0.025) and urban dwellers (P = 0.009). Almost half of respondents (46.0%) declared increased screen time, but only few declared more alcohol intake (4.0%). Weight gain was common (27.4%), and 44.4% of current smokers increased tobacco consumption. Adherence to recommended salt or fluid intake restrictions was reduced in 14.5%.

Incontinence and care dependence threatens patient dignity. The aim of this research was to explore, describe and explain the concept of dignity as it relates to continence care for older people requiring long-term care. METHODS The first four steps of Rodgers evolutionary method of concept analysis were followed. First, a comprehensive and systematic search of databases and key guidelines about continence care was undertaken to identify empirical research about dignity and continence care in older people in facilities that provide permanent residential or inpatient care of older people for day-to-day living. Data were extracted on the authors, date, sample, country of origin, and key definitions, attributes, contexts and consequences from each included record. Findings were inductively analysed and grouped according to whether they were the key attributes and antecedents of dignity in relation to continence care or the consequences of undignified continence care. RESULTS Of 625 articles identified, 18 were included in the final analysis. Fifty individual attributes were identified that were categorised in 6 domains (respect, empathy, trust, privacy, autonomy and communication). A further 15 were identified that related to the environment (6 physical and 9 social). Key consequences of undignified continence care were also identified and categorised into 3 levels of impact (resident/family member, staff or organisation).

In mammalian cells, microtubule bundles called kinetochore-fibers (k-fibers) connect chromosomes to the spindle poles. Chromosome segregation thus depends on the mechanical integrity of k-fibers. Here, we investigate the physical and molecular basis of k-fiber bundle cohesion. We detach k-fibers from poles by laser ablation-based cutting, thus revealing the contribution of pole-localized forces to k-fiber cohesion. We then measure the physical response of the remaining kinetochore-bound segments of the k-fibers. We observe that microtubules within ablated k-fibers often splay apart from their minus-ends. Furthermore, we find that minus-end clustering forces induced by ablation seem at least partially responsible for k-fiber splaying. We also investigate the role of the k-fiber-binding kinesin-12 Kif15. We find that pharmacological inhibition of Kif15-microtubule binding reduces the mechanical integrity of k-fibers. In contrast, inhibition of its motor activity but not its microtubule binding ability, i.e., locking Kif15 into a rigor state, does not greatly affect splaying. Altogether, the data suggest that forces holding k-fibers together are of similar magnitude to other spindle forces, and that Kif15, acting as a microtubule crosslinker, helps fortify and repair k-fibers. This feature of Kif15 may help support robust k-fiber function and prevent chromosome segregation errors.

Method: A cross-sectional online survey examining students' characteristics, volunteer status, adoption of evidence-based preventive measures, trust in information sources used, infectious disease training, and knowledge of PPE usage in relation to perceived risk of infection from SARS-CoV-2 in daily living, academic, and healthcare activities. A multivariate path model estimated the simultaneous influences of all exogenous factors on perceived risk. A Poisson regression model assessed the same multivariate effects on knowledge of PPE usage. Results: The analysis sample included 537 respondents. Perceived risk of infection was highest in hospital activities. On average, students were able to use only four out of seven types of PPE albeit they adopted most of the evidence-based preventive measures. Adoption of preventive measures was positively associated with perceived risk of COVID infection. Conversely, training on PPE usage and volunteer work were associated with lower perceived risk in healthcare setting and higher PPE knowledge.

METHODS: Literature searches were conducted using keywords related to COVID-19: physical activity, mobility, and lifestyle behaviors. Eligibility criteria were peer-reviewed empirical and quantitative studies published in English, addressing COVID-19 and using physical activity and/or sedentary behavior as the study outcomes. RESULTS: Out of 61 eligible studies, the majority (78.3%) were conducted in Asian and European countries, with only four (6.7%) being US studies. The results showed that COVID-19 was linked with significant decreases in mobility, walking, and physical activity, and increases in sedentary activity. A few studies also reported contradicting results including increased uses of parks/trails and increased recreational activity among certain groups of population.

We explored the hypothesis that a conserved His-rich cluster (His-Gly-His-His) in the linker region connecting its two catalytic domains senses pH and affects PAM trafficking by mutating these His residues to Ala (Ala-Gly-Ala-Ala; H3A). Purified recombinant wild-type and H3A linker peptides were examined using circular dichroism and tryptophan fluorescence; mutation of the His cluster largely eliminated its pH sensitivity.

While numerous seroprevalence reports have been published by blood operators during the COVID-19 pandemic, details on the assay used has not been well documented. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the diversity of assays being used by blood operators and assess how this may affect seroprevalence estimates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We surveyed 49 blood component providers from 39 countries. Questionnaire included information on the number and identity of assays used, the detected immunoglobulin(s) and target antigen, and performance characteristics (sensitivity, specificity). RESULTS: Thirty-eight of the 49 contacted blood suppliers provided at least partial responses. The results indicate that 19 commercial and five in-house serology assays have been used by surveyed blood operators. The Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay was the most commonly used kit and utilized by 15 blood suppliers. Two assays did not detect IgG, but detected either IgM/IgA or IgM. 682% of assays targeted the spike protein and 50% the nucleocapsid protein, while 182% targeted both viral proteins. The sensitivity and specificity of IgG-specific assays ranged from 719% to 100% and from 962% to 100%, respectively. As of 18 October 2020, the seroprevalence was below 5% in 10 of 14 countries reporting. CONCLUSION: Our results highlight the diversity of assays being used. Analyses comparing blood donor seroprevalence across countries should consider assay characteristics with optimization of signal/cut-off ratios and consistent methodology to adjust for waning antibody.","output":"An international comparison of anti-SARS-COV-2 assays used for seroprevalence surveys from blood component providers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage (DAH) is a life-threatening pulmonary complication occurring after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) without an explicit aetiology or a standard treatment.

We retrospectively evaluated 92 consecutive patients among 3987 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of DAH following allo-HSCT (HID: 71 patients, MRD: 21 patients). The incidence of DAH after allo-HSCT was 2.3%, 2.4% after HID-HSCT and 2.0% after MRD-HSCT (P = 0.501). The prognosis of patients with DAH after transplantation is extremely poor. The duration of DAH was 7.5 days (range, 1C48 days). The probabilities of overall survival (OS) were significantly different between patients with and without DAH within 2 years after transplantation (P < 0.001). According to the Cox regression analysis, a significant independent risk factor for the occurrence of DAH was delayed platelet engraftment (P < 0.001), and a high D-dimer level (>500 ng/ml) was a significant risk factor for the poor prognosis of DAH.

A multitarget treatment that modulates multifaceted biological functions might be more effective than a single-target approach. Here, the therapeutic efficacy of combination treatment using anti-A antibody NP106 and curcumin analog TML-6 versus monotherapy was investigated in an APP/PS1 mouse model of AD. Our data demonstrate that both combination treatment and monotherapy attenuated brain A and improved the nesting behavioral deficit to varying degrees. Importantly, the combination treatment group had the lowest A levels, and insoluble forms of A were reduced most effectively. The nesting performance of APP/PS1 mice receiving combination treatment was better than that of other APP/PS1 groups. Further findings indicate that enhanced microglial A phagocytosis and lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines were concurrent with the aforementioned effects of NP106 in combination with TML-6. Intriguingly, combination treatment also normalized the gut microbiota of APP/PS1 mice to levels resembling the wild-type control. Taken together, combination treatment outperformed NP106 or TML-6 monotherapy in ameliorating A pathology and the nesting behavioral deficit in APP/PS1 mice. The superior effect might result from a more potent modulation of microglial function, cerebral inflammation, and the gut microbiota.

This relationship could be caused by Galectin-3-mediated increased immune response and increased viral attachment. Keeping PDs under control and maintaining rigorous oral hygiene during this troubled Covid-19 pandemic period is very important. Patients with older age and pre-existing conditions like cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity are in the higher risk group for developing severe Covid-19 infections. The inflammatory pathways that are involved in these conditions are the same pathways that we see in periodontal diseases (PDs). This raises a significant question: Is PD a pre-existing condition that can increase the risk of developing severe Covid-19 infection? Several studies have shown that Galectins play a key role in the homeostasis of immune cells, and recently, a relationship was found between Covid-19 and Galectin-3 (Gal-3).It has been determined that an important area in the spike protein of Coronavirus-19 is almost exactly the same as the morphology of Gal-3, and these spike proteins are critical for the entry of the virus into host cells. We suspect that there is enough evidence to support a close relationship between PDs severity and Covid-19 infections. There is accumulating evidence to suggest a relationship between the severity of PD and the risk of infection with Covid-19, which requires further investigation. This relationship could be caused by Gal-3-mediated increased immune response and increased viral attachment. In this context, we want to emphasize the importance of keeping PD under control by maintaining rigorous oral hygiene during this troubled Covid-19 pandemic period. We would also like to point out the possibility that having PD may be a pre-disposition toward developing a severe Covid-19 infection.","output":"Is periodontal disease a risk factor for developing severe Covid-19 infection?

The objective of this study was to implement a daily standardized behavioral test of smell sensitivity in healthcare workers (HCW) to capture changes in smell sensitivity over time and to assess whether these changes occur prior to positive COVID test. METHODS: The study enrolled 500 high-risk COVID-negative HCW during the COVID-19 epidemic in Connecticut, beginning March 28, 2020 (80% F, mean age 38, 58% nurses). Initially, HCW received a daily symptom questionnaire with parosmia screening questions. On April 23 we introduced the Jiffy, a daily at-home psychophysical test of smell sensitivity, where olfactory stimuli are sampled and rated for perceived intensity. SARS-CoV-2 infection was tested every three days by PCR of nasopharyngeal swabs or saliva. Screening Questionnaire for Parosmia [Image: see text] The Jiffy Survey and Test [Image: see text] RESULTS: Of the first 500 enrolled HCW, 376 HCW (75%) completed the Jiffy 4528 times (mean 12 times/HCW). 17/500 HCW (3.4%) had a COVID+ test, of which 9/17 (53%) reported smell loss through the Jiffy or the daily symptom survey. 6/9 (67%) reported smell loss that preceded or was concurrent with a COVID+ test. 8/17 COVID+ HCW completed the Jiffy, with 5/8 (63%) reporting reductions in smell versus 42/368 (11%) COVID- HCW (OR=13, 95% CI: 2.4C85, p=.001). COVID+ HCW rated their greatest reduction in smell sensitivity as slight (40%) and severe (60%), versus slight (88%) and moderate (12%) in COVID- HCW. 16/17 COVID+ HCW completed a daily symptom survey (mean 14 times/HCW), with 8/16 (50%) ever reporting parosmia versus 90/466 (19%) of COVID- HCW (OR=4.2, 95% CI: 1.3C13, p=.007). Overall, parosmia was the first reported symptom in 3/13 (23%) COVID+ HCW who reported symptoms.

METHODS We conducted an online survey of health departments in the United States in 2015 to understand factors influencing health departments' decision making when choosing whether to implement social distancing measures. We paired survey results with data on area population demographic characteristics and analyzed them with a focus on broad trends. RESULTS Of 600 health departments contacted, 150 (25%) responded.

We sought to test if muscular weakness, as assessed by handgrip strength, was associated with extubation outcome. METHODS: Prospective multicenter trial over an 18 months period in six mixed ICUs. Adults receiving mechanical ventilation for at least 48 h were eligible. Just before weaning trial, HG, Maximal Inspiratory Pressure (MIP), Peak Cough Expiratory Flow (PCEF) and Medical Research Council (MRC) score were registered. The attending physicians were unaware of the tests results and weaning procedures were conducted according to guidelines. Occurrence of unscheduled reintubation, non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or high-flow nasal continuous oxygen (HFNC) because of respiratory failure within 7 days after extubation defined extubation failure. The main outcome was the link between HG and extubation outcome. RESULTS: 233 patients were included. Extubation failure occurred in 51 (22.5%) patients, 39 (17.2%) required reintubation. Handgrip strength was 12 [6C20] kg and 12 [8C20] kg, respectively, in extubation success and failure (p = 0.85). There was no association between extubation outcome and MRC score, MIP or PCEF. Handgrip strength was well correlated with MRC score (r = 0.718, p < 0.0001). ICU and hospital length of stay were significantly higher in the subset of patients harboring muscular weakness as defined by handgrip performed at the first weaning trial (respectively, 15 [10C25] days vs. 11 [7C17] days, p = 0.001 and 34 [19C66] days vs. 22 [15C43] days, p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: No association was found between handgrip strength and extubation outcome. Whether this was explained by the appropriateness of the tool in this specific setting, or by the precise impact of ICUAW on extubation outcome deserves to be further evaluated.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the mental health of children and adolescents. Our hypothesis is that the school closure during the pandemic with a gradual transfer to virtual schooling had an important impact on children's and adolescents' suicidal behavior. Therefore, we aimed to determine possible changes in the frequency of assessments as well as frequency and severity of suicidal behavior in the population of Slovene children and adolescents seeking emergency psychiatric help in correlation with the progression of the pandemic and online schooling. METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational analysis of medical records of all children and adolescents referred to the only 24-h emergency in- and outpatient child and adolescent psychiatry service in Slovenia from March 2019 through the end of July 2021. We extracted number of assessments, number of patients with suicidal ideation and with attempted suicide. A comparison between the same periods prior to the pandemic and during the pandemic was made. The months of school closure due to the COVID-19 restriction measures and the months without closures were also compared. RESULTS: During this period, 1966 children and adolescents were assessed. There was no statistically significant difference in the observed frequency of emergency visits when we compared all the months with to all the months without school closures, or when individual corresponding months with and without school closures were compared. However, there were statistically significantly more patients with suicidal ideation [t(16) = ?2.739, p = 0.015; W = 25.0, p = 0.016] and patients who had attempted suicide [t(16)= ?3.412, p= 0.004; W = 14.5, p =0.006] during the pandemic as individually compared to the corresponding pre-pandemic months. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the number of Slovene children and adolescents who required emergency psychiatric help with suicidality and attempted suicide increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase was shown only after the first year of the pandemic. The observed increase did not appear to directly correspond to the school closures, but was more likely related to the duration of the pandemic.","output":"Suicidal Behavior in Emergency Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Service Users Before and During the 16 Months of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Vascular spasm is well known to occur in the arterial system. Central venous spasm during pacemaker implantation is uncommon with only a few cases reported from time to time. Sometimes, the venous spasms may not respond to nitroglycerine injections which requires a change of access site and undue discomfort for the patient. CASE PRESENTATION A 72-year-old female patient with no prior comorbidities presented to us with recurrent dizziness on exertion and at rest. The electrocardiogram showed complete heart block, likely to be of sclerodegenerative etiology as the patient did not have any ischemic symptoms, also the electrocardiogram and echocardiogram did not show any evidence of ischemia. As part of the hospital protocol, a venogram was performed by giving intravenous diluted contrast (iohexol) through the left brachial vein, which showed good-sized axillary and subclavian veins. We attempted to cannulate the left axillary vein with a 16G needle using Seldinger technique, but the axillary vein could not be cannulated despite multiple attempts. We gave incremental boluses of intravenous nitroglycerine, despite that the left axillary vein could not be cannulated. Repeat intravenous contrast injection showed severe spasm of axillary and subclavian veins. Finally, the axillary vein was cannulated from the right side using anatomical landmarks and a pacemaker was implanted. CONCLUSIONS Venous spasm during device implantation although uncommon, it should be anticipated in patients with difficult cannulation to prevent inadvertent complications like pneumothorax and arterial injuries.

Alamandine (ALA) is a recently described protective peptide of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with essential tasks in several conditions. Our group previously demonstrated that ALA is reduced by 365% in the plasma of patients with idiopathic PF, and thus, it is plausible to believe that stimulation of this peptide could represent an important therapeutic target. In this sense, this study investigates the effects of ALA in an experimental model of PF. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bleomycin (BLM) was administrated in Wistar rats, and these fibrotic animals were treated with ALA for 14 days. Body weight, histology, respiratory, and hemodynamic parameters were analyzed to study the effects of ALA. RESULTS: ALA treatment attenuated the development of fibrosis (P < 0.0001), reduced respiratory system elastance (P < 0.0001), and preserved weight gain (P < 0.0001) in fibrotic animals without affecting the autonomic control of blood pressure and heart rate. CONCLUSION: The data from this study demonstrate the potential of ALA to alleviate pulmonary fibrosis and improve respiratory system mechanics in vivo. The promising results encourage more detailed investigations of the potential of ALA as a future and efficient antifibrotic.","output":"Assessment of Alamandine in Pulmonary Fibrosis and Respiratory Mechanics in Rodents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The burden of stroke is comparatively greater in Asian countries than in the Western world.

The objective of this study was to explore risk factors, medication use, incidence, and one-year recurrence of stroke in Taiwan. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide cohort study by reviewing all hospitalized patients ( 18 years) with a primary diagnosis of ischemic stroke between 2001 and 2011 from Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. RESULTS: A total of 291,381 first-ever ischemic stroke patients were enrolled between 2000 and 2011. The average age was about 70 years and approximately 58.6% of them were men. While prevalence of diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia, as well as use of statins, antiplatelet agents, and oral anticoagulant agents for atrial fibrillation significantly increased; incidence (142.3 vs. 129.5 per 100,000 in 2000 and 2011, respectively) and one-year recurrence (9.6% vs. 7.8% in 2000 and 2011, respectively) of stroke declined during this period of time.

Aims: We investigated how the COVID-19 pandemic influenced surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), focusing on patients with hepatitis C virus infection who were receiving surveillance for HCC after sustained virologic response (SVR) in Japan. Methods: Patients who achieved SVR between 1995 and 2017 and continued receiving surveillance were compared by month in terms of the rate at which they kept their scheduled visits for HCC surveillance from July 2019 to May 2020. Results: The percentage of kept scheduled visits was above 97% before February 2020. By contrast, it declined sharply after March 2020 when COVID-19 became pandemic; the percentages were 75.5% in March, 63.0% in April, and 49.1% in May 2020 (July 2019-February 2020 vs. March-May 2020, p<0.0001). Similar declines were observed in patients with cirrhosis or advanced fibrosis and in those with a history of HCC. Whereas most patients who cancelled a scheduled visit before February 2020 did not reschedule it, the majority of patients with cancellations after March 2020 did want to reschedule. Conclusions: The percentages of scheduled visits that were kept declined rapidly after COVID-19 became pandemic in Japan, where the spread of COVID-19 is relatively mild and the legal restriction of people's behavior and movement is absent.

During this COVID-19 pandemic there have been, at least, three consecutive single stories-the 'lethal threat' story, followed by the 'economic threat' story, and finally the 'vaccine miracle' story. None of these single stories can convincingly and permanently capture the dynamics of the pandemic. This is because countries experienced different morbidity and mortality patterns, different socioeconomic disadvantage, age and vulnerability of population, timing and level of lockdown with economic variability, and, despite heavy promotion, vaccines were beset with a significant and variable degree of hesitancy. Lack of transparency, coherence and consistency of pandemic management-arising from holding on to single storylines-showed the global deficiency of public health policy and planning, an underfunding of (public) health and social services, and a growing distrust in governments' ability to manage crises effectively. Indeed, the global management has increased already large inequities, and little has been learnt to address the growing crises of more infectious and potentially more lethal virus mutations. Holding onto single stories prevents the necessary learnings to understand and manage the complexities of 'wicked' problems, whereas listening to the many stories provides insights and pathways to do so effectively as well as efficiently.","output":"The danger of the single storyline obfuscating the complexities of managing SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From November to December 2020, the third wave of COVID-19 cases in Korea is ongoing.

an emerging and highly infectious disease making global public health concern and socio-economic burden. It is caused due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). It has the tendency to spread rapidly through person-to-person. Currently, several molecular diagnostic platforms such as PCR, qRT-PCR, reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), CRISPR are utilized for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. These conventional techniques are costly, time consuming and require sophisticated instrumentation facility with well trained personnel for testing. Hence, it is tough to provide testing en-masse to the people in developing countries. On the other hand, several serological biosensors such as lateral flow immunosensor, optical, electrochemical, microfluidics integrated electrochemical/fluorescence is currently utilized for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2.

OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to describe the development process of CoSMoS (COVID-19 Symptoms Monitoring System), which consists of a self-monitoring algorithm-based Telegram bot and a teleconsultation system. We describe all the essential steps from clinical perspectives and technical approaches in designing, developing, and integrating the system into the clinical practice during the COVID-19 pandemic and lessons learned from this development process. METHODS: CoSMoS was developed in three phases: 1) Requirement formation to identify clinical problems and drafting the clinical algorithm. 2) Development-testing iteration using the agile software development method. 3) Integration into clinical practice to design an effective clinical workflow using repeated simulations and role-plays. RESULTS: A total of 19 days was used to complete the development of CoSMoS. In phase 1 (requirement formation), we have identified three main functions: daily automated reminder system for patients to self-check their symptoms, safe patients' risk assessment to guide patients in clinical decision making, and active telemonitoring system with an in-time phone consultation. The system architecture of CoSMoS involved five components: Telegram instant messaging, clinician dashboard, system admin (backend), database, and DevOps infrastructure. The integration of CoSMoS in clinical practice involved the consideration of the COVID-19 infectivity and patient safety.

Accordingly, testing is crucial for mitigating the economic and public health effects. In order to facilitate point-of-care diagnosis, this study aims at presenting a label-free electrochemical biosensor as a powerful nanobiodevice for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein detection. Utilizing the IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody onto the electrode surface as a specific platform in an ordered orientation through staphylococcal protein A (ProtA) is highly significant in fabricating the designed nanobiodevice. In this sense, the screen-printed carbon electrode modified with Cu2O nanocubes (Cu2O NCs), which provide a large surface area in a very small space, was applied in order to increase the ProtA loading on the electrode surface. Accordingly, the sensitivity and stability of the sensing platform significantly increased. The electrochemical evaluations proved that there is a very good linear relationship between the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and spike protein contents via a specific binding reaction in the range 0.25 fg mL-1 to 1 g mL-1. Moreover, the assay when tested with influenza viruses 1 and 2 was performed in 20 min with a low detection limit of 0.04 fg mL-1 for spike protein without any cross-reactivity. The designed nanobiodevice exhibited an average satisfactory recovery rate of ~ 97-103% in different artificial sample matrices, i.e., saliva, artificial nasal, and universal transport medium (UTM), illustrating its high detection performance and practicability.

Two scenarios were considered in order to compare talazoparib with the alternatives of capecitabine, vinorelbine and eribulin: 1. Chemotherapy in patients pre-treated with anthracyclines/taxanes and, 2. A second- and subsequent-line treatment option. Treatment types following relapse were recorded in the mentioned clinical trial. The effectiveness measure used was quality-adjusted life years (QALY). The average health cost of patients treated at 43 months with talazoparib was 84,360.86, whilst current treatment costs were 26,683.90. The effectiveness of talazoparib was 1.93 years of survival (1.09 QALY) relative to 1.58 years (0.83 QALY) in the treatment group. The incremental cost-utility ratio was 252,420.04/QALY. This represents the additional cost required to earn an additional QALY when changing from regular treatment to talazoparib. Regarding budgetary impact, the number of patients susceptible to receiving treatment with between 94 and 202 talazoparib was estimated, according to scenario and likelihood. The 3-year cost difference was between 6.9 and 9 million euros. The economic evaluation conducted shows an elevated incremental cost-utility ratio and budgetary impact.

We conducted a retrospective analysis in inpatients with confirmed COVID-19 on the anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic effects of enoxaparin and fondaparinux at prophylactic doses. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used patients with confirmed COVID-19 during the first months of the Italian outbreak from February 18 to April 30, 2020. Our aim was to compare clinical characteristics, prophylactic treatment, markers of inflammation, and thrombotic outcomes in inpatients positive for SARS-CoV2 during hospitalization associated with thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin (40 mg or 60 mg once daily) or fondaparinux (2.5 mg once daily). Statistical analysis was conducted with using MatLab R2016B and ad hoc functions. RESULTS: There were no significatant differences in clinical characteristics between patients that used enoxaparin or fondaparinux as thromboprophylaxis for SARS-CoV2. No differences were found in D-dimer and fibrinogen levels either, which were used as markers of inflammation during the infection at testing on admission and after 3 weeks.Significant differences in CRP, IL6, and LDH were found in patients after 21 days treatment. DISCUSSION: Increased levels of fibrinogen and D-dimer in patients with confirmed COVID-19 have been reported in several studies. Our results showed that anti-inflammatory effects of fondaparinux and enoxaparin after 3 weeks of prophylactic treatment were similar when levels of fibrinogen and D-dimer were considered. Furthermore, levels of CRP showed a decrease in patients treated with enoxaparin and fondaparinux, although the decrease in the fondaparinux group seems to be more relevant.","output":"Antithrombotic and Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Fondaparinux and Enoxaparin in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients: The FONDENOXAVID Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dexamethasone (Dex), as a pretreatment agent, is widely used to attenuate the side effects of chemotherapy in breast cancer treatment. However, whether and how Dex affects breast cancer metastasis remain to be furtherly understood. In this study, we established several mouse breast cancer metastatic models to study the effect of Dex in vitro and in vivo. Transwell, Western Blot and RNA interference were applied to study the molecular mechanism of Dex in promoting breast cancer cell migration. Meanwhile, the effect of Dex on lung metastasis of breast cancer in Dex combined with PTX chemotherapy was discussed. Our results confirmed that Dex could promote breast cancer cell metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic studies revealed that this pro-metastatic effect of Dex was mediated by the GR-PI3K-SGK1-CTGF pathway in tumor cells. Ligation of Dex and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) on tumor cells activated the PI3K signaling pathway and upregulated serum glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1) expression, and then increased the expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) through Nedd4l-Smad2. Moreover, Dex was the leading factor for lung metastasis in a standard regimen for breast cancer treatment with paclitaxel and Dex. Importantly, targeting SGK1 with the inhibitor GSK650394 remarkably reduced lung metastasis in this regimen. Our present data provide new insights into Dex-induced breast cancer metastasis and indicate that SGK1 could be a candidate target for the treatment of breast cancer metastasis.","output":"Dexamethasone enhances the lung metastasis of breast cancer via a PI3K-SGK1-CTGF pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccination forms a key part of public health strategies to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 globally.

Ribavirin is prescribed for chronic hepatitis C and is contraindicated in women who are pregnant and in the male sexual partners of women who are pregnant. Both sexes are advised to avoid pregnancy for 6 months after exposure. The Ribavirin Pregnancy Registry was established in 2003 to monitor pregnancy exposures to ribavirin for signals of possible human teratogenicity. METHODS: This voluntary registry enrolls pregnant women with prenatal exposure to ribavirin. Exposure is classified as directwomen taking ribavirin during pregnancy or the 6 months prior to conceptionor indirectwomen exposed through sexual contact, 6 months prior to or during pregnancy, with a man who is taking or has taken ribavirin in the past 6 months. Women are followed until delivery and infants for 1 year. When enrollment is complete, birth defect rates will be compared with the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Programs published rate of 2.67. Using data collected since inception in 2003 through February 2016, preliminary rates were calculated. RESULTS: The registry has enrolled 272 pregnant women, with 180 live births: there were seven birth defect cases among 85 directly exposed women [7/85 (8.2%) (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.4C16.2)] and four birth defect cases among 95 indirectly exposed women [4/95 (4.2%) (95% CI 1.2C10.4)]. Of the 11 infants, nine had structural defects and two had chromosomal anomalies. Patterns suggesting a common etiology or relationship with ribavirin exposure are not seen. CONCLUSION: Based on the patterns of birth defects reported, preliminary findings do not suggest a clear signal of human teratogenicity for ribavirin. However, the current sample size is insufficient for definitive conclusions, and ribavirin exposure should be avoided during pregnancy and during the 6 months prior to pregnancy, in accordance with prescribing information.

Multiprofessional communication became more difficult, weakening stewardship activities. AIM: To determine changes in bacterial co-/secondary infections and antibiotics used in COVID-19 patients in critical care, and mortality rates, between the first and second waves. METHODS: Prospective audit comparing bacterial co-/secondary infections and their treatment during the first two waves of the pandemic in a single centre teaching hospital ICU. Data on demographics, daily antibiotic use, clinical outcomes, and culture results in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection were collected over 11 months. FINDINGS: From 9/3/20 to 2/9/20 (Wave 1), there were 156 patients and between 3/9/20 and 1/2/21 (Wave 2) there were 235 patients with COVID-19 infection admitted to intensive care. No significant difference was seen in mortality or positive blood culture rates between the two waves. The proportion of patients receiving antimicrobial therapy (93.0% vs 81.7%; p<0.01), and the duration of meropenem use (median (interquartile range): 5 (2-7) vs 3 (2-5) days; p=0.01) was lower in Wave 2.

We sought to identify whether there are distinct Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score trajectory-based subphenotypes in sepsis. Methods: We created 72-hour SOFA score trajectories in patients with sepsis from two diverse intensive care unit (ICU) cohorts. We then used Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to compute patient similarities to capture evolving heterogeneous sequences and establish similarities between groups with distinct trajectories. Hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) was utilized to identify subphenotypes based on SOFA trajectory similarities. Patient characteristics were compared between subphenotypes and a random forest model was developed to predict subphenotype membership, within 6 hours of ICU arrival. The model was then tested on the validation cohort. Results: A total of 4,678 and 3,665 unique sepsis patients were included in development and validation cohorts. In the development cohort, four subphenotypes of organ dysfunction were identified: Rapidly Worsening (n=612, 13.08%), Delayed Worsening (n=960, 20.52%), Rapidly Improving (n=1,932, 41.3%) and Delayed Improving (n=1174, 25.1%). In-hospital mortality for patients within different subphenotypes demonstrated distinct patterns over time. Similar subphenotypes and their associated outcome patterns were replicated in the multicenter validation cohort. Conclusion: Four novel, clinically-defined, trajectory-based sepsis subphenotypes were identified and validated. Trajectory based subphenotyping is useful for describing the natural history of sepsis in the ICU.

Antibody, T cells, natural killer cells, complement, phagocytes, and interferon are involved in the response to nearly all infections and, without any doubt, are together responsible for recovery. There is good evidence that T-cell-mediated immunity is of supreme importance in recovery from a variety of microbial infections. These are the infections in which the microorganism replicates intracellularly. Tissue responses in the host bear the hallmarks of T-cell involvement, the infiltrating cells consisting primarily of lymphocytes and macrophages. Inflammation, whether induced by immunological reactions, tissue damage or microbial products, plays a vital role in recovery from infection. Inflammation is necessary for the proper functioning of the immune defenses because it focuses all circulating antimicrobial factors onto the site of infection. Complement can carry out antimicrobial activities. However, there is little direct evidence that the antimicrobial activities of complement are in fact important in the body. Interferons also act on uninfected cells, binding to a cell surface receptor and activating a number of genes involved in immunity to viruses.

The ExoDont app delivers reminders for postoperative instructions and drug intake at defined intervals, thus fostering self-reliance among patients in taking their prescribed dose of medication. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to design, develop, and validate ExoDont, an innovative app for improved adherence to postoperative instructions after tooth extraction. METHODS: A postoperative treatment protocol was developed by a team of oral and maxillofacial surgeons and general dentists, following which the clinical and technological requirements of the app were determined along with the software engineers, graphic designers, and applications architect in the team. ExoDont was developed to provide timely reminders for medication and postoperative care. The app was field tested and validated using the User Version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale. RESULTS: The ExoDont software design was divided into a 3-level architecture comprising a user interface application, logical layer, and database layer. The software architecture consists of an Android-based ExoDont app for patients and a web version of the admin panel. The testing and validation of the ExoDont app revealed that Perceived Impact received the highest mean score of all rated components (mean 4.6, SD 0.5), while Engagement received the lowest mean score (mean 3.5, SD 0.8).

Identification of viral targets that are indispensable for the virus can be targeted to inhibit mutation-based new escape variant development. The 5-polyU tract of the antigenome offers such a target. Host cells do not harbor 5-polyU tracts on any of their transcripts, making the tract an attractive, virus-specific target. Inhibiting the 5-polyU can limit the use of the tract as template to generate 3 polyA tails of +RNAs of coronaviruses. Here, a modified DNA oligo with 3 polyAs is used to target the 5-polyU tract in mouse coronavirus (MHV-A59). The oligo treatment in mouse 17CL-1 cells infected with MHV-A59 significantly prevented virus-induced cell deaths. This proof-of-concept result shows a unique mode of action against mouse coronavirus without affecting host cells, and can be used for the development of novel classes of drugs that inhibit coronavirus infection in host cells, specifically by the COVID-19-causing virus SARS-CoV-2. In addition, as the 5-polyU tract is immediately generated upon infection, the tag can also be targeted for reliable early detection of viral infection. End of Abstract The global havoc brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic is becoming more exacerbated by the rapidly spreading etiological SARS-CoV-2 virus variants [1]. Though vaccination against the virus has paced up, apprehensions surrounding so-called immune-escape-variants raise concern for a worsening of the pandemic. Lack of enough vaccines have caused many countries to extend the gap between the two doses of vaccinations, which may lead to long durations of intermediate levels of immunity that could accelerate the emergence of new variants [2]. The potential consequences of emerging variants are increased transmissibility, increased pathogenicity and the ability to escape natural- or vaccine-induced immunity [3]. Drugs with high efficacy against the virus have not been developed yet. Concerns also surround whether drug-escape-variants, like immune-escape-variants, can evolve against any drug developed targeting the virus. Targeting coding regions directly can potentially lead to the evolution of escape variants.","output":"The Achilles heel of coronaviruses: targeting the 5 Polyuridines tract of the antigenome to inhibit Mouse coronavirus-induced cell death"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Large organizations that collect data about populations (like the US Census Bureau) release summary statistics that are used by multiple stakeholders for resource allocation and policy making problems.

RVs exacerbate chronic airway disease and confound the clinical diagnosis of influenza-like illness. We sought to estimate the spectrum of RV diversity, RV species seasonality and to breakdown RV involvement in respiratory virus co-detections by comprehensive molecular testing of a convenience collection of airway sample extracts from patients with suspected respiratory infections, collected during 2001. RVs were the most common virus detected. We were able to genotype 90% of RV detections, identifying 70 distinct RVs, spanning all three species. RV-Bs were under-represented. We found RV species co-circulated at times, although one species usually dominated. Each species displayed a bimodal distribution. Notably, RVs and influenza A viruses (IFAV) seldom co-occurred, supporting their roles as primary pathogens of the airway among acutely ill infants. Whether RV circulation has a moderating or controlling effect on the IFAV season or is controlled by it cannot be determined from these data. Despite the frequent perception that RVs commonly co-occur with another virus, our findings indicated this was not the case. Nearly 80% of RV detections occurred alone. Understanding more about population-level interference between viruses may allow us to harness aspects of it to generate a non-specific antiviral intervention that mimics a putative protective effect. For routine respiratory virus screening to best serve the patient, RV testing should be a principal component of any acute respiratory illness testing algorithm throughout the year.","output":"Genotypic diversity, circulation patterns, and co-detections among rhinoviruses in Queensland, 2001"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the law becomes increasingly globalised and online education is increasingly emphasised, clinical legal education presents new opportunities for transnational collaboration. With more law schools introducing global clinical experiences into their curriculum, clinicians, students, clients, and practitioners are facing a host of new questions, challenges, and obstacles. These challenges are practical, logistical, ethical, and cultural. As research has found, finding a means of addressing these issues in ways that advance social justice has proven difficult. Striking a balance between client service and student learning, navigating relationships between different learning institutions, and setting ambitious but attainable goals are important elements of any clinic, but become increasingly vital for the success of a transnational clinical programme. Despite these obstacles and foundational questions, we argue that transnational clinical education presents benefits to all parties involved. This article assesses the methods, strengths, weaknesses, and outcomes of a collaboration between Cornell Law Schools Human Rights Clinic and National Law University (NLU), Delhi, that took place in 2017. This clinic focused on advocacy in favour of lifting bans on compensated surrogacy in both India and New York, culminating in two reports, an event at the United Nations, and testimony before the New York State Assembly. Twelve students from Cornell Law School and eight students from NLU, Delhi met weekly in a global classroom equipped with video and chat functions to discuss the goals of the clinic, background readings, and their respective projects within the clinic. Eight students from Ithaca travelled to Delhi for eight days, conducting interviews and engaging in fact-finding with NLU, Delhi students. Together, students and clinicians from Cornell Law School and NLU, Delhi authored two reports, one focused on the U.S., and one focused on India, which were disseminated to each countrys governments. Our reflections on this programme are meant to serve as a learning experience for other clinicians considering implementing a transnational clinical legal education opportunity.","output":"Transnational law as a framework for law clinics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection remains a challenge. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the combined measurement of the levels of two synovial fluid biomarkers, -defensin and C-reactive protein (CRP), for the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection. METHODS One hundred and forty-nine synovial fluid aspirates, including 112 from patients with an aseptic diagnosis and thirty-seven from patients with periprosthetic joint infection, met the inclusion criteria for this prospective study. Synovial fluid aspirates were tested for -defensin and CRP levels with use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) definition of periprosthetic joint infection was utilized for the classification of cases as aseptic or infected. Comorbidities, such as inflammatory conditions, that could confound a test for periprosthetic joint infection were documented, but the patients with such comorbidities were included in the study. RESULTS The combination of synovial fluid -defensin and CRP tests demonstrated a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 100% for the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection. Synovial fluid -defensin tests alone demonstrated a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 96% for the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection. Synovial fluid CRP tests, with a low threshold of 3 mg/L, reversed all-false positive -defensin results without affecting the sensitivity of the test. The diagnostic characteristics of these assays were achieved in a population of patients demonstrating a 23% rate of systemic inflammatory diseases (in the series as a whole) and a 27% rate of concurrent antibiotic treatment (in the infection group). The synovial fluid levels of -defensin in the setting of periprosthetic joint infection were unchanged during concurrent antibiotic treatment. CONCLUSIONS The combined measurement of synovial fluid -defensin and CRP levels correctly diagnosed 99% of the cases in this study as aseptic or infected. This was achieved despite the inclusion of patients with systemic inflammatory disease and those receiving treatment with antibiotics. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Diagnostic Level II.

RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) tests are accurate but costly, making regular testing of every individual expensive. The costs are a challenge for all countries and particularly for developing countries. Cost reductions can be achieved by combining samples and testing them in groups. We propose an algorithm for grouping subsamples, prior to testing, based on the geometry of a hypercube. At low prevalence, this testing procedure uniquely identifies infected individuals in a small number of tests. We discuss the optimal group size and explain why, given the highly infectious nature of the disease, parallel searches are preferred. We report proof of concept experiments in which a positive sample was detected even when diluted a hundred-fold with negative samples. Using these methods, the costs of mass testing could be reduced by a factor of ten to a hundred or more. If infected individuals are quickly and effectively quarantined, the prevalence will fall and so will the costs of regularly testing everyone. Such a strategy provides a possible pathway to the longterm elimination of SARS-CoV-2.

NETs also promote tumor progression and metastasis, by modulating angiogenesis, anti-tumor immunity, blood clotting and inflammation and providing a supportive niche for metastasizing cancer cells. Besides neutrophils, other immune cells such as eosinophils, dendritic cells, monocytes/macrophages, mast cells, basophils and lymphocytes can also form extracellular traps (ETs) during cancer progression, indicating possible multiple origins of extracellular DNA in cancer.

This paper introduces a model of the immune response to a virus. This is based upon the same sort of mean-field dynamics as used in epidemiology. However, in place of the location, clinical status, and other attributes of people in an epidemiological model, we consider the state of a virus, B and T-lymphocytes, and the antibodies they generate. Our aim is to formalise some key hypotheses as to the mechanism of resistance. We present a series of simple simulations illustrating changes to the dynamics of the immune response under these hypotheses. These include attenuated viral cell entry, pre-existing cross-reactive humoral (antibody-mediated) immunity, and enhanced T-cell dependent immunity. Finally, we illustrate the potential application of this sort of model by illustrating variational inversion (using simulated data) of this model to illustrate its use in testing hypotheses. In principle, this furnishes a fast and efficient immunological assay--based on sequential serology--that provides a (i) quantitative measure of latent immunological responses and (ii) a Bayes optimal classification of the different kinds of immunological response (c.f., glucose tolerance tests used to test for insulin resistance).

Recent recommendations to treat perinatally infected infants within the first year of life are feasible only if early diagnosis is routinely available. Dried blood spots (DBS) on filter paper are an easy and convenient way to collect and transport blood samples. A rapid and cost effective method to diagnose and quantify HIV-1 from DBS is urgently needed to facilitate early diagnosis of HIV-1 infection and monitoring of antiretroviral therapy. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We have developed a real-time LightCycler (rtLC) PCR assay to detect and quantify HIV-1 from DBS. HIV-1 RNA extracted from DBS was amplified in a one-step, single-tube system using primers specific for long-terminal repeat sequences that are conserved across all HIV-1 clades. SYBR Green dye was used to quantify PCR amplicons and HIV-1 RNA copy numbers were determined from a standard curve generated using serially diluted known copies of HIV-1 RNA. This assay detected samples across clades, has a dynamic range of 5 log(10), and %CV <8% up to 4 log(10) dilution. Plasma HIV-1 RNA copy numbers obtained using this method correlated well with the Roche Ultrasensitive (r = 0.91) and branched DNA (r = 0.89) assays. The lower limit of detection (95%) was estimated to be 136 copies. The rtLC DBS assay was 2.5 fold rapid as well as 40-fold cheaper when compared to commercial assays. Adaptation of the assay into other real-time systems demonstrated similar performance.

Few studies have explored nurse perspectives regarding this communication modality for rural pediatric cohorts. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this qualitative study was to learn from the experiences of rural hospice nurses caring for children at the end of life using telehealth modalities to inform palliative communication. METHODS: Voice-recorded qualitative interviews with rural hospice nurse telehealth users inquiring on nurse experiences with telehealth. Semantic content analysis was used. RESULTS: About 15 hospice nurses representing nine rural hospice agencies were interviewed. Nurses participated in an average of eight telehealth visits in the three months prior. Nurses were female with a mean age of 38 years and an average of seven years of hospice nursing experience. Five themes about telehealth emerged: accessible support, participant inclusion, timely communication, informed and trusted planning, and familiarity fostered. Each theme had both benefits and cautions associated as well as telehealth suggestions. Nurses recommended individualizing communication, pacing content, fostering human connection, and developing relationships even with technology use. CONCLUSION: The experiences of nurses who use telehealth in their care for children receiving end-of-life care in rural regions may enable palliative care teams to understand both the benefits and challenges of telehealth use. Nurse insights on telehealth may help palliative care teams better honor the communication needs of patients and families while striving to improve care access.","output":"Human Touch via Touchscreen: Rural Nurses' Experiential Perspectives on Telehealth Use in Pediatric Hospice Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: With the global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an increasing number of clinical trials are being designed and executed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of various therapies for COVID-19 We conducted this survey to assess the methodological quality of registry protocols on potential treatments for COVID-19 Methods: Clinical trial protocols were identified on the ClinicalTrials gov and the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry Protocols were screened by two investigators independently against pre-defined eligibility criteria Quality of the included protocols was assessed according to the modified 14-item SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) 2013 Statement Results: We included 82 randomized controlled trial (RCT) protocols investigating treatment modalities for COVID-19 These ongoing trials are being conducted in 16 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities of China, and study interventions were either Western medicines (n = 56) or traditional Chinese medicine (n = 26) Findings of our quality assessment indicated that the existing trial protocols could be further improved on several aspects, including selection and definition of outcome measures, descriptions of study interventions and comparators, study subject recruitment time, definition of study inclusion and exclusion criteria, and allocation concealment methods Descriptions of random sequence generation methodologies were accurate for the majority of included trial protocols (n = 64;78 05%);however, reporting of allocation concealment remained unclear in 63 (76 83%) protocols Therefore, the overall risk of selection bias across these RCTs was judged to be unclear A total of 52 (63 41%) included RCT protocols were open-label trials and are thus associated with a high risk of performance bias and detection bias Conclusion: Quality of currently available RCT protocols on the treatments for COVID-19 could be further improved For transparency and effective knowledge translation in real-world clinically settings, it is important for trial investigators to standardize baseline treatments for patients with COVID-19 and assess clinically important core outcome measures Despite eager anticipation from the public on the results of effectiveness trials in COVID-19, robust design, execution, and reporting of these trials should be regarded as high priority","output":"Quality Assessment of the Chinese Clinical Trial Protocols Regarding Treatments for Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The trafficking of proteins such as aquaporin-2 (AQP2) in the exocytotic pathway requires an active actin cytoskeleton network, but the mechanism is incompletely understood. Here, we show that the actin-related protein (Arp) 2/3 complex, a key factor in actin filament branching and polymerization, is involved in the shuttling of aquaporin-2 (AQP2) between the trans Golgi network (TGN) and the plasma membrane. Arp2/3 inhibition (using CK-666) or siRNA knockdown blocks vasopressin induced AQP2 membrane accumulation, and induces the formation of distinct AQP2 perinuclear patches positive for markers of TGN-derived clathrin coated vesicles. After a 20oC cold block, AQP2 formed perinuclear patches due continuous endocytosis coupled with inhibition of exit from the TGN-associated vesicles. Upon rewarming, AQP2 normally leaves the TGN, and redistributes into the cytoplasm, entering the exocytotic pathway. Inhibition of Arp2/3 blocked this process, and trapped AQP2 in clathrin positive vesicles. Taken together, these results suggest that Arp2/3 is essential for AQP2 trafficking, specifically for its delivery into the post-TGN exocytotic pathway to the plasma membrane.","output":"Actin-related protein (Arp) 2/3 complex plays a critical role in the aquaporin-2 exocytotic pathway."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introdu??o Com 40 anos do incio da epidemia, alm de supress?o de Carga Viral (CV),  esperado melhora da qualidade de vida das Pessoas que Vivem com HIV/Aids (PVHA), especialmente nas popula??es-chave.

First, testing an air filter using monodispersed sodium chloride aerosols simulating solid aerosols is presented. A common method to characterize filter performance is the grade efficiency wherein the filter is challenged using monodispersed aerosol of a given size. The aerosol concentration is measured respectively upstream and downstream of the filter from which the grade efficiency can be determined. The grade efficiencies for aerosols of different sizes in the submicron- and nano-size range can be experimentally determined. The grade efficiency curve provides a characteristic signature of the filter, for which the performance of one filter can be compared with the other. On the other hand, a common test organic liquid aerosol, dioctyl phthalate, is often used for testing filter that is used for filtering liquid aerosols. Instead of using monodispersed aerosols, a continuous aerosol distribution with a preselected small size range using the scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) can also be used to challenge the filter. A comparison has been made between the monodispersed and SMPS aerosols challenging the same test filter revealing small difference in the filtration efficiency between the two test aerosol systems. Subsequently, we discuss other noncommon testing aerosols, such as silver nanoparticles, for testing the small aerosol size <50nm. The size of the silver oxide nanoparticles can be controlled by the furnace temperature on the silver. Aerosols of 100nm can be generated from polystyrene latex solution that is conveniently used for testing face masks. For 0.3m and above, ISO test dusts from the fine to coarser grades are also available for filter testing. Subsequently, aerosol loading on a filter using polydispersed aerosols is discussed. The second part of the chapter deals with a few popular filter standards and ratings. The standards for face mask and respirator are discussed with some details as there is a strong demand of both filters during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is followed by a discussion on the minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) rating testing on a filter for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) applications.

While mothers are often the primary engagers with health facilities, their independence in illness-related decisions is shaped by various factors. Drawing on a gender lens, we explored treatment-seeking pathways pre- and post-hospital admission for acutely ill young children living in low income settlements in Nairobi, Kenya; and the gendered impact of child illness both at the household and health system level. METHODS: Household members of 22 children admitted to a public hospital were interviewed in their homes several times post hospital discharge. In-depth interviews covered the childs household situation, health and illness; and the familys treatment-seeking choices and experiences. Children were selected from an observational cohort established by the Childhood Acute Illness and Nutrition (CHAIN) Network. RESULTS: Treatment-seeking pathways were often long and complex, with mothers playing the key role in caring for their children and in treatment decision-making. Facing many anxieties and dilemmas, mothers often consulted with significant influencers - primarily women - particularly where illnesses were prolonged or complex. In contrast to observations in rural African contexts, fathers were less prominent as influencers than (often female) neighbours, grandparents and other relatives. Mothers were sometimes blamed for their childs condition at home and at health facilities. Childrens illness episode and associated treatment-seeking had significant gendered socio-economic consequences for households, including through mothers having to take substantial time off work, reduce their working hours and income, or even losing their jobs. CONCLUSION: Women in urban low-income settings are disproportionately impacted by acute child illness and the related treatment-seeking and recovery process. The range of interventions needed to support mothers as they navigate their way through childrens illnesses and recovery include: deliberate engagement of men in child health to counteract the dominant perception of child health and care as a female-domain; targeted economic strategies such as cash transfers to safeguard the most vulnerable women and households, combined with more robust labour policies to protect affected women; as well as implementing strategies at the health system level to improve interactions between health workers and community members.","output":"Applying a gender lens to understand pathways through care for acutely ill young children in Kenyan urban informal settlements"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The responsiveness and the intertester reliability of the Finnish Canine Stifle Index (FCSI) were tested, and a cut-off between compromised and severely compromised performance level was set. METHODS: Three groups of dogs were used, 29 with any stifle dysfunction (STIF), 17 with other musculoskeletal disease except stifle (OTHER) and 11 controls (CTRL). All dogs were tested with the FCSI by the same physiotherapist at three occasions, at baseline, at six weeks and 10 weeks, and once also by another physiotherapist. RESULTS: Dogs in the STIF group demonstrated significantly higher (P<0.001) FCSI scores than in OTHER or CTRL groups at baseline. Only the STIF group showed a significant (P<0.001) change in FCSI score at all time points, indicating responsiveness to change. There were no significant differences between the evaluators (P=0.736), showing good intertester reliability, supported by moderate to good (0.78) intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The evaluator performing the FCSI did not have a significant effect when comparing the groups of dogs (P=0.214).

Colonization of the vaginal tract is normally dominated by Lactobacillus species. Both Lactobacillus and Enterococcus faecalis may secrete reutericyclin, which inhibits the growth of a variety of pathogenic bacteria. Increasing evidence suggests a potential therapeutic role for an analogue of reutericyclin, glycerol monolaurate (GML), against microbial pathogens. Previous studies using a macaque vaginal simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) transmission model demonstrated that GML reduces transmission and alters immune responses to infection in vitro. Previous studies showed that structural analogues of GML negatively impact other enveloped viruses. We sought to expand understanding of how GML inhibits HIV-1 and other enveloped viruses and show that GML restricts HIV-1 entry post-CD4 engagement at the step of coreceptor binding. Further, HIV-1 and yellow fever virus (YFV) particles were more sensitive to GML interference than particles matured by proteolytic processing.

The novel Visual-Grading for Ureteral Encrusted Stents (V-GUES) classification system goes from A to D, increasing the severity of encrustation. Results Encrusted stents could be removed with a single intervention in 112 patients (86.8%). Type A and B encrusted stents could be successfully removed in all patients (100 % success). Type D stents had minor retrieval and stone-free rates (p = 0.006 and p<0.0001, respectively). Stone-free status was achieved after the first procedure in 89 patients (69%). Flexible ureteroscopy had a low success rate (77.7%) in type C stents (OR 0.21). Combined access had a 100 % success rate to retrieve type C encrusted stents and a 92.9% success rate for type D encrusted stents (OR 9.18).

METHODS: We performed a planned secondary analysis of a cluster-randomized trial conducted from July 2011 to May 2015 including forty German hospitals. All adult patients with sepsis treated in the participating ICUs were included. Primary exposures were timing of antimicrobial therapy and delay of surgical source control during the first 48 h after sepsis onset. Primary endpoint was 28-day mortality. Mixed models were used to investigate the effects of timing while adjusting for confounders. The linearity of the effect was investigated by fractional polynomials and by categorizing of timing. RESULTS: Analyses were based on 4792 patients receiving antimicrobial treatment and 1595 patients undergoing surgical source control. Fractional polynomial analysis identified a linear effect of timing of antimicrobials on 28-day mortality, which increased by 0.42% per hour delay (OR with 95% CI 1.019 [1.01, 1.028], p  0.001).

Time to surgical source control was significantly associated with decreased odds of successful source control (OR = 0.982 [0.971, 0.994], p = 0.003) and increased odds of death (OR = 1.011 [1.001, 1.021]; p = 0.03) in unadjusted analysis, but not when adjusted for confounders (OR = 0.991 [0.978, 1.005] and OR = 1.008 [0.997, 1.02], respectively). Only, among patients with septic shock delay of source control was significantly related to risk-of death (adjusted OR = 1.013 [1.001, 1.026], p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that management of sepsis is time critical both for antimicrobial therapy and source control. Also patients, who are not yet in septic shock, profit from early anti-infective treatment since it can prevent further deterioration. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01187134).

The Attitudes About COVID-19 and Health (ATTACH) study focuses on understanding attitudes and beliefs while considering the impact on mental and physical health and the influence of broader demographic and geographic factors on attitudes, beliefs, and mental health burden. OBJECTIVE: In this assessment of our first wave of data collection, we provide baseline cohort description of the ATTACH study participants in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Mexico. Additionally, we assess responses to daily poll questions related to COVID-19 and conduct a cross-sectional analysis of baseline assessments collected in the UK between June 26 and October 31, 2020. METHODS: The ATTACH study uses smartphone app technology and online survey data collection. Participants completed poll questions related to COVID-19 2 times daily and a monthly survey assessing mental health, social isolation, physical health, and quality of life. Poll question responses were graphed using 95% ClopperCPearson (exact) tests with 95% CIs. Pearson correlations, hierarchical linear regression analyses, and generalized linear models assessed relationships, predictors of self-reported outcomes, and group differences, respectively. RESULTS: By October 31, 2020, 1405, 80, and 90 participants had consented to participate in the UK, United States, and Mexico, respectively. Descriptive data for the UK daily poll questions indicated that participants generally followed social distancing measures, but worry and negative impacts on families increased as the pandemic progressed. Although participants generally reported feeling that the reasons for current measures had been made clear, there was low trust that the government was doing everything in its power to meet public needs. In the UK, 1282 participants also completed a monthly survey (94.99% [1326/1396] White, 72.22% [1014/1404] female, and 20.12% [277/1377] key or essential workers); 18.88% (242/1282) of UK participants reported a preexisting mental health disorder, 31.36% (402/1282) reported a preexisting chronic medical illness, and 35.11% (493/1404) were aged over 65; 57.72% (740/1282) of participants reported being more sedentary since the pandemic began, and 41.89% (537/1282) reported reduced access to medical care. Those with poorer mental health outcomes lived in more deprived neighborhoods, in larger households (Ps<.05), had more preexisting mental health disorders and medical conditions, and were younger than 65 years (all Ps<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Communities who have been exposed to additional harm during the COVID-19 pandemic were experiencing worse mental outcomes. Factors including having a medical condition, or living in a deprived neighborhood or larger household were associated with heightened risk. Future longitudinal studies should investigate the link between COVID-19 exposure, mental health, and sociodemographic and residential characteristics.","output":"Attitudes About COVID-19 and Health (ATTACH): Online Survey and Mixed Methods Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed the lives of countless members of the general population. Older adults are known to experience loneliness, age discrimination, and excessive worry. It is therefore reasonable to anticipate that they would experience greater negative outcomes related to the COVID-19 pandemic given their increased isolation and risk for complications than younger adults. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to synthesize the existing research on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and associated isolation and protective measures, on older adults. The secondary objective is to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and associated isolation and protective measures, on older adults with Alzheimer disease and related dementias. METHODS: A rapid review of the published literature was conducted on October 6, 2020, through a search of 6 online databases to synthesize results from published original studies regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on older adults. The Human Development Model conceptual frameworkCDisability Creation Process was used to describe and understand interactions between personal factors, environmental factors, and life habits. Methods and results are reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Statement. RESULTS: A total of 135 records were included from the initial search strategy of 13,452 individual studies. Of these, 113 (83.7%) studies were determined to be of level 4 according to the levels of evidence classification by the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. The presence of psychological symptoms, exacerbation of ageism, and physical deterioration of aged populations were reported in the included studies. Decreased social life and fewer in-person social interactions reported during the COVID-19 pandemic were occasionally associated with reduced quality of life and increased depression. Difficulties accessing services, sleep disturbances, and a reduction of physical activity were also noted. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the need for adequate isolation and protective measures. Older adults represent a heterogeneous group, which could explain the contradictory results found in the literature. Individual, organizational, and institutional strategies should be established to ensure that older adults are able to maintain social contacts, preserve family ties, and maintain the ability to give or receive help during the current pandemic. Future studies should focus on specific consequences and needs of more at-risk older adults to ensure their inclusion, both in public health recommendations and considerations made by policy makers.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Older Adults: Rapid Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Bubble continuous positive airway pressure is an established therapy for infants in respiratory distress. In resource-limited settings, few treatment options exist for infants requiring further respiratory support. A bubble bilevel device has been developed to provide nonelectric, time-cycled, pressure-limited respiratory support. We compared the efficacy of bubble bilevel ventilation with conventional mechanical ventilation in sedated rabbits. METHODS: Six adult rabbits under inhaled isoflurane general anesthesia were ventilated by alternating intervals of conventional and bubble bilevel ventilation for three 10?15-min periods. During each period, interval arterial blood gas (ABG) measurements were obtained after at least 10 min on the respective mode of ventilation. RESULTS: The bubble bilevel system was able to deliver the following pressures: 20/7, 15/5, 12/5, 8/5 cm H(2)O. The estimated differences in arterial blood gas values on bubble bilevel vs. ventilator were as follows (normalized values): pH 7.41 vs. 7.40, pCO(2) 37.7 vs. 40, pO(2) 97.6 vs. 80. In addition, the bubble bilevel ventilation delivered consistent pressure waveforms without interruption for over 60 min on two rabbits. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates promising in vivo results on the efficacy of a novel bubble bilevel device, which may prove useful for infants in respiratory distress. IMPACT: Given the lack of personnel, funds or infrastructure to provide neonatal mechanical ventilation in resource-limited settings, additional low-cost, low-tech treatments are necessary to save infant lives. Bubble bilevel ventilation reliably delivers two levels of airway pressure to anesthetized rabbits resulting in normalization of blood gases comparable to those achieved on a traditional ventilator. If proven effective, simple technologies like this device have the potential to significantly impact neonatal mortality due to respiratory distress globally.","output":"Bubble bilevel ventilation facilitates gas exchange in anesthetized rabbits"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: We seek to report our management protocol and early outcomes of acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) repair during the early phase of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: From January 23 to April 30, 2020, we performed ATAAD repair for 33 patients, including three with pregnancy-related TAADs. Confirmation of COVID-19 depended on the results of two nucleic acid tests and pulmonary computed tomography scan. Based on testing results and hemodynamic stability, patients were triaged to an isolated intensive care unit or negative pressure operating room for emergency surgery. RESULTS: Mean age 50.2  13.3 years and 20 were male (60.1%) and 8 patients were febrile (>37.3C; 24.2%) and 17 were lymphopenic (51.5%). No patient was excluded from COVID-19 infection preoperatively. Extensive aortic repair with total arch replacement (TAR) was performed in 24 (72.7%), and limited proximal repair in 9 patients (27.3%). Cardiopulmonary bypass and cross-clamp times averaged 177  34 and 88  20 min for TAR, and 150  30 and 83  18 min for hemiarch, respectively. The mean operation time was 410  68.3 min. Operative mortality was 6.1% (2/33). Complications included reintubation in four (12.1%), acute kidney failure in two (6.1%), and cerebral infarction in one (3.0%). No paraplegia nor re-exploration for bleeding occurred. COVID-19 was excluded in 100% eventually. No nosocomial infection occurred.

During the processes of inflammation, disruption of the bloodCbrain barrier (BBB) may play a critical role in the enhancement of inflammatory responses and may initiate brain damage because the BBB constitutes an interface between the brain parenchyma and the bloodstream containing blood cells and plasma. The BBB has a distinct structure compared with those in peripheral tissues: it is composed of vascular endothelial cells with tight junctions, numerous pericytes surrounding endothelial cells, astrocytic endfeet, and a basement membrane structure. Under physiological conditions, the BBB should function as an important element in the neurovascular unit (NVU). High mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), a nonhistone nuclear protein, is ubiquitously expressed in almost all kinds of cells. HMGB1 plays important roles in the maintenance of chromatin structure, the regulation of transcription activity, and DNA repair in nuclei. On the other hand, HMGB1 is considered to be a representative damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) because it is translocated and released extracellularly from different types of brain cells, including neurons and glia, contributing to the pathophysiology of many diseases in the central nervous system (CNS). The regulation of HMGB1 release or the neutralization of extracellular HMGB1 produces beneficial effects on brain injuries induced by ischemia, hemorrhage, trauma, epilepsy, and Alzheimers amyloidpathy in animal models and is associated with improvement of the neurological symptoms. In the present review, we focus on the dynamics of HMGB1 translocation in different disease conditions in the CNS and discuss the functional roles of extracellular HMGB1 in BBB disruption and brain inflammation. There might be common as well as distinct inflammatory processes for each CNS disease. This review will provide novel insights toward an improved understanding of a common pathophysiological process of CNS diseases, namely, BBB disruption mediated by HMGB1. It is proposed that HMGB1 might be an excellent target for the treatment of CNS diseases with BBB disruption.","output":"High Mobility Group Box-1 and BloodCBrain Barrier Disruption"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose a simple dynamic model for estimating the relative contagiousness of two virus variants.

A modified one-pot polymerization method afforded a high-molecular-weight PI with sufficient film-forming ability from 2,2'-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzidine (TFMB) with a rod-like structure and H-PMDA. However, the PI film cast from its homogeneous solution did not have low CTEs, similar to the analogous system using meta-tolidine. To solve this problem, a series of amide- and amide-imide-containing diamines were designed and synthesized.

The cast films of certain systems examined in this study simultaneously achieved low CTEs, high optical transparency, considerably high glass transition temperatures (Tgs), and sufficient ductility. A possible mechanism for the generation of low CTEs, which is closely related to the spontaneous in-plane orientation behavior during solution casting, was proposed.

However, these vaccines are designed against SARS-CoV-2 isolated in Wuhan, China, and thereby may not be effective against other SARS-CoV-2 variants such as the United Kingdom variant (VUI-202012/01). The UK SARS-CoV-2 variant possesses D614G mutation in the Spike protein, which impart it a high rate of infection. Therefore, newer strategies are warranted to design novel vaccines and drug candidates specifically designed against the mutated forms of SARS-CoV-2. One such strategy is to target ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme2)CSpike protein RBD (receptor binding domain) interaction. Here, we generated a homology model of Spike protein RBD of SARS-CoV-2 UK strain and screened a marine seaweed database employing different computational approaches. On the basis of high-throughput virtual screening, standard precision, and extra precision molecular docking, we identified BE011 (Dieckol) as the most potent compounds against RBD. However, Dieckol did not display drug-like properties, and thus different derivatives of it were generated in silico and evaluated for binding potential and drug-like properties. One Dieckol derivative (DK07) displayed good binding affinity for RBD along with acceptable physicochemical, pharmacokinetic, drug-likeness, and ADMET properties. Analysis of the RBDCDK07 interaction suggested the formation of hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions, and hydrophobic interactions with key residues mediating the ACE2CRBD interaction. Molecular dynamics simulation confirmed the stability of the RBDCDK07 complex. Free energy calculations suggested the primary role of electrostatic and Van der Waals interaction in stabilizing the RBDCDK07 complex.

The extensive, long-term funding into research support structures, skilled people, and technology allowed the United Kingdom research response to move off the starting blocks at pace by utilizing pre-existing platforms. The increasing focus from funders on evaluating the outcomes and impact of research infrastructure investment requires both a reframing and progression of the current models in order to address the contribution of the underlying support infrastructure. The majority of current evaluation/outcome models focus on a pipeline approach using a methodology which follows the traditional research funding route with the addition of quantitative metrics. These models fail to embrace the complexity caused by the interplay of previous investment, the coalescing of project outputs from different funders, the underlying infrastructure investment, and the parallel development across different parts of the system. Research infrastructure is the underpinning foundation of a project-driven research system and requires long-term, sustained funding and capital investment to maintain scientific and technological expertise. Therefore, the short-term focus on quantitative metrics that are easy to collect and interpret and that can be assessed in a roughly 5-year funding cycle needs to be addressed. The significant level of investment in research infrastructure necessitates investment to develop bespoke methodologies that develop fit-for-purpose, longer-term/continual approach(es) to evaluation. Real-world research should reflect real-world evaluation and allow for the accrual of a narrative of value indicators that build a picture of the contribution of infrastructure to research outcomes. The linear approach is not fit for purpose, the research endeavour is a complex, twisted road, and the evaluation approach needs to embrace this complexity through the development of realist approaches and the rapidly evolving data ecosystem. This paper sets out methodological challenges and considers the need to develop bespoke methodological approaches to allow a richer assessment of impact, contribution, attribution, and evaluation of research infrastructure.

This limitation of the antibody-mediated immunity could be addressed by the T-cell mediated immunity, which is able to recognize conserved viral HLA peptides presented on virus-infected cells. Thus, by targeting conserved regions on the genome of a virus, T-cell epitope-based vaccines are less subjected to mutations and may work effectively on different strains of the virus. Here we propose a personalized workflow to identify an optimal set of T-cell epitopes based on the HLA alleles and the immunopeptidome of an individual person.

RESULTS: Women who preferred a community birth, on average, had less childbirth fear, had stronger beliefs that birth is a natural process, were less likely to see birth as a medical process, and were less stressed about being unprepared for birth and being infected with COVID\\\\19. In multivariate models, higher stress about perinatal COVID\\\\19 infection was associated with greater likelihood of preferring a community birth.

While some individuals remain nearly asymptomatic, others suffer from severe respiratory failure.

Methods: We made use of data on COVID-19 testing from 103,049 participants of the UK Biobank (mean age 71.5 years, 54.2% female), coupled to immunization records of the last ten years.

A complication is that not all trypanosome species are equally sensitive to all drugs and the reasons are at best partially understood. Here, we investigate whether drug transporters, mostly identified in T. b. brucei, determine the different drug sensitivities. We report that homologues of the aminopurine transporter TbAT1 and the aquaporin TbAQP2 are absent in T. congolense, while their introduction greatly sensitises this species to diamidine (pentamidine, diminazene) and melaminophenyl (melarsomine) drugs. Accumulation of these drugs in the transgenic lines was much more rapid. T. congolense is also inherently less sensitive to suramin than T. brucei, despite accumulating it faster. Expression of a proposed suramin transporter, located in T. brucei lysosomes, in T. congolense, did not alter its suramin sensitivity.

The results indicate that attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance correlate positively with the negative affect and correlate negatively with the positive affect. Furthermore, the results showed that the relationships between attachment dimensions and negative affect can be explained through psychological flexibility higher values of attachment dimensions contribute to lower psychological flexibility, which then leads to higher negative affect.

METHODS: In this prospective cross-sectional study, 140 patients who had at least one anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injection for nAMD within 12 months before COVID-19 pandemic and who had at least 3 months of unintended lapse for control visits during pandemic were recruited and underwent a detailed opthalmological examination and optical coherence tomography imaging. RESULTS: Of these 140 eyes, 113 (80.7%) were active with presence of either intraretinal and/or subretinal fluid and necessitated intravitreal anti-VEGF injections; and 20 (14.3%) of them complicated with subretinal hemorrhage. The mean interval of clinical visits and intravitreal antiVEGF injections were found to be prolonged during COVID-19 pandemics, which demonstrates a statistically significant lapse for both (p = 0.001 and p = 0.003 consecutively). The decreased visual acuity due to lapse was positively correlated with number of intravitreal anti-VEGF injections at last 6 months before COVID-19 pandemic (r = 0.217, p = 0.010) and central subfoveal thickness at first post-COVID-19 visit (r = 0.175, p = 0.038); and negatively correlated with follow-up duration (r = -0.231, p = 0.006) and number of control visits (r = -0.243, p = 0.004). Fifteen (16.9%) of the 89 patients who had drusen in the fellow eye before COVID-19 pandemic evolved to nAMD with an accompanying subretinal and/or intraretinal fluid.

Lumen formation requires that cells coordinately orient their polarity axis so that the basolateral domain is on the outside and apical domain inside epithelial structures. Here we show that the transmembrane aminopeptidase, CD13, is a key determinant of epithelial polarity orientation. CD13 localizes to the apical membrane and associates with an apical complex with Par6. CD13-deficient cells display inverted polarity in which apical proteins are retained on the outer cell periphery and fail to accumulate at an intercellular apical initiation site. Here we show that CD13 is required to couple apical protein cargo to Rab11-endosomes and for capture of endosomes at the apical initiation site. This role in polarity utilizes the short intracellular domain but is independent of CD13 peptidase activity.","output":"CD13 orients the apical-basal polarity axis necessary for lumen formation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The coronavirus pandemic has resulted in unprecedented rates of patients requiring intubation and ventilation over a short period of time. The authors present 3-month data on airway, voice and swallow outcomes for this cohort to better understand the impact of COVID-19 critical illness on laryngotracheal morbidity. Methods: : An observational cohort study was performed on all patients discharged following critical illness at our tertiary institution over a 2-month period (1st March 2020 - 30th April 2020). Patients were stratified on the basis of primary diagnosis: COVID-19 pneumonitis, Non-COVID-19 respiratory failure and non-respiratory. Our primary outcome measure was reported airway, voice, and swallow dysfunction during inpatient admission and on 6-12 week Critical Illness Recovery Clinic follow up. Endoscopic findings of patients referred onward to our Multidisciplinary Laryngology-Speech Therapy Clinic were recorded. Results: : 141 patients were included in our study. During inpatient admission there were no statistically significant differences in reported rates of airway, voice, or swallow dysfunction. In Critical Illness Recovery Clinic, there were markedly higher rates of reported airway, voice and swallow dysfunction in the COVID-19 pneumonitis cohort, although these rates only reached statistical significance in respect to airway outcomes (airway p=0.038, voice p=0.064, swallow p=0.240). 100% of patients reviewed to date in the Laryngology-Speech Therapy Clinic following COVID-19 critical illness had clinically significant laryngeal pathology.

Multicellular eukaryotes have therefore evolved a range of extrinsic and cell-autonomous mechanisms for restraining proliferation of aneuploid cells, including activation of the tumor suppressor protein p53. However, accumulating evidence indicates that a subset of aneuploid cells can escape p53-mediated growth restriction and continue proliferating in vitro. Here we show that such aneuploid cell lines display a robust modal karyotype and low frequency of chromosomal aberrations despite ongoing chromosome instability. Indeed, while these aneuploid cells are able to survive for extended periods in vitro, their chromosomally unstable progeny remain subject to p53-induced senescence and growth restriction, leading to subsequent elimination from the aneuploid pool. This mechanism helps maintain low levels of heterogeneity in aneuploid populations and may prevent detrimental evolutionary processes such as cancer progression and development of drug resistance.","output":"p53 induces senescence in the unstable progeny of aneuploid cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 academic interruption caused emergency pedagogical transformation of medical school curricula in the Spring of 2020 when the country went into lockdown. This transformation included changes in students contact hours, the use of technologies in classroom and laboratories, and the implementation of active self\\\\directed learning. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of these pedagogical changes on students academic and mental states. To achieve this goal, we proposed two questions: First question was to examine whether there was a difference between male and female students exam grades in the brain and behavior module during the COVID\\\\19 lockdown. In the second question, we examined whether there was a difference between students stress level in all age groups (22\\\\24), (25\\\\28) and 29 and above during the pandemic lockdown. This study employed a between\\\\subject design and utilized convenience sampling technique to include 79 first\\\\year medical students. The present study included the following variables: students module final exam grades, students perception about their stress levels during COVID\\\\19 and their age groups (22\\\\24), (25\\\\28) and 29 and above. We first used a comparison design between male and female students academic performance during COVID\\\\19. Further, we used a comparison design to compare between students stress level in all age groups (22\\\\24), (25\\\\28) and 29 and above during the pandemic lockdown. In the first question, the result of the one\\\\way between subject's ANOVA found that there was no statistically significant difference between male and female student grades in the brain and behavior module during the pandemic lockdown. These findings suggest that both male and female students were able to overcome many of the challenges triggered by the COVID\\\\19 in the learning environment and succeed in this module. In the second question, the one\\\\way between subject's ANOVA found that there was no statistically significant difference between students stress level in all age groups (22\\\\24), (25\\\\28) and 29 and above during the pandemic lockdown. These findings suggest that students in all ages felt the same level of stress during the COVID\\\\19 lockdown. We concluded that there was no difference in students final grades during pandemic, regardless of their gender, where all students maintained a high level of academic success. Additionally, students in all age groups were subjected to the same level of stress during COVID\\\\19.

METHODS: Migraine Buddy is a smartphone application by individuals to record their migraine headache episodes, characteristics, and coping mechanisms. For this study, anonymized self-reported data from 163,176 adult Migraine Buddy users in the United States between January 2020 and May 2020, were analyzed for migraines associated with stress. A stress-related migraine is defined as one in which stress or anxiety was reported as a trigger or symptom. A questionnaire on the impact of COVID-19 on migraine and its management was also completed by 923 users from the United States in the app between April 2020 and May 2020. RESULTS: 88% of the Migraine Buddy database extract and 84% of the respondents are female, with a mean age of 36.2 years. The proportion of stress-related migraine attacks peaked at 53% on March 21 to 23, although the number of migraine attacks decreased. This followed the declaration of the COVID-19 national emergency on March 13 and a spike in the number of COVID-19 cases in the United States. Questionnaire respondents felt that the following added more stress: social isolation (22.6%), information overdose (21.2%), access to essentials (food, medication, etc.) (18.7%), and financial concerns (17.8%). To help manage migraine during COVID-19, respondents suggested stress and diet coaching programs and resources (medical articles, etc.) (34.0%), having the option for home delivery of medication (30.6%) and tele-consulting (25.5%).

A modified CHA2DS2VASc score (M-CHA2D2VASc), developed by changing gender criteria from female to male, has been proposed to predict in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic accuracy of M-CHA2D2VASc for adverse clinical outcomes and short-term mortality in COVID-19 patients admitted to the Emergency Department. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective study of patients admitted to the ED who underwent computed tomography pulmonary angiography due to suspected pulmonary embolism or clinical worsening. Patients were stratified into three M-CHA2DS2-VASc risk-categories: low (0 - 1 points), intermediate (2 - 3 points) and high-risk ( 4 points). RESULTS: We included 300 patients (median age 71 years, 59% male). The overall mortality was 27%. The M-CHA2DS2-VASc score was higher in non-survivors compared to survivors [4 (IQR:3 - 5) vs 2 (IQR: 1 - 4), respectively, p < 0.001). The M-CHA2DS2-VASc score was identified as an independent predictor of mortality in a multivariable logistic regression model (OR 1.406, p = 0.007). The Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that the M-CHA2DS2-VASc score was associated with short-term mortality (log-rank test < 0.001), regardless of hospitalization (log-rank test p < 0.001 and p = 0.007, respectively). The survival proportion was 92%, 80% and 63% in the lower, intermediate, and higher risk-groups. As for the risk-categories, no difference was found in pulmonary embolism, Intensive Care Unit admission, and invasive mechanical ventilation. DISCUSSION: This is the first study to validate M-CHA2DS2-VASc score as a predictor of short-term mortality in patients admitted to the Emergency Department.

SETTING: An adult academic tertiary center in Indiana. PATIENTS: Patients were included in the analysis if they were screened 96 hours prior to or within 24 hours after undergoing a procedure in the operating room, cardiac catheterization lab, or endoscopy. METHODS: A report was generated from the electronic health record of patients undergoing procedures from a six week period of time (May 4th-June 14th, 2020). Health records for positive screens were reviewed and classified as symptomatic if they met either criteria: (1) screen performed due to presence of COVID-19 symptoms; (2) documentation of symptoms at the time of the screen.

Digital interventions that have been developed and evaluated in recent years may be used to mitigate the negative consequences of the pandemic. However, evidence-based recommendations on the use of existing telemedicine and internet-based (eHealth) and app-based mobile health (mHealth) interventions are lacking. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the theoretical and empirical base, user perspective, safety, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of digital interventions related to public mental health provision (ie, mental health promotion, prevention, and treatment of mental disorders) that may help to reduce the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A rapid meta-review was conducted. The MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and CENTRAL databases were searched on May 11, 2020. Study inclusion criteria were broad and considered systematic reviews and meta-analyses that investigated digital tools for health promotion, prevention, or treatment of mental health conditions and determinants likely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Overall, 815 peer-reviewed systematic reviews and meta-analyses were identified, of which 83 met the inclusion criteria. Our findings suggest that there is good evidence on the usability, safety, acceptance/satisfaction, and effectiveness of eHealth interventions. Evidence on mHealth apps is promising, especially if social components (eg, blended care) and strategies to promote adherence are incorporated. Although most digital interventions focus on the prevention or treatment of mental disorders, there is some evidence on mental health promotion.

However, the impact of HIV infection on SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and severity is a significant gap in the literature. In the same way, not many studies across the globe have analyzed the degree of vaccination willingness among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and considerations regarding prioritizing this population during vaccination plans, particularly in developing countries. METHODS: A descriptive-analytical cross-sectional study was conducted. Self-completed electronic surveys directed to PLWHA were performed via Twitter in February 2021, using accounts of HIV activists. RESULTS: 460 (87.1%) participants were willing to be vaccinated with any COVID-19 vaccine. The reasons for that were listed as 1) the belief that vaccination prevents both the COVID-19 infection (81.3%) as well as being a spreader (52.2%); 2) having a high occupational risk of becoming infected with COVID-19 (22%); and 3) the belief that they would be at high risk of death because of COVID-19 (21.3%). Only 56 (10.6%) participants expressed hesitancy toward vaccination, and 12 (2.2%) stated they did not want to get vaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: Our results may support the prioritization of people living with HIV during the implementation of vaccination plans in developing countries.

Classes with multiheaded scopes are the most popular among pathology trainees. Until recently, it was difficult to imagine that this educational approach could change. In the beginning of March 2020, our country faced a serious challenge, which all of us now know as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The rules of social distancing and work from home were applied. These types of restrictions were implemented in almost all parts of our life, including work and pathology education. OBJECTIVE.-: To share our experience in the Department of Hematopathology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center during the COVID-19 pandemic. We describe our experience in modifying our approaches to education. We show how we overcame many obstacles to learning by building one of the largest virtual hematopathology educational platforms via Cisco WebEx and using social media, in particular Twitter. These tools facilitated the learning of hematopathology by medical students, pathology trainees, and practicing pathologists from all over the world. DATA SOURCES.-: During the first 3 months of the pandemic (April, May, and June, 2020), we evaluated the visitor attendance to the MD Anderson Cancer Center Hematopathology Virtual Educational Platform using data collected by the Cisco WebEx Web site. To determine the impact that the platform had on medical education for the hematopathology community on Twitter, the analytic metrics obtained from Symplur LLC (www.symplur.com, April 27, 2020) were used via its Symplur Signals program.

Several LARPs have been characterized for their distinct activity in a specific aspect of RNA metabolism. The La-modules vary among the LARPs in linker length and RRM subtype. The La-modules of La protein and LARP7 bind and protect nuclear RNAs with UUU-3' tails from degradation by 3' exonucleases. LARP4 is a mRNA poly(A) stabilization factor that binds poly(A) and the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein PABPC1 (also known as PABP). LARP1 exhibits poly(A) length protection and mRNA stabilization similar to LARP4. Here, we show that these LARP1 activities are mediated by its La-module and dependent on a PAM2 motif that binds PABP. The isolated La-module of LARP1 is sufficient for PABP-dependent poly(A) length protection and mRNA stabilization in HEK293 cells. A point mutation in the PAM2 motif in the La-module impairs mRNA stabilization and PABP binding in vivo but does not impair oligo(A) RNA binding by the purified recombinant La-module in vitro. We characterize the unusual PAM2 sequence of LARP1 and show it may differentially affect stable and unstable mRNAs. The unique LARP1 La-module can function as an autonomous factor to confer poly(A) protection and stabilization to heterologous mRNAs.","output":"The isolated La-module of LARP1 mediates 3' poly(A) protection and mRNA stabilization, dependent on its intrinsic PAM2 binding to PABPC1."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection by the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59) requires the release of the viral genome by fusion with the respective target membrane of the host cell. Fusion is mediated by the viral S protein. Here, the entry pathway of MHV-A59 into murine fibroblast cells was studied by independent approaches. Infection of cells assessed by plaque reduction assay was strongly inhibited by lysosomotropic compounds and substances that interfere with clathrin-dependent endocytosis, suggesting that MHV-A59 is taken up via endocytosis and delivered to acidic endosomal compartments. Infection was only slightly reduced in the presence of substances inhibiting proteases of endosomal compartments, precluding that the endocytic uptake is required to activate the fusion potential of the S protein by its cleavage. Fluorescence confocal microscopy of labeled MHV-A59 confirmed that virus is taken up via endocytosis. Bright labeling of intracellular compartments suggests their fusion with the viral envelope. No fusion with the plasma membrane was observed at neutral pH conditions. However, when virus was bound to cells and the pH was lowered to 5.0, we observed a strong labeling of the plasma membrane. Electron microscopy revealed low pH triggered conformational alterations of the S ectodomain. Very likely, these alterations are irreversible because low-pH treatment of viruses in the absence of target membranes caused an irreversible loss of the fusion activity. The results imply that endocytosis plays a major role in MHV-A59 infection and the acidic pH of the endosomal compartment triggers a conformational change of the S protein mediating fusion.","output":"Role of endocytosis and low pH in murine hepatitis virus strain A59 cell entry."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is seriously threatening public health and setting off huge economic crises across the world.

We observed that biphasic activation of Akt was induced in at both the early stage (5, 15 and 30 min postinfection) and the late stage (12 and 24 h postinfection) of HP-PRRSV infection of MARC-145 cells, while an early-phase activation of Akt was found exclusively in virus-infected PAMs in vitro. Analysis with the PI3K-specific inhibitor LY294002 confirmed that PI3K acted as the upstream activator for the virus-induced activation of Akt. UV-irradiation-inactivated virus still induced the early event in PAMs but not in MARC-145 cells, suggesting that different mechanisms are employed for the early-stage induction of phosphorylated Akt within different cell cultures. We further demonstrated that FoxO1 and Bad, which serve as downstream targets of Akt, were phosphorylated in virus-infected MARC-145 cells. Moreover, the suppression of phosphorylated Akt with LY294002 significantly inhibited the virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) on MARC-145 cells, but it had a negligible effect on virus propagation.

SOCOM was tested in diverse indoor and outdoor settings (classrooms, lunchrooms, physical education [PE], and recess) among diverse schools (elementary, secondary, and special needs). Results: For the unique metrics of physical-distancing and face-covering behaviors, areas with more activity and a maximum of 10-15 students were ideal for accurately capturing data.

This biometric market segment has further facilitated rise of a new ecosystem of wearable devices helpful in tracking the real-time physiological data for Healthcare-related analysis. However, the devices in the smart-wearable ecosystem are limited to capturing and displaying the biometrics without any prescriptive analytics. This paper addresses this gap to analyse the human emotion space based on an individuals state of mind over the past 60 min and employs Deep Learning and Bayesian prediction techniques to predict the possibility of an impulsive outburst within upcoming few minutes. A lightweight smart processing device mounted with sensors captures the biometrics of the user and calibrate the same to the mental state of the user on a scale of zero to hundred. The results reveal that the deep learning algorithm along with the Bayesian probability module can predict the future mood fluctuations of the user with lower error than the other contemporary models. The predicted mood fluctuations has matched with the actual mood changes of the experimental subject within [Formula: see text] min of the predicted time index in 93% of the cases and within [Formula: see text] min in 82% of the cases.","output":"Prescriptive analytics for impulsive behaviour prevention using real-time biometrics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Stents and flow diverters have revolutionized the treatment of cerebrovascular disease. Guglielmi coils, flexible microcatheters, and first-generation intracranial stents, such as Neuroform (Stryker Neurovascular) and Enterprise stents (Codman/DePuy-Synthes), have paved the way for the development of the Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) (ev3/Covidien/Medtronic) and other endovascular approaches. RECENT FINDINGS This review discusses the historical development of flow diverter technologies from the PED to similar devices, such as the Surpass stent (Stryker Neurovascular), the Flow-Redirection Endoluminal Device (FRED; MicroVention, Inc.), the SILK stent (Balt Extrusion), and the p64 Flow Modulation Device (Phenox). In addition, the potential use of drug-eluting stents and various bioresorbable scaffolds (e.g., poly-L-lactic acid, magnesium), new developments in stent material (e.g., thin-film nitinol), design (e.g., biocompatible polymers, embedded microcircuitry, flow models), and potential applications for flow diverters will be considered.

Total cfDNA is constituted by both cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) originated mainly from the placenta, and maternal cfDNA derived from maternal leukocytes. Methods A systematic review was conducted by searching PubMed and Medline. Literature reporting levels of total cfDNA in the development of PE was included. Studies that only reported cffDNA, but no cfDNA concentrations were not included in this review. Results Eight studies were included. Seven reported values of cfDNA in PE patients, regardless of early or late onset PE, six of which demonstrated a significant increase of cfDNA in patients who subsequently developed PE. Seven studies evaluated cfDNA levels in the first trimester, six of which showed significant increase of cfDNA concentrations in women who later developed PE. Five studies investigated cfDNA levels in the second trimester, all presenting increased total cfDNA levels in the PE group compared with normal controls. Conclusion Total cfDNA may play a role as a biochemical marker of PE, compared with fetal cfDNA.

In response, countries in the region quickly set up crisis management committees and implemented drastic measures to stem the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The objective of this article is to analyse the epidemiological evolution of COVID-19 in seven Francophone West African countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, C?te dIvoire, Guinea, Mali, Niger, Senegal) as well as the public health measures decided upon during the first 7 months of the pandemic. METHODS: Our method is based on quantitative and qualitative data from the pooling of information from a COVID-19 data platform and collected by a network of interdisciplinary collaborators present in the seven countries. Descriptive and spatial analyses of quantitative epidemiological data, as well as content analyses of qualitative data on public measures and management committees were performed. RESULTS: Attack rates (October 2020) for COVID-19 have ranged from 20 per 100,000 inhabitants (Benin) to more than 94 per 100,000 inhabitants (Senegal). All these countries reacted quickly to the crisis, in some cases before the first reported infection, and implemented public measures in a relatively homogeneous manner. None of the countries implemented country-wide lockdowns, but some implemented partial or local containment measures. At the end of June 2020, countries began to lift certain restrictive measures, sometimes under pressure from the general population or from certain economic sectors. CONCLUSION: Much research on COVID-19 remains to be conducted in West Africa to better understand the dynamics of the pandemic, and to further examine the state responses to ensure their appropriateness and adaptation to the national contexts.

In this study we have employed immunocytochemical techniques to analyze in detail the budding compartment(s) of the virus. Electron microscopy of infected BHK-21 cells showed that virus particles are found in the cisternae throughout the Golgi stack. Within the cisternae, the virus particles were located preferentially in the dilated rims. This would suggest that virus budding may begin at or before the cis Golgi membranes. The virus budding compartment was studied further by immunoelectron microscopy with a pre-Golgi intermediate compartment marker, p58, and a Golgi stack marker protein, mannosidase II (ManII). Virus particles and budding virus were detected in ManII-positive Golgi stack membranes and, interestingly, in both juxtanuclear and peripheral p58-positive elements of the intermediate compartment. In cells incubated at 15 degrees C the nucleocapsid and virus envelope proteins were seen to accumulate in the intermediate compartment. Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that at 15 degrees C the nucleocapsid is associated with membranes that show a characteristic distribution and tubulo-vesicular morphology of the pre-Golgi intermediate compartment. These membranes contained virus particles in the lumen. The results indicate that the first site of formation of Uukuniemi virus particles is the pre-Golgi intermediate compartment and that virus budding continues in the Golgi stack. The results raise questions about the intracellular transport pathway of the virus particles, which are 100 to 120 nm in diameter and are therefore too large to be transported in the 60-nm-diameter vesicles postulated to function in the intra-Golgi transport. The distribution of the virus in the Golgi stack may imply that the cisternae themselves have a role in the vectorial transport of virus particles.","output":"Immunocytochemical analysis of Uukuniemi virus budding compartments: role of the intermediate compartment and the Golgi stack in virus maturation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We analyze the data about casualties in Italy in the period 01/01/2015 to 30/09/2020 released by the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT).

This study attempts to determine the ways in which the mainstream digital news covers the etiology of obesity and diseases associated with the burden of obesity. OBJECTIVE: The dual objectives of this study are to obtain an understanding of what the news reports on obesity and to explore meaning in data by extending the preconceived grounded theory. METHODS: The 10 years of news text from 2010 to 2019 compared the development of obesity-related coverage and its potential impact on its perception in Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Digital news stories on obesity along with affliction and inferences in 9 Chinese mainstream newspapers were sampled. An automatic content analysis tool, DiVoMiner was proposed. This computer-aided platform is designed to organize and filter large sets of data on the basis of the patterns of word occurrence and term discovery. Another programming language, Python 3, was used to explore connections and patterns created by the aggregated interactions. RESULTS: A total of 30,968 news stories were identified with increasing attention since 2016. The highest intensity of newspaper coverage of obesity communication was observed in Taiwan. Overall, a stronger focus on 2 shared causative attributes of obesity is on stress (n=4483, 33.0%) and tobacco use (n=3148, 23.2%). The burdens of obesity and cardiovascular diseases are implied to be the most, despite the aggregated interaction of edge centrality showing the highest link between the cancer and obesity. This study goes beyond traditional journalism studies by extending the framework of computational and customizable web-based text analysis. This could set a norm for researchers and practitioners who work on data projects largely for an innovative attempt. CONCLUSIONS: Similar to previous studies, the discourse between the obesity epidemic and personal afflictions is the most emphasized approach. Our study also indicates that the inclination of blaming personal attributes for health afflictions potentially limits social and governmental responsibility for addressing this issue.","output":"Obesity-Related Communication in Digital Chinese News From Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan: Automated Content Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: This study aimed to evaluate the incidence of co-infection with different types of pathogens in patients with hypoxemic pneumonia due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Reunion Island.This observational study using a prospectively collected database of hypoxemic pneumonia due to COVID-19 cases was conducted at Flix Guyon University Hospital in Reunion Island, France.Between 18 March 2020 and 15 April 2020, 156 patients were admitted to our hospital for COVID-19. A total of 36 patients had hypoxemic pneumonia (23.1%) due to COVID-19. Thirty of these cases (83.3%) were imported by travelers returning mainly from metropolitan France and Spain. Patients were screened for co-infection with other pathogens at admission: 31 (86.1%) by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 16 (44.4%) by cytobacteriological examination of sputum culture. Five patients (13.9%) were found to have co-infection: 1 with influenza virus A H1N1 (pdm09) associated with Branhamella catarrhalis, 1 with Streptococcus pneumoniae associated with Haemophilus influenzae, 1 with Human Coronavirus 229E, 1 with Rhinovirus, and 1 with methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus.

The virion has the unique ability of forming a complex with lipoproteins, which is known as the lipoviroparticle. Lipoprotein components as well as the envelope proteins, E1 and E2, play a key role in virus entry into the hepatocyte. HCV entry is a complex multistep process involving sequential interactions with several cell surface proteins. The virus relies on glycosaminoglycans and possibly the low-density lipoprotein receptors to attach to cells. Furthermore, four specific entry factors are involved in the following steps which lead to virus internalization and fusion in early endosomes. These molecules are the scavenger receptor SRB1, tetraspanin CD81 and two tight junction proteins, Claudin-1 and Occludin. Although they are essential to HCV entry, the precise role of these molecules is not completely understood. Finally, hepatocytes are highly polarized cells and which likely affects the entry process.

Of the enteric virus-positive cases by EM (n = 27), 16 cases had rotavirus or small round viruses alone and the remaining 11 cases had both viruses. None of the cases were positive for reovirus or coronavirus by EM. However, with reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), 40 cases (93%) were positive for rotavirus, 36 (84%) for TAstV-2, and 17 (40%) for reovirus. None of the cases were positive for turkey coronavirus by RT-PCR. The viruses from all cases were detected either alone or in combination of 2 or 3 by RT-PCR. Thus, 8 (19%) cases were positive for a single virus, whereas a combination of viruses was detected in the remaining 35 (81%) cases. The rota-TAstV-2 combination was the most predominant (n = 18 cases). Fifteen cases were positive for all 3 viruses. The rotaviruses had sequence homology of 89.8 to 100% with previously published sequences of turkey rotaviruses at the nucleotide level.

Traditional methods such as comparing the features cosine similarity and exploring the datasets manually to check which feature vector is suitable is relatively time consuming. Many classification tasks failed to achieve better classification results because of poor feature vector selection and sparseness of data. In this paper, we proposed a novel framework, topic2features (T2F), to deal with short and sparse data using the topic distributions of hidden topics gathered from dataset and converting into feature vectors to build supervised classifier. For this we leveraged the unsupervised topic modelling LDA (latent dirichlet allocation) approach to retrieve the topic distributions employed in supervised learning algorithms. We made use of labelled data and topic distributions of hidden topics that were generated from that data. We explored how the representation based on topics affect the classification performance by applying supervised classification algorithms. Additionally, we did careful evaluation on two types of datasets and compared them with baseline approaches without topic distributions and other comparable methods.

The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted in person medical visits for all individuals, with a rapid transition to telemedicine to provide medical care. Emerging data shows that the use of telemedicine may provide easier access to care and remove barriers to clinic attendance and improve access to appropriate medical care. Objective The purpose of this study was to use qualitative methods to understand the patients' experiences with telemedicine, identify patient preferences for type of appointment, and possible suggestions to improve telemedicine care. Methods Patients from the Johns Hopkins Sickle Cell Center for Adults who had at least one telemedicine visit were invited to participate in a semi structured interview via zoom meeting or telephone. The interview asked participants about their satisfaction with telemedicine care, barriers to telemedicine, benefits and risks of telemedicine and possible telemedicine improvements. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and coded by two independent raters using thematic analyses to understand the experiences of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results Overall, 30 adults with SCD who had at least one telemedicine visit were invited to participate and completed their interview (mean age 41 years  xx, 67% female, 93% Black/African American, 3% Multi-Race, 3% Other). ...I can't ignore the convenience of not having to worry about transportation ... that there's nothing to stop me from getting there. During a SCD pain crisis it can it challenging to move and receive treatment as one participant reported Maybe sometimes I might have pain...then moving around makes it difficult. So, getting in the car and finding somebody to drive you to a hospital or to whatever clinic would be difficult. Being able to access specialized SCD care even while in pain is important. Having the option of either having telemedicine or in person visits was important to SCD patients I could treat my crisis here at home. I don't have to go to the emergency room for it. So, if I can see my doctor in the tele-visit appointment and it's going to be constantly every day ... And when it's getting worse, then I could go to the emergency room more if needed. If it's not needed, I don't even need to go. Another emerging theme amongst participants was despite the benefits from telemedicine, they also wanted to continue having in-person visits when they needed. SCD participants felt due to their SCD they still needed to see their doctor in person but it did not have to be for every visit Well, I think telemedicine, for me, can be used in a setting where there's no such an emergency. Like if I'm having a routine exam, I don't mind having the telemedicine. But if ... I'm not feeling well ... I don't want to be having a telemedicine. SCD participants felt they needed a physical exam periodically. The only thing I didn't like about it was if I'm having some discomfort or some pain... there was no way for the physician to physically examine me. Along with the lack of physical exam, there were concerns about the lack of vital signs ... the drawbacks would be the lack of the vitals being taken or there's not the personal touch and stuff. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic has presented many obstacles for patients to receive care. People living with SCD found telemedicine to be a positive tool to receive treatment. Patients reported the desire to continue with telemedicine even after the COVID -19 pandemic. Telemedicine allows for more accessibility for a group of individuals who already have numerous barriers to treatment. Future research can seek to identify the impact that telemedicine has on no-show rates, health care utilization, and the impact telemedicine has on patient reported quality of life.

Under the imposed vaccination policy and antiviral treatment in society, complex factors (costs and expected effects of the vaccines and treatments, and fear of being infected) trigger an emulous situation in which individuals avoid infection by the pre-emptive or ex post provision. Aside from the established voluntary vaccination game, we propose a treatment game model associated with the resistance evolution of antiviral/antibiotic overuse. Moreover, the imperfectness of vaccinations has inevitably led to anti-vaccine behaviour, necessitating a proactive treatment policy. However, under the excessively heavy implementation of treatments such as antiviral medicine, resistant strains emerge. The model explicitly exhibits a dual social dilemma situation, in which the treatment behaviour changes on a local time scale, and the vaccination uptake later evolves on a global time scale. The impact of resistance evolution and the coexistence of dual dilemmas are investigated by the control reproduction number and the social efficiency deficit, respectively. Our investigation might elucidate the substantial impacts of both vaccination and treatment in the framework of epidemic dynamics, and hence suggest the appropriate use of antiviral treatment.","output":"Modelling and analysing the coexistence of dual dilemmas in the proactive vaccination game and retroactive treatment game in epidemic viral dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: I use Benfords law to assess whether there is misreporting of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) deaths in the USA.

Although there is no clarity in the principal mechanism of lung damage and ARDS development, it has been suggested that one of the main reasons of this pathology is the hyperactivation of the immune system, better known as cytokine storm syndrome. Tocilizumab has been proposed to treat COVID-19 severe cases associated to ARDS. Results & methodology: Here we present two successful cases of tocilizumab administration in two COVID-19 patients with prior administration of antiviral therapy (hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir and ritonavir) with adequate response and resolution of ARDS, septic shock and severe pneumonia within the first 72 h. Discussion & conclusion: This case supports the usage of tocilizumab as an effective therapy in COVID-19 associated cytokine storm syndrome.

In a sepsis simulation model, we tested whether the anesthetic ketamine inhibits the macrophage TNF response to antibiotic-exposed CA-MRSA bacteria via its antagonism of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. RAW264.7 cells were stimulated for 18 hrs with 10(5 )to 10(7 )CFU/mL inocula of either of two prototypical CA-MRSA isolates, USA300 strain LAC and USA400 strain MW2, in the presence of either vancomycin or daptomycin. One hour before bacterial stimulation, ketamine was added with or without MK-801 (dizocilpine, a chemically unrelated non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist), APV (D-2-amino-5-phosphono-valerate, a competitive NMDA receptor antagonist), NMDA, or combinations of these agents. Supernatants were collected and assayed for TNF concentration by ELISA. RESULTS: RAW264.7 cells exposed to either LAC or MW2 in the presence of daptomycin secreted less TNF than in the presence of vancomycin. The addition of ketamine inhibited macrophage TNF secretion after stimulation with either of the CA-MRSA isolates (LAC, MW2) in the presence of either antibiotic. The NMDA inhibitors, MK-801 and APV, also suppressed macrophage TNF secretion after stimulation with either of the antibiotic-exposed CA-MRSA isolates, and the effect was not additive or synergistic with ketamine. The addition of NMDA substrate augmented TNF secretion in response to the CA-MRSA bacteria, and the addition of APV suppressed the effect of NMDA in a dose-dependent fashion. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine inhibits TNF secretion by MRSA-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages and the mechanism likely involves NMDA receptor antagonism. These findings may have therapeutic significance in MRSA sepsis.","output":"Ketamine inhibits tumor necrosis factor secretion by RAW264.7 murine macrophages stimulated with antibiotic-exposed strains of community-associated, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article provides an explanation for how increased public participation can paradoxically translate into limited democratic decision-making in urban settings. Recent sociological research shows how governments can control participatory forums to restrict the distribution of resources to poor neighborhoods or to advance private land development interests. Yet such explanations cannot account for the decoupling of participation from democratic decision-making in the case of planning for climate change, which expands the substantive topics and public funding decisions that involve urban residents. Through an in-depth case study of one of the largest coastal protection projects in the world and drawing on global scholarship on participation, this article narrates the social production of resistance to climate change infrastructure by showing how the state sidestepped public input and exercised authority through appeals to the rationality of technical expertise. After a lengthy participation process wherein participants reported satisfaction with how their input was included in designs, city officials switched decision-making styles and used expertise from engineers to render the publicly-supported plan unfeasible, while continuing to involve residents in the process. As a result, conflict arose between activists and public housing representatives, bitterly dividing the neighborhood over who could legitimately claim to represent the interests of the frontline community. By documenting the experience of participants in the process before and after the switch in decision-making styles, this article advances a sociological description of public influence in policy: The ability for participants in a planning process to recognize their own input reflected in finished plans.","output":"Democracy underwater: public participation, technical expertise, and climate infrastructure planning in New York City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public transport is a fundamental service for the resumption of work and production, but the enclosed environment and dense population create very favorable conditions for the spread of epidemic infections. Thus, effective public health interventions are urgently introduced. The objective of this paper is to quantitatively estimate the SARS-CoV-2 transmission probability and evaluate the influence of environmental parameters and individual intervention on the epidemic prevention. For this purpose, (1) we estimate the virus emission rate with Diamond Princess Cruise Ship infection data by Monte Carlo simulation and the improved Wells-Riley model, and (2) employ the reproductive number R to quantify diverse mitigation strategies. Different determinants are examined such as the duration of exposure, the number of passengers combined with individual interventions such as mask type and mask-wearing rate. The results show that the SARS-CoV-2 quantum generation rate is 185.63. The R shows a stronger positive correlation with the exposure time comparing to the number of passengers. In this light, reducing the frequency of long-distance journeys on crowded public transportation may be required to reduce the spread of the virus during the pandemic. N95 mask and surgical mask can reduce the transmission risk by 97 and 84%, respectively, and even homemade mask can reduce the risk by 67%, which indicates that it is necessary to advocate wearing masks on public transportation.","output":"Estimation of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission probability in confined traffic space and evaluation of the mitigation strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents a method of implementation and the results of aerosol dispersion tests in underground mine workings.

Primary healthcare services, including tuberculosis services, are at increased risk of facing severe disruptions, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries. Indeed, corroborating model-based forecasts, there is increasing evidence of the COVID-19 pandemics negative impact on tuberculosis case detection. METHODS: Applying a segmented time-series analysis, we assessed the effects of COVID-19-related measures on tuberculosis diagnosis service across districts in Mozambique. Ministry health information system data were used from the first quarter of 2017 to the end of 2020. The model, performed under the Bayesian premises, was estimated as a negative binomial with random effects for districts and provinces. RESULTS: A total of 154 districts were followed for 16 consecutive quarters. Together, these districts reported 96 182 cases of all forms of tuberculosis in 2020. At baseline (first quarter of 2017), Mozambique had an estimated incidence rate of 283 (95% CI 200 to 406) tuberculosis cases per 100 000 people and this increased at a 5% annual rate through the end of 2019. We estimated that 17 147 new tuberculosis cases were potentially missed 9 months after COVID-19 onset, resulting in a 15.1% (95% CI 5.9 to 24.0) relative loss in 2020. The greatest impact was observed in the southern region at 40.0% (95% CI 30.1 to 49.0) and among men at 15% (95% CI 4.0 to 25.0). The incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis increased at an average rate of 6.6% annually; however, an abrupt drop (15%) was also observed immediately after COVID-19 onset in March 2020. CONCLUSION: The most significant impact of the state of emergency was observed between April and June 2020, the quarter after COVID-19 onset. Encouragingly, by the end of 2020, clear signs of health system recovery were visible despite the initial shock.","output":"COVID-19-related healthcare impacts: an uncontrolled, segmented time-series analysis of tuberculosis diagnosis services in Mozambique, 2017C2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although cyber victimization (CV) occurs in both middle school (MS) and high school (HS)and these experiences appear to differ between boys and girlsto our knowledge, no studies have directly examined these differences across specific acts of CV.

OBJECTIVES: The current study compared CV experiences reported by boys and girls in both MS and HS as well as examined CVs association with perceived school safety and school attachment. METHOD: Participants were 286 MS and 304 HS students (52% boys) from a small, rural Midwestern community in the United States. Self-reported measures were collected. RESULTS: HS girls reported experiencing more CV than MS girls on 5 of the 6 CV acts examined. Additionally, HS girls reported experiencing more CV on 3 of the acts compared to MS boys. In general, HS boys and HS girls report similar rates of CV, with the exception of HS girls experiencing higher levels of people saying mean and nasty things about them. Regression analyses indicated that youth who report higher CV feel less connected to school, but their CV experiences do not appear to be related their perceived school safety when also considering traditional forms of victimization.

As governments and health care systems develop and update policies and guidelines regarding the allocation of resources, patients and families affected by chronic disabilities, including many neuromuscular disorders that affect children and young adults, have become alarmed at the possibility that they may be determined to have less favorable prognoses due to their underlying diagnoses and thus be assigned to lower priority groups. It is important for health care workers, policymakers, and government officials to be aware that the long-term prognoses for children and young adults with neuromuscular disorders are often more promising than previously believed due to a better understanding of the natural history of these diseases, benefits of multidisciplinary supportive care, and novel molecular therapies that can dramatically improve the disease course. Although the realities of a global pandemic have the potential to require a shift from our usual, highly individualistic standards of care to crisis standards of care, shifting priorities should nonetheless be informed by good facts.

We hypothesized that patient satisfaction scores following virtual visits may improve over time as patients and physicians become more accustomed to a virtual platform. To evaluate this, we compared virtual visit patient satisfaction scores between early and late pandemic visits at a comprehensive cancer center. Materials/Methods Anonymized patient surveys from all virtual visit (VV) and in-person visits (IP) collected between April 2020 through January 2021 were included. Surveys consisted of 12 questions assessing the following aspects of the patient experience: connection quality, patient-physician communication, and overall provider quality. Open-ended questions (2/12) were excluded. Qualitative responses were given on a 1-3 Likert-type scale ranging from no, yes (somewhat), and yes (definitely). Surveys were grouped into early-pandemic (April 2020 - July 2020) and late-pandemic (August 2020 - January 2021). Responses were binned into satisfied (yes, [definitely] responses) and not satisfied (no and yes [somewhat] responses). Patient characteristics and survey responses for early and late pandemic were compared using a chi-square or independent t-test with significance set at P < 0.05. Results In total, 1,688 VV (45% early and 55% late pandemic) and 5,279 IP (39% early and 61% late pandemic) surveys were assessed. VV surveys were from the following specialties: 69% medical oncology, 13% surgical oncology, 12% radiation oncology, and 6% gynecologic oncology. The age distribution of VV patients was 49 (16%), 50-64 (28%), and 65 (56%) years compared to 49 (16%), 50-64 (32%), and 65 (52%) for IP patients. Survey response rates were 41% and 42% for VV and IP patients, respectively. Compared to early pandemic VV patients, late pandemic VV patients were more satisfied with regard to quality of explanation (91% vs 80%, P < .001), provider preparedness (89% vs 81%, P < 0.001), patient-provider trust (93% vs 87%, P < 0.001), provider listening (94% vs 86%, P < 0.001), follow-up instructions (85% vs 76%, P < 0.001), connection ease (83% vs 71%, P < 0.001), connection quality (85% vs 72%, P < 0.001), and appointment timing (84% vs 66%, P < 0.001). There was no significant difference between early and late pandemic for overall provider rating (mean [SD], 1-10 scale: 9.52 [1.45] vs. 9.58 [1.29], P = 0.36) or whether the patient would recommend the provider (94.6% vs. 92.3%, P = 0.10). In contrast, no significant differences were observed in patient survey scores between early and late pandemic for IP visits. Conclusion Patients who had virtual visits were significantly more satisfied on multiple aspects of their encounter later in the pandemic compared with earlier while no significant differences were observed for in-person visits.

We hypothesized that a standardized ERAS protocol would provide similar pain management and psychoemotional outcomes while decreasing the use of opioids in the hospital and after discharge. METHODS As part of a 7-month quality improvement project, cardiac surgery patients on a fast-tracked to extubate pathway were assigned pro re nata (PRN) narcotic pain management for 3 months (n = 49). After a 1-month ERAS protocol optimization period, a separate group of patients were given the ERAS protocol (n = 34). Clinical outcomes were gathered, and participants completed a quality of recovery survey that allowed for the assessment of pain and symptom control at four-time points after surgery. RESULTS Among 83 participants, 66% were male and the mean age was 53 years. There were no differences in patient characteristics between PRN and ERAS groups (all p > .244). There were no differences between ERAS and PRN groups for surgery characteristics (all p > .060), inpatient outcomes (all p > .658), or after-discharge outcomes (all p > .397).

METHODS: This study was a single-center retrospective cohort study. Receiver operating characteristic curves were drawn to calculate the area under the curve, and the optimal cut-off values for the time to initiate favipiravir treatment were calculated to predict defervescence within seven days. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify potential influencing factors of defervescence. This was defined as a body temperature of less than 37 C for at least 2 days. RESULTS: Data from 41 patients were used for the efficacy assessment. The days from the onset of fever to defervescence showed a positive correlation with the duration from the onset of fever to initiation of favipiravir treatment (r = 0.548, P < 0.001). The optimal cut-off value was the administration of favipiravir on day 4. Patients were assigned to two groups based on the optimal cut-off value from onset to initiation of favipiravir treatment: early treatment group (within 4-days) and late treatment group (more than 4-days).

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We designed a pragmatic pre-interventional and post-interventional quasi-experimental study combined with a prospective observational design to determine the uptake, acceptability, appropriateness and feasibility of a multifaceted intervention for scale up of uptake of VMMC among men with STIs at Bwaila STI clinic in Lilongwe, Malawi. The intervention includes transport reimbursement (R), intensified health education (I) and short messaging service (SMS)/telephonic tracing (Te) (RITe). The intervention will be implemented in phases: pre-implementation and implementation. Pre-implementation phase will be used for collecting baseline data, while the RITe intervention will be rolled-out in the implementation phase. The RITe intervention will be implemented in a sequential and incremental manner called implementation blocks: block 1: intensified health education; block 2: intensified health education and SMS/telephonic tracing; and block 3: intensified health education, SMS/telephonic tracing and transport reimbursement. The target sample size is 80 uncircumcised men for each intervention block, including the pre-implementation sample, making a total of 320 men (280 total, 70 per block will be surveyed).

RESULTS: We estimated that public sector contributions led to at least 30% reductions in COVID-19-related healthcare resource utilization. Private sector contributions to expanded diagnostic testing and treatments led to further reductions in mortality (- 44%), intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU hospital beds (- 30% and - 28%, respectively), and ventilator use (- 29%). The combination of lower diagnostic test sensitivity and proportions of patients self-isolating may exacerbate case numbers, and policies that encourage self-isolating should be considered.

Previously, it has been reported that the plasma concentrations of lopinavir significantly increase in inflammatory settings. As COVID-19 may be associated with major inflammation, assessing the plasma concentrations and safety of lopinavir in COVID-19 patients is essential. METHODS: Real-world COVID-19 data based on a retrospective study. RESULTS: Among the 31 COVID-19 patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir between March 18, 2020 and April 1, 2020, higher lopinavir plasma concentrations were observed, which increased by 4.6-fold (interquartile range: 3.6C6.2), compared with the average plasma concentrations in HIV. Lopinavir concentrations in all except one patient were above the upper limit of the concentration range of HIV treatment. Approximately one to 5 patients prematurely stopped treatment mainly because of an ADR related to hepatic or gastrointestinal disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Lopinavir plasma concentrations in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 were higher than expected, and they were associated with the occurrence of hepatic or gastrointestinal adverse drug reactions. However, a high plasma concentration may be required for in vivo antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, as suggested by previous studies. Therefore, in the absence of adverse drug reaction, lopinavir dosage should not be reduced.

Mattering is the feeling of being important to others in ways that give people the sense that they are valued and other people care about them. We contrast this feeling with messages of not mattering and being expendable and disposable due to ageism, gaps in the provision of care, and apparently economically focused positions taken during the pandemic that disrespect the value, worth, and merits of older persons. We provide a comprehensive review of past research on individual differences in mattering among older adults and illustrate the unique role of mattering in potentially protecting older adults from mental health problems. Mattering is also discussed in terms of its links with loneliness and physical health. This article concludes with a discussion of initiatives and interventions that can be modified and enhanced to instill a sense of mattering among older adults.

METHODS People with type 1 diabetes (n = 585), aged 17-77 years, were randomized to insulin glargine once daily at bedtime or NPH insulin either once- (at bedtime) or twice-daily (in the morning and at bedtime) according to their prior treatment regimen and followed for 28 weeks in an open-label, multicentre study. Both groups continued with pre-meal unmodified human insulin. RESULTS There was no significant difference between the two insulins in change in glycated haemoglobin from baseline to endpoint (insulin glargine 0.21 +/- 0.05% (mean +/- standard error), NPH insulin 0.10 +/- 0.05%). At endpoint, self-monitored fasting blood glucose (FBG) had decreased similarly in each group (insulin glargine -1.17 +/- 0.12 mmol/L, NPH insulin -0.89 +/- 0.12 mmol/L; p = 0.07). However, people on >1 basal insulin injection per day prior to the study had a clinically relevant decrease in FBG on insulin glargine versus NPH insulin (insulin glargine -1.38 +/- 0.15 mmol/L, NPH insulin -0.72 +/- 0.15 mmol/L; p < 0.01). No significant differences in the number of people reporting >or=1 hypoglycaemic episode were found between the two groups, including severe and nocturnal hypoglycaemia. Insulin glargine was well tolerated, with a similar rate of local injection and systemic adverse events versus NPH insulin. CONCLUSIONS A single, bedtime, subcutaneous dose of insulin glargine provided a level of glycaemic control at least as effective as NPH insulin, without an increased risk of hypoglycaemia.","output":"A randomized multicentre trial of insulin glargine compared with NPH insulin in people with type 1 diabetes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2/novel coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) has rapidly become a global pandemic since the first cases from Wuhan, China, were reported in December 2019 The pandemic has made it more challenging to treat various gastrointestinal disorders, including acute alcoholic hepatitis (AH) One of the mainstays of treatment for severe AH involves corticosteroids (mainly prednisolone) A concern when treating with prednisolone is the worsening of underlying infection There may be an additional risk in treating COVID-19-infected patients We present a case of a patient with severe acute AH and concomitant COVID-19 infection who did well with corticosteroid therapy without evidence for worsening infection","output":"Alcoholic Hepatitis and COVID-19: The Question of Steroids"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We analyze bank supply of credit under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).

The anamnesis and medical files of 155 patients who applied to our outpatient COVID-19 clinic were evaluated. Patients with positive PCR tests for COVID-19 who were aged between 18-72 years were divided into groups according to the presence of otolaryngological symptoms. The differences between the two groups were examined. RESULTS: Of the 155 patients, 89 (57.4%) had otolaryngological symptoms. The mean age of the patients was 36.3  8.1 years. Ninety-one (58.7%) patients were female, and 64 (42.2%) were male. Fifty-eight (37.4%) patients had received a clinical diagnosis of viral pneumonia with ground glass findings in tomography.

This case series consists of twenty-nine adult patients who were COVID -19 positive and treated for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, in India. The study was aimed at analyzing patient demographics of patients with DVT and the outcome of Catheter-Directed Thrombolysis (CDT) in COVID positive patients. Material and Methods: Patients who developed DVT while or after being COVID positive were managed between February and April 2021 at the institution of the first two authors and were included in this retrospective study. Demographic, clinical data, laboratory data, and treatment given were analyzed. All patients were followed up for 3 months with a Villalta score. Results: There were a total of 29 patients (12 male and 17 female) included in the study with a mean age of 47  17 years. The average time of presentation from being COVID positive was 17.8  3.6 days and one patient developed DVT after becoming Covid negative. All but one patient had lower limb involvement, with 42.8% having proximal and 57.2% distal DVT. All patients with Iliofemoral and two with Femoropopliteal DVT were treated with catheter-di thrombolysis and the other 15 patients were managed with anticoagulation alone. No re-thrombosis was observed in the thrombolysis group. Overall average Villalta score at 3 months was 10.7  2.1 with a score of 10.58  2.1 in the anticoagulation-only group and 10.85  2.3 in the CDT group. Conclusion: COVID-19 seems to be an additional risk factor in the development of DVT. The outcome of such patients, treated by thrombolysis appears to be similar to non-COVID patients. In this, observational experience of the authors suggests that CDT could be offered to COVID positive patients with symptomatic Iliofemoral DVT with good outcomes and an acceptable post-intervention Villalta score.","output":"The Outcome of Catheter-Directed Thrombolysis in COVID-19-Associated Deep Vein Thrombosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cyrtomium fortumei (J.) Smith is an important Chinese herbal medicine because of its biological functions. However, systematic and comprehensive studies on the phytochemicals from Cyrtomium fortumei (J.) Smith and their bioactivity are limited. RESULTS: Using the bioassay-guided technique, the ethyl acetate and n-BuOH extracts of the rhizomes of Cyrtomium fortumei (J.) Smith were shown to exhibit good antitumor activities, consequently leading to the isolation of 23 compounds. All compounds were isolated from the plant for the first time. The inhibitory activities of these compounds were investigated on tumor cells MGC-803, PC3, and A375 in vitro by MTT (thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide) assay, and the results showed that pimpinellin (3) had potent cytotoxic activities against the three cell lines, with the IC(50) values of 14.4  0.3 M, 20.4  0.5 M, and 29.2  0.6 M, respectively. The mechanism of the antitumor action indicated that pimpinellin inhibited the growth of MGC-803 cells via the induction of tumor cell apoptosis, with apoptosis ratio of 27.44% after 72 h of treatment at 20 M.

These enzymes are essential in RNA metabolism, where they are involved in a number of processes that require manipulation of RNA structure. Recent studies have found that some DEAD/DEAH-box helicases play important roles in innate immunity, where they act as sensors of cytosolic DNA/RNA, as adaptor proteins, or as regulators of signaling and gene expression. In spite of their function in immunity, DEAD/DEAH-box helicases can also be hijacked and exploited by viruses to circumvent detection and aid in viral replication. These findings not only imply that DEAD/DEAH-box helicases have a broader function than previously thought, but also give us a much better understanding of immune mechanisms and diseases that arise due to the dysregulation or evasion thereof.

In addition, we examined the reasons why women may decline participation and the reasons for higher or lower attendance rates. METHODS: Data from a stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial were used. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to determine associations among women's health behavior, sociodemographic and psychosocial characteristics, health care facilities, and participation and attendance in CP. RESULTS: A total of 2562 women were included in the study, and the average participation rate was 31.6% per health care facility (range of 10%-53%). Nulliparous women, women <26 years old or >30 years old, and women reporting average or high levels of stress were more likely to participate in CP.

Cilia are involved in a variety of cellular functions and perceptions, with one of them being the sense of smell. Hyposmia is a typical feature found in patients with BBS. However, reports of olfactory dysfunction in other cystic kidney diseases are sparse. Here we provide a systematic survey on olfaction in a large cohort of patients displaying genetically determined renal ciliopathies. METHODS: We performed a match-controlled systematic olfactory evaluation in a group of 75 patients with a defined genetic background using age adapted and validated odour identification tests. RESULTS: Test results revealed a significant olfactory deficit in patients carrying TMEM67 variants (n=4), while all other genetic disorders causing nephronophthisis (n=25) or polycystic kidney disease (n=18) were not associated with an impaired sense of smell. Also in patients with BBS, olfactory performance was depending on the underlying molecular defect.

The current studies used a modified associative recognition paradigm that allowed disentangling item impairment from associative impairment in DF. Participants studied scene-object pairings, followed by DF cues (item-method), and at test were presented with a previously studied scene along with three objects, one of which was studied with that scene (target), whereas the remaining two objects were studied with different scenes (lures). Experiment 1 used an associative encoding orienting task, and DF impairment was observed only when the forget targets were paired with forget lures within the test display; however, DF was eliminated when the forget targets were paired with remember lures, possibly due to a recall-to-reject strategy. Experiment 2 used an object-focused orienting task that downplayed the encoding of associative information. The results revealed the opposite of Experiment 1, with significant DF when the forget targets were paired with remember lures, and no DF when the lures and the target came from the same memory instruction. Experiment 3 used the same orienting task as Experiment 1, but testing used a sequential procedure, where item recognition was assessed first, followed by associative recognition test. Conditionalizing associative recognition on item recognition outcomes confirmed that DF impairment of associative memory can be obtained despite retained memory for forget-cued objects. Overall, the results provide strong support for the impairment of associative memory by DF.

Here, we report that energy expenditure is regulated by a subgroup of AgRP neurons that send non-collateral projections to neurons within the dorsal lateral part of dorsal raphe nucleus (dlDRN) expressing the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R), which in turn innervate nearby serotonergic (5-HT) neurons. Genetic manipulations reveal a bi-directional control of energy expenditure by this circuit without affecting food intake. Fiber photometry and electrophysiological results indicate that the thermo-sensing MC4RdlDRN neurons integrate pre-synaptic AgRP signaling, thereby modulating the post-synaptic serotonergic pathway. Specifically, the MC4RdlDRN signaling elicits profound, bi-directional, regulation of body weight mainly through sympathetic outflow that reprograms mitochondrial bioenergetics within brown and beige fat while feeding remains intact. Together, we suggest that this AgRP neural circuit plays a unique role in persistent control of energy expenditure and body weight, hinting next-generation therapeutic approaches for obesity and metabolic disorders.","output":"Deciphering an AgRP-serotoninergic neural circuit in distinct control of energy metabolism from feeding."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Infection screening tools classically define fever as 38.0C (100.4F). Frail older adults may not mount the same febrile response to systemic infection as younger or healthier individuals. We evaluate temperature trends among nursing home (NH) residents undergoing diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 testing and describe the diagnostic accuracy of temperature measurements for predicting test-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study evaluating diagnostic accuracy of pre-SARS-CoV-2 testing temperature changes. SETTING: Two separate NH cohorts tested diagnostically (e.g., for symptoms) for SARS-CoV-2. PARTICIPANTS Veterans residing in Veterans Affairs (VA) managed NHs and residents in a private national chain of community NHs. MEASUREMENTS: For both cohorts, we determined the sensitivity, specificity, and Youden's index with different temperature cutoffs for SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction results. RESULTS: The VA cohort consisted of 1,301 residents in 134 facilities from March 1, 2020, to May 14, 2020, with 25% confirmed for SARS-CoV-2. The community cohort included 3,368 residents spread across 282 facilities from February 18, 2020, to June 9, 2020, and 42% were confirmed for SARS-CoV-2. The VA cohort was younger, less White, and mostly male. A temperature testing threshold of 37.2C has better sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2, 76% and 34% in the VA and community NH, respectively, versus 38.0C with 43% and 12% sensitivity, respectively. CONCLUSION: A definition of 38.0C for fever in NH screening tools should be lowered to improve predictive accuracy for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Stakeholders should carefully consider the impact of adopting lower testing thresholds on testing availability, cost, and burden on staff and residents. Temperatures alone have relatively low sensitivity/specificity, and we advocate any threshold be used as part of a screening tool, along with other signs and symptoms of infection.","output":"Temperature Screening for SARS-CoV-2 in Nursing Homes: Evidence from Two National Cohorts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To explore the clinical significance of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: In this retrospective study, a total of 136 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 were recruited. Demographic and clinical data were recorded. The serum ACE activity was measured at baseline and during the recovery phase, and its relationship with clinical condition was analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 136 patients with confirmed COVID-19, the 16 severe patients were older and had a higher body mass index (BMI) and proportion of hypertension than the 120 nonsevere patients. In comparison to those of normal controls, the baseline serum ACE activities of subjects in the severe group and nonsevere group were decreased, with the lowest level in the severe group. However, the serum ACE activity increased in the recovery phase, and there were no significant differences among the severe group, nonsevere group and normal control group.

The severe lung disease caused by severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2, coronavirus disease 2019, is one of the many causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 has caused more than three million deaths worldwide and has challenged all therapeutic options for mechanical ventilation. Thus, new therapies are necessary to prevent deaths and long-term complications of severe lung diseases and prolonged mechanical ventilation. The authors of the present report have developed a novel device that allows selective lobe ventilation and selective lobe recruitment and provides a new platform for pulmonary drug delivery. A major advantage of separating lobes that are mechanically heterogeneous is to allow for customization of ventilator parameters to match the needs of segments with similar compliance, a better overall ventilation perfusion relationship, and prevention of ventilator-induced lung injury of more compliant lobes. This device accounts for lung heterogeneity and is a potential new therapy for acute lung injury by allowing selective lobe mechanical ventilation using two novel modes of mechanical ventilation (differential positive end-expiratory pressure and asynchronous ventilation), and two new modalities of alveolar recruitment (selective lobe recruitment and continuous positive airway pressure of lower lobes with continuous ventilation of upper lobes).

METHODOLOGY: A cross sectional study was conducted from 25-July 2020 to 5-August 2020. Participants of both genders of age >17 years, currently residing in Pakistan, who had access to internet and understood English were included in the survey. The survey was designed on Google form and was distributed digitally across different areas of Pakistan via social media. Survey included questions regarding socio-demographics, facemask adherence and perceived barriers related to facemask adherence such as perceived risks, health concerns, comfort, social influences, religious/cultural norms and social protocols and health recommendations. SPSS version 23 was used to analyze data. Independent t-test/One-way ANOVA was applied to assess significant difference between perceived barriers to wear face mask and socio-demographic factors, p-value 0.05 was taken as statistically significant. Post-hoc LSD test was also applied where applicable. RESULTS: Only 20% of the participants reported non-adherence to facemask. Amongst these participants, majority agreed that comfort was the main barrier precluding them from wearing a mask, 89.4% subjects saying that it was too hot to wear it and 84.1% saying that a mask was too uncomfortable to wear. Whereas, 82.1% highly agreed that difficulty in breathing is perceived barrier related to facemask usage. Statistically significant difference was found between health concerns with gender (p = 0.031), locality (p = 0.001) and religion (p = 0.03); comfort with locality (p = 0.007); social influences with gender (p = 0.001), ethnicity (p = 0.001) and locality (p = 0.017); cultural/religious norms with religion (p = 0.001) and social protocols and health recommendations with age (p = 0.015).

Methods: During the first lockdown in Austria, an online survey was distributed among 165 dentistry students in their clinical term at the Medical University of Vienna. The survey contained elaborative questions on the general knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19. A special focus of the questionnaire was set on the modification of the students curriculum regarding infection control. Results: In total, 77 (47%) students replied;68 questionnaires were included in the analysis. Dentistry students were found to have good general knowledge of COVID-19 during the early phase of the pandemic. Most students (89.6%) got their information regarding the COVID-19 infection from official sources;however, 58% would like to attend further lectures on COVID-19 to expand their knowledge.

As HBOT patients often require daily treatment sessions for a period of months, it is necessary for facilities providing HBOT services to adjust to the COVID-19 pandemic while still maintaining availability of this important service. Modification of HBOT session timing and chamber decontamination procedures, utilisation of telehealth services for initial patient evaluations, and acceptance of novel patient populations and diagnoses are mechanisms by which HBOT centers can adapt to the evolving model of health care delivery throughout a pandemic. While COVID-19 is not a currently accepted indication for HBOT, patients may be referred for HBOT consultation due to the post-infectious sequelae of the virus, and thus HBOT facilities must be aware of the potential uses of this treatment for post-viral complications.

Notably, several countries reported operating near or at their intensive care capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic, although the impact of this on patient outcomes remains unclear. Objectives: To determine if there is an association between survival rates in intensive care units (ICU) and occupancy of the unit on the day of admission. Design: National retrospective observational cohort study spanning the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in England. Setting: 114 hospital trusts (groups of hospitals that function as a single operational unit). Participants: 4,032 adults admitted to an ICU in England between 2nd April and 1st June, 2020, with presumed or confirmed COVID-19, for whom data was submitted to the national surveillance programme and met study inclusion criteria. Interventions: N/A Main Outcomes and Measures: A Bayesian hierarchical approach was used to model the association between hospital trust level (mechanical ventilation compatible) bed occupancy, and in-hospital all-cause mortality. Results were adjusted for unit characteristics (pre-pandemic size), individual patient-level demographic characteristics (age, sex, ethnicity, time-to-ICU admission), and recorded comorbidities (obesity, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, chronic liver disease, chronic heart disease, hypertension, immunosuppression, chronic neurological disease, chronic renal disease). Results: 38.4% (1,548) of patients admitted to an ICU died. Adjusting for patient-level factors, mortality was higher for admissions during periods of high occupancy (>85% occupancy versus the baseline of 45 - 85%) [median odds ratio (OR) 1.19 (95% posterior credible interval (PCI): 1.00 - 1.44)]. In contrast, mortality was decreased for admissions during periods of low occupancy (<45% relative to the baseline) [OR 0.75 (95% PCI: 0.62 - 0.89)]. Conclusion and Relevance: Increasing occupancy of beds compatible with mechanical ventilation, a proxy for operational strain, is associated with a higher mortality risk for individuals admitted to ICU. Public health interventions (such as expeditious vaccination programmes and non-pharmaceutical interventions) to control both incidence and prevalence of COVID-19, and therefore keep ICU occupancy low in the context of the pandemic, are necessary to mitigate the impact of this type of resource saturation.","output":"A national retrospective cohort study of mechanical ventilator availability and its association with mortality risk in intensive care patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between different levels of physical activity (light, moderate, and vigorous), physical health, happiness, and depression among older adults with diabetes.

The aim of this study is to prospectively validate ENDING-S in a cohort of long-term critical care patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult long-term ICU patients (with a length-of-stay> 4 days) were considered for this prospective multicenter observational study. ENDING-S and SOFA score were calculated daily and evaluated against the patients ICU outcome. The predictive properties were evaluated through a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty patients were enrolled for this study. Among these, 21.46% died during the ICU stay. ENDING-S correctly predicted the ICU outcome in 71.4% of patients. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values associated with the previously identified ENDING-S cut-off of 11.5 were 68.1, 72.3, 60 and 89.3%, respectively.

This Commentary is a contribution to the Frontiers Research Topic on social disparities in aging, and aims to draw attention to the novel connections that link social disparities, the biological capital of individuals, and policy strategies. The biological capital (as defined in the paper), accrued since conception by individuals, in turn affects their social, cultural, and economic capitals, and thus creates a positive feedback loop. In a large network funded by the European Commission, Lifepath, we have shown that the determinants of health inequalities start in early life and cumulate throughout the life-course. For example, exposure to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) influences the likelihood of later in life health effects, including poor aging. In this paper I compare two types of evidence that have recently emerged from the literature. One addresses the role of early vs. late exposures to risk factors for aging and mortality, including ACEs, using e.g., microsimulation models. The second type of evidence, provided in a recent document of the WHO European Regional Office, is based on the analysis of five broad determinants of health inequalities and eight different macroeconomic policies to tackle such inequalities. Six of the policies, if enacted, have the potential to reduce inequalities in the short term by increasing public expenditure on housing and community amenities, increasing expenditure on labor market policies, reducing income inequality, increasing social protection expenditure, reducing unemployment, and/or reducing out-of-pocket payments for health. Both of these lines of evidence suggest that there are ample opportunities for policy interventions. I also discuss the need for analytical methods to bridge the two types of analyses (biomedical and macroeconomic), i.e., fill the gap between analyses based on individual determinants of health inequalities and those based on societal determinants, to help create more effective policy-making. Also, I propose that before launching large projects to reduce health inequalities, well-designed experiments must be conducted to test their efficacy.

METHODS Twenty-five patients who underwent primary tympanoplasty and/or canalplasty for middle ear malformation at a tertiary academic medical center were retrospectively reviewed. CEACS was defined as an EAC diameter of 4 mm or less. Intraoperative findings, including irregularity of the ossicles, facial nerve, or chorda tympani; size of the TM and EAC on computed tomography; and pre- and postoperative hearing level, were collected. RESULTS We included 7 and 18 patients with and without CEACS, respectively. The malleus handle defect, anterior deviation of the chorda tympani, and small TM (7 mm) (p-values 0.015, <0.001, and 0.003, respectively; Fisher's exact test) had significantly higher prevalence in patients with CEACS than in those without. The mean postoperative air-bone gap (ABG) in patients with CEACS was not significantly different from that in patients with normal-sized EAC (20.6 dB and 19.5 dB, respectively; p-value, 0.121; Mann-Whitney U test). No difference was observed in mean postoperative ABG between patients with small TM and those with normal-sized TM (19.2 dB and 20.0 dB, respectively; p-value, 0.469; Mann-Whitney U test). CONCLUSION Patients with CEACS were more likely to have malleus handle defect, anterior deviation of the chorda tympani, and small TM than those without CEACS.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the rate of change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) after hospital discharge between patients with and without COVID-19 who experienced in-hospital AKI. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at 5 hospitals in Connecticut and Rhode Island from March 10 to August 31, 2020. Patients who were tested for COVID-19 and developed AKI were screened, and those who survived past discharge, did not require dialysis within 3 days of discharge, and had at least 1 outpatient creatinine level measurement following discharge were included. EXPOSURES: Diagnosis of COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mixed-effects models were used to assess the association between COVID-19Cassociated AKI and eGFR slope after discharge. The secondary outcome was the time to AKI recovery for the subgroup of patients whose kidney function had not returned to the baseline level by discharge. RESULTS: A total of 182 patients with COVID-19Cassociated AKI and 1430 patients with AKI not associated with COVID-19 were included. The population included 813 women (50.4%); median age was 69.7 years (interquartile range, 58.9-78.9 years). Patients with COVID-19Cassociated AKI were more likely to be Black (73 [40.1%] vs 225 [15.7%]) or Hispanic (40 [22%] vs 126 [8.8%]) and had fewer comorbidities than those without COVID-19 but similar rates of preexisting chronic kidney disease and hypertension. Patients with COVID-19Cassociated AKI had a greater decrease in eGFR in the unadjusted model (?11.3; 95% CI, C22.1 to ?0.4 mL/min/1.73 m(2)/y; P = .04) and after adjusting for baseline comorbidities (?12.4; 95% CI, C23.7 to ?1.2 mL/min/1.73 m(2)/y; P = .03). In the fully adjusted model controlling for comorbidities, peak creatinine level, and in-hospital dialysis requirement, the eGFR slope difference persisted (?14.0; 95% CI, C25.1 to ?2.9 mL/min/1.73 m(2)/y; P = .01). In the subgroup of patients who had not achieved AKI recovery by discharge (n = 319), COVID-19Cassociated AKI was associated with decreased kidney recovery during outpatient follow-up (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.35-0.92). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of US patients who experienced in-hospital AKI, COVID-19Cassociated AKI was associated with a greater rate of eGFR decrease after discharge compared with AKI in patients without COVID-19, independent of underlying comorbidities or AKI severity. This eGFR trajectory may reinforce the importance of monitoring kidney function after AKI and studying interventions to limit kidney disease after COVID-19Cassociated AKI.","output":"Assessment of Acute Kidney Injury and Longitudinal Kidney Function After Hospital Discharge Among Patients With and Without COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The full range of long\\\\term health consequences in intensive care unit (ICU) survivors with COVID\\\\19 is unclear.

A distinguishing feature of this new model is that it allows us to consider a set up under general latency and infectious period distributions. To some extent, queuing systems with infinitely many servers and a Markov chain with time-varying transition rate are the very technical underpinning of the paper. Although more general, the Markov chain is as tractable as previous models for exponentially distributed latency and infection periods. It is also significantly simpler and more tractable than semi-Markov models with a similar level of generality. Based on the notion of stochastic stability, we derive a sufficient condition for a shrinking epidemic in terms of the queuing system's occupation rate that drives the dynamics. Relying on this condition, we propose a class of ad-hoc stabilising mitigation strategies that seek to keep a balanced occupation rate after a prescribed mitigation-free period. We validate the approach in the light of recent data on the COVID-19 epidemic and assess the effect of different stabilising strategies. The results suggest that it is possible to curb the epidemic with various occupation rate levels, as long as the mitigation is not excessively procrastinated.","output":"A Novel Stochastic Epidemic Model with Application to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance Optimal management of sedation and airway during thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke is controversial due to lack of evidence from randomized trials. Objective To assess whether conscious sedation is superior to general anesthesia for early neurological improvement among patients receiving stroke thrombectomy. Design, Setting, and Participants SIESTA (Sedation vs Intubation for Endovascular Stroke Treatment), a single-center, randomized, parallel-group, open-label treatment trial with blinded outcome evaluation conducted at Heidelberg University Hospital in Germany (April 2014-February 2016) included 150 patients with acute ischemic stroke in the anterior circulation, higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score (>10), and isolated/combined occlusion at any level of the internal carotid or middle cerebral artery. Intervention Patients were randomly assigned to an intubated general anesthesia group (n = 73) or a nonintubated conscious sedation group (n = 77) during stroke thrombectomy. Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcome was early neurological improvement on the NIHSS after 24 hours (0-42 [none to most severe neurological deficits; a 4-point difference considered clinically relevant]). Secondary outcomes were functional outcome by modified Rankin Scale (mRS) after 3 months (0-6 [symptom free to dead]), mortality, and peri-interventional parameters of feasibility and safety. Results Among 150 patients (60 women [40%]; mean age, 71.5 years; median NIHSS score, 17), primary outcome was not significantly different between the general anesthesia group (mean NIHSS score, 16.8 at admission vs 13.6 after 24 hours; difference, -3.2 points [95% CI, -5.6 to -0.8]) vs the conscious sedation group (mean NIHSS score, 17.2 at admission vs 13.6 after 24 hour; difference, -3.6 points [95% CI, -5.5 to -1.7]); mean difference between groups, -0.4 (95% CI, -3.4 to 2.7; P = .82). Of 47 prespecified secondary outcomes analyzed, 41 showed no significant differences. In the general anesthesia vs the conscious sedation group, substantial patient movement was less frequent (0% vs 9.1%; difference, 9.1%; P = .008), but postinterventional complications were more frequent for hypothermia (32.9% vs 9.1%; P < .001), delayed extubation (49.3% vs 6.5%; P < .001), and pneumonia (13.7% vs 3.9%; P = .03). More patients were functionally independent (unadjusted mRS score, 0 to 2 after 3 months [37.0% in the general anesthesia group vs 18.2% in the conscious sedation group P = .01]). There were no differences in mortality at 3 months (24.7% in both groups). Conclusions and Relevance Among patients with acute ischemic stroke in the anterior circulation undergoing thrombectomy, conscious sedation vs general anesthesia did not result in greater improvement in neurological status at 24 hours.

We conducted a scientific search in main databases with a combination of related MESH terms and keywords. The outcomes included common clinical symptoms at the time of onset of the disease, common laboratory and radiological findings, the rates of vaginal delivery and Cesarean section, Cesarean section indications, maternal complications, and vertical transmission rates. A total of 51 studies comprising 571 pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia were included in the study. The most common symptoms were fever, cough, and dyspnea, respectively. Elevated C-reactive protein and ground-glass opacities were the most common laboratory and radiological findings of COVID-19 pneumonia, respectively. A total of 114 Cesarean sections were performed due to COVID-19-related concerns. There were 55 cases of intubation (11.6%) and 13 maternal deaths (2.3%). The vertical transmission rate was 7.9%. We conclude that the characteristics of pneumonia caused by COVID-19 in pregnant women do not appear to be different from those in the general population with COVID-19 infections. However, pregnant women with underlying diseases were more likely to develop COVID-19 than others, and, in those infected with the virus, the rate of Cesarean delivery and preterm birth increased.","output":"A Systematic Review of 571 Pregnancies Affected by COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated an immediate response and rapid transition from traditional face-to-face behavioral health services to behavioral telehealth at an organization serving sexual and gender diverse (SGD) individuals in Chicago.

It is widely applied in runners for performance enhancement. However, there is no scientific background to use it as a running speed modulator. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to verify the KT effect on running performance in university-level students while speed is considered. The 1 km run and 40 m shuttle run were investigated. Participants were highly motivated to run as fast as possible since the research was part of the graded fitness test. Students wanted to perform as well as possible to get good marks. Methods: A total of 150 students aged 19.93  0.85 with BMIs of 26.93  0.98 were randomly distributed to the experimental (EG), placebo (PG), and control group (CG). In the EG, 50 students were measured pre-test (no KT) and post-test (KT applied). In the PG, 50 students were measured the same way using the placebo application post-test. In the CG, 50 students were measured without any intervention pre-test or post-test. The application area was the triceps surae muscle bilaterally with KT tension of 75%. The Kruskal-Wallis test and repeated measures ANOVA were used for analysis with a 0.05 level of significance. Results: A statistically significant group effect was reported in the EG (<0.05) in the 1 km run discipline. The time results obtained were significantly shorter than in the PG and the CG. There was no statistically significant difference (0.717) reported in the 40 m shuttle run discipline between the groups. Conclusions: Applying KT with a tension of 75% on the triceps surae muscle bilaterally might be useful to increase the performance of medium or longer distance runs but may not be effective in improving sprinting ability. We recommend applying the KT in the overall muscle and tendon area with a tension of 75% if there is a focus on performance enhancement.","output":"Positive Effect of Kinesiotape on 1 km Run Performance in University-Level Males: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The molecular structures (i.e., conformation spaces, CS) of bio-macromolecules and the dynamics that molecules exhibit are crucial to the understanding of the basis of many diseases and in the continuous attempts to retarget known drugs/medications, improve the efficacy of existing drugs, or develop novel drugs. These make a better understanding and the exploration of the CS of molecules a research hotspot. While it is generally easy to computationally explore the CS of small molecules (such as peptides and ligands), the exploration of the CS of a larger biomolecule beyond the local energy well and beyond the initial equilibrium structure of the molecule is generally nontrivial and can often be computationally prohibitive for molecules of considerable size. Therefore, research efforts in this area focus on the development of ways that systematically favor the sampling of new conformations while penalizing the resampling of previously sampled conformations. In this work, we present Deep Enhanced Sampling of Proteins Conformation Spaces Using AI-Inspired Biasing Forces (DESP), a technique for enhanced sampling that combines molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and deep neural networks (DNNs), in which biasing potentials for guiding the MD simulations are derived from the KL divergence between the DNN-learned latent space vectors of [a] the most recently sampled conformation and those of [b] the previously sampled conformations. Overall, DESP efficiently samples wide CS and outperforms conventional MD simulations as well as accelerated MD simulations. We acknowledge that this is an actively evolving research area, and we continue to further develop the techniques presented here and their derivatives tailored at achieving DNN-enhanced steered MD simulations and DNN-enhanced targeted MD simulations.","output":"DESP: Deep Enhanced Sampling of Proteins Conformation Spaces Using AI-Inspired Biasing Forces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. The COVID pandemic has had a major impact on healthcare in hospitals, including the diagnosis and treatment of infections.

The probability of studied event (HAIE) during the studied period was calculate by Poisson distribution. Results. Four cases of HAIE were diagnosed in our institution during the study period. The incidence of HAIE during the study period was 2/patient-month and 0.25/patient-month during the previous 5 years (p=0.024). Two cases appeared during admission for COVID-19 with pulmonary involvement treated with metilprednisolone and tocilizumab. The other two cases were admitted to the hospital during the epidemic. All cases underwent central venous and urinary catheterization during admission. The etiology of HAIE was Enterococcus faecalis (2 cases), Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans (one case each). A source of infection was identified in three cases (central venous catheter, peripheral venous catheter, sternal wound infection, respectively). One patient was operated on. There were no fatalities during the first 30 days of follow-up. Conclusion. The incidence of HAIE during COVID-19 pandemic in our institution was higher than usual.

This brief report draws on a service evaluation undertaken immediately prior to and during the 2020 COVID-19 crisis. The pandemic creates a paradox when considering safety in the home, but it is important to recognise the dangers this presents to many victims of stalking. The information presented in this report is based on existing literature and early evidence from semi-structured interviews and discussions with 15 victims and six practitioners. Whilst lockdown measures might appear to be a time when victims are less accessible to their stalkers, early evidence from this study suggests that their vulnerability is increased. Technology has helped to facilitate stalking behaviours by providing stalkers with new approaches to control, humiliate, threaten and isolate their victims. Some lockdown restrictions have provided increased opportunities for stalkers to monitor their victims and the professional uncertainty and recognition around stalking has continued, coupled with delays in the criminal justice system. The COVID-19 crisis has reversed gains made by stalking victims and has imprisoned some victims in their homes making their whereabouts easier to monitor. Stalking behaviour has not ceased as a result of the COVID-19 restrictions and the risk of harm to victims remains significant.

METHODS: We invited people using PrEP who had an STI in the past 24 months to participate in this single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, AB/BA crossover superiority trial at the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium. Using block randomisation (block size eight), participants were assigned (1:1) to first receive Listerine Cool Mint or a placebo mouthwash. They were required to use the study mouthwashes daily and before and after sex for 3 months each and to ask their sexual partners to use the mouthwash before and after sex. Participants were screened every 3 months for syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhoea at the oropharynx, anorectum, and urethra.

In the Listerine-placebo group, the STI incidence rate was 1404 per 100 person-years during the Listerine period, and 1026 per 100 person-years during the placebo period. In the placebo-Listerine arm, the STI incidence rate was 1339 per 100 person-years during the placebo period, and 1475 per 100 person-years during the Listerine period. We did not find that Listerine significantly reduced STI incidence (IRR 117, 95% CI 084-164). Numbers of adverse events were not significantly higher than at baseline and were similar while using Listerine and placebo. Four serious adverse events (one HIV-infection, one severe depression, one Ludwig's angina, and one testicular carcinoma) were not considered to be related to use of mouthwash. INTERPRETATION: Our findings do not support the use of Listerine Cool Mint as a way to prevent STI acquisition among high-risk populations.

Contrary to explicit factors that are measurable, such as population density, number of medical staff, and the daily test rate, many factors are not directly observable, for instance, culture differences and attitudes toward the disease, which may introduce unobserved heterogeneity. Most contemporary COVID\\\\19 related research has focused on modeling the relationship between explicitly measurable factors and the response variable of interest (such as the infection rate or the death rate). The infection rate is a commonly used metric for evaluating disease progression and a state's mitigation efforts. Because unobservable sources of heterogeneity cannot be measured directly, it is hard to incorporate them into the quantitative assessment and decision\\\\making process. In this study, we propose new metrics to study a state's performance by adjusting the measurable county\\\\level covariates and unobservable state\\\\level heterogeneity through random effects. A hierarchical linear model (HLM) is postulated, and we calculate two model\\\\based metricsthe standardized infection ratio (SDIR) and the adjusted infection rate (AIR). This analysis highlights certain time periods when the infection rate for a state was high while their SDIR was low and vice versa. We show that trends in these metrics can give insight into certain aspects of a state's performance. As each state continues to develop their individualized COVID\\\\19 mitigation strategy and ultimately works to improve their performance, the SDIR and AIR may help supplement the crude infection rate metric to provide a more thorough understanding of a state's performance.","output":"New Metrics for Assessing the State Performance in Combating the COVID\\\\19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We examine in this note the impact of COVID-19 on the Spanish tourism sector by using a strong dependence model.

Healthcare services such as renal transplantation had to rapidly adjust and meet the needs to (1) protect patients and staff, (2) ramp up, conserve or redeploy resources while (3) ensuring that critical services remained operational. This paper aims to describe the experience of the renal transplant programme at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) in responding to the risks and constraints posed by the pandemic. METHODS AND MATERIALS This is a review and summary of the SGH renal transplant programme's policy and protocols that were either modified or developed in response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. RESULTS A multi-pronged approach was adopted to respond to the challenges of COVID-19. These included ensuring business continuity by splitting the transplant team into different locations, adopting video and tele-consults to minimise potential patient exposure to COVID-19, streamlining work processes using electronic forms, ensuring safe paths for patients who needed to come to hospital, ring-fencing and testing new inpatients at risk for COVID-19, enhancing precautionary measures for transplant surgery, ensuring a stable supply chain of immunosuppression, and sustaining patient and staff education programmes via video conferencing. CONCLUSIONS Though the COVID-19 pandemic has reduced access to kidney transplantation, opportunities arose to adopt telemedicine into mainstream transplant practice as well as use electronic platforms to streamline work processes. Screening protocols were established to ensure that transplantation could be performed safely, while webinars reached out to empower patients to take precautions against COVID-19.","output":"Managing a Renal Transplant Programme During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Practical Experience from a Singapore Transplant Centre."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Early detection of dementia is critical for intervention and care planning but remains difficult. Computerized cognitive testing provides an accessible and promising solution to address these current challenges. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate a computerized cognitive testing battery (BrainCheck) for its diagnostic accuracy and ability to distinguish the severity of cognitive impairment. METHODS: A total of 99 participants diagnosed with dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or normal cognition (NC) completed the BrainCheck battery. Statistical analyses compared participant performances on BrainCheck based on their diagnostic group. RESULTS: BrainCheck battery performance showed significant differences between the NC, MCI, and dementia groups, achieving 88% or higher sensitivity and specificity (ie, true positive and true negative rates) for separating dementia from NC, and 77% or higher sensitivity and specificity in separating the MCI group from the NC and dementia groups. Three-group classification found true positive rates of 80% or higher for the NC and dementia groups and true positive rates of 64% or higher for the MCI group.

The disease is highly infectious, and its main clinical symptoms include fever, dry cough, fatigue, myalgia, and dyspnea. Health care providers are in front in fighting the coronavirus spread by making themselves the risk of contracting the disease. This study aimed to assess the preparedness and approaches of healthcare providers to tackle the transmission of COVID-19 among North Shewa Zone Hospitals. Methods Facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted from April to May 2020 among 422 healthcare providers in the North Shewa Zone, Amhara, Ethiopia using a self-administered questionnaire. Study subjects were selected through systematic random sampling based on their proportional distribution of sample size to each hospital. A structured questionnaire will be used to collect data. The data were coded and entered into the Epi data 4.2.1 version and the analysis was carried out in statistical package for social science 25 versions. Results 404 participants involved in the study gives a response rate of 95.7%. The self-satisfaction of healthcare providers revealed 301 (74.5%) of study participants feel unsafe in their workplace.

As vaccines and appropriate drugs for treatment of the COVID-19 can reduce the effectiveness in the presence of variants and/or new viral agents, one of the questions in social studies of medicine is effective public policy responses to reduce the impact of COVID-19 global pandemic and similar infectious diseases on health of people and on economies. This study analyzes public policy responses to the pandemic crisis across Italian regions that were the first areas to experience a rapid increase in confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19. The analysis of regional strategies, from January to July 2020, reveals differences in public policy responses to delay and reduce the height of epidemic peak and to afford health-care systems more time to expand and respond to this new emergency. Veneto Region in North-East Italy has managed health policy responses with: a) a timely and widespread testing of individuals, b) units of epidemiological investigation for tracing all contacts of infected people in an effective contact tracing system. This public policy response has reduced total deaths and the final size of COVID-19 pandemic on health of people. Other regions have done public interventions without a clear strategy and goals to cope with diffusion of COVID-19 and as a consequence, they have had a higher negative impact on public health.

RESULTS Twenty-eight patients (mean age 51.7 years; 18 women) with 28 aneurysms were included in the analyses. Fifteen aneurysms were fusiform, 5 dissecting, and 8 saccular. Average aneurysm size was 12.3 mm; 7 were giant. Twenty aneurysms were located along the middle cerebral artery, 6 along the anterior cerebral artery, and 2 along the anterior communicating artery. PED deployment was successful in 27 patients, with coils utilized in 6 cases. Clinical follow-up was available for an average of 10.7 months (range 3-26). Twenty-seven patients had follow-up neurovascular imaging: 21 aneurysms had complete occlusion, 4 had residual neck filling, and 2 had residual dome filling. Periprocedural complications (<30 days) occurred in 3 patients (10.7%), including 1 case of device failure resulting in stroke. Outcomes were good (modified Rankin Scale score 0 to 2) in 27 patients (96.4%) and fair (modified Rankin Scale 3) in 1.

EEG signals are affected by artifacts in the recorded electrical activity; thereby it affects the analysis of EGG. To extract the clean data from EEG signals and to improve the efficiency of detection during encephalogram recordings, a developed model is required. Although various methods have been proposed for the artifacts removal process, sill the research on this process continues. Even if, several types of artifacts from both the subject and equipment interferences are highly contaminated the EEG signals, the most common and important type of interferences is known as Ocular artifacts. Many applications like Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) need online and real-time processing of EEG signals. Hence, it is best if the removal of artifacts is performed in an online fashion. The main intention of this proposal is to accomplish the new deep learning-based ocular artifacts detection and prevention model. In the detection phase, the 5-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), and Pisarenko harmonic decomposition are used for decomposing the signals. Then, the Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) are adopted as the techniques for extracting the features. With the collected features, the development of optimized Deformable Convolutional Networks (DCN) is used for the detection of ocular artifacts from the input EEG signal. Here, the optimized DCN is developed by optimizing or tuning some significant parameters by Distance Sorted-Electric Fish Optimization (DS-EFO). If the artifacts are detected, the mitigation process is performed by applying the Empirical Mean Curve Decomposition (EMCD), and then, the optimized DCN is used for denoising the signals. Finally, the clean signal is generated by applying inverse EMCD.

The infection may result into severe pneumonia with clusters illness onsets. Its impacts on public health make it paramount to clarify the clinical features with other pneumonias. METHODS: Nineteen 2019-nCoV pneumonia (NCOVID-19) and fifteen other pneumonia patients (NON-NCOVID-19) in out of Hubei places were involved in this study. Both NCOVID-19 and NON-NCOVID-19 patients were confirmed to be infected in throat swabs or/and sputa with or without 2019-nCoV by real-time RT-PCR. We analyzed the demographic, epidemiological, clinical, and radiological features from those patients, and compared the difference between NCOVID-19 and NON-NCOVID-19. RESULTS: All patients had a history of exposure to confirmed case of 2019-nCoV or travel to Hubei before illness. The median duration, respectively, was 8 (IQR:6~11) and 5 (IQR:4~11) days from exposure to onset in NCOVID-19 and NON-NCOVID-19. The clinical symptoms were similar between NCOVID-19 and NON-NCOVID-19. The most common symptoms were fever and cough. Fifteen (78.95%) NCOVID-19 but 4 (26.67%) NON-NCOVID-19 patients had bilateral involvement while 17 (89.47%) NCOVID-19 but 1 (6.67%) NON-NCOVID-19 patients had multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity of chest CT images.

Telephone interviews were conducted in Cantonese with adult residents. The response rate was 23.8% and the sample was representative of the Hong Kong population. Multivariable logistic regressions of 521 respondents adjusted with age and gender found education, income, risk perception and disaster preparedness were insignificantly associated with risk-taking behaviour during typhoons. This suggests that other factors may be involved in driving this behaviour, such as a general tendency to underestimate risk or sensation seeking. Further Health-EDRM research into risk-taking and sensation seeking behaviour during extreme events is needed to identify policy measures.","output":"Factors Associated with Urban Risk-Taking Behaviour during 2018 Typhoon Mangkhut: A Cross Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we model the epidemic course of a pathogen infection within a semi-closed group which generates clinical signals which do not necessarily permit its ready and certain identification.

Using air purifiers with a HEPA filter H14, a 4.6-6.1 Log reduction of test viruses can be achieved if bacteriophages are directly aerosolised into the air purifier, which corresponds to a reduction of 99.9974-99.9999%.

This report examined how telecommuting is related to smoking behavior of wage and salary workers. METHODS: Self\\\\reported smoking behavior of 1,390 U.S. wage and salary workers aged 16C64 years from the Tobacco Use Supplement of the Current Population Survey 2018/19 were linked to the 2018 American Time Use Survey. Weighted multivariate logistic regression predicting smoking probability and generalized linear regression predicting smoking intensity were used for analysis. RESULTS: Almost a fifth (19%) of wage and salary workers reported working from home and over a half (52%) reported working in telecommuting amenable occupations. Nearly 12% were current smokers, smoking 14.7 cigarettes daily on average. Compared to their counterparts, smoking prevalence (percentage points) was lower among those employed in telecommuting amenable occupations (?0.52, p < .001 for all; 0.01, p = .862 for men; ?2.40, p < .001 for women) and who worked more frequently from home (?0.21, p < .001 for all; ?0.76, p < .001 for men; ?0.03, p = .045 for women).

METHODS US scans of the neck vasculature were collected to produce a dataset of 2439 images and their respective manual segmentations. Fourfold cross-validation was employed to train and evaluate Mask RCNN and U-Net models. The U-Net algorithm includes a post-processing step that selects the largest connected segmentation for each class. A Mask R-CNN-based vascular reconstruction pipeline was validated by performing a surface-to-surface distance comparison between US and CT reconstructions from the same patient. RESULTS The average CA and IJV Dice scores produced by the Mask R-CNN across the evaluation data from all four sets were [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]. The average Dice scores produced by the post-processed U-Net were [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], for the CA and IJV, respectively. The reconstruction algorithm utilizing the Mask R-CNN was capable of producing accurate 3D reconstructions with majority of US reconstruction surface points being within 2 mm of the CT equivalent. CONCLUSIONS On average, the Mask R-CNN produced more accurate vascular segmentations compared to U-Net. The Mask R-CNN models were used to produce 3D reconstructed vasculature with a similar accuracy to that of a manually segmented CT scan.

On the other hand, T-cell function in particular cytotoxic T-cell function is the main mechanism for preventing severe viral disease and also for the control of viruses such as herpesviruses that can cause latency and thus reactivate in an immunocompromised individual.

T-cell dysfunction is usually most important early after SCT while deficient B-cell reconstitution can remain for many years after SCT. Furthermore, since loss of specific antibodies occurs frequently over time after allogeneic SCT, this will also increase the risk for reinfections with previously encountered viruses such as measles or varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and allow reactivation of viruses controlled by antibodies such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) [1, 2].","output":"Viral Infections in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Recipients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":": It is now known that SARS-CoV-2 infection because of coronavirus is highly contagious and caused varying degrees of illness throughout the world.

In response, the question of how individuals from different social and economic strata cope with those changes has arisen, as well as how much they have affected their mental well-being. Choosing strategies that cope with both the pandemic and the well-being of the population has also been a challenge for different governments. While a large number of studies have investigated the mental health of people from different populations during the COVID-19 pandemic, few have explored the number and type of changes experienced during lockdown by the general population, alongside their relationships with health-related quality of life (HRQoL). To fill this research gap, an observational cross-sectional study on those associations was conducted in the French-speaking part of the Swiss general population. Data were collected from 431 participants during the first four weeks of lockdown due to COVID-19. Multivariate regressions were used to identify the sociodemographic profile of the population that experienced different types and numbers of changes during this period, the association of those changes with the HRQoLmental and physicaland infection beliefs, and the perception of the governmental measures. We show that the more changes people experienced, the lower their mental HRQoL; however, adherence to governmental measures has helped people to cope with the imposed changes, even though the number of unexpected and unwished changes have strained their mental HRQoL. The low-income population experienced financial difficulties and changes in their food intake more frequently, while dual-citizenship or non-Swiss individuals declared conflictual situations more frequently. Sport practice had a positive association with mental HRQoL; nevertheless, a decrease in sport practice was frequently reported, which correlated with a lower mental HRQoL. Risk perception of COVID-19 increased with lower physical HRQoL score, which supports the efficiency of governmental communication regarding the pandemic. Our results support that government measures should be accompanied by effective and targeted communication about the risk of infection, in order to encourage all strata of the general population to follow such measures and adapt to the changes without unduly affecting their mental health. The usage of such tools might help to reduce the impact of policy-imposed changes on the mental HRQoL of the general population, by inducing voluntary changes in informed and engaged populations.","output":"Sudden Changes and Their Associations with Quality of Life during COVID-19 Lockdown: A Cross-Sectional Study in the French-Speaking Part of Switzerland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"UNLABELLED The author draws attention to the up-to-datedness of the selected topic and its personal and institutional effects.

Of the estimated almost 1000 students and 1048 classroom days reported, the mean percentage of the school day with appropriate mask usage was 76.9%. CONCLUSIONS: For a majority of the day while conducting in-person instruction, children in grades pre-K-2 are able to adhere to mask wearing as a key mitigation strategy for limiting SARS-CoV2 infection spread and possible future use.","output":"Adherence to Masking Requirement During the COVID-19 Pandemic by Early Elementary School Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has emerged as a coronavirus infection of humans in the past 5 years. Though confined to certain geographical regions of the world, infection has been associated with a case fatality rate of 35%, and this mortality may be higher in ventilated patients. As there are few readily available animal models that accurately mimic human disease, it has been a challenge to ethically determine what optimum treatment strategies can be used for this disease. We used in-vitro and human ex-vivo explant cultures to investigate the effect of two immunomodulatory agents, interferon alpha and cyclosporine, singly and in combination, on MERS-CoV replication. In both culture systems the combined treatment was more effective than either agent used alone in reducing MERS-CoV replication. PCR SuperArray analysis showed that the reduction of virus replication was associated with a greater induction of interferon stimulated genes. As these therapeutic agents are already licensed for clinical use, it may be relevant to investigate their use for therapy of human MERS-CoV infection.","output":"Effect of interferon alpha and cyclosporine treatment separately and in combination on Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) replication in a human in-vitro and ex-vivo culture model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic brought abrupt changes for international events that promote entrepreneurship and innovation Usually, such events bring together thousands of participants to provide them with information about ongoing and emerging trends in their fields, to network with old and new colleagues and get ideas that can develop into innovations In 2020, most such events were cancelled Few events were organized virtually, that is without participants physically coming together Compared with physical face-to-face events, virtual events reduce the travel-related emissions and consumption, thereby supporting sustainability This article studies the SHIFT entrepreneurship and innovation event held virtually in October 2020 and organized in Finland For this article, the author gathered data about user preferences from surveying participants, speakers, presenters and organizers, almost all of whom were first-time users of VirBELAs 3D virtual platform Furthermore, participant observation and interviews via avatars were conducted during the event At the virtual event, 68% of respondents talked with former acquaintances, and 68% also talked with new acquaintances, and 53% opinioned that using the virtual platform can support the emergence of innovations Virtual entrepreneurship and innovation events have potential to support networking, novel ideas and thus innovations, but issues of trust and confidentiality arose concerns among some participants","output":"Entrepreneurship and Innovation Events during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The User Preferences of VirBELA Virtual 3D Platform at the SHIFT Event Organized in Finland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose a method to adjust contributions from upwind emissions to downwind PM2.5 concentrations to account for the differences between observed and simulated PM2.5 concentrations in an upwind area. Emissions inventories (EI) typically have a time lag between the inventory year and the release year. In addition, traditional emission control policies and social issues such as the COVID-19 pandemic cause steady or unexpected changes in anthropogenic emissions. These uncertainties could result in overestimation of the emission impacts of upwind areas on downwind areas if emissions used in modeling for the upwind areas were larger than the reality. In this study, South Korea was defined as the downwind area while other regions in Northeast Asia including China were defined as the upwind areas to evaluate applicability of the proposed adjustment method. We estimated the contribution of emissions released from the upwind areas to PM2.5 concentrations in South Korea from 2015 to 2020 using a three-dimensional photochemical model with two EIs. In these two simulations for 2015-2020, the annual mean foreign contributions differed by 4.1-5.5 g/m3. However, after adjustment, the differences decreased to 0.4-1.1 g/m3. The adjusted annual mean foreign contributions were 12.7 and 8.8 g/m3 during 2015-2017 and 2018-2020, respectively. Finally, we applied the adjustment method to the COVID-19 pandemic period to evaluate the applicability for short-term episodes. The foreign contribution of PM2.5 during the lockdown period in China decreased by 30% after adjustment and the PM2.5 normalized mean bias in South Korea improved from 15% to -4%. This result suggests that the upwind contribution adjustment can be used to alleviate the uncertainty of the emissions inventory used in air quality simulations. We believe that the proposed upwind contribution adjustment method can help to correctly understand the contributions of local and upwind emissions to PM2.5 concentrations in downwind areas.","output":"An observation-based adjustment method of regional contribution estimation from upwind emissions to downwind PM2.5 concentrations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The ever-growing number of COVID-19 patients stresses upon the need to identify effective yet readily available predictors of disease severity to ensure better clinical outcomes D-dimer is a fibrin specific degradation product derived by enzymatic action of plasmin on factor XIIIa cross-linked fibrin It serves as an ideal marker for activation of coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways Identification of coagulopathy as an important complication in COVID-19 patients has brought to focus D-dimer as a possible predictor of clinical severity in patients Aim: In this study, we analysed the role of D-dimer levels in assessing the clinical severity of the COVID-19 patients Materials and Methods: We enrolled 217 in-patients of Tirunelveli Medical College in this single centre observational study and classified them into asymptomatic, mild, moderate and severe according to \\"Clinical Management Protocol: COVID 19\\", by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and Director General of Health Services D-dimer was estimated in the separated plasma, using latex based assay using semi automated coagulation analyser Data were presented as percentages for categorical variables and medianInter Quartile Range (IQR) for continuous variables Chi-square test was used to compare the D-dimer values between symptomatic and asymptomatic groups A value of p&lt;0 05 was considered statistically significant Results: Among the 217 cases 88 9% were asymptomatic cases, 8 8% presented with mild clinical severity and 2 3% had moderate clinical presentation In our study population, the MeanSD and MedianIQR of D-dimer values (in ng/mL) were 223 4230 6 and 157 0187 7, respectively The mean D-dimer value was found to increase as the category of our study group ascended from asymptomatic patients to mild and moderate clinical cases It was noted that 91 1% of the cases who had D-dimer values &lt;500 ng/mL were asymptomatic Also, the odds of patients with high levels of D-dimer being clinically symptomatic was 5 5 times more than the odds of patients with D-dimer levels &lt;500 ng/mL Conclusion: Elevation of D-dimer levels associated with the severity of clinical course of patients infected with SARS CoV-2 when compared to patients with mild or asymptomatic clinical presentations","output":"D-dimer: A marker of severity in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel COVID-19, detected in Wuhan, China, has reached almost every city across the globe, and researchers from many countries have used several epidemiologic models to describe the epidemic trends In this context, it is also important to know the geographic extent of the infected population Following this approach, a Gumpertz model was adapted with official data from the state of Hidalgo, Mexico, in order to estimate the people infected during this COVID-19 pandemic We found, based on the adjusted data, the highest value in infected people according to official and theoretical data Furthermore, using a geographical analysis based on geostatistical measures related to density of demographic and economic data, traffic level and geolocation, raster files were generated to estimate probability of coronavirus cases occurrence using the areas where the contagion may occur We also distributed the maximum contagion obtained by the epidemic model, using these raster files, and a regression model to weight factors according their importance Based on this estimated distribution, we found that most of the infected people were located in the southern border, a trend related to the economic strip in the southern part of Hidalgo State, associated with its vicinity to the Megacity of Mexico","output":"Prediction and Potential Spatially Explicit Spread of COVID-19 in Mexicos Megacity North Periphery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The host range of SARS-CoV-2 and the susceptibility of animal species to the virus are topics of great interest to the international scientific community.

Based on these analyses, cattle have been implicated as a potential susceptible species to SARS-CoV-2 and have been reported to have increased ACE2 receptor distribution in the liver and kidney, and lower levels in the lungs. The goal of the current study was to determine the susceptibility of cattle to SARS-CoV-2 utilizing inoculation routes that facilitated exposure to tissues with increased ACE2 receptor distribution.

Nasal and rectal swab samples, as well as blood and urine samples, were collected over the course of the study to evaluate viral shedding, viremia, and seroconversion. Pyrexia was used as the primary criteria for euthanasia and tissue samples were collected during necropsy. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in only two nasal swab samples collected on days 3 and 10 post-inoculation (pi) in two calves; one calf in the intratracheal group and the other calf in the intravenous group, respectively. Additionally, the calf in the intratracheal group that was positive on the nasal swab on day 3 pi also had a positive tracheobronchial lymph node on day 9 pi.

RECENT FINDINGS: Patients with IBD are not at increased risk of COVID-19 but several risk factors for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 infection) have been identified, such as active IBD, obesity, and corticosteroid use. COVID-19 outcomes are similar among patients with IBD and the overall population. Although biologics have not been shown to increase the risk of severe COVID-19 complications, several risk factors have been associated with negative COVID-19 outcomes in patients with IBD, including older age, obesity, the presence of comorbidities, active disease, and corticosteroid use. IBD therapy should, therefore, be continued with the aim of attaining or maintaining remission, except for corticosteroids, which should be held or reduced to the minimal effective dose. Although it has been recommended that immunosuppressive therapy be held during a case of COVID-19, the half-lives of these drugs and data on the timing of restarting therapy limit the strength of these recommendations. We recommend COVID-19 vaccination for IBD patients whenever available, as benefits to the individual and to society outweigh the risks. SUMMARY: As our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 continues to evolve, we are learning more about its impact in patients with IBD and how to better manage patients in this setting. Managing IBD during this pandemic has also highlighted the importance of restructuring services in order to adapt to current and potential future outbreaks.

In turn, ARDS is characterized by an acute inflammation and an excessive activity of the coagulation cascade, rising the vulnerability for venous thromboembolic events. In order to investigate the relation of inflammation and the influence of coagulation factors on their release, human peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PBMCs) were treated with autologous serum, heparinized plasma and different doses of fibrin. Thereafter, the concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the secretome of PBMCs was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Our analyses revealed autologous serum to significantly increase the secretion of cytokines and chemokines after 24 h of incubation time. Furthermore, the addition of fibrin markedly increased the secretion of cytokines and chemokines by PBMCs in a dose-dependent manner. Consequently, in accordance with previous studies, our study outlines that anti-coagulation may constitute a promising tool for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, reducing both, the cytokine storm, as well as the risk for thrombotic complications.","output":"Anti-coagulation for COVID-19 treatment: both anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[...]our model hypothesizes, if and when forging closer cooperation with an external powerin our case, connectivity cooperation with Chinaboosts the ruling elites major pathways of legitimation (and enhances their cooptation and/or coercive capacity), then the state is likely to downplay apprehensions and embrace such big power-backed ventures as the BRI.

Therefore, many so-called non-urgent elective procedures and outpatient appointments have been canceled or postponed, possibly impacting negatively on health and well-being of patients in the short- and long-term. Aim: Here, we aimed at describing numbers and types of outpatient appointments canceled as a result of government's restrictive measures in our memory clinic. Methods: The scheduled appointments at the memory clinic of the Santa Lucia Foundation IRCCS, Rome, Italy, are recorded in a comprehensive dataset under strict administrative control. Here, we compared appointments (first-time and follow-up) that were canceled from January to April 2020 with those of the corresponding months in 2019. Results: We observed a substantial decrease in appointments during 2020. The majority of scheduled appointments were follow-up, and about a quarter were first-time appointments. We estimated that 66.7% and 77.4% of patients missed out respectively their first and follow-up appointments in our memory clinic due to government's restrictive measures in MarchCApril 2020. Conclusions: A large number of patients with neurocognitive disorders missed crucial appointments due to government's restrictive measures, and many experienced a delay in initial diagnosis and initiation of treatment.

The risk of reaching to the composite endpoints was compared among patients with COVID-19 according to the presence and number of comorbidities. Results: Of the 1,590 cases, the mean age was 48.9 years. 686 patients (42.7%) were females. 647 (40.7%) patients were managed inside Hubei province, and 1,334 (83.9%) patients had a contact history of Wuhan city. Severe cases accounted for 16.0% of the study population. 131 (8.2%) patients reached to the composite endpoints. 399 (25.1%) reported having at least one comorbidity. 269 (16.9%), 59 (3.7%), 30 (1.9%), 130 (8.2%), 28 (1.8%), 24 (1.5%), 21 (1.3%), 18 (1.1%) and 3 (0.2%) patients reported having hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, diabetes, hepatitis B infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney diseases, malignancy and immunodeficiency, respectively. 130 (8.2%) patients reported having two or more comorbidities. Patients with two or more comorbidities had significantly escalated risks of reaching to the composite endpoint compared with those who had a single comorbidity, and even more so as compared with those without (all P<0.05).

Here, we characterize a non-canonical pathway implicating glycerophosphodiesterase 3 (GDE3, from GDPD2 gene). Human GDE3 expressed in HEK293T cell membranes catalyzed the conversion of lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) into monoacylglycerol and inositol-1-phosphate. The enzyme was equally active against 1-acyl- and 2-acyl-LPI. When using 2-acyl LPI, where arachidonic acid is the predominant fatty acid, LC-MS analysis identified 2-AG as the main product of LPI hydrolysis by GDE3. Furthermore, inositol-1-phosphate release into the medium occurred upon addition of LPI to intact cells, suggesting that GDE3 is actually an ecto-lysophospholipase C. In cells expressing G-protein-coupled receptor GPR55, GDE3 abolished 1-acyl-LPI-induced signaling. In contrast, upon simultaneous expression of GDE3 and cannabinoid receptor CB2, 2-acyl-LPI evoked the same signal as that induced by 2-AG. These data strongly suggest that, beside simply degrading the GPR55 LPI ligand, GDE3 can act as a switch between GPR55 and CB2 signaling. Coincident with a major expression of both GDE3 and CB2 in spleen, spleens from transgenic mice lacking GDE3 displayed doubling of LPI content, compared to wild type mice. Decreased production of 2-AG in whole spleen was also observed, supporting the in vivo relevance of our findings. These data thus open a new research avenue in the field of endocannabinoid generation and reinforce the view of GPR55/LPI being genuine actors of endocannabinoid system.","output":"Glycerophosphodiesterase 3 (GDE3) is a lysophosphatidylinositol-specific ecto-phospholipase C acting as an endocannabinoid signaling switch"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe COVID-19 patients demonstrate hypercoagulability, necessitating thromboprophylaxis.

A total of 9748 adults had complete data for longitudinal analyses. Outcomes included psychological distress (General Health Questionnaire-12), loneliness, current cigarette smoking, use of e-cigarettes and alcohol consumption. Cross-sectional prevalence estimates were calculated and multilevel Poisson regression assessed associations between time period and the outcomes of interest, as well as differential associations by age, gender, education level and ethnicity. RESULTS: Psychological distress increased 1 month into lockdown with the prevalence rising from 19.4% (95% CI 18.7% to 20.1%) in 2017C2019 to 30.6% (95% CI 29.1% to 32.3%) in April 2020 (RR=1.3, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.4).

The social isolation of older people leads to death without dignity. With the outbreak of COVID-19, efforts to eliminate solitary death need to be adjusted in line with changes in lifestyle and accompanying changes in social structure. Health monitoring services that utilize wearable devices may contribute to this end. Our goals are to outline how wearable devices might be used to (1) detect emergency situations involving solitary older people and swiftly connect them with medical treatment, to (2) reduce the frequency of deaths that remain undiscovered and (3) to reduce social isolation by promoting social interaction. METHODS: Theoretical and philosophical approaches were adopted to examine ethical issues surrounding the application of wearable devices and cloud-based information processing systems to prevent solitary death in the world with/after COVID-19. MAIN BODY: (1) Technology cannot replace social connections; without social support necessary to foster understanding of the benefits of health management through wearable devices among older adults, such devices may remain unused, or not used properly. (2) Maturity of the technology; systems face the difficult task of detecting and responding to a wide range of health conditions and life-threatening events in time to avert avoidable morbidity and mortality. (3) Autonomy and personhood; promoting the voluntary use of wearable devices that are a part of larger efforts to connect isolated individuals to a community or social services might be effective. Legal force should be avoided if possible. There is some concern that landlords may require an older person to sign a contract agreeing to wear a device. The autonomy of solitary older people should be respected. (4) Governance: policies must be developed to limit access to data from wearables and the purposes for which data can be used. CONCLUSION: If thoughtfully deployed under proper policy constraints, wearable devices offer a way to connect solitary older people to health services and could reduce cases of solitary death while respecting the personhood of the user.","output":"Solitary death and new lifestyles during and after COVID-19: wearable devices and public health ethics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Circadian oscillations are generated via transcriptional-translational negative feedback loops.

Here we showed that heterogeneity in circadian period is heritable and used a multi-omics approach to investigate underlying mechanisms. By examining large-scale phenotype-associated gene expression profiles in hundreds of mouse clonal cell lines, we identified and validated multiple novel candidate genes involved in circadian period determination in the absence of significant genomic variants. We also discovered differentially co-expressed gene networks that were functionally associated with period length. We further demonstrated that global differential DNA methylation bidirectionally regulated these same gene networks. Interestingly, we found that depletion of DNMT1 and DNMT3A had opposite effects on circadian period, suggesting non-redundant roles in circadian gene regulation.

Methods: A parallel randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted among self-selected student teachers at a Danish undergraduate program for teacher education in the autumns of 2019 and 2020. Participation was not recommended in case of (1) clinical depression or a diagnosis of psychosis or schizophrenia, (2) abuse of alcohol, drugs, and/or medicine. Randomization was performed by a Statistician who was blinded to the identity of the students. Data was collected using self-reported questionnaires. The primary outcome was a change in perceived stress 3 months from baseline. Secondary outcome measures were symptoms of anxiety and depression, well-being, resilience, mindfulness, and thoughts and feelings during rest. The effects were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle using mixed-effect linear regression models. Mediating effects of mindfulness skills on the mental health outcomes were explored using structural equation modeling. Results: The study group included 67 student teachers with 34 allocated to the intervention group (median age: 25 years; women: n = 24, 71%); and 33 students (median age: 25 years; women: n = 25, 76%) allocated to a waiting list control group. At baseline, mean Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) scores were 18.88 (SD: 5.75) in the intervention group and 17.91 (SD: 6.36) in the waiting list control group. A total of 56 students completed the questionnaire at a 3-month follow-up (28 in both the intervention- and the control group). Statistically significant effects of the intervention were found on perceived stress, symptoms of anxiety and depression, well-being, and on three of seven resting-state dimensions. No effects were found on resilience or mindfulness. Statistically significant mediated effects via resting-state dimensions were found. Conclusion The findings suggested that offering a mindfulness program at an undergraduate program for teacher education could significantly improve the mental health among self-selected students within 3 months. Results of mediation analysis supported the hypothesis that some of the effects might be explained by reduced distracting thoughts.

Favipiravir is an orally administrable antiviral drug whose mechanism of action is to selectively inhibit RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. A preliminary trial in COVID-19 patients reported significant improvements across a multitude of clinical parameters, but these findings have not been confirmed in an adequate well-controlled trial. We conducted a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III trial assessing the efficacy and safety of favipiravir in patients with moderate pneumonia not requiring oxygen therapy. METHODS: COVID-19 patients with moderate pneumonia (SpO(2)  94%) within 10 days of onset of fever (temperature  37.5 C) were assigned to receive either placebo or favipiravir (1800 mg twice a day on Day 1, followed by 800 mg twice a day for up to 13 days) in a ratio of 1:2. An adaptive design was used to re-estimate the sample size. The primary endpoint was a composite outcome defined as the time to improvement in temperature, oxygen saturation levels (SpO(2)), and findings on chest imaging, and recovery to SARS-CoV-2-negative. This endpoint was re-examined by the Central Committee under blinded conditions. RESULTS: A total of 156 patients were randomized. The median time of the primary endpoint was 11.9 days in the favipiravir group and 14.7 days in the placebo group, with a significant difference (p = 0.0136). Favipiravir-treated patients with known risk factors such as obesity or coexisting conditions provided better effects. Furthermore, patients with early-onset in the favipiravir group showed higher odds ratio. No deaths were documented. Although adverse events in the favipiravir group were predominantly transient, the incidence was significantly higher. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested favipiravir may be one of options for moderate COVID-19 pneumonia treatment. However, the risk of adverse events, including hyperuricemia, should be carefully considered. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.jp number: JapicCTI-205238.

The aim is to evaluate the rate of AKI, defined according to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcome guidelines, in a series of critical COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU of a single tertiary teaching hospital. METHODS: From April to May 2020, all consecutive critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU who did not meet exclusion criteria (length of ICU stay <48 h, ESRD requiring dialysis, and patients still hospitalized in ICU at the time of data analysis) were enrolled in this study. Patients were stratified according to the highest AKI stage attained during ICU stay. RESULTS: Sixty-one patients were included in the analysis. AKI was observed in 35/61 patients (57.4%): 25/35 episodes (71.4%) were observed within the first 7 days. AKI was classified as follows: 17.1% stage 1, 25.7% stage 2, and 57.2% stage 3. Fourteen out of 20 stage-3 patients required continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), mostly related to persistent oliguria. The overall ICU mortality was 68.9%, and it was higher in patients developing AKI if compared to no-AKI patients (p = 0.006). Renal function recovery of any grade was observed in 14 out of 35 AKI patients (40%). Among patients undergoing CRRT, 13 patients were still dialysis dependent at the time of death. CONCLUSION: In critical COVID-19 patients, ICU mortality is particularly high, especially in patients developing AKI.

Virulence is not static, instead depending on ecological context and potentially evolving rapidly. For instance, at the start of an epidemic, when susceptible hosts are plentiful, pathogens may evolve increased virulence if this maximizes their intrinsic growth rate. However, if host density declines during an epidemic, theory predicts evolution of reduced virulence. Although well-studied theoretically, there is still little empirical evidence for virulence evolution in epidemics, especially in natural settings with native host and pathogen species. Here, we used a combination of field observations and lab assays in the Daphnia-Pasteuria model system to look for evidence of virulence evolution in nature. We monitored a large, naturally occurring outbreak of Pasteuria ramosa in Daphnia dentifera, where infection prevalence peaked at ~ 40% of the population infected and host density declined precipitously during the outbreak. In controlled infections in the lab, lifespan and reproduction of infected hosts was lower than that of unexposed control hosts and of hosts that were exposed but not infected. We did not detect any significant changes in host resistance or parasite infectivity, nor did we find evidence for shifts in parasite virulence (quantified by host lifespan and number of clutches produced by hosts). However, over the epidemic, the parasite evolved to produce significantly fewer spores in infected hosts. While this finding was unexpected, it might reflect previously quantified tradeoffs: parasites in high mortality (e.g., high predation) environments shift from vegetative growth to spore production sooner in infections, reducing spore yield. Future studies that track evolution of parasite spore yield in more populations, and that link those changes with genetic changes and with predation rates, will yield better insight into the drivers of parasite evolution in the wild.

Most cases require mesh excision and complex abdominal wall reconstruction, with variable success rates. We report two cases of mesh salvage with a novel use of percutaneous drainage and antibiotic irrigation. CASES Two patients developed infected seromas after laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. One patient with a remote history of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) mesh infection underwent laparoscopic ventral hernia repair with a 20 x 23-cm piece of Parietex composite mesh. Two weeks post-operatively, he developed fevers and MRSA was aspirated from the seroma. Another patient had a 32 x 33-cm piece of ePTFE placed for repair. He subsequently developed a massive seroma requiring repeated aspirations. Four months following the repair, he developed an infected seroma with Klebsiella pneumonia. Each patient underwent percutaneous drainage of their abscesses with a six-French-pigtail catheter under ultrasound guidance. After 2 weeks of parenteral antibiotics and clinical resolution, the patients were placed on 4 weeks of gentamicin irrigations (80 mg in 30 cc solution) via the drain three times per day. Once therapy was completed, the drains were removed. The first patient also remains on daily oral doxycycline for suppression for his MRSA. Both patients have remained free of clinical signs of infection at 12 and 16 months, respectively, following the completion of therapy.

The 33-item questionnaire collected data on elective and emergency neurosurgical operations, ongoing learning activities, and health worker safety. RESULTS: A total of 298 of 470 neurosurgery residents completed the survey, equivalent to a 63% response rate. The decrease in elective neurosurgical operations in Indonesia and in the Philippines (median, 100% for both) was significantly greater compared with other countries (P < 0.001).

Different algorithms have been published for constructing parenclitic networks, leading to the questionwhich algorithm should be chosen? Initially, it was suggested to calculate the weight of an edge between two nodes of the network as a deviation from a linear regression, calculated for a dependence of one of these features on the other. This method works well, but not when features do not have a linear relationship. To overcome this, it was suggested to calculate edge weights as the distance from the area of most probable values by using a kernel density estimation. In these two approaches only one class (typically controls or healthy population) is used to construct a model. To take account of a second class, we have introduced synolytic networks, using a boundary between two classes on the feature-feature plane to estimate the weight of the edge between these features. Common to all these approaches is that topological indices can be used to evaluate the structure represented by the graphs. To compare these network approaches alongside more traditional machine-learning algorithms, we performed a substantial analysis using both synthetic data with a priori known structure and publicly available datasets used for the benchmarking of ML-algorithms. Such a comparison has shown that the main advantage of parenclitic and synolytic networks is their resistance to over-fitting (occurring when the number of features is greater than the number of subjects) compared to other ML approaches. Secondly, the capability to visualise data in a structured form, even when this structure is not a priori available allows for visual inspection and the application of well-established graph theory to their interpretation/application, eliminating the black-box nature of other ML approaches.","output":"Parenclitic and Synolytic Networks Revisited"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To investigate the rate of antibiotic resistance and its main risk factors in a population of patients with diabetic foot infection (DFI) during the COVID-19 pandemic, in comparison with the population of 2019.

In addition, several studies suggest that more vulnerable women are less likely to use them. Yet significant investments continue to be made in building and running MWHs within conflict-affected and under-resourced health systems. AIMS: We critically examine the literature to shed light on the challenges and opportunities provided by MWHs during health emergencies and in conflict situations. FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION: MWHs are difficult to utilise during crises because they require women to be away from home, are often designed as dormitories, can lack security and be over-crowded. Some MWHs have been adapted during situations of political conflict to incorporate birthing and broader reproductive health care, thereby improving the availability of care away from over-burdened health facilities. How MWHs are adapted during times of crisis may provide insights into what systems of care are more appropriate in meeting women's needs more broadly. CONCLUSION: The current global pandemic is an important time to reflect on whether MWHs are meeting the needs of a diverse range of women, in times of stability and during emergencies, and engage in genuine dialogue with women about the kinds of maternity care they want.

Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses is largely unknown during the COVID-19 pandemic but would inform strategies to rapidly and accurately test patients with respiratory symptoms. METHODS: This study retrospectively examined 298,415 respiratory specimens collected from symptomatic patients for SARS-CoV-2 testing in the three months since COVID-19 was initially documented in the province of Alberta, Canada (March-May, 2020). By focusing on 52,285 specimens that were also tested with the Luminex Respiratory Pathogen Panel for 17 other pathogens, this study examines the prevalence of 18 potentially co-circulating pathogens and their relative rates in prior years versus since COVID-19 emerged, including four endemic coronaviruses. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was identified in 2.2% of all specimens. Parallel broad multiplex testing detected additional pathogens in only 3.4% of these SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens: significantly less than in SARS-CoV-2-negative specimens (p < 0.0001), suggesting very low rates of SARS-CoV-2 co-infection. Furthermore, the overall co-infection rate was significantly lower among specimens with SARS-CoV-2 detected (p < 0.0001). Finally, less than 0.005% of all specimens tested positive for both SARS-CoV-2 and any of the four endemic coronaviruses tested, strongly suggesting neither co-infection nor cross-reactivity between these coronaviruses. CONCLUSIONS: Broad respiratory pathogen testing rarely detected additional pathogens in SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens. While helpful to understand co-circulation of respiratory viruses causing similar symptoms as COVID-19, ultimately these broad tests were resource-intensive and inflexible in a time when clinical laboratories face unprecedented demand for respiratory virus testing, with further increases expected during influenza season. A transition from broad, multiplex tests toward streamlined diagnostic algorithms targeting respiratory pathogens of public health concern could simultaneously reduce the overall burden on clinical laboratories while prioritizing testing of pathogens of public health importance. This is particularly valuable with ongoing strains on testing resources, exacerbated during influenza seasons.","output":"Broad respiratory testing to identify SARS-CoV-2 viral co-circulation and inform diagnostic stewardship in the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examines the behavioural intentions of international tourists travelling to Beijing when faced with smog pollution.

Several countries have declared a stringent lock-down in order to enforce social distancing and prevent the spread of infection. This analysis was conducted in an attempt to understand the impact of lock-down on infection and death rates over a period of time. Material and Methods: A validated database was used to generate data related to countries with declared lock-down. Simple regression analysis was conducted to assess the rate of change in infection and death rates. Subsequently, a k-means and hierarchical cluster analysis was done to identify the countries that performed similarly. Sweden and South Korea were included as counties without lock-down in a second-phase cluster analysis. Results: There was a significant 61% and 43% reduction in infection rates 1-week post lock-down in the overall and India cohorts, respectively, supporting its effectiveness. Countries with higher baseline infections and deaths fared poorly compared to those who declared lock-down early on. Sweden and South Korea fared equally well, as most lock-down countries stemmed the growth of infection and death. Conclusion: Lock-down has proven to be an effective strategy is slowing down the SARS-CoV-2 disease progression exponentially.

This review discusses emerging threats, newer modalities of diagnostic tests and emerging treatment options, and also highlights the increasing problem of antimicrobial resistance. RECENT FINDINGS Nosocomial pneumonia is increasingly due to multidrug-resistant Gram-negative organisms in immunosuppressed patients. Viral pneumonias remain a very significant threat, present atypically and carry a high mortality. Aspergillosis remains the most common fungal infection, and infections due to Mucorales are increasing. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is on the increase throughout the world. Mixed infections are common and early bronchoscopy with appropriate microbiological tests, including molecular diagnostics, optimise management and reduce mortality. CONCLUSION Pulmonary infection remains the most frequent infectious complication in the immunocompromised host. These complex infections are often mixed, have atypical presentations and can be due to multidrug-resistant organisms. Multidisciplinary involvement in specialist centres with appropriate diagnostics, treatment and infection control improves outcome.

METHODS: CORONADO is a nationwide observational study that included patients with diabetes hospitalised for COVID-19 between March 10 and April 10, 2020 in 68 French centres. The primary outcome combined tracheal intubation and/or death within 7 days of admission. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was reported for death up to day 28. The association between metformin use and outcomes was then estimated in a logistic regression analysis after applying a propensity score inverse probability of treatment weighting approach. RESULTS: Among the 2449 patients included, 1496 were metformin users and 953 were not. Compared with non-users, metformin users were younger with a lower prevalence of diabetic complications, but had more severe features of COVID-19 on admission. The primary endpoint occurred in 28.0% of metformin users (vs 29.0% in non-users, P = 0.6134) on day 7 and in 32.6% (vs 38.7%, P = 0.0023) on day 28.

Of note, -defensins also modulate microbe-induced inflammation by affecting the production of soluble tumor necrosis factor (sTNF) and other proinflammatory cytokines. Here, we report that natural rhesus macaque -defensin (RTD) isoforms regulate sTNF cellular release by inhibiting TNF--converting enzyme (TACE; also known as adisintegrin and metalloprotease 17; ADAM17), the primary pro-TNF sheddase. Dose-dependent inhibition of cellular TACE activity by RTDs occurred when leukocytes were stimulated with live Escherichia coli cells as well as numerous Toll-like receptor agonists. Moreover, the relative inhibitory potencies of the RTD isoforms strongly correlated with their suppression of TNF release by stimulated blood leukocytes and THP-1 monocytes. RTD isoforms also inhibited ADAM10, a sheddase closely related to TACE. TACE inhibition was abrogated by introducing a single opening in the RTD-1 backbone, demonstrating that the intact macrocycle is required for enzyme inhibition. Enzymologic analyses showed that RTD-1 is a fast binding, reversible, non-competitive inhibitor of TACE. We conclude that -defensin-mediated inhibition of pro-TNF proteolysis by TACE represents a rapid mechanism for the regulation of sTNF and TNF-dependent inflammatory pathways.

Estrogen has been commonly implicated in migraine pathogenesis, yet its exact role in the pathophysiology of migraines has yet to be fully understood. METHOD We conducted a scoping review of the literature regarding estrogen's role in migraine pathogenesis and included 19 studies out of an initial 202 in the final review. Two independent reviewers screened and extracted data from included studies based on predetermined inclusions and exclusion criteria. RESULTS The estrogen withdrawal hypothesis, discussed by 12 of the reviewed studies, is the most discussed theory about estrogen's role in migraine physiology and describes the association of migraine onset with natural declines in estrogen levels, particularly when estrogen levels fall below 45-50 pg/mL after an extended period of priming. Additional findings suggest that women with a history of migraine have an increased sensitivity to physiologic fluctuations in estradiol levels. Several studies suggest that migraines are associated with menstruation. CONCLUSION It appears that estrogen is very likely to play a key role in migraine pathogenesis, but seems to affect patients in different ways depending on their past medical history, age, and use of hormonal therapy.

In this study, we develop a method for detecting bone marrow edema by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the sacroiliac joints and a deep-learning network. A total of 815 MR images of the sacroiliac joints were obtained from 60 patients diagnosed with axSpA and 19 healthy subjects. Gadolinium-enhanced fat-suppressed T1-weighted oblique coronal images were used for deep learning. Active sacroiliitis was defined as bone marrow edema, and the following processes were performed: setting the region of interest (ROI) and normalizing it to a size suitable for input to a deep-learning network, determining bone marrow edema using a convolutional-neural-network-based deep-learning network for individual MR images, and determining sacroiliac arthritis in subject examinations based on the classification results of individual MR images. About 70% of the patients and normal subjects were randomly selected for the training dataset, and the remaining 30% formed the test dataset. This process was repeated five times to calculate the average classification rate of the five-fold sets. The gradient-weighted class activation mapping method was used to validate the classification results.

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Single institution across 3 hospital sites during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Patients who were intubated for respiratory wean tracheotomy underwent SARS-CoV-2 PCR nasal, throat, and endotracheal tube swabs at the time of the procedure. These were assessed via quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR. The tracheal tissue excised during the tracheotomy was cultured for SARS-CoV-2 with Vero E6 and Caco2 cells. Serum was assessed for antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 via neutralization assays. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were included in this study. The mean number of days intubated prior to undergoing surgical tracheotomy was 27.8. At the time of the surgical tracheotomy, PCR swab testing yielded 8 positive results, but none of the 35 individuals who underwent tissue culture were positive for SARS-CoV-2. All 18 patients who had serum sampling demonstrated neutralization antibodies, with a minimum titer of 1:80. CONCLUSION: In our series, irrespective of positive PCR swab, the likelihood of infectivity during tracheotomy remains low given negative tracheal tissue cultures. While our results do not undermine national and international guidance on tracheotomy after day 10 of intubation, given the length of time to procedure in our data, infectivity at 10 days cannot be excluded.

In this study, we truncated and modified cecropin 4 (41 amino acids) by varying the charge and hydrophobicity balance to obtain smaller AMPs. The derivative peptide C18 (16 amino acids) demonstrated high antibacterial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, as well as yeasts. Moreover, C18 demonstrated a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4 g/mL against the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and showed synergy with daptomycin with a fractional inhibition concentration index (FICI) value of 0.313. Similar to traditional cecropins, C18 altered the membrane potential, increased fluidity, and caused membrane breakage at 32 g/mL.

Besides, C18 possessed a strong binding ability with DNA at 7.8 M and down-regulated the expression of virulence factor genes like agrA, fnb-A, and clf-1 by more than 5-fold (p < 0.05). Interestingly, in the Galleria mellonella model, C18 rescued more than 80% of larva infected with the MRSA throughout 120-h post-infection at a single dose of 8 mg/kg (p < 0.05). In conclusion, this study provides a reference for the transformation of cecropin to derive small peptides and presents C18 as an attractive therapeutic candidate to be developed to treat severe MRSA infections.","output":"Novel Cecropin-4 Derived Peptides against Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) adalah jenis virus baru yang menyerang imunitas tubuh serta dapat menyebabkan kematian.

The model is applied to the daily released numbers of confirmed cases of Israel and United States of America to explore and predict the trend under vaccination based on their current epidemic status and intervention measures. For Israel, of which 53.83% of the population was fully vaccinated, under the current intensity of NPIs and vaccination scheme, the pandemic is predicted to end between May 14, 2021 to May 16, 2021 depending on an immunity duration between 180 days and 365 days; Assuming no NPIs after March 24, 2021, the pandemic will ends later, between July 4, 2021 to August 26, 2021. For USA, if we assume the current vaccination rate (0.268% per day) and intensity of NPIs, the pandemic will end between February 3, 2022 and August 17, 2029 depending on an immunity duration between 180 days and 365 days. However, assuming an immunity duration of 180 days and with no NPIs, the pandemic will not end, and instead reach an equilibrium state with a proportion of the population remaining actively infected. Overall the daily vaccination rate should be chosen according to the vaccine efficacy and the immunity duration to achieve herd immunity. In some situations, vaccination alone cannot stop the pandemic, and NPIs are necessary both to supplement vaccination and accelerate the end of the pandemic.

METHODS A systematic search was performed in PubMed (MEDLINE), Embase, CINAHL and Cochrane Central Library databases from inception through 2 March 2020. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were prespecified for individual sarcomere genes, presence/absence of pathogenic variants, paediatric and adult cohorts, family history, inclusion of probands, and variant classification method. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa tool. RESULTS A total of 132 articles met inclusion criteria. The detection rate based on pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants was significantly higher in paediatric cohorts compared with adults (56% vs 42%; p=0.01) and in adults with a family history compared with sporadic cases (59% vs 33%; p=0.005). When studies applied current, improved, variant interpretation standards, the adult detection rate significantly decreased from 42% to 33% (p=0.0001) because less variants met criteria to be considered pathogenic. The mean difference in age-of-onset in adults was significantly earlier for genotype-positive versus genotype-negative cohorts (8.3 years; p<0.0001), MYH7 versus MYBPC3 cohorts (8.2 years; p<0.0001) and individuals with multiple versus single variants (7.0 years; p<0.0002). Overall, disease penetrance in adult cohorts was 62%, but differed significantly depending on if probands were included or excluded (73% vs 55%; p=0.003).

BACKGROUND: School closures and homeworking during the Covid-19 crisis have resulted in an immediate increase in unpaid care work, which draws new attention to gender inequality in divisions of unpaid care work. METHODS: Data come from the wave 9 (2017-19) of Understanding Society and the following April (n = 15,426) and May (n = 14,150) waves of Understanding Society Covid-19 study. Psychological distress was measured using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) at both before and during the lockdown, and unpaid care work was measured during the lockdown. Linear regression models were used. RESULTS: Women spent much more time on unpaid care work than men during lockdown, and it was more likely to be the mother than the father who reduced working hours or changed employment schedules due to increased time on childcare. Women who spent long hours on housework and childcare were more likely to report increased levels of psychological distress. Working parents who adapted their work patterns increased more psychological distress than those who did not. This association was much stronger if he or she was the only member in the household who adapted their work patterns, or if she was a lone mother. Fathers increased more psychological distress if they reduced work hours but she did not, compared to neither reducing work hours. CONCLUSION: There are continued gender inequalities in divisions of unpaid care work.

Both the abuse potential in mothers with ELM and in mothers with a history of mental disorders might be associated with a disturbed mother-child interaction. OBJECTIVE The current study examined differences in emotional availability between mothers with a history of ELM and previous or current mental disorders (non-resilient), mothers with ELM without mental disorders (resilient), and control mothers without ELM and without mental disorders. METHODS Thirty-three non-resilient mothers, 18 resilient mothers, and 37 control mothers and their 5- to 12-year-old children participated in a standardized mother-child interaction task. Videotaped interactions were rated by three independent, trained raters based on the Emotional Availability Scales (EA Scales) and compared between the groups. RESULTS The non-resilient mothers and their children showed reduced maternal sensitivity, structuring, non-intrusiveness, non-hostility, responsiveness, and involvement compared to the resilient mothers and their children and the control mothers and their children (p = 0.006, p2 = 0.12). No differences on any of the EA Scales were found between resilient mothers and control mothers. CONCLUSIONS These deficits in mother-child interaction in non-resilient mothers might contribute to mechanisms that could explain the cycle of abuse. Interestingly, resilient mothers, who did not develop a mental disorder despite having experienced ELM, did not show these deficits. Thus, prevention programs promoting resilience might be a key to break the cycle of abuse.","output":"The Cycle of Abuse: Emotional Availability in Resilient and Non-Resilient Mothers with Early Life Maltreatment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CLOs and Leveraged Loans 2020 was a virtual (online) event held June 16-17, 2020 Many of the speakers and panelists expressed strongly positive outlooks for the CLO and leveraged loan sectors Although the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic was a central theme in many sessions, the dominant view was that leveraged loans and CLOs will be able to weather the storm Sessions covered include: ?

Methods Twenty-four volunteers were randomized into two groups receiving biofeedback training (N = 12) via a mobile insole system (Loadsol?) or conventional training using a bathroom scale (N = 12). After initial PWB training (20 kg) of one randomized leg, the immediate and one-week retention effects were analysed using mean and maximum load (N) and overload rate (%). Statistical analysis was performed using a two-way repeated measures ANOVA with post-hoc pairwise comparisons (p < 0.05). RESULTS A significantly (p < 0.001) improved immediate and long-term PWB adherence was found for the insole feedback group during walking. A significant (p < 0.001) reduction of the overload rate by 86% was found for the insole feedback group when compared to the conventional training group after one week. Significant (p < 0.01) reductions by 51% and 46% was also found for the mean and maximum load in the insole feedback group when compared to the conventional training group.

We evaluated design elements previously shown for other coronavirus S protein-based vaccines to be successful, e.g., prefusion-stabilizing substitutions and heterologous signal peptides, for selection of a S-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate.

However, little is known about parents and students satisfaction with telepractice services and their preferences for different service delivery modes. These factors may affect therapy effectiveness and the future adoption of telepractice. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated students and parents perceptions of telepractice efficacy and their preferences for different service delivery modes (ie, on-site practice vs telepractice). We also identified factors that affect parents and students preferences for different service delivery modes during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A 19-question survey on telepractice satisfaction and preferences was administered to 41 Hong Kong Chinese students and 85 parents who received telepractice services from school-based speech-language pathologists during the COVID-19 class suspension period. In addition to providing demographic information and data on the implementation of telepractice services, all participants were asked to rate their perceptions of the efficacy of telepractice services and compare on-site practices to telepractice on a 5-point Likert scale (ie, 1=strongly disagree/prefer the use of on-site speech-language therapy services and 5=strongly agree/prefer the use of telepractice services). RESULTS: Despite the fact that telepractice efficacy was highly rated by parents (95% CI 3.30-3.66) and students (95% CI 3.21-3.76), both groups believed that telepractice was less effective than on-site practices (parents: 95% CI 2.14-2.52; students: 95% CI 2.08-2.65). Moreover, parents preferred on-site practices over telepractice (95% CI 2.04-2.43), whereas students did not prefer one mode of practice over the other (95% CI 2.74-3.41). A significant association between telepractice efficacy and a preference for telepractice services was found only among the students (=.43, P<.001), not the parents (=.07; P=.44). CONCLUSIONS: Although telepractice is an acceptable alternative service delivery option for providing speech and language therapy services to school-aged individuals, speech-language therapists and parents must play a more proactive role in telepractice services to facilitate effective communication between clinicians and parents.","output":"Parents and Students Perceptions of Telepractice Services for Speech-Language Therapy During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The present study examined the psychological effects and identify factors associated with worse outcomes, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Mexican nurses involved in fighting against COVID-19.

Moreover, since general anesthesia is an aerosol-generating procedure, its use became controversial. This strongly restricted therapeutic strategies. Here, we report a series of undeferrable surgical cases treated with awake surgery under neuraxial anesthesia. Contextual benefits of this approach are deepened. METHODS: During the first pandemic surge, thirteen patients (5 men and 8 women) with a mean age of 80 years, needing undelayable surgery due to abdominal emergencies, underwent awake open surgery at our Hospital. Prior to surgery, all patients underwent nasopharyngeal swab tests for COVID-19 diagnosis. In all cases, regional anesthesia (spinal, epidural, or combined spinal-epidural anesthesia) was performed. Intraoperative and postoperative pain intensities have been monitored and regularly assessed. A distinct pathway has been set up to keep patients of uncertain COVID-19 diagnosis separated from all other patients. Postoperative course has been examined. RESULTS: The mean operative time was 87 minutes (minimum 60 minutes; maximum 165 minutes). In one case, conversion to general anesthesia was necessary. Postoperative pain was always well controlled. None of them required postoperative intensive care support. No perioperative major complications (ClavienCDindo 3) occurred. Early readmission after surgery never occurred. All nasopharyngeal swabs resulted negative. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, awake laparotomy under regional anesthesia resulted feasible, safe, painless, and, in specific cases, was the only viable option. This approach allowed prevention of the need of postoperative intensive monitoring during the COVID-19 era.

Following the discovery of the initial CRISPR/Cas-based system, the technology has been advanced to facilitate a multitude of different functions. These include development as a base editor, prime editor, epigenetic editor, and CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and CRISPR activator (CRISPRa) gene regulators. It can also be used for chromatin and RNA targeting and imaging. Its applications have proved revolutionary across numerous biological fields, especially in biomedical and agricultural improvement. As a diagnostic tool, CRISPR has been developed to aid the detection and screening of both human and plant diseases, and has even been applied during the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. CRISPR/Cas is also being trialed as a new form of gene therapy for treating various human diseases, including cancers, and has aided drug development. In terms of agricultural breeding, precise targeting of biological pathways via CRISPR/Cas has been key to regulating molecular biosynthesis and allowing modification of proteins, starch, oil, and other functional components for crop improvement. Adding to this, CRISPR/Cas has been shown capable of significantly enhancing both plant tolerance to environmental stresses and overall crop yield via the targeting of various agronomically important gene regulators. Looking to the future, increasing the efficiency and precision of CRISPR/Cas delivery systems and limiting off-target activity are two major challenges for wider application of the technology.

Implicit in a social contract is the enactment of laws to achieve a democratic, civilized society and the concept of advocacy. Advocacy exists to protect an individuals rights. The legal profession originated organically as the citizens of Ancient Greece and Rome recognized the need for professional advocates. From this nascent beginning, the legal profession has evolved over centuries to adjust to cultural changes in our society. The digital age has altered cultural norms and permeated society thereby challenging the legal profession to adapt. Technologys tremendous impact on the legal profession appears not only in a lawyers daily practice, but also in the development of alternative business models designed to increase access to legal services and in the clamoring for regulatory reform. No doubt, the COVID-19 Pandemic has further propelled the legal profession to innovate and embrace technology.This Article briefly explores the development of the legal profession from its origin in Ancient Greece and Rome to its reemergence in medieval England, and then fast forwards to the beginnings of the legal profession in the United States.

Countrywide MTCT of HIV is estimated to be > 10,000 annually. Aims of present study are to find out the prevalence of HIV and correlates of HIV transmission among children given birth by HIV infected mother through systematic review along with meta-analysis. METHODS All avaiable articles are retrieved using MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Science Direct, EMBASE, Google Scholar and PUBMED following guidelines for Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI) are applied to critically reviewing the selected articles. STATA 13.0 is used to preparation of forest plot for Meta-analysis. For assessment of heterogeneity and publication biases I2 statistics along with Begg and Mazumdar's test and Egger's tests are used. Odds ratio (OR) along with forest plots have been showing with 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS All together 10 studies including 1537 pairs of mothers and new births are assessed in present meta-analysis. Present analysis revealed the prevalence of HIV due to MTCT in India as 8.76% (95% CI; 5.76, 12.31). Analysis of subgroups exhibit a higher pooled prevalence in eastern region of India, 10.83% (95% CI: 5.9, 17.81) and lower in in Western region in India, 6.37% (95% CI: 4.65, 8.49). Status of MTCT before and after initiation of universal ART are 10.23% (95% CI 6.61, 14.55) and 7.93% (95% CI 4.18, 12.76) respectively. Associated factors with MTCT of HIV include absence of maternal prevention of MTCT intervention, OR = 10.82 (95% CI: 5.28, 22.17), lacking in administration of infant ARV (antiretroviral), OR = 8.21 (95% CI: 4.82, 14.0) and absence of medical facility during childbirth OR = 3.73 (95% CI: 1.67, 8.33). CONCLUSIONS In India, pooled HIV prevalence of MTCT as high as 8.78% (95% CI; 5.76, 12.31) among babies born to infected mothers warrants urgent need of focused intervention for providing ART (PMTCT intervention), ensuring proper infant ARV prophylaxis, and avoiding delivery without proper medical facility to pregnant women with HIV for reduction of occurrence in HIV transmission from mothers to children.","output":"Mother-to-child HIV transmission and its correlates in India: systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main question surrounding the re-election of Macron is the uncertain balance of Frances flexilateral policy vis--vis the EU in a post-Brexit and COVID-19 context: Strengthening European integration by changing Frances practice towards the EU or taking an inter-governmentalist turn by using C in a very classical way C Europe as an Archimedes lever to defend national interests","output":"Presidential Election 2022: A Euroclash Between a Liberal and a Neo-Nationalist France Is Coming"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article provides an in-depth discussion of social distancing and its socio-behavioral implications on church gatherings in the era of COVID-19.

Historically, this has been treated with an open surgical approach (with high morbidity) and with angioplasty in more recent years. Herein we describe technical aspects of stenting of the IVC in patients with recalcitrant chronic occlusive disease and evaluate its outcomes. METHODS We reviewed all the patients treated in an endovascular fashion for venous disease at our institution from 2005 to 2014 to identify and to include those with IVC stent placement in this study. Clinical characteristics, treatment details, and outcomes data were collected from medical records. Primary end points were technical success, symptom resolution, freedom from reintervention, and patency rate at follow-up. RESULTS Twenty-eight patients (15 men) with a mean age of 48  2.7 years underwent IVC stent placement for 16 occlusions (4 congenital) and 12 high-grade stenoses. Hypercoagulable state was noted in 14 patients, 7 of whom had malignant disease. A previously placed IVC filter was present in 13 patients. Median time from onset of symptoms to presentation was 81 months (3-480 months). Lytic therapy with tissue plasminogen activator (Alteplase) was performed in 12 patients for a median of 2 days (range, 1-3 days). Self-expanding stents (Wallstent; Boston Scientific, Natick, Mass) were used most commonly in the IVC (n = 22) with or without adjunctive use of balloon-expandable stents (Palmaz stent; Cordis, New Brunswick, NJ). Technical success was 100%. At median follow-up of 10 months (range, 0-56 months), thrombotic complications requiring reintervention occurred in four patients at 1, 4, 8, and 37 months. One patient died at 2 weeks secondary to underlying malignant disease. Freedom from reintervention, patency rate, and symptom-free survival rate at 2 years were 84%, 90%, and 80%. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular stenting for chronic occlusive disease of the IVC is safe and effective in the midterm follow-up, with minimal morbidity. Reintervention rate is low, with excellent functional outcomes.","output":"Technical considerations, outcomes, and durability of inferior vena cava stenting."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper explores the impacts that the New Zealand government's lockdown measures to contain the COVID-19 virus during 2020 had on the activity and experiences of outdoor recreationists in New Zealand. Concepts related to coping strategies such as rationalisation, displacement and substitution, have been used frequently to explain the behavioural changes and processes involved in outdoor recreation when disruptions arise such as crowding and recreational conflict. However, such concepts have rarely been applied to rapid on-set disruptors such as pandemics. This paper adopts coping strategy theory to help document the strategies adopted by outdoor recreationists in response to the national lockdown in 2020. Based on a qualitative analysis of twenty interviews with outdoor recreationists in New Zealand, various coping mechanisms such as temporal, activity, and spatial displacement are identified. These include increased appreciation for outdoor settings, discovery of local activities and microadventures, and increased walking activity across the restricted, reaction and reset periods. Outdoor recreation coping strategies may contribute to increased resilience to disruptive and rapid on-set events and enhance understanding of how recreationists respond and adapt to disruption. This research presents a unique insight of coping strategies adopted in response to the national lockdown that may have implications for participation and management of outdoor recreation in New Zealand in the coming years. This paper also offers a new perspective on the behaviourist tradition in the field of outdoor recreation which may be fruitful for future research examining rapid on-set disruptions and crises.","output":"From backyards to the backcountry: Exploring outdoor recreation coping strategies and experiences during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Diagnostic accuracy studies aim to examine the diagnostic accuracy of a new experimental test, but do not address the actual merit of the resulting diagnostic information to a patient in clinical practice. In order to assess the impact of diagnostic information on subsequent treatment strategies regarding patient-relevant outcomes, randomized test-treatment studies were introduced. Various designs for randomized test-treatment studies, including an evaluation of biomarkers as part of randomized biomarker-guided treatment studies, are suggested in the literature, but the nomenclature is not consistent. METHODS: The aim was to provide a clear description of the different study designs within a pre-specified framework, considering their underlying assumptions, advantages as well as limitations and derivation of effect sizes required for sample size calculations. Furthermore, an outlook on adaptive designs within randomized test-treatment studies is given. RESULTS: The need to integrate adaptive design procedures in randomized test-treatment studies is apparent. The derivation of effect sizes induces that sample size calculation will always be based on rather vague assumptions resulting in over- or underpowered study results. Therefore, it might be advantageous to conduct a sample size re-estimation based on a nuisance parameter during the ongoing trial. CONCLUSIONS: Due to their increased complexity, compared to common treatment trials, the implementation of randomized test-treatment studies poses practical challenges including a huge uncertainty regarding study parameters like the expected outcome in specific subgroups or disease prevalence which might affect the sample size calculation. Since research on adaptive designs within randomized test-treatment studies is limited so far, further research is recommended.

However, prolonged duration of endotracheal tube placement contributes to the development of ventilator-associated pneumonias (VAPs). The aim of this study was to evaluate whether subglottic suctioning using TaperGuard EVAC tubes was effective in decreasing the frequency of VAP. METHODS A total of 276 mechanically ventilated patients for more than 72 hours were randomly assigned to group E (EVAC tube) and group C (conventional tube). All patients received routine care including VAP prevention measures during their intensive care unit stay. In group E, subglottic suctioning was performed every 6 hours. Outcome variables included incidence VAP, intensive care unit length of stay, and mortality. RESULTS Frequency of intraluminal suction, mechanical ventilation-free days, reintubation, the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen and mortality rate were similar between the 2 groups (P > .05). The mean cuff pressure in group E was significantly less than that in group C (P < .001). Ventilator-associated pneumonia was significantly less in group E compared with group C (P = .015).

Vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mother to child was found to be unlikely.","output":"Clinical manifestation, outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19 and the possibility of vertical transmission: a systematic review of the current data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The perception of the pass-through of oil price shocks on the real and financial spheres has undergone considerable evolution with the emergence of a literature devoted to the sources of oil price fluctuations. This perception is also found to evolve over time depending on market expectations, structural changes or crises. Focusing on the specific case of the US, this paper investigates the time-varying effects of oil price shocks on financial intermediation (credit market) and inflation as a transmission channel. Monthly data are used for a period that encompasses the recent Covid-19 pandemic crisis. Prior to the construction of a time-varying parameter structural vector autoregression stochastic volatility (TVP-SVAR-SV), a structural VAR (SVAR) model is estimated to disentangle oil price shocks in four shocks: oil supply, aggregate demand, domestic demand and oil-specific demand shocks. The results underscore the increasing response of financial intermediation to oil supply, aggregate demand and oil specific demand shocks since the shale revolution. In addition, the response of credit markets to aggregate demand shocks during the covid-19 pandemic is different from that observed during the subprime crisis. It appears also that the response of inflation influence the reaction of the credit market to aggregate and domestic demand shocks.","output":"The time-varying responses of financial intermediation and inflation to oil supply and demand shocks in the US: Evidence from Bayesian TVP-SVAR-SV approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE Children with complex chronic conditions (CCC) are disproportionately affected by obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and a growing number require continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Early initiation of effective CPAP can improve treatment adherence, so timely titration is critical. Autotitrating CPAP (APAP) can be started at home prior to the laboratory-based polysomnography (PSG) titration study, but no studies have examined its use in children with CCC. Our study aimed to compare treatment pressures determined by APAP to those determined by PSG in children with CCC. METHODS Retrospective study of children with OSA 18 years initiated on APAP between 2015-2019. Patients without adequate PSG or APAP data were excluded. Median pressures (PMED) and average device pressures 95% of the time (P95) from APAP use downloads were compared to PSG-prescribed pressures (PPSG). Demographics, clinical characteristics, and diagnostic PSG data were also collected. Feudtner's pediatric CCC classification system version 2 was used. Institutional Research Ethics Board approval was obtained. RESULTS Fourty-eight patients met inclusion criteria. Mean age was 11.6 (SD 4.1) years, 65.3% were male, and 64.6% had a CCC. APAP was used 4 hours/night for a median 59.0 (31.5, 81.8) % of nights. Median obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (OAHI) decreased from 15.0 (7.8, 26.7) events/hour on diagnostic PSG to 1.4 (0.5, 4.7) events/hour on titration PSG. Median PPSG was 8.0 (7.0, 9.3) cmH2O, PMED was 7.6 (6.8, 8.7) cmH2O, and P95 was 10.1 (8.9, 11.0) cmH2O. PMED and P95 both correlated with PPSG (r=0.37, p=0.01;r=0.28, p=0.05). Bland-Altman plots showed fair agreement between PMED and PPSG (bias-0.4, SD 2.3) and P95 and PPSG (bias 1.7, SD 2.5). Diagnostic OAHI significantly predicted PPSG (p&lt;0.05) on median regression analysis, but there were no other predictors (age, sex, CCC). CONCLUSIONS APAP-derived pressures correlated with and were close to final CPAP pressures determined by titration PSG. APAP was safe and generally well-tolerated. Initiation of APAP should therefore be considered in children with CCC who are awaiting their titration PSG. This mitigating strategy is imperative with long PSG waitlists in Canada, and especially now, with increased delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Autotitrating continuous positive airway pressure titration compared to laboratory-based polysomnography titration for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea in children with complex chronic care conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Rhomboid domain containing 1 (RHBDD1) plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis. Silibinin, which is a natural extract from milk thistle, has shown anti-tumor effects against various tumors. Here, we investigate whether silibinin affects the function of RHBDD1 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Methods The Oncomine database and an immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay were used to determine the RHBDD1 expression levels in lung cancer tissues. The associations between RHBDD1 and overall survival rate or clinicopathological parameters were respectively assessed using the Kaplan-Meier overall survival analysis or Chi-squared test. CCK-8 and Transwell assays were applied to analyze cell proliferation, migration and invasion. A549 cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of silibinin. RHBDD1 knockdown and overexpression were achieved via transfection with si-RHBDD1 or RHBDD1 overexpression plasmid, respectively. Western blotting was performed to measure the expressions of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers. Results We found that overexpression of RHBDD1 in lung cancer tissues correlates with a poor prognosis of survival. Clinical specimen analysis showed that upregulation of RHBDD1 correlates remarkably well with TNM stage and lymph node metastasis. Silibinin suppresses A549 cell proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, RHBDD1 was downregulated in silibinin-treated A549 cells. RHBDD1 overexpression reversed the suppressive effects of silibinin on A549 cell proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT expression, while its knockdown enhanced them.

The purpose was to assess the diagnostic usefulness of cardiac computed tomography (CT) in valvular and perivalvular complications in patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) and to compare CT results with transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and intraoperative findings. METHODS The retrospective study included 44 consecutive patients with PVE who underwent cardiac surgery. The mean age was 59.6  12.9 years, 33 (75 %) were males. The presence of vegetations, abscess/pseudoaneurysm, paravalvular leakage (PVL) and inflammatory infiltration were evaluated by TTE, TEE and CT prior to surgery and the results were compared with intraoperative findings. RESULTS Endocarditis affected 47 valves (26 mechanical, 21 biological) in 44 patients. PVE most often affected the aortic valve (n = 36), followed by the mitral valve (n = 9) and the pulmonary valve (n = 2). In the per-valve analysis, the sensitivity of TTE, TEE and CT in diagnosing vegetations was 65 %, 91 % and 96 %; abscess 44 %, 77 % and 89 %; paravalvular leakage 90 %, 100 % and 70 %; inflammatory infiltration 39 %, 56 % and 78 %, respectively. The combination of CT and echocardiography allowed the detection of abscesses/pseudoaneurysms and inflammatory infiltration in all cases except one. CONCLUSION CT was superior to echocardiography in the diagnosis of paravalvular abscesses, vegetations and inflammatory infiltration. Echocardiography had a higher diagnostic value to CT in the evaluation of paravalvular leakage.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients admitted to The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College in Bengbu City, Anhui Province, China, in January and February 2020 for COVID-19 pneumonia were enrolled in this study. COVID-19 infection was confirmed by the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in throat swab samples using real-time fluorescent reverse transcription PCR. Serum IL-6 concentrations at admission were measured by ELISA. Correlations between serum IL-6 concentrations and ICU admission due to the development of severe COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated. RESULTS This study enrolled 68 patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia. IL-6 concentrations were significantly higher in patients with more severe than less severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Eight of 40 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia became critically ill and required ICU admission. IL-6 concentrations were significantly higher in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who were than who were not treated in the ICU.

Antiviral therapy has a greater impact when provided early in the disease to outpatients, potentially preventing hospitalization and subsequent deaths, while reducing healthcare system pressure. Controversies persist about the best treatment option for COVID-19 outpatients at risk of disease progression to hospital. No head-to-head RCT has been conducted to compare the three major modalities in current use-oral/intravenous antivirals, monoclonal antibodies and COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP). Methods. We assembled data from March 2020 to April 2022 from published outpatient RCTs examining authorized COVID-19 therapies with hospitalization as the major endpoint, and that also assessed mortality, symptom resolution, underlying risk factors for progression, timing and dose of the intervention in relationship to evolving variants of concern (VOC). Findings. CCP, monoclonal antibodies and oral antivirals each had comparable efficacy converging to 80% hospital risk reduction dependent on the dose and the timing of the intervention. Most RCTs targeted populations with at least one risk factor for severe COVID-19. Control group hospitalizations were less than 10% in 16 of 20 RCTs. Amongst the effective two CCP trials, monoclonals and three antiviral small molecules, deaths were reduced by 90% from 44 total in combined control arm to 4 in intervention arms. The overall risk of bias was deemed low for nine studies and some concerns for eight. The I2 statistic heterogeneity amongst the outpatient trials with endpoint hospitalization is 73% (p- < 0.01). Interpretation. The emerging resistance of Omicron BA.2 and related sublineages (XE, BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5) to monoclonal antibodies suggests a pressing need to reevaluate CCP (nowadays largely available from vaccinees with high neutralizing antibody levels) for COVID19 outpatients at risk of disease progression, especially in settings with constrained medical resources.

Sen-itiroh Hakomori, the Scientific Director, provided all the institutional support. The characterization started from the 3 major alleles (A1, B, and O), and proceeded to the alleles of A2, A3, Ax and B3 subgroups and also to the cis-AB and B(A) alleles, which specify the expression of A and B antigens by single alleles.

Other scientists interested in blood group genes later characterized more than 250 ABO alleles. However, recent developments in next-generation sequencing have enabled the sequencing of millions of human genomes, transitioning from the era of genetics to the era of genomics. As a result, numerous SNP variations have been identified in the coding and noncoding regions of the ABO gene, making ABO one of the most studied loci for human polymorphism.

One hundred and ten (95%) patients completed follow-up and 68 patients (62%) continued to maintenance treatment. A total of 68 patients reported an effect on PROM, BD and ICIQ-OAB, which is the same 62% that continue in maintenance PTNS. A significant decline was seen in overall ICIQ-OAB score, with a median drop from 87 to 54, a significant decline in overall frequency and nocturia on bladder diary and a shift in pad test group in 19% of the incontinence patients. CONCLUSION PTNS shows an equally significant effect on men as well as women both in the iOAB and nOAB subgroups in a daily outpatient clinic. In our opinion, PTNS should be a standard treatment option available at urological departments, where both men and women in both sub-groups could benefit from treatment. Further randomized studies focusing on men with iOAB are needed.","output":"Percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation for idiopathic and neurogenic overactive bladder dysfunction: a four-year follow-up single-centre experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers, who are at the forefront of the fight against COVID-19, are particularly susceptible to physical and mental health consequences such as anxiety and depression. The aim of this umbrella review of meta-analyses is to determine the prevalence of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using relevant keywords, data resources including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, ProQuest, Science Direct, Google Scholar and Embase were searched to obtain systematic reviews and meta-analyses reporting the prevalence of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic from the beginning of January to the end of October 2020. The random effects model was used for meta-analysis, and the I2 index was employed to assess heterogeneity among studies. Data was analyzed using STATA 14 software. RESULTS: In the primary search, 103 studies were identified, and ultimately 7 studies were included in the umbrella review. The results showed that the overall prevalence of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic was 24.94% (95% CI: 21.83-28.05, I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.804) and 24.83% (95% CI: 21.41-28.25, I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.897), respectively. CONCLUSION: This umbrella review shows that the prevalence of anxiety and depression is relatively high among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

They presented with chest pain, fever, and flu-like symptoms. Diagnosis was made based on the synopsis of clinical presentation, elevated levels of troponin T and NT-proBNP, impaired systolic function on echocardiography, and findings in non-invasive tissue characterization by cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. Two patients also underwent endomyocardial biopsies. As none of the patients showed signs of cardiogenic shock, they were discharged from ward care only a few days after their initial presentations.

The functions of a large number of viral ORFs are poorly understood or unknown. In order to gain more insight into functions and modes of action and interaction of the different proteins, we cloned the viral ORFeome and performed a genome-wide analysis for intraviral protein interactions and for intracellular localization. 900 pairwise interactions were tested by yeast-two-hybrid matrix analysis, and more than 65 positive non-redundant interactions, including six self interactions, were identified. About 38% of interactions were subsequently confirmed by CoIP in mammalian cells. Nsp2, nsp8 and ORF9b showed a wide range of interactions with other viral proteins. Nsp8 interacts with replicase proteins nsp2, nsp5, nsp6, nsp7, nsp8, nsp9, nsp12, nsp13 and nsp14, indicating a crucial role as a major player within the replication complex machinery. It was shown by others that nsp8 is essential for viral replication in vitro, whereas nsp2 is not. We show that also accessory protein ORF9b does not play a pivotal role for viral replication, as it can be deleted from the virus displaying normal plaque sizes and growth characteristics in Vero cells. However, it can be expected to be important for the virus-host interplay and for pathogenicity, due to its large number of interactions, by enhancing the global stability of the SARS proteome network, or play some unrealized role in regulating protein-protein interactions.

Thus in the early stages of the spread (before travel restrictions), international tourism could be seen as one of the main responsible factors for the recent pandemic, validating the tourism-led vulnerability hypothesis. Accordingly, considering that such health shocks should be more frequent in the near future, this finding suggests that the tourism specialization model in the context of small islands is too vulnerable to be considered as sustainable in the medium and long-run.

This is particularly evident in the case of pig farming as shown by the recent episodes of African swine fever or porcine epidemic diarrhoea. Moreover, a better biosecurity may help to improve productivity and may contribute to reducing the use of antibiotics. Biosecurity can be defined as the application of measures aimed to reduce the probability of the introduction (external biosecurity) and further spread of pathogens within the farm (internal biosecurity). Thus, the key idea is to avoid transmission, either between farms or within the farm. This implies knowledge of the epidemiology of the diseases to be avoided that is not always available, but since ways of transmission of pathogens are limited to a few, it is possible to implement effective actions even with some gaps in our knowledge on a given disease. For the effective design of a biosecurity program, veterinarians must know how diseases are transmitted, the risks and their importance, which mitigation measures are thought to be more effective and how to evaluate the biosecurity and its improvements.

RESULTS: Anxiety (55.8%) was the most common negative emotion reported by participants facing COVID-19-related news and problem-solving was the most frequent strategy used to control negative emotions. Both groups with high and low personal relevance indicated a similar pattern in experiencing high and low arousal emotions, as well as using ER strategies, and no significant differences were found (X(2)=0.006, p=0.51; X(2)=0.14, p=0.39, respectively). We also found that participants with high scores in the resilience scale used an integrative rather than a single approach of the ER strategies (rbp=0.15, p=0.01). CONCLUSION: We found that during the COVID-19 outbreak, news media may have important role in triggering anxiety in people who regularly read the relevant news, and problem-solving was the most frequent strategy among them. Being directly involved with COVID-19 in personal life did not make any differences in the way that individuals emotionally respond to the news. While using an integrative approach in regulating emotion was found in more resilient individuals.","output":"How People Emotionally Respond to the News on COVID-19: An Online Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Marketers have been trying to find the means to innovate and introduce technology as much as they can in their line of work in order to convince consumers to acquire their products or services and due to recent outcomes, it has become harder for certain fields to benefit from conventional marketing strategies and implementations.

The pharmacological burden may be further aggravated by the addition of treatments for COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the risk of potential DDIs upon admission and during hospitalisation in patients with COVID-19 treated at our hospital. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 502 patients with COVID-19 (mean age 61  16 years, range 15C99) treated at our hospital with a proven diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection hospitalised between 21 February and 30 April 2020 and treated with at least two drugs. RESULTS: Overall, 68% of our patients with COVID-19 were exposed to at least one potential DDI, and 55% were exposed to at least one potentially severe DDI. The proportion of patients experiencing potentially severe DDIs increased from 22% upon admission to 80% during hospitalisation. Furosemide, amiodarone and quetiapine were the main drivers of potentially severe DDIs upon admission, and hydroxychloroquine and particularly lopinavir/ritonavir were the main drivers during hospitalisation. The majority of potentially severe DDIs carried an increased risk of cardiotoxicity. No potentially severe DDIs were identified in relation to tocilizumab and remdesivir. CONCLUSIONS: Among hospitalised patients with COVID-19, concomitant treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine led to a dramatic increase in the number of potentially severe DDIs. Given the high risk of cardiotoxicity and the scant and conflicting data concerning their efficacy in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection, the use of lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine in patients with COVID-19 with polypharmacy needs to be carefully considered.","output":"DrugCDrug Interactions and Prescription Appropriateness in Patients with COVID-19: A Retrospective Analysis from a Reference Hospital in Northern Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus is a large family of viruses that infect mammals and birds.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate how COVID-19 pandemic and PPE can affect operative time, operating room time, transfer into the operating room to delivery time and skin incision to delivery time in cesarean section. METHODS This is a single-center retrospective cohort study. Women with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection having a cesarean section after March 7th, 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic were included in the study. For each woman with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, a woman who had a cesarean section for the same indication during the COVID-19 pandemic and with similar clinical history but not affected by SARS-CoV-2 was included. RESULTS 42 cesarean sections were studied. The operating room time was longer in the COVID-19 confirmed or suspected women: 90 (73.0 to 110.0) versus 61 (48.0 to 70.5) minutes; p < .001. The transfer into the operating room to delivery time was longer, but not statistically significant, in urgent cesarean sections in COVID-19 confirmed or suspected women: 25.5 (17.5 to 31.75) versus 18.0 (10.0 to 26.25) minutes; p = .113.

A search of 5 databases found 10 articles adherent to the pre-defined inclusion criteria. The studies assessed 8 strongman exercises and included male participants of relatively similar body mass but varying training backgrounds.

Future strongman biomechanical studies should: assess under/un-researched strongman exercises; include a greater number of experienced and female strongman athletes; utilise more advanced (e.g., 3D motion capture and/or inertial sensor) technology so to provide a broader range and greater quality of data.

Yet, little is known about the physiological costs of cooperation, which may be detrimental to direct fitness. Oxidative stress, the imbalance between reactive oxygen species (by-products of energy production) and antioxidant protection, may represent such a cost when cooperative behaviours are energetically demanding. Oxidative stress can lead to the accumulation of cellular damage, compromising survival and reproduction, thus mediating the trade-off between these competing life-history traits. Here, we experimentally increased energetically demanding cooperative contributions in captive Damaraland mole-rats (Fukomys damarensis). We quantified oxidative stress-related effects of increased cooperation on somatic and germline tissues, and the trade-off between them. Increased cooperative contributions induced oxidative stress in females and males, without increasing somatic damage. Males accumulated oxidative damage in their germline despite an increase in antioxidant defences. Finally, oxidative damage accumulation became biased towards the germline, while antioxidant protection remained biased towards the soma, suggesting that males favour the maintenance of somatic tissues (i.e. survival over reproduction). Our results show that heightened cooperative contributions can ultimately affect direct fitness through oxidative stress costs, which may represent a key selective pressure for the evolution of cooperation.","output":"Oxidative costs of cooperation in cooperatively breeding Damaraland mole-rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The fight against the coronavirus pandemic has led to an insulation of social and economic life and will have considerable economic consequences.

RESULTS While some clinical teachers showed a correct interpretation, rating strategies also appeared to be affected by the target supervision level for completion of the clerkship. Instructions to estimate readiness for a supervision level in the future were not always understood. Further, teachers' interpretation of the scale anchors relied heavily on the phrasing. DISCUSSION Prospective assessment asks clinical teachers to make an extra inference step in their judgement process from reporting observed performance to estimating future level of supervision. This requires a change in mindset when coming from a retrospective, performance-oriented assessment method, i.e., reporting what was observed.

This is because of many reasons which include the atypical presentation in the geriatric population which might have led to diagnostic delay.

Lethality of countries located within the 5th parallels North/South on 6 April and 6 May 2020, was compared with that of all the other countries. Lethality in the European areas of The Netherlands, France and the United Kingdom was also compared to the territories of the same nations in areas with a non-temperate climate. RESULTS A lower lethality rate of COVID-19 was found in Equatorial countries both on April 6 (OR=0.72 CI 95% 0.66-0.80) and on May 6 (OR=0.48, CI 95% 0.47-0.51), with a strengthening over time of the protective effect.

Moreover, combination therapy with statins plus ezetimibe and/or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors facilitates achievement of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) targets in patients with heFH. However, heFH remains underdiagnosed and undertreated worldwide.Areas covered: In this review, we summarize current evidence on the prevalence and control rates of heFH. Accumulating data suggest that heFH is one of the most common hereditary metabolic disorders, affecting approximately 1 in every 300 individuals. However, only a small minority of patients with heFH achieve LDL-C targets, even in high-income countries and in subjects followed-up in specialized lipid clinics.Expert opinion: Given the underdiagnosis of heFH using cascade and opportunistic screening, wider, population-based screening strategies should be evaluated for their feasibility and cost-effectiveness if we aspire to timely diagnosis and therefore prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in this very high risk population. Overcoming inertia in uptitrating statin dose, adding ezetimibe and/or PCSK9 inhibitors along with more generous reimbursement for lipid-lowering agents in patients with heFH are essential for improving goal attainment rates.","output":"Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia: prevalence and control rates."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mechanical thrombectomy with stent retrievers is an effective treatment for patients with ischemic stroke.

Whether genetic risk of incident severe COVID-19 is the same regardless of preexisting COPD is unknown. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential interaction between genetic risk and COPD in relation to severe COVID-19. METHODS: We constructed a polygenic risk score for severe COVID-19 by using 112 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 430,582 participants from the UK Biobank study. We examined the associations of genetic risk and COPD with severe COVID-19 by using logistic regression models. RESULTS: Of 430,582 participants, 712 developed severe COVID-19 as of February 22, 2021, of whom 19.8% had preexisting COPD. Compared with participants at low genetic risk, those at intermediate genetic risk (odds ratio [OR], 1.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09C1.66) and high genetic risk (OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.18C1.92) had higher risk of severe COVID-19 (P for trend = 0.001), and the association was independent of COPD (P for interaction = 0.76). COPD was associated with a higher risk of incident severe COVID-19 (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.12C1.67; P = 0.002). Participants at high genetic risk and with COPD had a higher risk of severe COVID-19 (OR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.35C3.04; P < 0.001) than those at low genetic risk and without COPD. CONCLUSIONS: The polygenic risk score, which combines multiple risk alleles, can be effectively used in screening for high-risk populations of severe COVID-19.

There is evidence that socio-economic position influences oral health behaviours, but little is known about this association during adolescence. This study aims to investigate the association between social disadvantage (individual- and area-level) and oral health behaviours among Australian adolescents. METHODS This study utilised data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC). The sample consisted of 2877 adolescents. Exposure measures were area-level social disadvantage (Socioeconomic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA)), and parent-reported household income from Wave 5. Outcomes, measured in Wave 6, wereadolescent-reported oral health behaviours: frequency of brushing, consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) and dental visits. Associations between quintiles of each exposure and each oral health behaviour were tested by fitting multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS Household income and area-level disadvantage were associated with dental visits and brushing frequency. Associations between social disadvantage and consumption of SSBs was less apparent, with only the leastdisadvantaged adolescentshaving lower odds of consumption of SSBs compared to the mostdisadvantaged group. CONCLUSION Broad population-based strategies must be adopted to reduce intake of SSBs, however targeted strategies are needed among more disadvantaged populations to address infrequent tooth brushing and irregular dental visits among adolescents.","output":"Associations between Individual-level and Area-level social disadvantage and oral health behaviours in Australian adolescents."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on access to health care resources. Our objective was to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of childhood cancer in Canada. We also aimed to compare the proportion of patients who enrolled in clinical trials at diagnosis, presented with metastatic disease or had an early death during the first 9 months of the COVID-19 pandemic compared with previous years. METHODS: We conducted an observational study that included children younger than 15 years with a new diagnosis of cancer between March 2016 and November 2020 at 1 of 17 Canadian pediatric oncology centres. Our primary outcome was the monthly age-standardized incidence rates (ASIRs) of cancers. We evaluated level and trend changes using interventional autoregressive integrated moving average models. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of patients who were enrolled in a clinical trial, who had metastatic or advanced disease and who died within 30 days. We compared the baseline and pandemic periods using rate ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Age-standardized incidence rates during COVID-19 quarters were 157.7, 164.6, and 148.0 per million, respectively, whereas quarterly baseline ASIRs ranged between 150.3 and 175.1 per million (incidence RR 0.93 [95% CI 0.78 to 1.12] to incidence RR 1.04 [95% CI 0.87 to 1.24]). We found no statistically significant level or slope changes between the projected and observed ASIRs for all new cancers (parameter estimate [], level 4.98, 95% CI ?15.1 to 25.04, p = 0.25), or when stratified by cancer type or by geographic area. Clinical trial enrolment rate was stable or increased during the pandemic compared with baseline (RR 1.22 [95% CI 0.70 to 2.13] to RR 1.71 [95% CI 1.01 to 2.89]). There was no difference in the proportion of patients with metastatic disease (RR 0.84 [95% CI 0.55 to 1.29] to RR 1.22 [0.84 to 1.79]), or who died within 30 days (RR 0.16 [95% CI 0.01 to 3.04] to RR 1.73 [95% CI 0.38 to 15.2]). INTERPRETATION: We did not observe a statistically significant change in the incidence of childhood cancer, or in the proportion of children enrolling in a clinical trial, presenting with metastatic disease or who died early during the first 9 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, which suggests that access to health care in pediatric oncology was not reduced substantially in Canada.","output":"Incidence of childhood cancer in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new coronavirus infection has posed a major public health challenge around the world, but new data on the disease raises more questions than answers The lack of optimal therapy is a significant problem The article examines the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the pathogenesis of COVID-19, special attention is paid to features of pathological processes and immune responses in children COVID-19 leads to a wide diversity of negative outcomes, many of which can persist for at least months Many of the consequences have yet to be identified SARS-CoV-2 may provoke autoimmune reactions Reinfection, herd immunity, vaccines and other prevention measures are also discussed in this review","output":"Addressing the issue of OVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 virus and the disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Depuis son mergence en dcembre 2019 jusqu la fin de la quatrime vague pandmique en octobre 2021, la circulation du SARS-CoV-2 a t associe  des volutions molculaires significatives du virus.

Clinicians tend to associate prolonged fever with COVID-19-related diseases in patients with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we present a patient who was admitted with a clinical suspicion of multi-inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and was finally diagnosed with a renal abscess. CASE REPORT: A 16-year-old girl with prolonged fever, bilateral non-purulent conjunctivitis, weight loss, muscle pain, general malaise, cough, and yellow sputum was admitted to Heim Pl National Pediatric Institute, Budapest, Hungary. She had proven SARS-CoV-2 infection 3 weeks prior to admission. Although inflammatory markers were elevated, repeated urine analyses, aerobic and anaerobic urine cultures, hemoculture, chest X-ray, and otorhinolaryngology examinations were negative. Based on clinical and laboratory criteria, the diagnosis of MIS-C was eventually ruled out. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a 172015 mm simplex cyst at the edge of the parenchyma in the upper third of the left kidney. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed, showing a multi-compartment, septated, thick-walled parenchymal lesion of 504052 mm in the upper pole of the right kidney, which showed signal characteristics of an abscess, and 2016 mm and 8 mm lesions in the upper pole of the left kidney, which appeared to be cysts. After being unresponsive to intravenous wide-spectrum antibiotic therapy (meropenem 2 g tid for 5 days), surgical intervention was needed to remove the abscess.

The aim of this study is to understand which investigations are useful in a screening protocol aimed at protecting health but also avoiding inappropriate examinations. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study of a professional soccer team that is based on an extensive screening protocol for resuming training during the COVID-19 pandemic. It included personal history, antigen swabs, blood tests, spirometry, resting/stress-test ECG with oxygen saturation monitoring, echocardiogram, Holter and chest CT. We also compared the findings with prior data from the same subjects before infection and with data from SARS-CoV-2-negative players. RESULTS: None of the players had positive swab and/or anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM class antibodies. Out of 30 players, 18 (60%) had IgG class antibodies. None had suffered severe SARS-CoV-2-related disease, 12 (66.7%) had complained of mild COVID-19-related symptoms and 6 (33.3%) were asymptomatic. None of the players we examined revealed significant cardiovascular abnormalities after clinical recovery. A mild reduction in spirometry parameters versus pre-COVID-19 values was observed in all athletes, but it was statistically significant (p<0.05) only in SARS-CoV-2-positive athletes. One SARS-CoV-2-positive player showed increased troponin I level, but extensive investigation did not show signs of myocardial damage. CONCLUSION: In this small cohort of athletes with previous asymptomatic/mild SARS-CoV-2 infection, a comprehensive screening protocol including blood tests, spirometry, resting ECG, stress-test ECG with oxygen saturation monitoring and echocardiogram did not identify relevant anomalies.

METHODS this observational study used testing, vaccination and mortality data for LTCF residents aged  65 years who were regularly tested regardless of symptoms from 8 December 2020 to 30 September 2021 in England. Adjusted VE, calculated as one minus adjusted hazard ratio, was estimated using time-varying Cox proportional hazards models for infection and death within 28 days of positive test result. Vaccine status was defined by receipt of one or two doses of vaccine and assessed over a range of intervals. RESULTS of 197,885 LTCF residents, 47,087 (23.8%) had a positive test and 11,329 (5.8%) died within 28 days of a positive test during the study period. Relative to unvaccinated individuals, VE for infection was highest for ChAdOx-1 at 61% (40-74%) at 1-4 weeks and for BNT162b2 at 69% (52-80%) at 11-15 weeks following the second dose.

If a certain integrin is found on tumor cells but not on normal ones, radioactive molecules (named tracers) that specifically bind to this integrin will accumulate in the cancer lesion if injected into the blood stream. The emitted radiation can be detected from outside the body and allows for localization and thus, diagnosis, of cancer. Only one of the 24 integrins, the subtype v3, has hitherto been thoroughly investigated in this context. We herein summarize the most recent, pertinent research on other integrins, and argue that some of these approaches might ultimately improve the clinical management of the most lethal cancers, such as pancreatic carcinoma. ABSTRACT: For almost the entire period of the last two decades, translational research in the area of integrin-targeting radiopharmaceuticals was strongly focused on the subtype v3, owing to its expression on endothelial cells and its well-established role as a biomarker for, and promoter of, angiogenesis. Despite a large number of translated tracers and clinical studies, a clinical value of v3-integrin imaging could not be defined yet. The focus of research has, thus, been moving slowly but steadily towards other integrin subtypes which are involved in a large variety of tumorigenic pathways. Peptidic and non-peptidic radioligands for the integrins 51, v6, v8, 61, 64, 31, 41, and M2 were first synthesized and characterized preclinically. Some of these compounds, targeting the subtypes v6, v8, and 61/4, were subsequently translated into humans during the last few years. v6-Integrin has arguably attracted most attention because it is expressed by some of the cancers with the worst prognosis (above all, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma), which substantiates a clinical need for the respective theranostic agents. The receptor furthermore represents a biomarker for malignancy and invasiveness of carcinomas, as well as for fibrotic diseases, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and probably even for Sars-CoV-2 (COVID-19) related syndromes. Accordingly, the largest number of recent first-in-human applications has been reported for radiolabeled compounds targeting v6-integrin. The results indicate a substantial clinical value, which might lead to a paradigm change and trigger the replacement of v3 by v6 as the most popular integrin in theranostics.","output":"Its Time to Shift the Paradigm: Translation and Clinical Application of Non-v3 Integrin Targeting Radiopharmaceuticals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has now emerged as a global health problem and is responsible for high mortality and morbidity The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)) emerged as a promising drug target because of its essential role in the processing of polyproteins, which is translated from viral RNA The present study reports a designed novel hybrid antiviral molecule (VTRRT-13 V2 1) against SARS-CoV2 main protease A series of different combinations of hybrid antiviral were generated from nonspecific antiviral molecules currently used to control COVID-19 To enhance the specificity of the designed hybrid antiviral molecule, the core pocket region of the active site of M(pro) protein was targeted In-silico screening, molecular mechanics, molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) analysis identified a hybrid VTRRT-13 V2 molecule Retrosynthetic analysis and combinatorial synthesis generated 1000 analogs of VTRRT-13 V2 molecules Docking, molecular mechanics, and MDS analysis selected VTRRT-13 V2 1 as a possible inhibitor for SARS-CoV2 main protease Comparative analysis of all the results showed that VTRRT-13 V2 1 have the highest docking Glide score (-12 28 kcal/mol) and best binding energy (-52 23 kcal/mol) as compared to the other hybrid constructs such as VTRRT-13 V2 (-9 47 and -47 36 kcal/mol), VTRRT-13 (-8 9 and -47 55 kcal/mol), and current antiviral investigated The mutational sensitivity screening showed that binding residues of M(pro) are not present in mutation hotspots It was also observed that VTRRT-13 V2 1 does not have any human off-targets SARS-CoV2 main protease is essential for the survival of this virus;hence, a designed novel hybrid antiviral molecule (VTRRT-13 V2 1) might be useful to control the infection of COVID-19 infection","output":"Novel hybrid antiviral VTRRT-13V2.1 against SARS-CoV2 main protease: retro-combinatorial synthesis and molecular dynamics analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective To assess the association of depression and anxiety with clinical outcomes and laboratory markers among hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods A prospective cohort study in Wuhan, China was conducted in 205 adult hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of moderate coronavirus disease from admission through discharge or death. Anxiety and depression were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The primary outcome was the incidence of severe or critical COVID-19, and the secondary outcomes were increased length of hospital stay and altered laboratory markers during follow up. Results Among the 205 hospitalized patients (mean age 58 years; 51.7% male), 25 (12.2%) developed severe or critical COVID-19. According to the HADS scores, 51 (24.9%) and 92 (44.9%) of participants presented with clinically significant anxiety and depression, respectively. Using multi-variable adjusted Cox regression analysis, the adjusted hazard ratio of developing severe or critical COVID-19 associated with anxiety and depression was 1.55 (95% CI: 0.63, 3.80) and 4.28 (95% CI: 1.20, 15.30), respectively. The risk of developing severe or critical COVID-19 with both anxiety and depression was more than four times higher than in patients without anxiety or depression (HR, 4.05; 95% CI: 1.02, 16.00). In addition, both the trends of depression and anxiety were positively associated with a prolonged duration of hospitalization, and immune response was significantly decreased in patients with depression than those without. Conclusions In patients having coronavirus disease, depression was associated with worse clinical outcomes.

Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended face mask use by the general public, there is a lack of evidence on the effect of face mask policies on the spread of COVID-19 at the state level. OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of the Executive Order on face mask use on COVID-19 cases and mortality in NY. DESIGN: A comparative interrupted time series analysis was used to assess the impact of the Executive Order in NY with Massachusetts (MA) as a comparison state. PARTICIPANTS: We analyzed data on COVID-19 in NY and MA from March 25 to May 6, 2020. INTERVENTION: The Executive Order on face mask use in NY. MAIN MEASURES: Daily numbers of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths. KEY RESULTS: The average daily number of confirmed cases in NY decreased from 8549 to 5085 after the Executive Order took effect, with a trend change of 341 (95% CI, 187-496) cases per day. The average daily number of deaths decreased from 521 to 384 during the same two time periods, with a trend change of 52 (95% CI, 44-60) deaths per day.

Methods: Our analysis was supported by host genetics, viral whole genome sequencing, phylogenomic viral population analysis, and refined epidemiological data obtained from interviews with the involved subjects. Results: The reinfection involved a 53-year-old woman with asthma (Case A), with a first COVID-19 episode in April-2020 and a much more severe second episode four months and a half later, with COVID-19 seroconversion in August, and requiring hospital admission. An extended genomic analysis allowed us to demonstrate that the strain involved in Case As reinfection was circulating in the epidemiological context of Case A and was also transmitted subsequently from Case A to her family context. The reinfection was also supported by a phylogenetic analysis, including 348 strains from Madrid, which revealed that the strain involved in the reinfection was circulating by the time Case A suffered the second episode, August/September-2020, but absent at the time range corresponding to Case As first episode.

Adipose tissue is generally linked to excessive body fat, and it is well known that the female breast is rich in adipose tissue.

Adipose tissue as an organ consists of adipocytes, an extracellular matrix (ECM) and immune cells, with a significant role in the dynamics of breast changes throughout the life span of a female breast from puberty, pregnancy, lactation and involution. In this review, we will discuss the importance of breast adipose tissue in breast development and its involvement in breast changes happening during pregnancy, lactation and involution. We will focus on understanding the biology of breast adipose tissue, with an overview on its involvement in the various steps of breast cancer development and progression. The interaction between the breast adipose tissue surrounding cancer cells and vice-versa modifies the tumor microenvironment in favor of cancer. Understanding this mutual interaction and the role of breast adipose tissue in the tumor microenvironment could potentially raise the possibility of overcoming breast adipose tissue mediated resistance to therapies and finding novel candidates to target breast cancer.","output":"The Importance of Breast Adipose Tissue in Breast Cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 lockdown restrictions in conjunction with the pervasive hospital fear endured by the vast majority of the population played a fundamental role in discouraging access to emergency departments (EDs). We aimed at investigating whether and how the COVID-19 outbreak limited access to ED and affected urgent surgical activities during and immediately after the 2-month pandemic-related national lockdown. METHODS: Data regarding patients who accessed to the surgical ED were retrospectively collected. Analysed time-periods included: 'Pre-COVID-19 Era', 'COVID-19 Era' considered as the period of full national lockdown and 'Post-COVID-19 Era' after easing of lockdown measures. Consecutive emergency surgical procedures and ED admissions before, during and after COVID-19-lockdown were retrieved and analysed. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in overall ED admissions and in all-specialty surgical consultations (P<0.01) throughout the outbreak. Once national lockdown was eased, we recorded a subsequent rebound 5-fold rise of emergency surgical procedures compared to COVID-19 group (P=0.011). Time-to-surgery was significantly greater in 'COVID-19 era' and 'post-COVID-19 era' compared to 'pre-COVID-19' group (22.564.78, 75.9915.89 and 16.73 1.76 hours, respectively) (P<0.01). A raised incidence of postoperative complications emerged in the 'COVID-19 era' group (37.5%) compared to pre and post-COVID groups (9.1% and 12.5%, respectively; P<0.001). Mortality rate in the 'COVID-19 era' was 31.3% and 7.5% in 'post-COVID-19' group (<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the major reduction of emergency surgical procedures and overall ED admissions caused by COVID-19 pandemic. The raised rate of postoperative complications and mortality might be likely due to the superior severity of surgical conditions observed in the 'COVID-19 era' subjects together with a probable deferred pursuit of medical attention.","output":"Repercussions of covid-19-related national lockdown on emergency surgery department: a longitudinal cohort monocentric study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a modified age-structured SIR model based on known patterns of social contact and distancing measures within Washington, USA.

Single doses of 6 mg dexamethasone phosphate (DEX-P), betamethasone phosphate (BET-P), or 1:1 mixture of betamethasone phosphate and acetate (BET-PA) were administered orally (PO) or intramuscularly (IM) where each woman enrolled in a two-period cross-over study. Plasma concentrations collected over 96 h were described with a two-compartment model with differing PO and IM first-order absorption inputs. Overall, BET exhibited slower clearance, similar volume of distribution, faster absorption, and longer persistence than DEX with BET acetate producing extremely slow absorption but full bioavailability of BET. Six biomarkers were assessed over a 24-h baseline period with four showing circadian rhythms with complex baselines. These baselines and the strong responses seen after drug dosing were fitted with various indirect response models using the Laplace estimation methods in NONMEM 7.4. Both the PK and six biomarker responses were well-described with modest variability likely due to the homogeneous ages, weights, and ethnicities of the women. The drugs either inhibited or stimulated the influx processes with some models requiring joint inclusion of drug effects on circadian cortisol suppression. The biomarkers and order of sensitivity (lowest IC(50)/SC(50) to highest) were: cortisol, T-helper cells, basophils, glucose, neutrophils, and T-cytotoxic cells. DEX sensitivities were generally greater than BET with corresponding mean ratios for these biomarkers of 2.86, 1.27, 1.72, 1.27, 2.69, and 1.06. Overall, the longer PK (e.g. half-life) of BET, but lesser PD activity (e.g. higher IC(50)), produces single-dose response profiles that appear quite similar, except for the extended effects from BET-PA. This comprehensive population modeling effort provides the first detailed comparison of the PK profiles and six biomarker responses of five commonly used dosage forms of DEX and BET in healthy women.

As of April 10, 2020, half of Canadas COVID-19 deaths had occurred in LTC facilities. OBJECTIVE: To better understand trends and risk factors associated with COVID-19 death in LTC facilities in Ontario, Canada. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study of 627 LTC facilities included 269 total individuals who died of COVID-19 in Ontario to April 11, 2020, and 83 individuals who died of COVID-19 in Ontario LTC facilities to April 7, 2020. Because population denominators were not available for LTC residents, they were approximated as the total number of LTC facility beds in Ontario (79 498), assuming complete occupancy. EXPOSURES: Confirmed or suspected COVID-19 outbreaks; confirmed COVID-19 infection among residents and staff, diagnosed by real-time polymerase chain reaction testing. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: COVID-19Cspecific mortality incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for LTC residents were calculated with community-living Ontarians older than 69 years as the comparator group. Count-based regression methods were used to model temporal trends and to identify associations of infection risk among staff and residents with subsequent LTC resident death. Model-derived IRRs for COVID-19Cspecific mortality were generated through bootstrap resampling (1000 replicates) to generate median and 95% credible intervals for IRR over time. RESULTS: Of 627 LTC facilities, 272 (43.4%) reported COVID-19 infection in residents or staff. Of 1 731 315 total individuals older than 69 years living in Ontario during the study period, 229 (<0.1%) died; of 79 498 potential residents in LTC facilities, 83 (0.1%) died. The IRR for COVID-19Crelated death in LTC residents was 13.1 (95% CI, 9.9-17.3) compared with community-living adults older than 69 years. The IRR increased sharply over time and was 87.3 (95% credible interval, 6.4-769.8) by April 11, 2020. Infection among LTC staff was associated with death among residents with a 6-day lag (eg, adjusted IRR for death per infected staff member, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.11-1.26). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of COVID-19Crelated deaths during the pandemic in Ontario, Canada, mortality risk was concentrated in LTC residents and increased during a short period. Early identification of risk requires a focus on testing, providing personal protective equipment to staff, and restructuring the LTC workforce to prevent the movement of COVID-19 between facilities.","output":"Risk Factors Associated With Mortality Among Residents With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Long-term Care Facilities in Ontario, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cell culture studies suggest targeting nsp6 could help treat coronavirus infection.","output":"Coronavirus NSP6 protein (nsp6)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Hyperventilation (HV) is one of the main and basic activation methods during ambulatory electroencephalogram (EEG), unless medical reasons contraindicate it. During the COVID-19 pandemic, with the high risk of human-to-human infection, local guidelines and recommendations have been developed that suggest not to perform the HV maneuver routinely. Our objective was to characterize patients who present positive HV in an epilepsy center. METHODS: We analyzed retrospectively all the ambulatory EEGs performed during one year in our specialized ambulatory child and adolescent epilepsy center, and describe patients with positive maneuver. RESULTS: A total of 305 EEGs were performed. Patients under 3 years and 11 months were excluded as well as all patients that did not fill up the criteria for epilepsy diagnosis. From the 252 EEGs that were included in the study, 194 EEGs (77%) were classified as abnormal and 58 (23%) as normal. From these same 252 EEGs, 150 EEG finished correctly the HV maneuver. Physiological slowing response was found in 54 EEGs (36%), no changes (negative) in 83 (55%), and abnormal response (positive) in 13 EEGs (9%). The 13 HV-positive EEGs showed 4 patients with an increase of epileptiform activity, 3 patients experienced an increase of basal preregistered abnormal slowing, and 6 EEGs showed trigger of bilaterally synchronous and symmetric 2-4 Hz spike-and-slow wave discharges and absences. None of these last 6 patients needed more than 3 minutes to elicit the paroxysmal discharge. SIGNIFICANCE: Based on these findings and according with other studies, the low positivity and high specificity of the HV maneuver support the idea that HV could be excluded during the COVID-19 pandemic situation, and also reevaluate whether it could be changed to a complementary maneuver, restricted only for cases where absence epilepsy is suspected.

OBJECTIVE: The PREVAIL (Pediatric Respiratory and Enteric Virus Acquisition and Immunogenesis Longitudinal) Cohort study was undertaken to define the natural history of infection and immune response to major pathogens causing AGE and ARI in US children. METHODS: Mothers in Cincinnati, Ohio, were enrolled in their third trimester of pregnancy, with intensive child follow-up to 2 years. Blood samples were obtained from children at birth (cord), 6 weeks, and 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Whole stool specimens and midturbinate nasal swabs were collected weekly and tested by multipathogen molecular assays. Saliva, meconium, maternal blood, and milk samples were also collected. AGE (3 loose or watery stools or 1 vomiting episode within 24 hours) and ARI (cough or fever) cases were documented by weekly cell phone surveys to mothers via automated SMS text messaging and review of medical records. Immunization records were obtained from registries and providers. follow-up ended in October 2020. Pathogen-specific infections are defined by a PCR-positive sample or rise in serum antibody. RESULTS: Of the 245 enrolled motherCchild pairs, 51.8% (n=127) were White, 43.3% (n=106) Black, 55.9% (n=137) publicly insured, and 86.5% (n=212) initiated breastfeeding.

Patients aged 21 to 65 years old and the mean age was 42.38  11.507, the male-to-female sex ratio was 1.40:1. All confirmed cases had a direct or indirect exposure history in the Beijing Xinfadi Market (BXM), and the clinical manifestations of 97% confirmed cases was diagnosed as mild or moderate. Different clinical classification in age (P = .041), exposure history (P = .025), fever (P = .020), and cough (P = .000) were the statistically significant difference, but there was no statistically significant difference in gender (P = .501), the type of diagnosis (P = .478), expectoration (P = .979), fatigue (P = .906), dizziness or headache (P = .848), muscle pain (P = .825), sore throat or throat discomfort (P = .852), chills (P = .933), diarrhea (P = .431) and runny nose or nasal congestion (P = .898). This study shows that Beijing's epidemic scope was mainly concentrated in the Xinfadi Market. The initial cases were epidemiologically related to the BXM, the clinical classification of most cases was mild and moderate, and the differences in age, exposure history, fever, and cough among different clinical cases were statistically significant.","output":"The re-emergence from the COVID-19 epidemic of Beijing Xinfadi Market"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present ir-measures, a new tool that makes it convenient to calculate a diverse set of evaluation measures used in information retrieval.

There is an intense discussion and uncertainty which factors and sanctions can reduce infection rates. The overall aim is to prevent an overload of the medical system. Even within one country, there is frequently a strong local variability in both -- political sanctions as well as other local factors -- which may influence infection rates. The main focus of study is analysis and interpretation of recent temporal developments (infection rates). We present a statistical framework designed to identify local factors which reduce infection rates. The approach is robust with respect to the number of undetected infection cases. We apply the framework to spatio-temporal infection data from Germany. In particular, we demonstrate that (1) infection rates are in average significantly decreasing in Germany; (2) there is a high spatial variability of these rates, and (3) both, early emergence of first infections and high local infection densities has led to strong recent decays in infection rates, suggesting that psychological effects (such as awareness of danger) lead to behaviour changes that reduce infection rates. However, the full potential of the presented method cannot yet be exploited, since more precise spatio-temporal data, such as local cell phone-based mobility data, are not yet available.

Study Design and Methods: We conducted a systematic review to characterize the lung histopathologic features of COVID-19 and compare them against findings of other recent viral pandemics, H1N1 influenza and SARS. We systematically searched MEDLINE and PubMed for studies published up to June 24, 2020 using search terms for COVID-19, H1N1 influenza and SARS with keywords for pathology, biopsy, and autopsy. Using PRISMA-IPD guidelines, our systematic review analysis included 26 articles representing 171 COVID-19 patients; 20 articles representing 287 H1N1 patients; and eight articles representing 64 SARS patients. Results In COVID-19, acute phase diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) was reported in 88% of patients, which was similar to the proportion of cases with DAD in both H1N1 (90%) and SARS (98%). Pulmonary microthrombi were reported in 57% of COVID-19 and 58% of SARS patients, as compared to 24% of H1N1 influenza patients.

We hypothesized that BRCA1 expression pattern could be used as a prognostic biomarker. METHODS Sixty-seven patients who underwent resections for PDAC were included. A tissue microarray was constructed, stained with antibodies to BRCA1, and scored for intensity and subcellular location. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed. RESULTS An increase in cytosolic BRCA1 distribution was associated with higher pathologic stage (P = 0.006). Nuclear-cytosolic BRCA1 distribution was associated with a decrease in recurrence-free survival with a hazards ratio of 1.4 (P = 0.059). Decreased BRCA1 intensity was associated with higher pathologic stage (P = 0.027), but BRCA1 intensity was not associated with overall survival or recurrence-free survival.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of our staged reopening protocol and the incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among elective arthroplasty patients. METHODS: We identified all elective hip and knee arthroplasty patients who underwent our universal COVID-19 testing protocol during our phased reopening between May 1, 2020, and July 21, 2020, at our institution. We recorded the SARS-CoV-2 test results of each patient along with their demographics, medical comorbidities, and symptoms at the time of testing. We followed each of these positive patients through their rescheduled cases and recorded any complications or potential SARS-CoV-2 healthcare exposures. RESULTS: Of the 2,329 patients, we identified five patients (0.21%) with a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction--confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive test, none with symptoms. All patients were successfully rescheduled and underwent their elective arthroplasty procedure within 6 weeks of their original surgery date. None of these patients experienced a perioperative complication at the time of their rescheduled arthroplasty procedure. No orthopaedic surgeon or staff member caring for these patients reported a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. CONCLUSION: Our phased reopening protocol with universal preoperative virus testing was safe and identified a low incidence of SARS-CoV-2 among asymptomatic, elective arthroplasty patients at our institution.

In this animal study, the authors aimed to elucidate the role of collateral supply with regard to the hemodynamic changes and neointimal modifications that occur from jailing arteries with FDSs. To serve this purpose, the authors sought to quantify 1) the hemodynamic changes that occur at the jailed arterial branches immediately after stent placement and 2) the ostia surface values at 3 months after stenting; both parameters were investigated in the presence or absence of collateral arterial flow. METHODS After an a priori power analysis, 2 groups (Group A and Group B) were created according to an animal flow model for terminal and anastomotic arterial circulation; each group contained 7 Large White swine. Group A animals possessed an anastomotic-type arterial configuration to supply the territory of the right ascending pharyngeal artery (APhA), while Group B animals possessed a terminal-type arterial configuration to supply the right APhA territory. Subsequently, all animals underwent FDS placement, thereby jailing the right APhAs. Mean flow rates and velocities inside the jailed branches were quantified using time-resolved 3D phase-contrast MR angiography before and after stenting. Three months after stent placement, the jailed ostia surface values were quantified on scanning electron micrographs. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and group comparisons with parametric and nonparametric tests. RESULTS The endovascular procedures were feasible, and there were no findings of in situ thrombus formation on postprocedural optical coherence tomography or ischemia on postprocedural diffusion-weighted imaging. In Group A, the mean flow rate values at the jailed right APhAs were reduced immediately following stent placement as compared with values obtained before stent placement (p = 0.02, power: 0.8). In contrast, the mean poststenting flow rates for Group B remained similar to those obtained before stent placement. Three months after stent placement, the mean ostia surface values were significantly higher for Group B (527,911  306,229 m2) than for Group A (89,329  59,762 m2; p < 0.01, power: 1.00), even though the initial dimensions of the jailed ostia were similar between groups. A statistically significant correlation was found between groups (A or B), mean flow rates after stent placement, and ostia surface values at 3 months. CONCLUSIONS When an important collateral supply was present, the jailing of side arteries with flow diverters resulted in an immediate and significant reduction in the flow rate inside these arteries as compared with the prestenting values. In contrast, when competitive flow was absent, jailing did not result in significant flow rate reductions inside the jailed arteries. Ostium surface values at 3 months after stent placement were significantly higher in the terminal group of jailed arteries (Group B) than in the anastomotic group (Group A) and strongly correlated with poststenting reductions in the velocity value.","output":"Role of terminal and anastomotic circulation in the patency of arteries jailed by flow-diverting stents: from hemodynamic changes to ostia surface modifications."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multiple epicenters of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have emerged since the first pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, such as Italy, USA, and Brazil.

At the same time, with the recovery of social production activities, China has become the only country which achieves positive growth in 2020 in the major economies. It entered the post pandemic period. These measures improved the local environmental quality. However, whether this improvement can be sustained is also a problem that needs to be solved. So, this study investigated the changes of five air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, and CO) in the nine cities most severely affected by the pandemic in China during the lockdown and post pandemic period. We emphasized that when analyzing the changes of environmental quality during the epidemic, we must consider not only the impact of the day and short-term changesbut also the cumulative lag effect and sustainable development. Through a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, it is found that the concentration of pollutants decreased significantly during the lockdown compared to the situation before the epidemic. PM10 and NO2 are falling most, which downs 39% and 46% respectively. During the lockdown period, the pollutant concentrations response to the pandemic has a lag of 3-7 days. More specifically, in the cities related to single pollutants, the impact on the pollutant shows a significant correlation when the measures are delayed for seven days. In the cities that are related to multiple pollutants, the correlation is usually highest in 3-5 days. This means that the impact of policy measures on the environment lasted for 3-5 days. Besides, Wuhan, Jingmen and Jingzhou have seen the most obvious improvement. However, this improvement did not last. In the post pandemic period, the pollutants rebounded, the growth rates of PM10 and NO2 reached 44% and 87% in September. When compared with the changes of pollutants concentration in the same period from 2017 to 2019, the decline rate has also been significantly slower, even higher than the average concentration of previous years.

METHODS: Telemedicine guidelines established by our hospital system were used as inclusion criteria for this prospective study, which included patients indicated for surgery in the outpatient clinic during a 3-month period. Patients were excluded if they had wounds closed with nonabsorbable suture, remained admitted to the hospital, or required a custom orthosis at their first postoperative visit. Baseline demographics and patient-reported outcome measures were collected prior to surgery. Information pertaining to technology usage was collected for the telemedicine visit and travel information was obtained for the in-clinic visit. Patient satisfaction was recorded for both visits. RESULTS: Fifty-seven of 87 patients (66%) who met the inclusion criteria elected to participate in the study. A cell phone was utilized by 89% of patients and 88% of visits were performed from the patients home. There were 4 technological complications during the study period (7%). Mean round-trip travel distance for the in-clinic visit was 60 miles with an average drive time of 85 minutes. Visit times were significantly shorter with telemedicine (7 minutes vs 38 minutes). Telemedicine was preferred by 90% of patients for subsequent encounters. All 4 clinical complications were recognized during the telemedicine visit. CONCLUSIONS: A telemedicine program for postoperative care after hand and upper extremity surgery decreases travel burdens associated with conventional in-clinic appointments. Telemedicine significantly decreases visit times without decreasing patient satisfaction for patients who elect to participate in remote video visits. The ability to recognize early postsurgical complications was not compromised by utilizing this technology, even during our early experience.

We investigated the impact of a new assessment form on airway prediction and management by anaesthesia residents. We hypothesized that residents would demonstrate improvement in evaluation of DAs over the study duration. METHODS After IRB approval, anaesthesia residents were randomized into two groups: control (existing form) and experimental (new form). Data were collected prospectively from August 2008 to May 2010 on all non-obstetric adult patients undergoing non-emergent surgery. RESULTS Eight thousand three hundred and sixty-four independent preoperative assessments were collected and 8075 were analysed. The experimental group had the higher completion rate than the control group (94.3% vs 84.3%, P=0.001). DA prediction was higher for the control group (71.2%) compared with the experimental group (69.1%; P=0.032). A significant improvement in prediction rates was found over time for the experimental group (likelihood estimate=0.00068, P=0.031).

The consumption of isoflavonoids is increasing in the general population, especially due to the use of food supplements and a variety of isoflavonoid-rich foods. However, detailed studies on the vascular influence of individual pure isoflavonoids are mostly missing. For this study, 16 isoflavonoids were initially screened for their vasorelaxant properties on rat aortas. The 2 most potent of them, biochanin A and glycitein, were further tested for the mechanism of action on porcine coronary arteries. They both induced an endothelium independent vascular relaxation, with EC50 below 6 and 17 M, respectively. Biochanin A, but not glycitein, was able to block the vasoconstriction caused by KCl, CaCl2, serotonin, and U46619 in a dose-dependent manner. Another series of experiments suggested that the major mechanism of action of biochanin A was the inhibition of L-type calcium channels. Moreover, biochanin A in relatively small concentrations (2 - 4 M) interfered with the cGMP, but not cAMP, pathway in isolated coronary arteries. These results indicate that some isoflavonoids, in particular biochanin A, are able to have vasodilatory effects in micromolar concentrations, which is of potential clinical interest for the management of cardiovascular pathologies.","output":"Biochanin A, the Most Potent of 16 Isoflavones, Induces Relaxation of the Coronary Artery Through the Calcium Channel and cGMP-dependent Pathway."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"L\\\\'evy walks (LWs) are spatiotemporally coupled random-walk processes describing superdiffusive heat conduction in solids, propagation of light in disordered optical materials, motion of molecular motors in living cells, or motion of animals, humans, robots, and viruses.

Methodology Two different commercial hybridized pigs, LJH (a crossed pig containing Chinese native pig genotypes) and DLY (Duroc  Landrace  Yorkshire) were selected to analyze FNDC5 mRNA expression and the mRNA composition of four adult myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms (IIIaIIxIIb) in the longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle. C2C12 myoblasts were cultured to investigate the effects of FNDC5 on the four MyHCs mRNA expressive levels, using small interfering RNA for depletion and a eukaryotic expression vector carrying FNDC5 for overexpression. ZLN005 (a small molecule activator of FNDC5's upstream control gene PGC1) or recombinant human irisin protein were also used. Results In LD muscle, LJH pigs had the higher FNDC5 mRNA level, and MyHC I or IIa proportion than DLY pigs (P < 0.05). For C2C12 cells in vitro, small interfering RNA (si-592) silencing of FNDC5 expression markedly reduced MyHC IIa mRNA levels (P < 0.05), while FNDC5 overexpression significantly increased MyHC IIa mRNA levels (P < 0.05).

Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is recommended as an adjuvant therapy for hemodynamics management in patients with sepsis. The aim of this study was to develop an adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) for the Cox regression model to predict the hospital mortality in patients with Sepsis-3.0 undergoing CRRT using Medical Information Martin Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III v1.4. METHODS: Patients who met the Sepsis-3.0 definition were identified using the MIMIC-III v1.4. Among them, patients who received CRRT during ICU hospitalization were included in this study. According to the survival status, patients were split into death or survival group. Adaptive LASSO for the Cox regression model was constructed by STATA software. At last, nomogram and Kaplan-Meier curves were drawn to validate the model. RESULTS: A total of 181 patients who met Sepsis 3.0 criteria received CRRT were included in the study, in which, there were 31 deaths and 150 survivals during hospitalization, respectively. The overall in-hospital mortality was 17.1%. According to the results of multivariate Cox-LASSO regression analysis, use of vasopressor, international normalized ratio (INR) 1.5, and quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA) score were associated with hospital mortality in patients with sepsis who underwent CRRT, but lactate level, mechanical ventilation (MV) support, PaO(2)/FiO(2), platelet count, and indicators of acute kidney injury (AKI), such as blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine, were not independently associated with hospital mortality after adjusted by qSOFA. The risk nomogram and Kaplan-Meier curves verified that the use of vasopressor and INR 1.5 possess significant predictive value. CONCLUSIONS: Using the Cox-LASSO regression model, use of vasopressor, INR 1.5, and qSOFA score are found to be associated with hospital mortality in patients with Sepsis-3.0 who received CRRT.

Over the past decade, the overall incidence of LVFWR has decreased given the advancements in reperfusion therapies. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a significant delay in hospital presentation of patients suffering myocardial infarctions, leading to a higher incidence of mechanical complications from myocardial infarctions such as LVFWR. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case in which a patient suffered a LVFWR as a mechanical complication from myocardial infarction due to delay in seeking care over fear of contracting COVID-19 from the medical setting. The patient had been having chest pain for a few days but refused to seek medical care due to fear of contracting COVID-19 from within the medical setting. He eventually suffered a cardiac arrest at home from a massive inferior myocardial infarction and found to be in cardiac tamponade from a left ventricular perforation. He was emergently taken to the operating room to attempt to repair the rupture but he ultimately expired on the operating table. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of LVFWR has been on a more significant rise over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic as patients delay seeking care over fear of contracting COVID-19 from within the medical setting. Clinicians should consider mechanical complications of MI when patients present as an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, as delay in seeking care is often the exacerbating factor.","output":"Left ventricular free wall rupture as a result of delayed presentation of an inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction due to fear of COVID-19: case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In global health, a discipline with a racist and colonial history, white supremacy, white privilege and racism are still present today.1 Although many believe we are witnessing a resurgence of racism in global health, because of a recent rise of extreme right comments and racism in the community and online2, 3.

Previous experimental studies mainly focussed on evaluating osteomyelitis in the presence of an implant or used a sclerosing agent to promote infection onset. In contrast, we focused on the longitudinal assessment of a nonimplant related osteomyelitis. METHODS An intramedullary tibial infection with S. aureus was established in NZW rabbits. Clinical and haematological infection status was evaluated weekly, combined with X-ray radiographs, biweekly injections of calcium binding fluorophores, and postmortem micro-CT. The development of the infection was assessed by micro-PET at consecutive time points using 18F-FDG as an infection tracer. RESULTS The intramedullary contamination of the rabbit tibia resulted in an osteomyelitis. Haematological parameters confirmed infection in mainly the first postoperative weeks (CRP at the first 5 postoperative weeks, leucocyte differentiation at the second and sixth postoperative weeks, and ESR on the second postoperative week only), while micro-PET was able to detect the infection from the first post-operative week onward until the end of the study. CONCLUSIONS This study shows that osteomyelitis in the rabbit can be induced without use of an implant or sclerosing agent. The sequential follow-up indicates that the diagnostic value of each infection parameter is time point dependant. Furthermore, from all parameters used, the diagnostic value of 18F-FDG micro-PET is the most versatile to assess the presence of an orthopaedic infection in this model.","output":"The longitudinal assessment of osteomyelitis development by molecular imaging in a rabbit model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The role of the CXC chemokine ligand 9 (CXCL9) in host defense following infection with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) was determined.

In the Neurospora VS ribozyme, a kissing-loop interaction between the stemCloop I (SLI) substrate and stemCloop V (SLV) of the catalytic domain is known to play an important role in substrate recognition. In addition, this I/V kissing-loop interaction is associated with a helix shift in SLI that activates the substrate for catalysis. To better understand the role of this kissing-loop interaction in substrate recognition and activation by the VS ribozyme, we performed a thermodynamic characterization by isothermal titration calorimetry using isolated SLI and SLV stemCloops. We demonstrate that preshifted SLI variants have higher affinity for SLV than shiftable SLI variants, with an energetic cost of 1.8C3 kcal/mol for the helix shift in SLI. The affinity of the preshifted SLI for SLV is remarkably high, the interaction being more stable by 7C8 kcal/mol than predicted for a comparable duplex containing three WatsonCCrick base pairs. The structural basis of this remarkable stability is discussed in light of previous NMR studies. Comparative thermodynamic studies reveal that kissing-loop complexes containing 6C7 WatsonCCrick base pairs are as stable as predicted from comparable RNA duplexes; however, those with 2C3 WatsonCCrick base pairs are more stable than predicted. Interestingly, the stability of SLI/ribozyme complexes is similar to that of SLI/SLV complexes. Thus, the I/V kissing loop interaction represents the predominant energetic contribution to substrate recognition by the trans-cleaving VS ribozyme.","output":"A remarkably stable kissing-loop interaction defines substrate recognition by the Neurospora Varkud Satellite ribozyme"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AimsVitamin D deficiency is common among people with Intellectual and Developmental Disability (IDD) and is linked to worse health outcomes.Our aims were to re-evaluate vitamin D testing and supplementation among inpatients with IDD, examine any correlates with physical health conditions including COVID-19 and make recommendations for the current regime of supplementation and testing within inpatient IDD services.MethodThe study population comprised inpatients who were in any of the Northgate Hospital IDD inpatient services in Northumberland, UK.

There were at least 3 drone types were available commercially to lift 10 kg load and several drones with payload capacity below 10 kg.

Results: : Seven patients infected with COVID-19 were identified from 265 liver transplantation recipients. The majority of patients were male and had COVID-19 despite being in-home quarantine. All patients received immunosuppressive drugs during infection with COVID-19 with no change in the routine immunosuppressive therapy. Among the identified patients, 5 recovered and 2 died. One of the dead patients, in addition to having a liver transplant, suffered brain cancer with metastasis to the lungs. Conclusion: It seems that the in liver transplants infected with COVID-19, the immunosuppressive drugs causes mild to moderate illness, and even recover from the disease.However, more evidence is needed to prove this hypothesis.

It was temporarily named as 2019-nCoV then subsequently named as COVID-19 virus. A coronavirus is a group of viruses, known to be zoonotic, causing illness ranging from acute to mild respiratory infections. These are spherical or pleomorphic enveloped particles containing positive sense RNA. The virus enters host cells, its uncoated genetic material transcribes, and translates. Since it has started spreading rapidly, protective measures have been taken all over the world. However, its transmission has been proved to be unstoppable and the absence of an effective drug makes the situation worse. The scientific community has gone all-out to discover and develop a possible vaccine or a competent antiviral drug. Other domains of biological sciences that promise effective results and target somewhat stable entities that are proteins, could be very useful in this time of crisis. Proteomics and metabolomics are the vast fields that are equipped with sufficient technologies to face this challenge. Various protein separation and identification techniques are available which facilitates the analysis of various types of interactions among proteins and their evolutionary lineages. The presented review aims at confronting the question: how proteomics can help in tackling SARS-CoV-2?

Although clinical treatments of PCa have made great progress in recent decades, once tolerance to treatments occurs, the disease progresses rapidly after recurrence. PCa exhibits a unique metabolic rewriting that changes from initial neoplasia to advanced neoplasia. However, systematic and comprehensive studies on the relationship of changes in the metabolic landscape of PCa with tumor recurrence and treatment response are lacking. We aimed to construct a metabolism-related gene landscape that predicts PCa recurrence and treatment response. METHODS: In the present study, we used differentially expressed gene analysis, proteinCprotein interaction (PPI) networks, univariate and multivariate Cox regression, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to construct and verify a metabolism-related risk model (MRM) to predict the disease-free survival (DFS) and response to treatment for PCa patients. RESULTS: The MRM predicted patient survival more accurately than the current clinical prognostic indicators. By using two independent PCa datasets (International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) PCa and Taylor) and actual patients to test the model, we also confirmed that the metabolism-related risk score (MRS) was strongly related to PCa progression. Notably, patients in different MRS subgroups had significant differences in metabolic activity, mutant landscape, immune microenvironment, and drug sensitivity. Patients in the high-MRS group were more sensitive to immunotherapy and endocrine therapy, while patients in the low-MRS group were more sensitive to chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: We developed an MRM, which might act as a clinical feature to more accurately assess prognosis and guide the selection of appropriate treatment for PCa patients. It is promising for further application in clinical practice.","output":"A Metabolism-Related Gene Landscape Predicts Prostate Cancer Recurrence and Treatment Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antecedentes: La infeccin por SARS-CoV-2 est provocando graves consecuencias en la humanidad.

Background: At present, COVID-19 is a global pandemic and is seriously harmful to humans. In this retrospective study, the aim was to investigate the interaction between CVD and COVID-19. Methods: A total of 180 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Yichang Central Peoples Hospital from 29 January to 17 March 2020 were initially included. The medical history, clinical manifestations at the time of admission, laboratory test results, hospitalization time and complications were recorded. According to the medical history, the patients were assigned to the nonsevere group with non-CVD (n=90), the nonsevere group with CVD (n=22), the severe group with non-CVD (n=40) and the severe group with CVD (n=28). Results: In the severe group, compared with non-CVD patients, CVD patients had a significantly higher incidence of fever (P<0.05). However, compared with the nonsevere group, the severe group had significantly higher proportions of patients with hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, CHD and HF (all P<0.05). Among the patients with nonsevere COVID-19, the WBC count and the levels of IL-6, CRP, D-dimer, NT-proBNP, and FBG were significantly higher and the Hb level was significantly lower in the CVD patients than in the non-CVD patients (all P<0.05). However, among the patients with severe COVID-19, only the level of NT-proBNP was significantly higher in CVD patients than in non-CVD patients (P<0.05). In addition, the WBC count and the levels of IL-6, CRP, D-dimer, CKMB, ALT, AST, SCR, NT-proBNP, and FBG were significantly higher and the Hb level was significantly lower in the severe group than in the nonsevere group (all P<0.05). However, among the patients with severe COVID-19, the incidences of acute myocardial injury, acute kidney injury, arrhythmia, and sudden death were significantly higher in the CVD group than in the non-CVD group (all P<0.05). The same results were found in the comparison of the nonsevere group with the severe group. Among the patients with nonsevere COVID-19, those without CVD had a mean hospitalization duration of 25.25 (SD 7.61) days, while those with CVD had a mean hospitalization duration of 28.77 (SD 6.11) days; the difference was significant (P<0.05).

The prevalence rate ratio of firefighters in the database compared to the baseline prevalence of firefighting in the Chicago metropolitan area was calculated via the Poisson distribution. Results: Nineteen firefighters were identified; all were men. A variety of ILD subtypes were seen across the cohort, including four patients with a diagnosis of connective tissue disease. Patients had mild forced vital capacity (FVC) and moderate diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) decrements on presentation; three patients died and two received lung transplantation over an average follow-up time of 76 months. Firefighters were seen at a greater proportion in the ILD registry than in the general population with a prevalence rate ratio of 3.98. Conclusions: Firefighting was overrepresented in our cohort compared to the general population, suggesting that there may be a causative association between firefighting and the presence of ILD.

METHODS: The study aim was to evaluate the incidence and risk factors associated with both CA-AKI and HA-AKI. Consecutive patients hospitalized at a reference center for COVID-19 were included in this prospective cohort study. RESULTS: We registered 349 (30%) AKI episodes in 1,170 hospitalized patients, 224 (19%) corresponded to CA-AKI, and 125 (11%) to HA-AKI. Compared to patients with HA-AKI, subjects with CA-AKI were older (61 years [IQR 49C70] vs. 50 years [IQR 43C61]), had more comorbidities (hypertension [44 vs. 26%], CKD [10 vs. 3%]), higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (2 points [IQR 1C4] vs. 1 point [IQR 0C2]), and presented to the emergency department with more severe disease. Mortality rates were not different between CA-AKI and HA-AKI (119 [53%] vs. 63 [50%], p = 0.66). In multivariate analysis, CA-AKI was strongly associated to a history of CKD (OR 4.17, 95% CI 1.53C11.3), hypertension (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.01C2.36), Charlson Comorbidity Index (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.02C1.32), and SOFA score (OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.87C2.57).

Buckland and F. Wild, Nature [London] 338:547, 1989). To determine the role of the conserved leucines in the oligomeric structure and biological activity of the Newcastle disease virus (NDV) fusion protein, the heptadic leucines at amino acids 481, 488, and 495 were changed individually and in combination to an alanine residue. While single amino acid changes had little effect on fusion, substitution of two or three leucine residues abolished the fusogenic activity of the protein, although cell surface expression of the mutants was higher than that of the wild-type protein. Substitution of all three leucine residues with alanine did not alter the size of the fusion protein oligomer as determined by sedimentation in sucrose gradients. Furthermore, deletion of the C-terminal 91 amino acids, including the leucine zipper motif and transmembrane domain, resulted in secretion of an oligomeric polypeptide. These results indicate that the conserved leucines are not necessary for oligomer formation but are required for the fusogenic ability of the protein. When the polar face of the potential alpha helix was altered by nonconservative changes of serine to alanine (position 473), glutamic acid to lysine or alanine (position 482), asparagine to lysine (position 485), or aspartic acid to alanine (position 489), the fusogenic ability of the protein was not significantly disrupted.

Recent studies showed change in IUS parameters after treatment initiation but studies with an endoscopic reference standard are scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate early change of IUS parameters and determine cut-off values for endoscopic endpoints in UC patients starting anti-inflammatory treatment. Methods: In this longitudinal prospective study consecutive patients with moderate-severe UC (baseline endoscopic Mayo score (EMS)2) starting an anti-inflammatory treatment were included. Clinical scores, biochemical parameters and IUS parameters were collected at baseline, after 2 (T1), 6 (T2) and 8-26 weeks (T3) around time of the second sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy. IUS parameters were measured as previously established1. Endoscopic remission (ER) and mucosal healing (MH) were evaluated in the sigmoid and defined as EMS=0 and EMS1, respectively. The ultrasonographist and endoscopist were blinded for the outcomes of endoscopy and IUS, respectively. Results: 51 consecutive patients were included (Table 1) of whom 31 underwent a second endoscopy (MH: n=15 (45%), ER: n=9 (27%)). Two additional patients underwent colectomy and were considered non-responders. 18 patients did not undergo second endoscopy due to the COVID-19 pandemic (n=2), refusal (n=5), loss to follow-up (n=1) or treatment escalation because of clinical deterioration confirmed by IUS and biomarkers before second endoscopy was performed (n=10). Bowel wall thickness (BWT) was significantly lower from T2 onwards in patients reaching MH (p=0.026) and ER (p=0.002) at T3 (Fig 1). A significant decrease in BWT was already visible at T1 in patients receiving infliximab (p=0.001) or tofacitinib (p=0.007), but not in patients treated with vedolizumab (p=0.11) (Fig 2). Most accurate BWT cut-off values at T3 to determine MH and ER were 3.52 mm (AUROC: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.86-1.00, p<0.0001, sens: 91%, spec: 91%) and 2.98 mm (AUROC: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.85-1.00, p=0.001, sens: 87%, spec: 100%), respectively. Other IUS parameters at T3 did not improve association with MH or ER. IUS parameters at T2 that predict MH and ER are demonstrated in Table 2.

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY: In September 2020, a nationwide cross-sectional survey study among Dutch intensive care nurses was carried out to measure prevalence rates of symptoms of anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and need for recovery (NFR), objectified by the HADS-A, HADS-D, IES-6 and NFR questionnaires, respectively. Associated risk factors were determined using multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Symptoms of anxiety, depression, and post traumatic stress disorder were reported by 27.0%, 18.6% and 22.2% of the 726 respondents, respectively. The NFR was positive, meaning not being recovered from work, in 41.7%. Working in an academic hospital, being afraid of infecting relatives and experiencing insufficient numbers of colleagues were associated with more mental symptoms, while having been on holiday was associated with reduced depression symptoms and need for recovery. CONCLUSION: The first COVID-19 surge had a high impact on the mental well-being of intensive care nurses, increasing the risk for drop out and jeopardising the continuity of care. Effort should be made to optimize working conditions and decrease workload to guarantee care in the next months of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"The impact of the first COVID-19 surge on the mental well-being of ICU nurses: A nationwide survey study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Covid-19 pandemic can seriously affect African nations because of the weak health care system, crowding, poor hygiene in the cities, and the random mobility of people. Hospital-based interventions are not a good choice for resource-scarce countries which have shortages of hospital beds, ventilators, and oxygen;rather practicing preventive measures at a community level is the best strategy. There is a shortage of evidence about current public adherence with COVID-19 preventive strategies in Ethiopia, therefore this study helps to target health education messages to groups of populations with poor compliance to specific prevention measures, which also contribute to decreasing the magnitude and duration of the pandemic. Methods: A Community based cross-sectional study was done on 405 participants selected by systematic random sampling in Shashemane. Data was collected using A pretested structured tool comprising socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge, attitude, and adherence with COVID-19 prevention practice. Participants who practiced 75% of the COVID-19 preventive practices were labeled as having good adherence. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the associated variables. Odds ratios along with 95%CI were estimated to identify associated factors and a level of statistical significance was decided at p -value less than 0.05. Result: The practice of COVID-19 preventive measures was 19.5%, (95% CI: 15C24.5%).

Driven by population growth, migration, economic decline in rural areas, political instabilities, and even more recently, the Covid-19 pandemic, urban systems and spaces are changing to accommodate moving people and new functions. In many cases, these trends contribute to increased levels of inequality, poverty, food insecurity, and unemployment, while the warnings about the impact of climate change continue to raise concerns. Though some have called this a new urban revolution, others have referred to, in a more apocalyptic turn, the end of cities. In response, many writers are encouraging smarter cities, whereas others are promoting a post-urban context and a return to small communities. High levels of uncertainty are characteristic, along with increased intensities of complexity, rapid fluctuation and unbounded experimentation. This raises many questions about the nature and implication of change in different cities situated in vastly contrasting contexts. This thematic issue of Urban Planning focuses on five narratives from cities across the world to illustrate various drivers of change and their implications for urban design and planning. The editorial introduces these narratives, as well as commentaries from leading academics/practitioners and highlights several divergent experiences and common threats. It argues that to deal with the rapid and often large-scale changes, planners need to view human settlements as socio-ecological systems and plan for change and uncertainty to facilitate the co-evolution of humans and nature.","output":"Rapidly Changing Cities: Working with Socio-Ecological Systems to Facilitate Transformation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic & lockdown has cause deliberate effect to humans physical & mental health & trigger many psychological problems like anxiety, loneliness, stress, depression & other panic disorder The investigators interested to find out the psychological impact of lockdown among general population & correlation with different components of modified psychosocial impact event scale Researchers have used non C experimental descriptive research deign with Non C randomized convenient sampling & 500sample recruited for the study Researchers have used standardized modified impact event scale in the form of 5 point likert scale, they have identified that 366 sample(73 2%)have moderate stress,110 sample (22%) identified with severe stress & remaining 24 sample (4 8%) have mild stress Another finding revel that each component having positive correlation with each other The significant association of psychological impacts & selected demographic variables were found with use of modified impact event scale Researcher have concluded that this type of event or diseases outbreak affect the mental health of the person, increased stress among individual & also affect the daily life of the person ? 2020, Institute of Medico-Legal Publications All rights reserved","output":"Covid-19 pandemic: Immediate psycological impact during the 3td stage of lockdown among general population of selected areas of vadodara city"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We thank Tang et al. for their perspective on the possible limitation of D-dimer levels guiding anticoagulant treatment in patients with COVID-19 [1].

We conduct generalized linear modeling to examine the relationship between awakenings and workplace outcomes, controlling for confounders. RESULTS 258 caregivers to older adults reported current employment and met our inclusion criteria.

AIM: In light of these changes, the authors compared data relative to allogeneic transplants carried out from 2018 at their center before (n = 167) and during the pandemic (n = 45). METHODS: The authors examined patient characteristics, donor and graft types, cell doses and main transplant outcomes. Moreover, the authors evaluated the rise of costs attributable to additional COVID-19-related procedures as well as the risk of adverse events these procedures conveyed to grafts or recipients. RESULTS: Overall, the number of transplants did not decrease during the pandemic, whereas patients at high relapse risk were prioritized. Transplants were mainly from matched unrelated donors, with a significant decrease in haploidentical related donors. Moreover, the use of bone marrow as a graft for haploidentical transplant was almost abandoned. Cryopreservation was introduced for all related and unrelated apheresis products, with a median storage time of 20 days. Notably, transplant outcomes (engraftment, acute graft-versus-host disease and non-relapse mortality) with cryopreserved products were comparable to those with fresh products.

As a result, more testing could increase the perceived risk of dying from the disease - i.e. 'stoke fear' - and cause a fall in economic activity, despite improving health outcomes. Two main insights emerge. First, increased testing is beneficial to the economy and pays for itself if performed at a sufficiently large scale, but not necessarily otherwise. Second, heterogeneous risk perceptions across age-groups can have important aggregate consequences.

Studies with more patients are needed to clarify the maintenance rate of postoperative hearing function and to identify prognostic of hearing function. METHOD: Ninety-one patients (mean age, 39.5 years; mean tumor size, 18.9 mm) with preserved useful hearing immediately after surgery were retrospectively analyzed. The useful hearing was defined as the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) classes A and B. Hearing tests, including auditory brainstem responses (ABR) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE), were evaluated preoperatively, immediately after surgery, and at outpatient follow-up. RESULTS: At the final follow-up (mean, 63.0 months), the useful hearing was maintained in 79 patients (87%), and the hearing class remained unchanged during the follow-up period in 40 patients (44%). Significant predictors of useful hearing maintenance were AAO-HNS class A immediately after surgery, improvement of ABR, and the absence of postoperative DPOAE deterioration. Postoperative DPOAE deterioration correlated with hearing class deterioration. CONCLUSIONS: Despite hearing being preserved in vestibular schwannoma patients immediately after surgery, Thirteen percent lost their useful hearing during the long follow-up period, and hearing class worsened in 55% of the patients.

However, the effect of CQ treatment on porcine immature Sertoli cells (iSCs) remains unclear. Here we showed that CQ could reduce iSC viability in a dose-dependent manner. CQ treatment (20 M) on iSCs for 36h could elevate oxidative stress, damage mitochondrial function and promote apoptosis, which could be partially rescued by melatonin (MT) (10 nM). Transcriptome profiling identified 1611 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (776 up- and 835 down-regulated) (20 M CQ vs. DMSO), mainly involved in MAPK cascade, cell proliferation/apoptosis, HIF-1, PI3K-Akt and lysosome signaling pathways. In contrast, only 467 (224 up- and 243 down-regulated) DEGs (CQ + MT vs. DMSO) could be found after MT (10 nM) addition, enriched in cell cycle, regulation of apoptotic process, lysosome and reproduction pathways. Therefore, the partial rescue effects of MT on CQ treatment were confirmed by multiple assays (cell viability, ROS level, mitochondrial function, apoptosis, and mRNA levels of selected genes). Collectively, CQ treatment could impair porcine iSC viability by deranging the signaling pathways related to apoptosis and autophagy, which could be partially rescued by MT supplementation.","output":"Melatonin mitigates Chloroquine-induced defects in porcine immature Sertoli cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted access to healthcare. Delay in diagnosis and onset of care increases cancer related mortality. We aim to analyse its impact on patient profile, hospital visits, morbidity in surgically treated patients, and process outcomes. METHODS: We analysed an ambi-directional cohort from 16th March to June 30, 2020 (Pandemic cohort, PC) as compared to 2019 (Pre-pandemic cohort, PPC). We measured, new patient registrations, proportion of within state patients vs rest of India, median time to treatment decision, proportion of patients seeking second opinions, modality of initial treatment (surgery/radiotherapy/chemotherapy), 30-day post-operative morbidity/mortality, conversion of inpatient-to teleconsult in the PC. RESULTS: Between the 2 cohorts, new registrations declined from 235 to 69 (70% reduction). The percentage of within state patients increased from 41.7% to 53.6% (11.9% increase). There was a decline in second opinion consults from 25% to 16%. The median time to decision-making decreased to 16 days in PC vs 20 days in PPC (20% reduction). Surgery was the first line of treatment in 40% as compared to 34% in the PPC with a mean time to surgery of 24 days in PC compared to 36 days in PPC (33% reduction). 66 surgeries were performed in the PC compared to 132 in the PPC. Thirty day post operative morbidity needing readmission remained similar (18% PC, vs 17% PPC). Perioperative intensive care remained similar in both cohorts. Teleconsultation was deemed medically safe in 92.8% (439/473 patients). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID 19 pandemic has substantially reduced access and onset to cancer care.

This systematic review aimed to determine the effectiveness of home-based PR (HBPR) programs for COPD patients. METHODS: A systematic review of scholarly literature published within the last 10 years from the conception of this project was conducted using internationally recognized guidelines. Search strategies were applied to electronic databases and clinical trial registries through March 2020 and updated in November 2021 to identify studies comparing HBPR with usual care or outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation (OPR). To critically appraise randomized studies, the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool (ROB) was used. The quality of non-randomized studies was evaluated using the ACROBAT-NRSI tool. The quality of evidence relating to key outcomes was assessed using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), exacerbation frequencies, COPD-related hospital admissions, and program adherence. Three independent reviewers assessed methodologic quality and reviewed the studies. RESULTS: Twelve randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 2 comparative observational studies were included. While considerable evidence relating to the effectiveness of HBPR programs for COPD patients exist, overall quality is low. There were no differences between HBPR and OPR in terms of safety, HRQoL, functional exercise capacity and health care resource utilization. Compared to usual care, functional exercise capacity seemed to significantly improve after HBPR. While patient compliance with HBPR is good, two factors appeared to increase the risk of non-compliance: expectations of patients to 1) complete daily diaries/activity logs and 2) engage in solely unsupervised exercise sessions. CONCLUSION: The overall quality for most outcomes was low to very low; however, HBPR seems to offer comparable short-term benefits to OPR.

The present research aimed to assess the level of misconceptions and the factors associated with it among the older FDMNs in Bangladesh. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: A selected Rohingya camp situated in Cox's Bazar, a southeastern district of Bangladesh. PARTICIPANTS: Information was collected from 416 conveniently selected FDMNs who were aged 60 years and above. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was misconceptions related to the spread, prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Information on 14 different locally relevant misconceptions was gathered, each was scored as one, and obtained a cumulative score, ranging from 0 to 14, with a higher score indicating a higher level of misconceptions. A multiple linear regression model explored the factors associated with misconceptions. RESULTS: The participants had an average of five misconceptions. The most prevalent misconceptions were: everyone should wear personal protective equipment when outside (84.6%) and its prevention by nutritious food (62.5%) and drinking water (59.3%). Other notable misconceptions included the spread of COVID-19 through mosquito bites (42%) and its transmissions only to the non/less religious person (31.4%). In regression analyses, memory or concentration problems, communication frequency with social networks, pre-existing conditions and receiving information from health workers were significantly associated with higher COVID-19 misconceptions. These misconceptions were less likely among those overwhelmed by COVID-19, having COVID-19 diagnosed friends or family members and receiving information from friends and family. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we found that misconceptions were prevalent among the older FDMNs in Bangladesh. The associations have important implications for programmes to prevent and manage COVID-19 in these settings.

Several diagnostic methods were used to screen for the cause of disease, and minute virus of canines (MVC) was detected in all parenchymal organs, including the liver. Other pathogens that may cause degenerative viral hepatitis were not found. Infection with MVC was confirmed by in situ hybridization, which revealed the presence of MVC nucleic acid in the liver tissue of the dog. Through sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the nearly complete genome sequence, the strain was found to be distinct from other previously reported MVC strains.

The innovative teaching methodologies (for example IBL, PBL, etc.) have been experiencing digital evolution and experimentation, especially during the covid-19 pandemic in which schools have engaged in periods of distance-teaching. The use of stories on social media is now a very widespread communication practice among internet users. This narrative methodology is used in educational practice in various sectors of training not only to electrify disciplinary content but also to encourage emotional sharing and participation in the educational process. The purpose of the article is the design of an educational intervention aimed at teachers in the initial stages of a training path that aims to develop digital skills and a group atmosphere that will accompany the use of those skills in their subsequent training activities. The proposed experimental model not only collects the content to be followed during the educational intervention but also focuses attention on the use of digital technology (apps and software) to be integrated with the virtual platform for the concrete realization of digital storytelling 2.0. From a psychological point of view, it is interesting to monitor the processes of motivation, attention and participation in the didactic intervention. ? 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.","output":"Narrative techniques and digital storytelling laboratory for the development of emotional and cognitive skills in school"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RESUMO Objetivo: analisar, a partir de publica??es do site do Conselho Federal de Enfermagem, os lxicos que mantm rela??o com a temtica \\"Combate  infodemia durante a pandemia da Covid-19\\" Mtodo: pesquisa qualitativa do tipo documental, cujas fontes primrias foram reportagens e notcias divulgadas no site do Conselho Federal de Enfermagem durante a Semana de Enfermagem de 2020 Os dados foram processados pelo software IRAMUTEQ?

However, a few studies have explored patient-centered outcomes in critical care survivors. We aimed to investigate frailty and disability transitions in COVID-19 patients admitted to ICUs. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: University hospital in Sao Paulo. PATIENTS: Survivors of COVID-19 ICU admissions. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We assessed frailty using the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). We also evaluated 15 basic, instrumental, and mobility activities. Baseline frailty and disability were defined by clinical conditions 2C4 weeks before COVID-19, and post-COVID-19 was characterized 90 days (day 90) after hospital discharge. We used alluvial flow diagrams to visualize transitions in frailty status, Venn diagrams to describe the overlap between frailty and disabilities in activities of daily living, and linear mixed models to explore the occurrence of new disabilities following critical care in COVID-19. We included 428 participants with a mean age of 64 years, 57% males, and a median Simplified Acute Physiology Score-3 score of 59. Overall, 14% were frail at baseline. We found that 124/394 participants (31%) were frail at day 90, 70% of whom were previously non-frail. The number of disabilities also increased (mean difference, 2.46; 95% CI, 2.06C2.86), mainly in participants who were non-frail before COVID-19. Higher pre-COVID-19 CFS scores were independently associated with new-onset disabilities. At day 90, 135 patients (34%) were either frail or disabled. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty and disability were more frequent 90 days after hospital discharge compared with baseline in COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU.

Here, we investigated the expression of PDK1, a key regulator of glucose metabolism, in bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA) and its effect on prognosis. The expression pattern of PDK1 was examined by bioinformatics analysis and immunohistochemistry. A total of 101 cases of BLCA were selected for tissue microarrays (TMAs) that contained both tumour and paired normal tissues. We demonstrated that PDK1 expression was correlated with tumour grade and Ki67expression in our TMA cohort (all p values < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that patients with MIBC with high PDK1 expression had a worse prognosis than patients with low PDK1 expression (p = 0.016). Multifactor risk analysis showed that increased PDK1 expression was an independent prognostic factor affecting the overall survival of MIBC patients. GSEA showed that the mTOR pathway, HIF pathway, glycolysis, PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling, etc. were differentially enriched in the PDK1 high expression phenotype.

Published reports have identified conflicting pro- and antiviral effects of IFITM3 on SARS-CoV-2 in cultured cells, and its impact on viral pathogenesis in vivo remains unclear. Here, we show that IFITM3 knockout (KO) mice infected with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 experienced extreme weight loss and lethality, while wild type (WT) mice lost minimal weight and recovered. KO mice had higher lung viral titers and increases in lung inflammatory cytokine levels, CD45-positive immune cell infiltration, and histopathology, compared to WT mice. Mechanistically, we observed disseminated viral antigen staining throughout the lung tissue and pulmonary vasculature in KO mice, while staining was observed in confined regions in WT lungs. Global transcriptomic analysis of infected lungs identified upregulation of gene signatures associated with interferons, inflammation, and angiogenesis in KO versus WT animals, highlighting changes in lung gene expression programs that precede severe lung pathology and fatality. Corroborating the protective effect of IFITM3 in vivo, K18-hACE2/IFITM3 KO mice infected with non-adapted SARS-CoV-2 showed enhanced, rapid weight loss and early death compared to control mice. Increased heart infection was observed in both mouse models in the absence of IFITM3, indicating that IFITM3 constrains extrapulmonary dissemination of SARS-CoV-2.

Two articles were cohort studies, and the remaining were expert consensuses and published guidelines. The most common recommendation among the studies in this systematic review was to test asymptomatic patients for SARS-CoV-2 prior to treatment. Conclusion: There is a lack of studies which directly address COVID-19 testing of asymptomatic patients before treatment.

METHODS This study addresses the question whether robot-assisted Single-Site? cholecystectomy provides significant benefits over single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy in terms of surgeon's stress load, while matching the standards of the conventional single-incision approach with regard to peri- and postoperative outcomes. It is designed as a single centre, single-blinded randomized controlled trial, which compares both surgical approaches with the primary endpoint surgeon's physical and mental stress load at the time of surgery. In addition, the study aims to assess secondary endpoints such as operating time, conversion rates, additional trocar placement, intra-operative blood loss, length of hospital stay, costs of procedure, health-related quality of life, cosmesis and complications. Patients as well as ward staff are blinded until the 1st postoperative year. Sample size calculation based on the results of a previously published experimental setup utilizing an estimated effect size of surgeon's comfort of 0.8 (power of 0.8, alpha-error level of 0.05, error margin of 10-15%) resulted in a number of 30 randomized patients per arm. DISCUSSION The study is the first randomized controlled trial that compares the da Vinci Single Site? platform to conventional laparoscopic approaches in cholecystectomy, one of the most frequently performed operations in general surgery. TRIAL REGISTRATION This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (trial number: NCT02485392 ).

DESIGN: A retrospective descriptive study. METHODS: Call data sourced from Pharmacy One Poison Center from the lockdown period (21 March 2020C21 May 2020) and the same period during 2019 (21 March 2019C21 May 2019) were revised. In addition, a database was established and analysed. RESULTS: We noticed that not only did calls increased, but there was also a noticeable change in call patterns. Calls increased by 91% (544 vs 285 calls) during the lockdown period. Drugs were the most common among types of exposure, and the most prevalent route of exposure was ingestion. There was a notable increase in ocular exposure by 550% (13 vs 2 cases). The majority of exposures were at home and there were no occupational exposures. We found an increase in household cleaner exposure among males and an increase in alcohol exposure in females. Children aged below 5 years are the most affected. Even though there is an increase in the total number of cases, severe cases decreased. CONCLUSION: The lockdown effect on rates of toxic exposures was prominent, whether through the increase in calls or the change in patterns. As people spent more time at home, their exposure to toxic agents increased. Furthermore, cleaning recommendations led to the misuse of cleaning and disinfectant products, increasing exposures related to abating the COVID-19 infection.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the incidence and patterns of toxic exposures and poisoning in Jordan: a retrospective descriptive study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In chest computed tomography (CT) scan, bilateral peripheral multifocal ground-glass opacities, linear opacities, reversed halo sign, and crazy-paving pattern are suggestive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in clinically suspicious cases, but they are not specific for the diagnosis, as other viral pneumonias, like influenza and some viral pneumonia may show similar imaging findings. AIM: To find a specific imaging feature of the disease would be a welcome guide in diagnosis and management of challenging cases. METHODS: Chest CT imaging findings of 650 patients admitted to a university Hospital in Tehran, Iran between January 2020 and July 2020 with confirmed COVID-19 infection by RT-PCR were reviewed by two expert radiologists. In addition to common non-specific imaging findings of COVID-19 pneumonia, radiologic characteristics of pulmonary target sign (PTS) were assessed. PTS is defined as a circular appearance of non-involved pulmonary parenchyma, which encompass a central hyperdense dot surrounded by ground-glass or alveolar opacities. RESULTS: PTS were presented in 32 cases (frequency 4.9%). The location of the lesions in 31 of the 32 cases (96.8%) was peripheral, while 4 of the 31 cases had lesions both peripherally and centrally. In 25 cases, the lesions were located near the pleural surface and considered pleural based and half of the lesions (at least one lesion) were in the lower segments and lobes of the lungs. 22 cases had multiple lesions with a > 68% frequency. More than 87% of cases had an adjacent bronchovascular bundle. Ground-glass opacities were detectable adjacent or close to the lesions in 30 cases (93%) and only in 7 cases (21%) was consolidation adjacent to the lesions. CONCLUSION: Although it is not frequent in COVID-19, familiarity with this feature may help radiologists and physicians distinguish the disease from other viral and non-infectious pneumonias in challenging cases.","output":"Pulmonary target sign as a diagnostic feature in chest computed tomography of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel therapies for the treatment of COVID-19 are continuing to emerge as the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic progresses. PCR remains the standard benchmark for initial diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, while advances in immunological profiling are guiding clinical treatment. The SARS-Cov-2 virus has undergone multiple mutations since its emergence in 2019, resulting in changes in virulence that have impacted on disease severity globally. The emergence of more virulent variants of SARS-Cov-2 remains challenging for effective disease control during this pandemic. Major variants identified to date include B.1.1.7, B.1.351; P.1; B.1.617.2; B.1.427; P.2; P.3; B.1.525; and C.37. Globally, large unvaccinated populations increase the risk of more and more variants arising. With successive waves of COVID-19 emerging, strategies that mitigate against community transmission need to be implemented, including increased vaccination coverage. For treatment, convalescent plasma therapy, successfully deployed during recent Ebola outbreaks and for H1N1 influenza, can increase survival rates and improve host responses to viral challenge. Convalescent plasma is rich with cytokines (IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-17, and IL-8), CCL2, and TNF, neutralizing antibodies, and clotting factors essential for the management of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical trials can inform and guide treatment policy, leading to mainstream adoption of convalescent therapy.

This global pandemic has pushed the healthcare system and restricted the movement of people and succumbing of the available therapeutics utterly warrants the development of a potential vaccine to contest the deadly situation. In the present study, highly efficacious, immunodominant cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes were predicted by advanced immunoinformatics assays using the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV2, generating a robust and specific immune response with convincing immunological parameters (Antigenicity, TAP affinity, MHC binder) engendering an efficient viral vaccine. The molecular docking studies show strong binding of the CTL construct with MHC-1 and host membrane specific TLR2 receptors. The molecular dynamics simulation in an explicit system confirmed the stable and robust binding of CTL epitope with TLR2. Steep magnitude RMSD variation and compelling residual fluctuations existed in terminal residues and various loops of the ? linker segments of TLR2-epitope (residues 105-156 and 239-254) to about 0.4 nm. The reduced Rg value (3.3 nm) and stagnant SASA analysis (275 nm/S2/N after 8 ns and 5 ns) for protein surface and its orientation in the exposed and buried regions suggests more compactness due to the strong binding interaction of the epitope.

We investigate the evidence for a change in lethality of COVID-19 in late autumn 2020 in the UK, using age-structured, weekly national aggregate data for cases and mortalities. Models that allow a (step-like or graded) change in infection fatality rate (IFR) have consistently higher model evidence than those without. Moreover, they all infer a close to two-fold increase in IFR. This value lies well above most previously available estimates. However, the same models consistently infer that, most probably, the increase in IFR preceded the time window during which variant B.1.1.7 (alpha) became the dominant strain in the UK. Therefore, according to our models, the caseload and mortality data do not offer unequivocal evidence for higher lethality of a new variant. We compare these results for the UK with similar models for Germany and France, which also show increases in inferred IFR during the same period, despite the even later arrival of new variants in those countries. We argue that while the new variant(s) may be one contributing cause of a large increase in IFR in the UK in autumn 2020, other factors, such as seasonality, or pressure on health services, are likely to also have contributed.","output":"Bayesian inference across multiple models suggests a strong increase in lethality of COVID-19 in late 2020 in the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Following a year of development, several vaccines have been approved to contain the global COVID-19 pandemic.

It is the first review that summarizes the different GANs methods and the lungs images datasets for COVID-19. It attempts to answer the questions related to applications of GANs, popular GAN architectures, frequently used image modalities, and the availability of source code. This review included 57 full-text studies that reported the use of GANs for different applications in COVID-19 lungs images data. Most of the studies (n=42) used GANs for data augmentation to enhance the performance of AI techniques for COVID-19 diagnosis. Other popular applications of GANs were segmentation of lungs and super-resolution of the lungs images. The cycleGAN and the conditional GAN were the most commonly used architectures used in nine studies each. 29 studies used chest X-Ray images while 21 studies used CT images for the training of GANs. For majority of the studies (n=47), the experiments were done and results were reported using publicly available data. A secondary evaluation of the results by radiologists/clinicians was reported by only two studies. Conclusion: Studies have shown that GANs have great potential to address the data scarcity challenge for lungs images of COVID-19. Data synthesized with GANs have been helpful to improve the training of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models trained for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Besides, GANs have also contributed to enhancing the CNNs performance through the super-resolution of the images and segmentation.

While several factors have been proposed in the literature to explain the unexpected role of Africa, including a relatively young population, more historical-driven preparedness to other types of coronavirus and diseases, and a limited amount of testing, the puzzle is not considered to be solved.

Here, a novel murine model of fetal ZIKV infection incorporating intraventricular infection and cell type-specific in utero electroporation (IUE) was used to identify the time course of ZIKV infection and to determine the identity of cells that are initially infected or spared during neocortical neurogenesis. In vivo time course studies revealed the presence of ZIKV in apical radial glial cells (aRGCs) at early time points following virus exposure, while basal intermediate progenitor cells (bIPCs) became maximally (ZIKV(+)) after 3 d of virus exposure. ZIKV-infected fetal brains exhibited microencephaly as early as 1 d following infection, regardless of developmental age. This change in brain size was caused in part by apoptosis and reduced proliferation that persisted until birth. While 60% of aRGC basal fibers were perturbed during infection, 40% retained normal morphology, indicating that aRGCs are not uniformly vulnerable to ZIKV infection. To investigate this heterogeneous vulnerability, we performed genetic fate mapping using cell type-specific probes derived from a mouse embryonic day (E)15.5 neocortical wall single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) dataset. The results indicate that one class of aRGCs preferentially express the putative ZIKV entry receptor AXL and that these cells are more vulnerable to ZIKV infection than other aRGC subtypes with low AXL expression.

Diagnosis of PE by point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) might reduce the need for computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA), while decreasing time-to-diagnosis. MATERIALS & METHODS: This prospective, observational study included adult ICU patients with COVID-19. Multi-organ (lungs, deep vein, cardiac) POCUS was performed within 24 h of CTPA, looking for subpleural consolidations, deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and right ventricular strain (RVS). We reported the scan time, and calculated diagnostic accuracy measures for these signs separately and in combination. RESULTS: 70 consecutive patients were included. 23 patients (32.8%) had a PE. Median scan time was 14 min (IQR 11C17). Subpleural consolidations' diagnostic accuracy was: 42.9% (95%CI [34.1C52.0]). DVT's and RVS' diagnostic accuracy was: 75.6% (95%CI [67.1C82.9]) and 74.4% (95%CI [65.8C81.8]). Their sensitivity was: 24.0% (95%CI [9.4C45.1]), and 40.0% (95%CI [21.3C61.3]), while their specificity was: 88.8% (95%CI [80.8C94.3]), and: 83.0% (95%CI [74.2C89.8]), respectively.

Using the PRISMA methodology, we provide a comprehensive review of the complex interactions between entrepreneurship and epidemics over time.

In the long term, as medical uncertainty abates, Schumpeterian entrepreneurship can contribute to transforming the post-crisis environment, either supporting or undermining the public reaction to the crisis and determining the path of institutionalization, in the process of defining a new normal. Thus, epidemics could lead to unpredictable socioeconomic and technological improvements, but also to highly undesirable outcomes. The construction of a satisfactory new normal requires the integration of entrepreneurial capabilities within the public sector and an explicit policy of cooperation with the private sector.

Incidences were quantified and compared with regard to age and method of implant fixation. METHODS: Using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, 12 randomized controlled trials and 18 cohort studies were investigated for evidence-based outcomes following HXPLE and CPE use in 2,539 hips over a 5 to 15-year follow-up. RESULTS: Lower rates of osteolysis, aseptic loosening, and implant revision were reported following use of HXLPE liners. Osteolysis was reduced from 25.4% with CPE to 4.05% with HXLPE in young patients, and from 29.7% to 6.6% in the older patient cohort. Similarities in osteolysis rates were observed when cemented (24.9% for CPE and 6.5% for HXLPE) and uncemented components (32.8% for CPE and 7.1% for HXLPE) were compared.

Chemotherapy consisted of protracted infusion of 5-fluoracil (800 mg/m2/day) on days 1-5 and cisplatin or nedaplatin (80 mg/m2/day) on day 1. The median (range) follow-up was 47 (6-127) months. The 5-year overall and disease-free survival rates were 71.2% and 60.6%, respectively. The 5-year overall survival rate was significantly higher in patients with the SLC31A1 rs10981694 C allele compared with the rs10981694 A/A genotype (91.7% vs. 65.0%, P = 0.018).

Here we report a case of MOGAD after mRNA severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination. A previously healthy 68-year-old woman presented to our department with gradually worsening numbness on the right side of her face, which began 14 days after her second dose of an mRNA-1273 vaccination. The patient's brain MRI revealed a right cerebellar peduncle lesion with gadolinium enhancement, a typical finding of MOGAD. A neurological examination revealed paresthesia on her right V2 and V3 areas. Other neurological examinations were unremarkable. Laboratory workups were positive for serum MOG-IgG as assessed by live cell-based assays and the presence of oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The patient's serum test results for cytoplasmic-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, perinuclear-cytoplasmic-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, GQ1b-antibodies, and aquaporin-4 antibodies (AQP4-IgG) were all negative. Tests for soluble interleukin (IL)-2 receptors in the serum, IL-6 in the CSF and skin pricks, and angiotensin converting enzyme tests were all unremarkable. The patient was diagnosed with MOGAD after receiving an mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. After two courses of intravenous methylprednisolone treatment, the patient's symptoms improved and her cerebellar peduncle lesion shrunk slightly without gadolinium enhancement. To date, there have only been two cases of monophasic MOGAD following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, including both the ChAdOx1 nCOV-19 and mRNA-1273 vaccines, and the prognosis is generally similar to other typical MOGAD cases.

Outpatient fever clinics (FCs), instituted during the SARS epidemic in 2003, were upgraded to serve for COVID-19 screening and prevention of disease transmission in large tertiary hospitals in China. FCs were hoped to relieve some of the healthcare burden from emergency departments (EDs). We aimed to evaluate the effect of upgrading the FC system on rates of nosocomial COVID-19 infection and ED patient attendance at Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH). DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 6365 patients were screened in the FC. METHODS: The FC of PUMCH was upgraded on 20 January 2020. We performed a retrospective study of patients presenting to the FC between 12 December 2019 and 29 February 2020. The date when COVID-19 was declared an outbreak in Beijing was 20 January 2020. Two groups of data were collected and subsequently compared with each other: the first group of data was collected within 40 days before 20 January 2020; the second group of data was collected within 40 days after 20 January 2020. All necessary data, including patient baseline information, diagnosis, follow-up conditions and the transfer records between the FC and ED, were collected and analysed. RESULTS: 6365 patients were screened in the FC, among whom 2912 patients were screened before 21 January 2020, while 3453 were screened afterward. Screening results showed that upper respiratory infection was the major disease associated with fever. After the outbreak of COVID-19, the number of patients who were transferred from the FC to the ED decreased significantly (39.21% vs 15.75%, p<0.001), and patients generally spent more time in the FC (55 vs 203 min, p<0.001), compared with before the outbreak. For critically ill patients waiting for their screening results, the total length of stay in the FC was 22 min before the outbreak, compared with 442 min after the outbreak (p<0.001). The number of in-hospital deaths of critically ill patients in the FC was 9 out of 29 patients before the outbreak and 21 out of 38 after the outbreak (p<0.05). Nineteen cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in the FC during the period of this study. However, no other patients nor any healthcare providers were cross-infected. CONCLUSION: The workload of the FC increased significantly after the COVID-19 outbreak. New protocols regarding the use of FC likely helped prevent the spread of COVID-19 within the hospital. The upgraded FC also reduced the burden on the ED.","output":"Identifying the effects of an upgraded fever clinic on COVID-19 control and the workload of emergency department: retrospective study in a tertiary hospital in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pompe Disease, also known as glycogenosis type 2, is due to deficiency in lysosomal alpha- glucosidase, a lysosomal hydrolase, which presents infantile and late onset subtypes (LOPD).

Re-examining this association using up-to-date data reflecting current and real-world practices, across different global regions and in both haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients, is important. METHODS: We describe the association between serum phosphate and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in incident dialysis patients between 2008 and 2018 using the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant (ANZDATA) Registry. Time-dependent Cox proportionate hazards models were used. Models were adjusted for available covariates and fitted for the overall cohort, and also each dialysis modality. RESULTS: 31,989 patients were followed over 97,122 person-years at risk (mean age at first dialysis 61 years, 38% female, 67% haemodialysis). We observed a U-shaped association between serum phosphate and all-cause mortality. In the fully adjusted model, categories of serum phosphate above and below 1.25 - 1.99 mmol/L were associated with progressively higher risk, reaching a hazard ratio of 2.13 (95% CI 1.93 - 2.36, p<0.001) for serum phosphate &#8805;2.75mmol/L, and 1.56 (95% CI 1.44 - 1.69, p<0.001) for serum phosphate <1.00mmol/L. Low and high levels of serum phosphate were also associated with increased risk of cardiovascular mortality, however the association with high serum phosphate was more pronounced (\\"J-shaped relationship\\"). The associations were consistent across sub-analyses of patients receiving haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In this large contemporary dialysis cohort, both high and low levels of serum phosphate were independently associated with increased risk of mortality.

The review presents methods and techniques to improve sensitivity in monitoring vital signs, such as the use of doping agents or coatings for optical fiber (OF) that provide stability and resistance to the external factors from which they must be protected in in vivo situations. It has been observed that most of these sensors work with single-mode optical fibers (SMF) in a spectral range of 1550 nm, while only some work in the visible spectrum (Vis); the vast majority, operate through fiber Bragg gratings (FBG), long-period fiber gratings (LPFG), and interferometers. These sensors have brought great advances to the measurement of vital signs, especially with regard to respiratory rate; however, many express the possibility of monitoring other vital signs through mathematical calculations, algorithms, or auxiliary devices. Their advantages due to miniaturization, immunity to electromagnetic interference, and the absence of a power source makes them truly desirable for everyday use at all times.","output":"Fiber Optic Sensors for Vital Signs Monitoring.

The homestead food production intervention, implemented by Helen Keller International, began in mid-2015 and ended in December 2018. METHODS: We use four data sources: 1) baseline data (all women and their youngest child, March-May 2015); 2) surveillance data (every two months - all children 6C18m and a rotating random third of women and children 19C37m, September 2015-August 2019); 3) endline data (all women and children 6C23m, September 2019-February 2020); 4) phone survey during the COVID-19 lockdown (a random two-thirds of women, May-June 2020). We calculated dietary diversity for women (MDDW-10) and children (WHO IYCF). Our analysis included 24,931 observations of 2,701 women and 17,445 observations of 2,162 children (6C37m). We estimate the impact of the intervention on dietary diversity using multi-level regression, controlling for clustering by settlement and repeated measures. RESULTS: Dietary diversity scores and the proportion of women and children classified as consuming adequate diets varied greatly over the year, peaking in May/June with 5.3 food groups for women (out of ten) and 3.8 food groups for children (out of seven). Over all program years, intervention women had 1.8 higher odds of consuming an adequate diet compared to control women (p < 0.001). However, this benefit varied from 1.3 in the first year of the intervention (p = 0.015) to 2.3 in the last year (p < 0.001), before falling to around 1.9 in the post-intervention years (p < 0.001). We saw a nearly identical pattern in children. Dietary improvement was driven through incremental increases in nearly all food groups.

Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of Rhesus macaques is similar in many key aspects to human HIV-1 infection and consequently this non-human primate (NHP) model has and continues to prove instrumental in evaluating HIV prevention, treatment and eradication approaches.

COVID-19 IgG and IgM Test results were entered into the EPIINFO questionnaire administered simultaneously with each test. EPIINFO was then used for both the descriptive and inferential statistical analyses of the data generated. The seroprevalence of COVID-19 in Niger State was found to be 25.41% and 2.16% for the positive IgG and IgM respectively. Seroprevalence among age groups, gender and by occupation varied widely. A seroprevalence of 37.21% was recorded among health care workers in Niger State. Among age groups, COVID-19 seroprevalence was found to be in order of 30-41 years (33.33%) > 42-53 years (32.42%) > 54-65 years (30%) > 66 years and above (25%) > 6-17 years (19.20%) > 18-29 years (17.65%) > 5 years and below (6.66%). A seroprevalence of 27.18% was recorded for males and 23.17% for females in the state. COVID-19 asymptomatic rate in the state was found to be 46.81%. The risk analyses showed that the chances of infection are almost the same for both urban and rural dwellers in the state. However, health care workers and those that have had contact with person (s) that travelled out of Nigeria in the last six (6) months are twice ( 2 times) at risk of being infected with the virus. More than half (54.59%) of the participants in this study did not practice social distancing at any time since the pandemic started. Discussions about knowledge, practice and attitude of the participants are included. The observed Niger State COVID-19 seroprevalence means that the herd immunity for COVID-19 is yet to be achieved and the population is still susceptible for more infection and transmission of the virus. If the prevalence stays as reported here, the population will definitely need COVID-19 vaccines when they become available. Niger State should fully enforce the use of face/nose masks and observation of social/physical distancing in gatherings including religious gatherings in order to stop or slow the spread of the virus.","output":"Seroprevalence of COVID-19 in Niger State"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) care in the Emergency Department (ED) has had to be modified during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Scarce literature exists on comfort of clinicians (defined as physicians, nurses & advanced practice providers-APP's) in these new roles and their perceived understanding of new algorithms. METHODS: Routine CPA care in our ED was modified during the COVID-19 pandemic. This involved clinicians in shared leadership roles alongside COVID-19 specific changes to CPA algorithms. The new protocol was operationalized through a two-step educational intervention involving didactic education and in-situ simulations. Univariate analyses using student's t-test assessed effectiveness of this educational intervention with clinician comfort as team leaders and perceived knowledge as primary outcomes on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Subgroup analysis across physicians (attending & resident), nurses & APP's were also undertaken with an alpha of 0.05, and p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Secondary outcomes of task saturation, procedural safety and error prevention were also analyzed. RESULTS: Across 83 of 95 total participants, our primary outcome of clinician comfort in the team leader role improved from a mean value of 3.41 (SD: 1.23) pre-intervention to 4.11 (SD: 0.88) with a p-value <0.001 post intervention. Similar and statistically significant findings in clinician comfort were noted across all subgroups except attending physicians and APP's. Perceived knowledge increased from a mean value of 3.54 (SD: 1.06) pre-intervention to a mean value of 4.24 (SD: 0.67) with a p-value <0.001 post intervention. Similar and statistically significant findings in perceived knowledge were noted across all subgroups except APP's. Responses were registered in either the strongly agree or agree category with regards to task saturation (89%), procedural safety (93%) and error prevention (71%) across all clinicians post intervention. CONCLUSION: Our pilot investigation of the effectiveness of an educational intervention of a novel CPA protocol in the ED during the COVID-19 pandemic reached statistical significance with regards to clinician comfort in shared leadership roles and perceived knowledge. These findings suggest that the protocol is rapidly teachable, usable and can be efficiently disseminated across ED clinicians of varying experience, especially in pandemic settings. Further work regarding effectiveness of this new protocol in real life cardiac arrest scenarios is warranted.","output":"Findings from a tandem clinician leadership intervention for emergency department cardiac arrest care during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in health care facilities poses a challenge against pandemic control. Health care workers (HCWs) have frequent and high-risk interactions with COVID-19 patients. We undertook a cost-effectiveness analysis to determine optimal testing strategies for screening HCWs to inform strategic decision-making in health care settings. METHODS: We modeled the number of new infections, quality-adjusted life years lost, and net costs related to six testing strategies including no test. We applied our model to four strata of HCWs, defined by the presence and timing of symptoms. We conducted sensitivity analyses to account for uncertainty in inputs. RESULTS: When screening recently symptomatic HCWs, conducting only a PCR test is preferable; it saves costs and improves health outcomes in the first week post-symptom onset, and costs $83,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained in the second week post-symptom onset. When screening HCWs in the late clinical disease stage, none of the testing approaches is cost-effective and thus no testing is preferable, yielding $11 and 0.003 new infections per 10 HCWs. For screening asymptomatic HCWs, antigen testing is preferable to PCR testing due to its lower cost. CONCLUSIONS: Both PCR and antigen testing are beneficial strategies to identify infected HCWs and reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in health care settings. IgG tests value depends on test timing and immunity characteristics, however it is not cost-effective in a low prevalence setting. As the context of the pandemic evolves, our study provides insight to health-care decision makers to keep the health care workforce safe and transmissions low.

Mixed-effects models were applied to assess associations among COVID-19-related income loss, financial strain, and pandemic-related worries about health, with anxiety and depression, controlling for multiple covariates including pre-COVID-19 income. RESULTS: In both studies, income loss and financial strain were associated with greater depressive symptoms at T1, above and beyond T1 anxiety, worries about health, and pre-COVID-19 income. Worsening of income loss was associated with exacerbation of depression at T2 in both studies. Worsening of subjective financial strain was associated with exacerbation of depression at T2 in one study (US).

Perspectives of endocrine surgery patients regarding this mode of healthcare delivery remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the opinions and perspectives of endocrine surgery patients regarding telemedicine. METHODS: The first 100 adult patients who had their initial telemedicine appointment with two endocrine surgeons were contacted at the conclusion of their visit. The survey administered assessed satisfaction with telemedicine, the provider, and whether attire or video background played a role in their perception of the quality of care received using a 5-point Likert scale. Differences in responses between new and returning patients were also evaluated. RESULTS: Telemedicine endocrine surgery patients stated excellent satisfaction with their visit (4.89 out of 5) and their provider (4.96 out of 5). While there was less consensus that telemedicine was equivalent to in-person or face-to face clinic visits (4.15 out of 5), patients would recommend a telemedicine visit to others and most agreed that this modality made it easier to obtain healthcare (4.7 out of 5). Attire of the provider and video background did not influence patient opinion in regard to the quality of care they received. Returning patients were more likely to be satisfied with this modality (4.94 vs 4.73, p = 0.02) compared to new patients.

HYPOTHESIS: Individual risk factors in athletes with shoulder instability who are managed nonoperatively can be integrated into a scoring system that can predict successful return to sport. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4. METHODS: A total of 57 scholastic athletes with primary anterior shoulder instability who were managed nonoperatively were reviewed. Success was defined as a return to index sport at the same level and playing at least 1 subsequent season without missed time as a result of the shoulder. Patient-specific risk factors were individually evaluated, and odds ratios were calculated. A 10-point Nonoperative Injury Severity Index Score (NISIS) incorporated the risk factors for failure. This score was then retrospectively applied with regression analysis and a chi-square analysis to determine the overall optimal score that predicted failure of nonoperative management. RESULTS: In total, 6 risk factors for failure were included in the NISIS: age (>15 years), bone loss, type of instability, type of sport (contact vs noncontact), male sex, and arm dominance. Overall, 79% of patients treated nonoperatively were able to successfully return to sport. Nearly all (97%) low-risk patients (NISIS <7) successfully returned to sport, while only 59% of high-risk patients returned to sport, a relative risk of 12.2 (P = 0.001).

Carbon emission efficiency is an important indicator that can be used to measure progress toward carbon emission reduction targets. The relationship between green technology innovation and carbon emission efficiency has not been adequately studied, and the transmission mechanism is not yet clear. Based on the above research gaps, taking 32 developed countries that have proposed carbon neutral targets as research samples, this paper used spatial econometric models to explore the impact of green technology innovation on carbon emission efficiency and adopted spatial mediation model and spatial moderation model to analyze the transmission effects of economic development, urbanization, and financial development on environment-related green technology and carbon emission efficiency. This paper aimed to provide a policy basis for developed countries to mitigate carbon emissions and achieve carbon neutrality goals as soon as possible. The following results were obtained: (1) Luxembourg, Norway, and Switzerland were found to be efficient in terms of carbon emissions, while most developed countries were in an inefficient state. (2) Environment-related green technology innovation significantly improved carbon emission efficiency. (3) Economic development and urbanization had a mediating role on green technology innovation and carbon emission efficiency. In other words, green technology innovation could have an indirect impact on carbon emission efficiency by influencing economic development and urbanization. (4) Financial development could positively moderate the sensitivity of carbon emission efficiency to green technology innovation. Improving the level of green technology innovation is one way to improve carbon emission efficiency, and the mediating effect of economic development and urbanization can be used as a focus point to improve carbon emission efficiency. The pressure of carbon emission reduction can be moderated by finance development. The results of this study provide theoretical support that will assist developed countries in achieving their carbon neutrality targets.","output":"How green technology innovation affects carbon emission efficiency: evidence from developed countries proposing carbon neutrality targets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Functional exercises is very essential to the recovery of patients with fracture.

METHODS: School-age children with limb fractures treated in our hospital from January 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021 were selected. The characteristics and postoperative functional exercise compliance of included children were analyzed. Pearson correlation and Logistic regression analysis were conducted to analyze the influencing factors of compliance to functional exercises. RESULTS: A total of 328 children with limb fracture were included, the incidence of compliance to functional exercise was only 35.98%. Pearson correlation analysis showed that age(r = 0.707), only child of family(r = 0.537), guardians(r = 0.642) and type of temperament(r = 0.635) were correlated with compliance to functional exercises in school-age children with limb fractures (all p < 0.05).

Starting from the well-known pandemic effect on sleep and dreaming, we presented a picture of dream activity in pharmacologically treated NT1 patients during the Italian lockdown. Forty-three NT1 patients completed a web-survey during Spring 2021 and were compared with 86 matched-controls. Statistical comparisons revealed that: (a) NT1 patients showed greater sleepiness than controls; (b) controls showed higher sleep disturbances than NT1 patients, and this result disappeared when the medication effect in NT1 was controlled; (c) NT1 patients reported higher lucid dream frequency than controls. Focusing on dreaming in NT1 patients, we found that (a) nightmare frequency was correlated with female gender, longer sleep duration, higher intrasleep wakefulness; (b) dream recall, nightmare and lucid dream frequency were positively correlated with sleepiness. Comparisons between low and high NT1 lucid dreamers showed that patients more frequently experiencing lucid dreams reported a greater influence of dreaming during wakefulness, especially concerning problem-solving and creativity. Overall, our results are consistent with previous studies on pandemic dreaming carried out on healthy subjects. Moreover, we confirmed a link between lucidity and creativity in NT1 patients.

Estuarine sediments from the natural clam banks were also analyzed. Viral RNA was detected by RT-qPCR, targeting IP4, E and N1 genomic regions. Positive samples were also subjected to a PMAxx-triton viability RT-qPCR assay in order to discriminate between intact and altered capsids, obtaining indirect information about the viability of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 RNA traces were detected in 9/12 clam samples by RT-qPCR, from which 4 were positive for two different target regions. Viral quantification ranged from <LoQ to 4.48 Log genomic copies/g of digestive tissue. Regarding the sediment samples, 3/12 were positive by RT-qPCR, but only IP4 region was successfully amplificated. Quantification values for sediment samples ranged from <LoQ to 3.60 Log genomic copies/g of sediment.

This is documented most clearly in resource-limited settings, where limited access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and other health-care services contribute to the elevated mortality. The impact of HIV on patients with TB is less clear in resource-rich nations such as the United States. To understand the impact of HIV on the risk for death during TB treatment in the United States, data were analyzed for all culture-positive patients with TB from 1993 to 2008, and the proportion that died was determined and stratified by HIV test result. Mortality data were restricted to patients reported before 2007. The proportion of all patients with TB who died during TB treatment decreased from 2,445 of 13,629 (18%) in 1993 to 682 of 7,578 (9%) in 2006. Among patients with TB and HIV, 950 of 2,337 (41%) died during treatment in 1993; this proportion declined to 131 of 663 (20%) in 2006. The proportion of patients with TB and HIV who received their TB diagnosis postmortem dropped from 191 of 2,927 (7%) in 1993 to 32 of 768 (4%) in 2006; 624 of 10,468 (6%) persons with TB and unknown HIV status received their TB diagnosis postmortem in 1993, and this proportion did not decline.

However, the relationship between COX inhibitor drug indication (prophylactic or therapeutic) and the magnitude of this effect remains unclear. Observations collected in two population pharmacokinetic studies, in preterm neonates, investigating amikacin and vancomycin were used to estimate: i) the impact of ibuprofen administration on the clearance of these drugs; and ii) the difference between prophylactic and therapeutic administration of ibuprofen on this clearance. Prophylactic administration of ibuprofen to preterm neonates on the first day of life to enhance closure of an asymptomatic patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) reduced amikacin clearance by 21% while coadministration of ibuprofen to induce closure of a symptomatic PDA resulted in an 18% reduction in vancomycin clearance in the first month of postnatal life. A significant and clinically relevant reduction in drug clearance is observed when ibuprofen is coadministered independent of indication, postmenstrual or postnatal age.

Enteroviruses have been associated with regional and global epidemics, recently, including with severe disease (Enterovirus A71 and D68), and are of interest as emerging viruses. Here, we typed Enterovirus A-D (EV) from central nervous system (CNS) and respiratory infections in Viet Nam. METHODS: Data and specimens from prospective observational clinical studies conducted between 1997 and 2010 were used. Species and serotypes were determined using type-specific RT-PCR and viral protein 1 or 4 (VP1, VP4) sequencing. RESULTS: Samples from patients with CNS infection (51 children C 10 CSF and 41 respiratory/rectal swabs) and 28 adults (28 CSF) and respiratory infection (124 children C 124 respiratory swabs) were analysed. Twenty-six different serotypes of the four Enterovirus species (A-D) were identified, including EV-A71 and EV-D68. Enterovirus B was associated with viral meningitis in children and adults. Hand, foot and mouth disease associated Enteroviruses A (EV-A71 and Coxsackievirus [CV] A10) were detected in children with encephalitis. Diverse serotypes of all four Enterovirus species were found in respiratory samples, including 2 polio-vaccine viruses, but also 8 CV-A24 and 8 EV-D68. With the exception of EV-D68, the relevance of these viruses in respiratory infection remains unknown. CONCLUSION: We describe the diverse spectrum of enteroviruses from patients with CNS and respiratory infections in Viet Nam between 1997 and 2010. These data confirm the global circulation of Enterovirus genera and their associations and are important for clinical diagnostics, patient management, and outbreak response.

Methods: Our study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04252885, named ELACOI), was an exploratory randomized (2:2:1) controlled trial assessing the efficacy and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) or arbidol monotherapy for treating patients with mild/moderate COVID-19. Findings: This study successfully enrolled 86 patients with mild/moderate COVID-19, with 34 randomly assigned to receive LPV/r, 35 to arbidol, and 17 with no antiviral medication as control. Baseline characteristics of the three groups were comparable. The primary endpoint, the rate of positive-to-negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, was similar between groups (all p > 0.05). There were no differences between groups in the secondary endpoints, the rates of antipyresis, cough alleviation, or improvement of chest computed tomography (CT) at days 7 or 14 (all p > 0.05). At day 7, 8 (23.5%) patients in the LPV/r group, 3 (8.6%) in the arbidol group, and 2 (11.8%) in the control group showed a deterioration in clinical status from moderate to severe/critical (p = 0.206). Overall, 12 (35.3%) patients in the LPV/r group and 5 (14.3%) in the arbidol group experienced adverse events during the follow-up period. No apparent adverse event occurred in the control group.

This study evaluates the implementation of this pathway in terms of postoperative complications and patient satisfaction. Materials and Methods: Observational, retrospective, uni-centric study comparing two care pathways: traditional hospitalization versus outpatient care, for a total mastectomy associated or not with an axillary lymph node procedure. In the outpatient care, a teleconsultation by the coordinating nurses (IDEC) was performed the day after the surgery (D1 postoperative). Patient satisfaction in the outpatient care protocol was assessed by means of a satisfaction questionnaire sent by e-mail, in person or by telephone. Results: Between January 2020 and March 2021, 314 total mastectomies, without immediate breast reconstruction, associated or not with an axillary lymph node procedure, were performed at CLB. Thirty-six patients (11.46%) benefited from the outpatient program. We matched them in age and ASA score with 36 patients who underwent total mastectomy in traditional hospitalization during the same period. The complication rate in our cohort was 54.2%, 30.6% of which were lymphoceles. The postoperative complication rate and the revision surgery rate were not significantly different between the 2 groups (p=0.509, p=0.614). Five patients (13.9%) in the outpatient protocol were converted to traditional hospitalization. No patient in the outpatient program was rehospitalized for a surgical complication. In 66.7% of cases, the teleconsultation on D1 post-operation was carried out between the patient, the IDEC and the nurse in the patient's home who was responsible for the rest of the management. The patients in the outpatient protocol responded to the satisfaction questionnaire in 83.3% of cases. The overall satisfaction rate was rated at 4 or 5 out of 5 in 72.2% of cases. Patients would recommend the outpatient program to a relative in 90% of cases. Conclusions: Our study highlights the feasibility of outpatient total mastectomy, with good patient satisfaction.

However, these reports have downplayed or failed to distinguish potential effects on taste, ignored chemesthesis, generally lacked quantitative measurements, and were mostly restricted to data from single countries. Here, we report the development, implementation and initial results of a multi-lingual, international questionnaire to assess self-reported quantity and quality of perception in three distinct chemosensory modalities (smell, taste, and chemesthesis) before and during COVID-19. In the first 11 days after questionnaire launch, 4039 participants (2913 women, 1118 men, 8 other, ages 19-79) reported a COVID-19 diagnosis either via laboratory tests or clinical assessment. Importantly, smell, taste and chemesthetic function were each significantly reduced compared to their status before the disease. Difference scores (maximum possible change {+/-}100) revealed a mean reduction of smell (-79.7{+/-}28.7, mean{+/-}SD), taste (-69.0{+/-}32.6), and chemesthetic (-37.3{+/-}36.2) function during COVID-19. Qualitative changes in olfactory ability (parosmia and phantosmia) were relatively rare and correlated with smell loss. Importantly, perceived nasal obstruction did not account for smell loss. Furthermore, chemosensory impairments were similar between participants in the laboratory test and clinical assessment groups. These results show that COVID-19-associated chemosensory impairment is not limited to smell, but also affects taste and chemesthesis. The multimodal impact of COVID-19 and lack of perceived nasal obstruction suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection may disrupt sensory-neural mechanisms.","output":"More than just smell - COVID-19 is associated with severe impairment of smell, taste, and chemesthesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the postoperative outcomes and evaluate the success predictors of phacoemulsification with Kahook Dual Blade goniotomy for cataract and glaucoma management in eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma. METHODS: This was a retrospective, non-comparative; inter ventional case series in which all patients with primary open-angle glaucoma who underwent phacoemulsification with Kahook Dual Blade goniotomy between June 2018 and April 2019 were enrolled. All the participants had a minimum follow-up period of 6 months. Preoperative and postoperative intraocular pressure values (at 1, 3, and 6 months), number of antiglaucoma medications, best-corrected visual acuity, surgical complications, and any subsequent related events or procedures were recorded. A logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the association between the different variables and surgical outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 47 patients (57 eyes) were included (mean age, 70.5  7 years). The mean intraocular pressure was reduced from 15.5  4.2 mmHg to 12.2  2.4 mmHg at the last follow-up visit (p<0.001). The mean number of antiglaucoma medications decreased significantly from 1.9  1.0 to 0.6  1.0 during the same period (p<0.001). On the basis of the predefined criterion (intraocular pressure reduction 20% and/or reduction 1 medication), the 6-month success rate was 86%. A higher preoperative intraocular pressure value (odds ratio [OR]= 2.01; p=0.016) and greater percentage of initial (30 days) intraocular pressure reduction (OR= 1.02; p=0.033) were sig nificantly associated with surgical success. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that phacoemulsification with Kahook Dual Blade goniotomy is an effective and safe alternative for cataract management in eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma that positively impacts intraocular pressure control and medication burden. Eyes with higher baseline intraocular pressure and a more pronounced initial response to the procedure appeared to present better outcomes at 6 months.

Postherpetic neuralgia can occur anywhere on the body but often follows acute herpes zoster occurring in trigeminal and brachial plexus dermatomes. An analysis was conducted to determine whether the anatomic location of lidocaine patch 5% is associated with variations in effectiveness or tolerability in patients with postherpetic neuralgia. METHODS This was a post hoc analysis by anatomic site of patch placement (head [including neck], trunk [chest, abdomen, back, hips], and extremities [arm, leg]) of a 4-week, multicenter, open-label study that enrolled patients with persistent pain following herpes zoster infection. Effectiveness was measured by Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) average pain intensity (0 [no pain] to 10 [worst imaginable pain]) and the BPI subscale for pain relief (0% [no relief] to 100% [complete relief]). Tolerability was assessed on the basis of patient-reported adverse events. RESULTS Of 332 enrolled patients (59.6% women [n = 198]; 92.5% white [n = 307]; mean [standard deviation] age, 71.2 [13.9] years), those (n = 203) who applied lidocaine patch 5% to a single anatomic site only and had baseline and postbaseline pain score data were analyzed (trunk, n = 130; head, n = 41; extremities, n = 32). The frequency of adverse events differed significantly by anatomic location, with significantly more adverse events reported with patch placement on the head versus the extremities (P = 0.006) or trunk (P = 0.02). BPI average pain improved significantly from baseline in each of the three anatomic areas (mean score decrease, 1.50-2.04; P  0.002), with no significant difference in effectiveness by patch location.

OBJECTIVE The sequential introduction of severe measures, intentionally aiming at reducing the number of new infections, also imposes sharp restrictions on populations with potentially unintended, detrimental effects on public mental health. METHOD We used observational data reflecting the number of phone calls made to national crisis hotlines in Austria and Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic (January 2020-April 2020) to investigate the impact of government restrictions as well as their later revocations on public mental health. Importantly, both countries have comparable health care systems, are similar in their political and socio-economic idiosyncrasies, and took similar restrictive government measures in order to contain COVID-19-but implemented them at different points in time. RESULTS Analysis indicated that the number of crisis hotline calls increased in both countries. This increase seemed to occur at around the same time as the implementation of restrictive governmental responses. Importantly, the revocation of these governmental restrictions (i.e., re-opening the economy, allowing more social contact) seemed to occur at around the same time as the decrease in the number of calls.

Based on reported statistics (prevalence of a biomarker and its associated outcome, and/or an odds/risk ratio relating these two), seven of these could be adopted in a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN), providing the probability of disturbed allostasis in any given elder. Additional statistical analyses showed that changes in IL-6 and BMI contributed the most to a disturbed allostasis, indicating their prognostic potential in relation to deteriorating health in otherwise generally healthy elderly. In this way, and despite the natural decline in variance that irrevocably alters the prognostic relevance of most allostatic (bio)markers with aging, it appeared possible to outline an allostatic load index specifically for the elderly.

CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that PET/CT is a sensitive modality to hypothesize SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in patients with cancer, even when asymptomatic. More data are needed to verify the correlation among immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, clinical evolution, and PET results. Under the strict safety measures implemented at the PET center, the number of potentially SARS-CoV-2Cpositive patients undergoing PET/CT was very low (1.6%), and no staff member has been diagnosed with infection as of April 30, 2020.","output":"Unknown SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia detected by PET/CT in patients with cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It can be an exciting and positive thing to realize an Indonesian-style building in a location from certain ethnic groups like the Karo Batak Notably, suppose they collaborated with social empowerment where they live so that the diversity of Indonesias ethnic groups will be more colorful in cooperating or working together or in the Sisampat-sampati in Karo Language In that case, this can be built by creating approaches for developing the character of ethnic groups and in person Developing the character of a person or ethnic group in Indonesia will make the Indonesian people better in the future, because in principle, these characters are formed from many national cultures, such as respect for nature and others Indonesia is very friendly or likes to communicate and interact, so that the use of social media in Indonesia can be said to be very broad and the third largest for several types of social media However, whether this has excellent implications for increasing the quality of life or significant quality of life is still a big question especially Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) number 13, climate change However, with a hypothesis that mutual character building is the right answer, the researcher is pleased to provide input from a broader view of character development itself and architecture This will undoubtedly bring significant changes to the nation in the future This paper is a conceptual article or literature study and input from several journals","output":"Environmental friendly Jambur building relevance in Karo Batak communities and gotong-royong/sisampat-sampati communities in Covid-19 pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Extensive work has demonstrated an age-related decline in face recognition, but the nature and the extent of aging-related alterations in face representations remain unclear.

I also explore how these two market characteristics interplay in regional small business credit markets. Using the U.S. county-level data, I find that greater banking market concentration reduces the number of PPP loans per business, but the negative effect is diminished by a greater presence of community banks.

The most common features are purported to be fever and a new persistent cough, although the global prevalence of these symptoms remains unclear. The aim of this systematic review is to determine the prevalence of symptoms associated with COVID-19 worldwide. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, medRxiv and bioRxiv on 5th April 2020 for studies of adults (>16 years) with laboratory test confirmed COVID-19. No language or publication status restrictions were applied. Data were independently extracted by two review authors into standardised forms. All datapoints were independently checked by three other review authors. A random-effects model for pooling of binomial data was applied to estimate the prevalence of symptoms, subgrouping estimates by country. I2 was used to assess inter-study heterogeneity. RESULTS: Of 851 unique citations, 148 articles were included which comprised 24,410 adults with confirmed COVID-19 from 9 countries. The most prevalent symptoms were fever (78% [95% CI 75%-81%]; 138 studies, 21,701 patients; I2 94%), a cough (57% [95% CI 54%-60%]; 138 studies, 21,682 patients; I2 94%) and fatigue (31% [95% CI 27%-35%]; 78 studies, 13,385 patients; I2 95%).

To detect RVF virus (RVFV) infection, indirect immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) which utilize recombinant RVFV nucleocapsid (RVFV-N) protein as assay antigen, have reportedly been used, however, there is still a need to develop more sensitive and specific methods of detection. METHODS: RVFV-N protein was expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) and purified by histidine-tag based affinity chromatography. This recombinant RVFV-N (rRVFV-N) protein was then used as antigen to develop an IgG sandwich ELISA and IgM capture ELISAs for human sera. Ninety six serum samples collected from healthy volunteers during the RVF surveillance programme in Kenya in 2013, and 93 serum samples collected from RVF-suspected patients during the 2006C2007 RVF outbreak in Kenya were used respectively, to evaluate the newly established rRVFV-N protein-based IgG sandwich ELISA and IgM capture ELISA systems in comparison with the inactivated virus-based ELISA systems. RESULTS: rRVFV-N protein-based-IgG sandwich ELISA and IgM capture ELISA for human sera were established. Both the new ELISA systems were in 100% concordance with the inactivated virus-based ELISA systems, with a sensitivity and specificity of 100%. CONCLUSIONS: Recombinant RVFV-N is a safe and affordable antigen for RVF diagnosis. Our rRVFV-N-based ELISA systems are safe and reliable tools for diagnosis of RVFV infection in humans and especially useful in large-scale epidemiological investigation and for application in developing countries.","output":"Comparison of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay systems using rift valley fever virus nucleocapsid protein and inactivated virus as antigens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has led to a global pandemic that has disrupted all sectors of society.

Urgent studies to identify new antiviral drugs, repurpose existing drugs, or identify drugs that can target the overactive immune response are ongoing. Antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) have been tested in past human coronavirus infections, and also against SARS-CoV-2, but a trial of lopinavir and ritonavir failed to show any clinical benefit in COVID-19. However, there is limited data as to the course of COVID-19 in people living with HIV, with some studies showing a decreased mortality for those taking certain ARV regimens. We hypothesized that ARVs other than lopinavir and ritonavir might be responsible for some protection against the progression of COVID-19. Here, we used chemoinformatic analyses to predict which ARVs would bind and potentially inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) or RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp) enzymes in silico. The drugs predicted to bind the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro included the protease inhibitors atazanavir and indinavir. The ARVs predicted to bind the catalytic site of the RdRp included Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors, abacavir, emtricitabine, zidovudine, and tenofovir.

Infection with COVID-19 has been associated with coagulopathy and inflammation. This prothrombotic state has been identified in the literature as an indicator of poor prognosis and those with COVID-19 who receive anticoagulation therapy may have better outcomes. Due to this prothrombotic state, patients who are currently receiving anticoagulation therapy for other indications prior to infection with COVID-19 may have better outcomes. METHODS: This was a retrospective case control study conducted at an inner city hospital. Patients were eligible if they were hospitalized between March 15, 2020 and May 15, 2020 and had confirmed infection due to COVID-19. Patients were matched by age, sex, body mass index (BMI), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by chronic kidney disease (CKD) state. This study evaluated morality in patients who were receiving long term anticoagulation therapy prior to infection with COVID-19 compared to those who were not. RESULTS: Of the 436 patients hospitalized with confirmed infection due to COVID-19, 400 were eligible for analysis. Twenty-two were on anticoagulation therapy prior to admission. Among those patients, 68% were male and 32% were female. The majority of the patients were greater than 60 years of age (82%). Comorbidities were present in 21 patients and were as follows: HTN (95%), CKD (67%), DM (57%), obesity (36%). Of the 22 patients, five expired due to COVID-19 infection compared to 52 patients from the 149-patient matched cohort [z-score 1.13, p = 0.26; odds ratio (OR) 1.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69C4.71].

Current pandemic is also characterized by surge in hospitalizations which has overwhelmed even the most resilient health systems. Therefore, it is imperative to assess health system preparedness in tandem with need projections for comprehensive outlook. OBJECTIVE: We attempted this study to forecast the need for hospital resources for one year period and correspondingly assessed capacity and tipping points of Indian health system to absorb surges in need due to COVID-19. METHODS: We employed age-structured deterministic SEIR model and modified it to allow for testing and isolation capacity to forecast the need under varying scenarios. Projections for documented cases were made for varying degree of containment and mitigation strategies. Correspondingly, data on health resources was collated from various government records. Further, we computed daily turnover of each of these resources which was then adjusted for proportion of cases requiring mild, severe and critical care to arrive at maximum number of COVID-19 cases manageable by health care system of India. FINDINGS: Our results revealed pervasive deficits in the capacity of public health system to absorb surge in need during peak of epidemic. Also, model suggests that continuing strict lockdown measures in India after mid May 2020 would have been ineffective in suppressing total infections significantly. Augmenting testing of 1,500,000 tests per day during projected peak (mid-Sept) under social-distancing measures and current test to positive rate of 9.7% would lead to more documented cases (60, 000, 000 to 90, 000, 000) leading to surge in demand for hospital resources. A minimum allocation of 13x, 70x and 37x times more acute care beds, severe care beds and mechanical ventilators respectively would be required to commensurate with need under that scenario. However, if testing capacity is limited to 9,000,000 tests per day (current situation as of 19th August 2020) under continued social-distancing measures, documented cases would plummet significantly, still requiring 5x, 31x and 16x times the current allocated resources (acute care beds, severe care beds and mechanical ventilators respectively) to meet unmet need for COVID-19 treatment in India.","output":"Capacity-need gap in hospital resources for varying mitigation and containment strategies in India in the face of COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic first reported in Wuhan, China, several research on the psychological impact of the pandemic on patients with Crohns disease (CD) have been conducted. However, with the progression of the global pandemic and the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant, follow-up studies need to be performed to monitor the alterations of psychological status and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among CD patients. Aims We aimed to evaluate the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant on the mental health and life quality among the CD population and tried to explore potent risk factors. Methods This observational study included 153 CD patients who responded to our pre-designed self-reported questionnaire. Demographic, clinical, and psychological information were collected and analyzed. Results Quite a number of CD patients were confronted with different levels of anxiety and depression, with incidence of 28.10 and 31.37% for anxiety and depression, respectively. Compared with non-pandemic circumstances, the life quality of CD patients due to the present situation was more often compromised. Isolation [odds ratio (OR): 4.71, P = 0.007] was verified as a risk factor for anxiety while use of telemedicine could help relieve anxiety (OR: 0.22, P < 0.001). Worsening of symptoms (OR: 4.92, P = 0.006), isolation (OR: 5.75, P = 0.005), and drug withdrawn (OR: 2.66, P = 0.026) were identified to be independent factors for developing depression. Likewise, use of telemedicine (OR: 0.13, P < 0.001) was negatively related to depression. Considering life quality, vaccination (OR: 3.07, P = 0.021) together with no medication (OR: 7.73, P = 0.010) was relevant to better life quality while worsening of symptoms (OR: 0.09, P = 0.034) were an independent risk factor for impaired life quality. Conclusion Many CD patients suffered from symptoms of anxiety and depression and impaired life quality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Those in isolation or with worsening of symptoms and drug withdrawn were more prone to experience psychological stress. Individualized management such as drug delivery and telemedicine should be promoted to maintain control of mental health and life quality during the pandemic.","output":"Impact of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant on the Psychological States and Health-Related Quality of Life in Patients With Crohns Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Tocilizumab was approved for chimeric antigen receptor TCcell therapy induced cytokine release syndrome and it may provide clinical benefit for selected COVIDC19 patients. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed hypoxic COVIDC19 patients who were consecutively admitted between March 13, 2020 and April 19, 2020. Patients with lung infiltrates and elevated inflammatory markers received a single dose of tocilizumab if no contraindication was present. Systemic steroid, hydroxychloroquine, and azithromycin were concomitantly used for majority of the patients. FINDINGS: Of the 51 patients included for analysis, 28 (55%) received tocilizumab and 23 (45%) did not receive tocilizumab. Tocilizumab cohort required more invasive ventilation (68% vs. 22%) at baseline and during entire hospitalization (75% vs. 48%). The median time to clinical improvement in tocilizumab vs. no tocilizumab cohorts was 8 days (Interquartile range [IQR]: 625 C 975 days) vs. 13 days (IQR: 975 C 1525 days) among patients who required mechanical ventilation at any time (Hazard ratio for clinical improvement: 183, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 057 C 584) and 65 days vs. 7 days among all patients (Hazard ratio for clinical improvement: 114, 95% CI: 055 C 238), respectively. The median duration of vasopressor support and invasive mechanical ventilation were 2 days (IQR: 175 C 425 days) vs. 5 days (IQR: 4 C 8 days), p = 0.039, and 7 days (IQR: 4 C 14 days) vs. 10 days (IQR: 5 C 15 days) in tocilizumab vs. no tocilizumab cohorts, p = 0.11, respectively.

On the multivariate analysis, the use of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (AOR 0.502, 95%CI 0.309-0.815, p=0.005) and angiotensin receptor blockers (AOR 0.454, 95%CI 0.274-0.759, p=0.003) were independent protectors against in-hospital mortality whereas the use of acetylsalicylic acid was associated with higher in-hospital mortality (AOR 1.761, 95%CI 1.092-2.842, p=0.020). Other antidiabetic drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and statins showed neutral association with in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: We found important differences between cardiometabolic drugs and in-hospital mortality in older patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus hospitalized for COVID-19. Preadmission treatment with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers could reduce in-hospital mortality; other antidiabetic drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and statins seem to have a neutral effect; and acetylsalicylic acid could be associated with excess mortality.","output":"Cardiometabolic therapy and mortality in very old patients with diabetes hospitalized due to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Genetic variations in the COVID-19 virus are one of the main causes of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in 2020 and 2021.

Specifically, we model the evolution of susceptible S and removed R populations by ODEs and the infected I population by a MDE comprised of a probability vector field (PVF) and a source term. In addition, the ODEs for S and R contains terms that are related to the measure I. We establish analytically the well-posedness of the coupled ODE-MDE system by using generalized Wasserstein distance.

To manage the serviceable inventory, we implement a proportional order-up-to (POUT) replenishment policy. In this context, we first analyse the system efficiency by assessing its capacity to meet customer demand in a cost-effective manner. To this end, we consider both inventory performance (i.e., the balance between inventory holding and stock-out costs) and production smoothness (by measuring the Bullwhip effect in the supply chain). Second, we investigate the system resilience to demand volatility. In particular, we explore the impact of demand shocks on the inventory and production of the closed-loop system. Interestingly, we find that tuning the POUT controller to optimise efficiency may be problematic in terms of resilience to demand shocks. In this sense, a key trade-off exists that needs to be carefully considered by supply chain managers. Linking efficiency to resilience in such supply chains thus becomes essential to strengthen the transition towards more circular economic models. All in all, our analysis, via control-theoretic and simulation techniques, provides professionals with valuable insights into how to identify the appropriate formula for building both efficient and resilient closed-loop supply chains.","output":"Examining the balance between efficiency and resilience in closed-loop supply chains"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We examined the influencing factors of the undermet care needs of the Chinese disabled oldest old people when their children are both caregivers and are themselves older people.

CR3022 is a SARS-CoV neutralizing antibody to a highly conserved epitope on the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the spike protein that can cross-react with SARS-CoV-2, but with lower affinity. Using x-ray crystallography, mutagenesis, and binding experiments, we illustrate that of four amino acid differences in the CR3022 epitope between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, a single mutation P384A fully determines the affinity difference. CR3022 does not neutralize SARS-CoV-2, but the increased affinity to SARS-CoV-2 P384A mutant now enables neutralization with a similar potency to SARS-CoV. We further investigated CR3022 interaction with the SARS-CoV spike protein by negative-stain EM and cryo-EM. Three CR3022 Fabs bind per trimer with the RBD observed in different up-conformations due to considerable flexibility of the RBD. In one of these conformations, quaternary interactions are made by CR3022 to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of an adjacent subunit.

This systematic review aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of Re Du Ning in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). METHODS: We searched seven databases (PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, SinoMed, CNKI, WanFang, and the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry) up to November 1, 2021, to identify randomized controlled trials of Re Du Ning for AECOPD. Two researchers independently carried out literature screening and data extraction. Effects were measured by risk ratios (RRs) or mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The meta-analysis was completed by RevMan 5.4 software. RESULTS: Twenty-six studies met the eligibility criteria, with a total of 2284 patients. The findings of the meta-analysis indicated that the response rate of the experimental group was higher than that of the control group: RR = 1.14% and 95% CI: (1.09, 1.19). Significantly greater improvements in pulmonary function: FEV1: MD = 0.28 L, 95% CI: (0.20, 0.36); FEV1/FVC: MD = 8.63%, 95% CI: (4.68, 12.59); T-lymphocyte counts: CD4: MD = 6%, 95% CI: (2.44, 9.56); CD3: MD = 10.42%, 95% CI: (8.6, 12.24); CD4/CD8: MD = 0.38%, 95% CI: (0.32, 0.43); acid/base imbalance: PH: MD = 0.05, 95% CI: (0.01, 0.10); PaO2: MD = 9.02 mmHg, 95% CI: (11.11, 0.10), p=0.005; C-reactive protein: MD = ?6.65 mg/L, 95% CI: (?10.97, ?2.34); and PCT: MD = ?0.28 g/L, 95% (CI: ?0.41, ?0.15) were observed in patients receiving Re Du Ning compared with those receiving the control treatment.

Chronic adversity such as discrimination or racism as trauma may perpetuate health inequities in marginalized populations. There is a growing body of the literature on trauma informed and culturally competent care as essential elements of promoting health equity, yet no prior review has systematically addressed trauma informed interventions. The purpose of this study was to appraise the types, setting, scope, and delivery of trauma informed interventions and associated outcomes. METHODS We performed database searches- PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, SCOPUS and PsycINFO-to identify quantitative studies published in English before June 2019. Thirty-two unique studies with one companion article met the eligibility criteria. RESULTS More than half of the 32 studies were randomized controlled trials (n = 19). Thirteen studies were conducted in the United States. Child abuse, domestic violence, or sexual assault were the most common types of trauma addressed (n = 16). While the interventions were largely focused on reducing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (n = 23), depression (n = 16), or anxiety (n = 10), trauma informed interventions were mostly delivered in an outpatient setting (n = 20) by medical professionals (n = 21). Two most frequently used interventions were eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (n = 6) and cognitive behavioral therapy (n = 5). Intervention fidelity was addressed in 16 studies. Trauma informed interventions significantly reduced PTSD symptoms in 11 of 23 studies. Fifteen studies found improvements in three main psychological outcomes including PTSD symptoms (11 of 23), depression (9 of 16), and anxiety (5 of 10). Cognitive behavioral therapy consistently improved a wide range of outcomes including depression, anxiety, emotional dysregulation, interpersonal problems, and risky behaviors (n = 5). CONCLUSIONS There is inconsistent evidence to support trauma informed interventions as an effective approach for psychological outcomes. Future trauma informed intervention should be expanded in scope to address a wide range of trauma types such as racism and discrimination.

Thus, it is necessary to determine dominating factors affecting the interannual variability of the carbon sink to improve our capability of predicting future terrestrial carbon sinks. Using global datasets derived from machine-learning methods and process-based ecosystem models, this study reveals that the interannual variability of the atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD) was significantly negatively correlated with net ecosystem production (NEP) and substantially impacted the interannual variability of the atmospheric CO2 growth rate (CGR). Further analyses found widespread constraints of VPD interannual variability on terrestrial gross primary production (GPP), causing VPD to impact NEP and CGR. Partial correlation analysis confirms the persistent and widespread impacts of VPD on terrestrial carbon sinks compared to other environmental variables. Current Earth system models underestimate the interannual variability in VPD and its impacts on GPP and NEP.

The present study aimed to evaluate retrospectively the clinical and chest CT findings of COVID-19 and to analyze CT findings and determine their relationships with clinical severity. METHODS: Chest CT and clinical features of 271 COVID-19 patients were assessed. The presence of CT findings and distribution of parenchymal abnormalities were evaluated, and CT patterns were classified as bronchopneumonia, organizing pneumonia (OP), or diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). Total extents were assessed using a visual scoring system and artificial intelligence software. Patients were allocated to two groups based on clinical outcomes, that is, to a severe group (requiring O2 therapy or mechanical ventilation, n = 55) or a mild group (not requiring O2 therapy or mechanical ventilation, n = 216). Clinical and CT features of these two groups were compared and univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent prognostic factors. RESULTS: Age, lymphocyte count, levels of C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin were significantly different in the two groups. Forty-five of the 271 patients had normal chest CT findings. The most common CT findings among the remaining 226 patients were ground-glass opacity (98%), followed by consolidation (53%). CT findings were classified as OP (93%), DAD (4%), or bronchopneumonia (3%) and all nine patients with DAD pattern were included in the severe group. Uivariate and multivariate analyses showed an elevated procalcitonin (odds ratio [OR], 2.521; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.001-6.303, P = 0.048), and higher visual CT scores (OR, 1.137; 95% CI, 1.042-1.236; P = 0.003) or higher total extent by AI measurement (OR, 1.048; 95% CI, 1.020-1.076; P < 0.001) were significantly associated with a severe clinical course.

DESIGN: A modified 2-step Delphi process was used to generate consensus statements. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The Delphi panel consisted of 21 US and Canadian post-acute and long-term care experts in clinical medicine, administration, and patient care advocacy. METHODS: State and federal reopening statements were collected in June 2020 and the panel voted on these using a 3-point Likert scale with consensus defined as &#8805;80% of panel members voting \\"Agree.\\" The consensus statements then informed development of the visitor guidance statements.

The stock of FFP-2/3 masks, protective suits, face shields, safety glasses, and medical face masks were mostly considered completely insufficient or insufficient, whereas disposable gloves and disinfectants were considered sufficient or completely sufficient. The stock of PPE was significantly positively associated with PP and had the largest effect on PP across all models;the association of the knowledge of a pandemic plan was significant but considerably smaller. PPE scores did not vary considerably in their explanatory power. The assessment of a pandemic plan as beneficial did not significantly affect PP. Conclusions An adequate stockpile of PPE is essential for perceived pandemic preparedness among GPs. Pandemic plans are considered less important for GPs. General practitioners, health authorities, and policy makers should focus on stockpiling PPE for future pandemic emergencies. Key messages Sufficient stockpiled personal protective equipment is the most important factor influencing pandemic preparedness of general practitioners in Germany. Knowledge on a pandemic plan has a subordinate effect on pandemic preparedness of general practitioners;usefulness of a pandemic plan does not have a significant effect.","output":"Predictors of perceived pandemic preparedness among general practitioners"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mushrooms have a long history of uses for their medicinal and nutritional properties. They have been consumed by people for thousands of years. Edible mushrooms are collected in the wild or cultivated worldwide. Recently, mushroom extracts and their secondary metabolites have acquired considerable attention due to their biological effects, which include antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-obesity, and immunomodulatory activities. Thus, in addition to phytochemists, nutritionists and consumers are now deeply interested in the phytochemical constituents of mushrooms, which provide beneficial effects to humans in terms of health promotion and reduction of disease-related risks. In recent years, scientific reports on the nutritional, phytochemical and pharmacological properties of mushroom have been overwhelming. However, the bioactive compounds and biological properties of wild edible mushrooms growing in Southeast Asian countries have been rarely described. In this review, the bioactive compounds isolated from 25 selected wild edible mushrooms growing in Southeast Asia have been reviewed, together with their biological activities.

We designed a study to assess the feasibility and acceptability of integrating TPT into CARGs among key stakeholders, including CARG members, in Zimbabwe. We conducted 45 key informant interviews (KII) with policy makers, implementers, and CARG leaders; 16 focus group discussions (FGD) with 136 PLHIV in CARGs; and structured observations of 8 CARG meetings. KII and FGD were conducted in English and Shona. CARG observations were conducted using a structured checklist and time-motion data capture. Ninety six percent of participants supported TPT integration into CARGs and preferred multi-month TPT dispensing aligned with ART dispensing schedules. Participants noted that the existing CARG support systems could be used for TB symptom screening and TPT adherence monitoring/support. Other perceived advantages included convenience for PLHIV and decreased health facility provider workloads. Participants expressed concerns about possible medication stockouts and limited knowledge about TPT among CARG leaders but were confident that CARGs could effectively provide community-based TPT education, adherence monitoring/support, and TB symptom screening provided that CARG leaders received appropriate training and supervision. These results are consistent with findings from pilot projects in other African countries that are scaling up both differentiated service delivery for HIV and TPT and suggest that designing contextually appropriate approaches to integrating TPT into less-intensive HIV treatment models is an effective way to reach people who are established on ART but who may have missed out on access to TPT.","output":"Acceptability of Community-Based Tuberculosis Preventive Treatment for People Living with HIV in Zimbabwe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pregnancy and the postpartum period represent a condition characterized by a thrombotic predisposition.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: It was a cross-sectional online survey. There were 35 questions in total, divided into sections of knowledge of COVID-19, practices of personal protective equipment (PPE), and knowledge of implications of COVID-19 in dental treatment. Both convenience sampling and snowball sampling were used, so that maximal participation could be ensured. The results were analyzed using descriptive statistics and making comparisons among various groups. The data were summarized as proportions and percentages (%). All the associations were tested using the Chi-square test, ANOVA, and Pearson's correlation coefficient. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 19.0. RESULTS: 26.8% of respondents had a high knowledge, 61.5% had good knowledge, 10.1% had low knowledge, and 6 (1.5%) had nil knowledge about COVID-19. No significant association was found between qualification and knowledge level among the respondents (P = 0.053). Both graduates and postgraduates had low knowledge regarding effective PPE components (P = 0.053), donning (P = 0.888), and doffing (P = 0.745). Only 52.9% of postgraduates and 43.7% graduates answered correctly about the sequence of donning, and 47.9% of postgraduates and 46.1% of graduates had knowledge regarding correct doffing sequence of PPE. Furthermore, knowledge was low regarding the implications of COVID-19 in dental treatment. CONCLUSION: Although the dentists were found to have high/good knowledge scores regarding COVID-19, there was a lack of knowledge regarding hand hygiene, proper use of PPE, and implications of COVID-19 in dental treatment.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for remote services delivery, courts made a rapid pivot to provide technology-based solutions for access to court processes. In 2020, when the courts closed to the public, and many lawyers started working from home, some counties among the 58 that comprise the California state court system continued to allow electronic filings. Analysis of court record data shows that debt collectors continued to file new cases even though e-filing was not available to unrepresented parties and the courts were closed for in-person services.

A blocking-ELISA was used to study to what extent antibodies in convalescent sera interfered with the binding of monoclonal antibodies (MAB) 57.16 or 57.110 to the attenuated TGEV/Purdue virus. Monoclonal antibody 57.16 is directed against the A site on the peplomer, neutralizes virus, and recognizes TGEV and PRCV. Monoclonal antibody 57.110 is directed against the X site on the peplomer, but does not neutralize virus, and recognizes only TGEV. Antibodies directed against TGEV and PRCV could be detected in a blocking ELISA, using MAB 57.16 as a conjugate. Antibodies directed against both viruses were detectable as early as 1 week after inoculation. Antibody titers correlated well with those in a virus-neutralization test. Antibodies against TGEV could be detected in a blocking ELISA, using MAB 57.110 as a conjugate. Such antibodies were not induced by a PRCV infection. In the blocking ELISA, using MAB 57.110 as a conjugate, antibodies were detectable as early as 2 weeks after inoculation. There was a significant difference between antibody titers reached after infection with various TGEV strains, however. This difference is ascribed to a variation of the antigenic site defined by MAB 57.110 in TGEV strains.

A randomized trial was conducted to evaluate perioperative (30-day) safety and 1-year results. METHODS Sixty patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 50-60 kg/m(2) were randomized to LRYGB or LDS. BMI, percentage of excess BMI lost, complications and readmissions were compared between groups. RESULTS Patient characteristics were similar in the two groups. Mean operating time was 91 min for LRYGB and 206 min for LDS (P < 0.001). One LDS was converted to open surgery. Early complications occurred in four patients undergoing LRYGB and seven having LDS (P = 0.327), with no deaths. Median stay was 2 days after LRYGB and 4 days after LDS (P < 0.001). Four and nine patients respectively had late complications (P = 0.121). Mean BMI at 1 year decreased from 54.8 to 38.5 kg/m(2) after LRYGB and from 55.2 to 32.5 kg/m(2) after LDS; percentage of excess BMI lost was greater after LDS (74.8 versus 54.4 per cent; P < 0.001).

Although many zoonotic transmissions occur on industrial-scale factory farms, public discussions mainly blame wild animal (\\"wet\\") markets or focus on reactionary solutions, posing a psychological obstacle to preventing future pandemics. In two pre-registered studies early in the 2020 pandemic, we examined whether British adults fail to recognize factory farming in causing epidemics, and whether such dismissal represents motivated cognition. Cross-sectional data (Study 1, N = 302) confirmed that people blame factory farms and global meat consumption less than wild animal trade and consumption or lack of government preparedness, especially among meat-committed persons. Experimental exposure (Study 2, N = 194) to information blaming factory farms (vs. wild animal markets) produced lower endorsement of preventive solutions than of reactionary solutions, which was exacerbated among meat-committed persons. These findings suggest that people, especially those highly committed to eating meat, willfully disregard solutions targeting animal agriculture and global meat consumption to prevent future pandemics precisely because such solutions implicate their dietary habits.

The advancement in molecular methods creates an opportunity for the adoption of alternative surveillance systems, such as wastewater-based epidemiology. This study presents the use of conventional and advanced polymerase chain reaction techniques (droplet digital PCR) to determine the occurrence and concentration of total mycobacteria and members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) in treated and untreated wastewater. Wastewater samples were taken from three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the city of Durban, South Africa, known for a high burden of TB/MDR-TB due to HIV infections. All untreated wastewater samples contained total mycobacteria and MTBC at varying percentages per WWTP studied. Other members of the MTBC related to tuberculosis infection in animals, M. bovis and M. caprae were also detected. The highest median concentration detected in untreated wastewater was up to 4.9 (0.2) Log10 copies/ml for total mycobacteria, 4.0 (0.85) Log10 copies/ml for MTBC, 3.9 (0.54) Log10 copies/ml for M. tuberculosis, 2.7 (0.42) Log10 copies/ml for M. africanum, 4.0 (0.29) Log10 copies/ml for M. bovis and 4.5 (0.52) Log10 copies/ml for M. caprae. Lower concentrations were detected in the treated wastewater, with a statistically significant difference (P-value  0.05) in concentrations observed. The log reduction achieved for these bacteria in the respective WWTPs was not statistically different, indicating that the treatment configuration did not have an impact on their removal. The detection of M. africanum in wastewater from South Africa shows that it is possible that some of the TB infections in the community could be caused by this mycobacterium.

This is a cluster-randomized trial of a multi-component public health intervention. 36 community health centre (CHC) areas will be selected as study locations and randomly allocated to intervention and control arms (1:1). PPs in the intervention areas will be identified using a mapping exercise and recruited into the study if they are eligible and consent. They will receive a tailored intervention package including in-person education about TB management along with bimonthly electronic refreshers, context-specific selection of referral pathways, and access to a TB-reporting app developed in collaboration with the National TB programme.

Recently, antiviral aloe anthraquinones had been reported against human influenza virus. In the present work two anthraquinones, aloesaponarin-I (1) and aloesaponarin-II (2) were isolated from A. vera roots, and six derivatives were obtained by methylation (3), acetylation (4) and O-glycosyl (5-6) reactions starting from (1). Additionally, a new Tetra-O-acetyl--d-glucopyranosyl derivative from 2 was also prepared. All compounds were evaluated against two strains of influenza virus AH1N1 by cytopathic effect reduction assay (CPE). The antiviral activity was determined by the ability of compounds to inhibit virus replication on Madin Darby Canine Kidney cells (MDCK). New derivatives 3-(2,3,4,6-Tetra-O-acetyl--d-glucopyranosyl-aloesaponarin-I (5) and 3-(2,3,4,6-Tetra-O-acetyl--d-glucopyranosyl- aloesaponarin-II (7) showed a cytopathic reduction effect against influenza strain A/Yucatn/2370/09 with IC(50) of 30.77 and 13.70 M, and against the virus A/Mexico/InDRE797/10 with IC(50) of 62.28 and 19.47 M, respectively.

In the light of current discussions on the vaccinations of children it seems necessary to better identify children who are immune against SARS-CoV-2 due to a previous infection and to better understand COVID-19 related immune reactions in children. Methods: In a cross-sectional design, children aged 1C17 were recruited through primary care pediatricians for the study (a) randomly, if they had an appointment for a regular health check-up or (b) if parents and children volunteered and actively wanted to participate in the study. Symptoms were recorded and two antibody tests were performed in parallel directed against S (in house test) and N (Roche Elecsys) viral proteins. In children with antibody response in either test, neutralization activity was determined. Results: We identified antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in 162 of 2,832 eligible children (5.7%) between end of May and end of July 2020 in three, in part strongly affected regions of Bavaria in the first wave of the pandemic. Approximately 60% of antibody positive children (n = 97) showed high levels (>97th percentile) of antibodies against N-protein, and for the S-protein, similar results were found. Sufficient neutralizing activity was detected for only 135 antibody positive children (86%), irrespective of age and sex. Initial COVID-19 symptoms were unspecific in children except for the loss of smell and taste and unrelated to antibody responses or neutralization capacity. Approximately 30% of PCR positive children did not show seroconversion in our small subsample in which PCR tests were performed. Conclusions: Symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infections are unspecific in children and antibody responses show a dichotomous structure with strong responses in many and no detectable antibodies in PCR positive children and missing neutralization activity in a relevant proportion of the young population.","output":"Symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies, and Neutralization Capacity in a Cross Sectional-Population of German Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The performance of the Roche Elecsys?

The disease caused by this virus is named as Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), reported first time in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. It had spread to almost all countries of the world disrupting the health and economy of many countries. It was the recent zoonotic spillover disease reported in humans from the Coronavirus group, without proper medicine and non-existence of prior immunity, this disease posed a challenge to both the scientific and medical fraternity. The search for safe, effective drugs to treat the disease and vaccines against the causative agent SARS- CoV-2 had begun all over the world with public and private partnerships. Many countries are part of the solidarity trail for identifying the effective drugs, clinical trials and vaccines for this global pandemic. Here in this review, we are focussing on the different vaccine production platforms being used in the preparation of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, their current status and prospects. Vaccine production technology significantly advanced in recent times by imbibing the cutting edge technologies such as nucleic acid based technologies such as DNA/RNA/Codon deoptimization and availability of safe and effective viral vectors produced through rDNA technology. The availability of complete genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2, geared up for the production of vaccine candidates based on these new vaccine production platforms, and in a record time of 4-5 months, these vaccine candidates entered in human clinical trials for the evaluation of safety and efficacy. Prior knowledge on SARS and MERS-CoV's structural and genomic features, vaccine production platforms used in making vaccines against them greatly augmented in the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine efforts. As per World Health Organization (WHO) a total of202 vaccine candidates are under developing for SARS-CoV-2, among them 47 entered in clinical trials and 156 are in the preclinical stage. These vaccines are prepared by an amalgamation of both new and old traditional vaccine production platforms such as nucleic acid base platforms, inactivated, live attenuated, recombinant viral vectors, protein and peptide-based vaccines. The success of these vaccine candidates lies in the generation of effective immune response for SARS-CoV-2 across all age groups and people with co-morbidities. We briefly summarize the different strategies of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine production and their prospects with an emphasis on different routes of administration and added a basic mathematical model depicting the importance of vaccination for any pandemic.","output":"Prospects of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and their landscape.

We reviewed the literature about the practice and effectiveness of the rehabilitation of the female pelvic floor dysfunction via telehealth regarding symptomatology and quality of life and function of pelvic floor muscles (PFM). METHODS: A bibliographic review was carried out in May 2020 in the databases: Embase, Medline/PubMed, LILACS and PEDro. A total of 705 articles were reviewed after the removal of duplicates. The methodological quality of the articles was evaluated by the PEDro scale. Two authors performed data extraction into a standardized spreadsheet. RESULTS: Four studies were included, two being randomized controlled trials. Among the RCTs, only one compared telehealth with face-to-face treatment; the second one compared telehealth with postal treatment. The other two studies are follow-up and cost analysis reports on telehealth versus postal evaluation. Data showed that women who received the intervention remotely presented significant improvement in their symptoms, such as reducing the number of incontinence episodes and voiding frequency, improving PFM strength and improving quality of life compared to women who had the face-to-face treatment.

Only studies on RATs that did not need a separate reader for result retrieval and that reported data on viral load, patients' symptom status, sample type, and PCR assay used were included. RESULTS: 19 studies utilizing 11,109 samples with 2,509 RT-PCR-positives were included. RAT sensitivity varied between 28.9% (95% CI 16.4-44.3) and 98.3% (95% CI 91.1-99.7), likely dependent upon population characteristics, viral load, and symptom status.

Approximately 10% of NUT carcinomas contain an NSD3::NUTM1 fusion. NUT carcinomas manifest as poorly differentiated or undifferentiated squamous carcinomas, and 33% show areas of mature squamous differentiation. Only exceptionally have NUT carcinomas shown histology discordant from poorly differentiated/undifferentiated squamous carcinoma, and a thyroid NUT carcinoma with histologic thyrocyte differentiation has not been described to date. Our patient's tumor exhibited mixed cytologic features suggestive of squamoid cells or papillary thyroid carcinoma cells. Overt squamous differentiation was absent, and the tumor produced colloid in poorly formed follicles. Immunophenotypically, the carcinoma was consistent with thyrocyte differentiation with expression of monoclonal PAX8, TTF1, and thyroglobulin (the last predominantly in extracellular colloid). There was zero to < 2% reactivity for proteins typically diffusely expressed in NUT carcinoma: p40, p63, and cytokeratins 5/6. NUT protein expression was equivocal, but fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed a NUTM1 rearrangement. This exceptional case suggests that NUTM1 fusions may occur in an unknown number of aggressive thyroid carcinomas, possibly with distinctive histologic features but with thyrocyte differentiation.

The majority of the respondents of the online questionnaire (65.5%, 707/1,078) answered that they could see themselves reporting clinical observations of their equine. The multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that French-speaking equine owners and those belonging to the positive attitude cluster are more likely to report to a CBS tool. Equi-Commun operated between October 2018 and December 2019 yet received only four reports. With the addition of qualitative interviews, we identified three critical, interlinked issues that may have led to the non-use of Equi-Commun within the Swiss equine community: (1) for successfully implementing CBS, the need for surveillance within the community of interest must be given; (2) the respective population under surveillance, here the equine, needs to show enough clinical cases for owners to be able to maintain the memory of an existing tool and its possible use; and (3) targeted and high effort communication of the system is key for its success. While CBS relying only on lay animal owners, complementary to existing surveillance systems, could potentially provide a good proxy of timely surveillance data, it is questionable whether the added value of generated surveillance knowledge is in balance with efforts necessary to implement a successful system. With this study, we showcased both the potential and challenges of CBS in animal health, as this may be of relevance and guidance for future initiatives.","output":"Potential and Challenges of Community-Based Surveillance in Animal Health: A Pilot Study Among Equine Owners in Switzerland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Recent studies show adverse right atrial (RA) emptying pattern is prognostic for clinical worsening events in pediatric pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). No study has reported changes in RA emptying over time or evaluated whether serial measurements offer further prognostic information. METHODS: Prospective study of 32 children with idiopathic or heritable PAH undergoing echocardiogram at baseline and 1-year. RA conduit fraction percent (RA cF%) was measured as percentage of total diastolic RA area change prior to the electrical p wave. Clinical worsening was analyzed with a predefined composite adverse event outcome. RESULTS: Longitudinal subjects (median age 13.3a?yr) had RA cF% 61% (IQR 32-68%) at baseline and 60% (IQR 35-73%) at 1-year (NS). 11 subjects had a qualifying event during median 21-month follow-up. Subjects with an event had 1-year RA cF%a?=a?33% (IQR 20-40%) compared to 72% (IQR 63-75%) for those with no event (pa?<a?0.001). Event rates were lowest for subjects with both echocardiograms showing RA cF%a?>a?60% (0%), highest for subjects with neither (80%), and intermediate for those with one (38%, pa?=a?0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Changes in RA cF% inform risk of adverse events in pediatric PAH.

We aim to provide a systematic review and meta-analysis on the prevalence of NOAF in patients with sepsis, and its impact on in-hospital mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality. Methods: PubMed and EMBASE were systematically searched on 26 December 2021. Studies reporting on the prevalence of NOAF and/or its impact on in-hospital mortality or ICU mortality in patients with sepsis or septic shock were included. The pooled prevalence and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated, as well as the risk ratios (RR), 95%CI and 95% prediction intervals (PI) for outcomes. Subgroup analyses and meta-regressions were performed to account for heterogeneity. Results: Among 4988 records retrieved from the literature search, 22 articles were included. Across 207,847 patients with sepsis, NOAF was found in 13.5% (95%CI: 8.9C20.1%), with high heterogeneity between studies; significant subgroup differences were observed, according to the geographical location, study design and sample size of the included studies. A multivariable meta-regression model showed that sample size and geographical location account for most of the heterogeneity. NOAF patients showed an increased risk of both in-hospital mortality (RR: 1.69, 95%CI: 1.47C1.96, 95%PI: 1.15C2.50) and ICU mortality (RR: 2.12, 95%CI: 1.86C2.43, 95%PI: 1.71C2.63), with moderate to no heterogeneity between the included studies. Conclusions: NOAF is a common complication during sepsis, being present in one out of seven individuals.

Methods: This study used data from the NHANES (2001-2010). Cox regression was used to analyze the relationship between Serum 25(OH)D, cadmium, CRP, and all-cause, cause-specific mortality. We used restricted cubic splines to explore the dose-response relationship between serum 25(OH)D, cadmium, CRP, and all-cause mortality. Results: During a mean follow-up of 9.1 years, the study included 20,221 participants, 2,945 people with diabetes, and 17,276 people without diabetes. Compared with serum 25(OH)D deficiency group in diabetic patients, the sufficient serum 25(OH)D group was associated with lower all-cause mortality (HR = 0.41, 95%CI 0.28-0.60, P < 0.001) and cardiovascular mortality (HR = 0.46, 95%CI 0.22-0.95, P = 0.04).

Overall, from 24 March to 30 April, 3138 subjects (21.8%) reported COVID-19-like symptoms, and 219 (1.5%) fever above 38.5C; 217 subjects performed at least one swab. Of these, 46 were positive (21.3% of those performed, 0.3% of the total). The frequency of any symptom was similar in women and men, but fever above 38.5C was lower in women (multivariate odds ratio (OR) = 0.65, 95% confidence interval, CI, 0.49-0.85).

Analysis of geographic pattern of mutational profiling for the whole genome reveals differences between each continent. A transition mutation from C to T represents the most mutation types across the genome, suggesting rapid evolution and adaptation of the virus in host. Amino acid (AA) deletions and insertions found across the genome results in changes in viral protein length and potential function alteration.

Organizations offering long-term care for older adults are expected to provide person-centered care (PCC) in a complex context, with older adults aging in place and participating in society for as long as possible, staff shortages and the slow adoption of technological solutions. To address these challenges, these organizations increasingly use scientific knowledge to evaluate and innovate long-term care. This paper describes how co-creation, in the sense of close, intensive, and equivalent collaboration between science, care practice, and education, is a key factor in the success of improving long-term care for older adults. Such co-creation is central in the Academic Collaborative Center (ACC) Older Adults of Tilburg University. In this ACC, Tilburg University has joined forces with ten organizations that provide care for older adults and CZ zorgkantoor to create both scientific knowledge and societal impact in order to improve the quality of person-centered care for older adults.

Two experiments compared structural priming in dialogues between native British English speakers and (i) other native British English speakers, (ii) native speakers of North American English, and (iii) non-native speakers of English, to assess to what extent interlocutor characteristics influence structural convergence in dialogue. Our findings suggest that rates of structural convergence depend both on a speaker's pre-existing structural biases for particular verbs, and their perception of (linguistic or social) similarity to their interlocutor. This suggests that low-level mechanisms underlying structural convergence may be mediated by beliefs about how interlocutors are socially situated with respect to each other.

This was embedded within ambiguous loss type 2 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, e.g. social distancing and quarantine practices led to physical estrangement from others and ambiguity ensued about when, or if, estrangement would end before resulting in death. Further, the coping mechanisms defined in the ambiguous loss framework: restructuring identity, finding meaning, gaining mastery, increasing ambivalence capacity, reframing attachments, and gaining hope, were compromised due to overarching ambiguous loss attributed to the pandemic. Continued panic and frustration regarding lack of communication with and access to the memory care center instilled a sense of being locked out of caregiving. Findings suggest dementia caregivers may experience both types of ambiguous loss compounded during the Covid-19 pandemic, suspending grief and coping processes, and inciting poorly understood needs and challenges that must be better understood to support dementia caregivers.","output":"Locked Out of Caregiving: A Case Study of Dementia Caregiving During the Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In mid-December 2019, a novel atypical pneumonia broke out in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and was caused by a newly identified coronavirus, initially termed 2019 Novel Coronavirus and subsequently severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of 19 May 2020, a total of 4,731,458 individuals were reported as infected with SARS-CoV-2 among 213 countries, areas or territories with recorded cases, and the overall case-fatality rate was 6.6% (316,169 deaths among 4,731,458 recorded cases), according to the World Health Organization. Studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is notably similar to (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) SARS-CoV that emerged in 2002C2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that spread during 2012, and these viruses all contributed to global pandemics. The ability of SARS-CoV-2 to rapidly spread a pneumonia-like disease from Hubei Province, China, throughout the world has provoked widespread concern. The main symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) include fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue and lower respiratory signs. At present, nucleic acid tests are widely recommended as the optimal method for detecting SARS-CoV-2. However, obstacles remain, including the global shortage of testing kits and the presentation of false negatives. Experts suggest that almost everyone in China is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to date, there are no effective treatments. In light of the references published, this review demonstrates the biological features, spread, diagnosis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 as a whole and aims to analyse the similarities and differences among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV to provide new ideas and suggestions for prevention, diagnosis and clinical treatment.","output":"A comparison of COVID-19, SARS and MERS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.3389/fpubh.2020.589359.].","output":"Corrigendum: Anxiety and Depression Among People Under the Nationwide Partial Lockdown in Vietnam"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 outbreak is associated with mental health implications during viral infection and at short-term follow-up.

Psychiatric clinical interview, self-report questionnaires, and neuropsychological profiling of verbal memory, working memory, psychomotor coordination, executive functions, attention and information processing, and verbal fluency were performed. Three months after discharge from the hospital, 35.8% still self-rated symptoms in the clinical range in at least one psychopathological dimension. We observed persistent depressive symptomatology, while PTSD, anxiety, and insomnia decreased during follow-up. Sex, previous psychiatric history, and the presence of depression at one month affected the depressive symptomatology at three months. Regardless of clinical physical severity, 78% of the sample showed poor performances in at least one cognitive domain, with executive functions and psychomotor coordination being impaired in 50% and 57% of the sample. Baseline systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), which reflects the immune response and systemic inflammation based on peripheral lymphocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts, predicted self-rated depressive symptomatology and cognitive impairment at three-months follow-up; and changes of SII predicted changes of depression during follow-up. Neurocognitive impairments associated with severity of depressive psychopathology, and processing speed, verbal memory and fluency, and psychomotor coordination were predicted by baseline SII. We hypothesize that COVID-19 could result in prolonged systemic inflammation that predisposes patients to persistent depression and associated neurocognitive dysfunction.

Insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) exerts a variety of biological effects. However, the role of IGF-1 in myocarditis remains unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS LDL-R knockout mice were randomly divided into the control group, myocarditis group, and IGF-1 siRNA group. Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Western blot were used to measure IGF-1 expression in myocardial tissue. The myocardial tissue changes were analyzed by HE staining. The total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) in each group were detected. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the number of macrophages. The secretion of TNF- and INF- and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS Compared with the control group, IGF-1 expression, TC, and LDL in myocarditis group was significantly increased, along with decreased heart rate (HR), left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVEDs), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDd), and left ventricular mass index (LVMI). In addition, inflammatory cell infiltration, fibrosis, and macrophages number in the peritoneum were increased. Moreover, the secretion of TNF-, INF-, and MIF was also significantly increased (p<0.05). However, IGF-1 siRNA treatment inhibited IGF-1 expression and reversed the changes in the myocarditis group with statistically significant differences compared with the myocarditis group (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS IGF-1 expression is increased in myocarditis. The downregulation of IGF-1 expression inhibits macrophages infiltration, reduces the expression of MIF and inflammatory factors, and improves myocarditis injury.","output":"IGF-1 affects the development of myocarditis in LDL-R knockout mice by inhibiting peritoneal infiltration of macrophages."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, Non-Pharmaceutical and Pharmaceutical treatments were alternative strategies for governments to intervene.

To our knowledge, no nationwide investigation has been carried out to determine the actual extent of infection in the general population. METHODS: A total of 1308 random serum samples were collected from the general population in Taiwan in 2010. The antibody-captured enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to detect DENV-specific IgM and IgG. Demographics data were used for risk analysis. RESULTS: The weighted overall seroprevalence was 1.96% for anti-DENV IgM, and 3.4% for anti-DENV IgG, respectively. A significant rise of DENV IgG seropositive rate had been noted since late adulthood stage, from 1.1% at the age group of 50C59 years to 7.6% at the age group of 60C69 years. For people aged over 70 years, the seropositive rate reached 19%. Age, nationality, and regions of residency were associated with the IgG seropositivity. There was no statistically significant difference in seroprevalence of anti-Dengue IgM, indicating recent infection, among univariate predictors we proposed, including gender, age, residency, nationality, and household size. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that the majority of population in Taiwan born after 1940 is naive to dengue virus and the prevalence of IgG antibody against dengue virus rises with age.

Robotic surgery for rectal cancer has several advantages over conventional surgery in performing precise dissection and was proved to be safe and effective in previous studies. However, comparison between laparoscopic and robotic rectal resection has drawn contradictory results. The aim of the present study was to compare robotic and laparoscopic sphincter-saving rectal resections for short-term and pathological outcomes. METHODS Between January 2013 and May 2016, we performed a total of 258 robotic surgeries, including 146 colorectal resections (56%). For this study, we included the first 65 sphincter-saving robotic resections and compared them to the last 65 consecutive laparoscopic resections. The laparoscopic group was constituted by the last 65 consecutively operated patients who matched the inclusion criteria. RESULTS Patients' baseline characteristics were similar in both the groups. Conversion rate was greater in the laparoscopic group (17 vs. 5%, p=0.044). Reoperation rate, overall and severe morbidity, and median hospital stay were similar in both the groups. Quality of mesorectal excision specimen was considered complete or near complete in 97 and 96% in the laparoscopic and robotic groups, respectively. There was no difference in the rates of negative circumferential radial margin, distal margin, and surgical success measured by composite criteria.

Uncertain load and generation, and line outages during contingency conditions of electric power systems should be properly and efficiently dealt with. Lately, lockdown situations because of COVID-19 pandemic have greatly influenced energy demands in many areas in the World. Vulnerable operation of power networks, especially in either isolated microgrids or large-scale smart grids can be significantly avoided through proposing optimal reconfigurable network. In this paper, employing the distribution network (DN) reconfiguration is deeply studied for achieving fault-tolerance and fast recovery to reliable configurable DN in smart grids. Since radiality is among crucial properties of DN topology, searching for feasible configuration of DN is NP-hard optimization problem. Therefore, the recent Manta Ray Foraging Optimization (MRFO) is considered for solving such DN optimization instance. Performance of MRFO is examined against two common optimizers: the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and the Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO). Different operating conditions for both the IEEE 33-bus and IEEE 85-bus systems are analysed using these optimization techniques. The goal is to search for feasible reconfigured DN with the minimum power losses and the optimal enhanced voltage profile. Simulation results reveal that the proposed MRFO approach provides efficient and outstanding behaviour in various operation scenarios. The efficiency and the robustness of the proposed MRFO approach are verified, the power loss reduction ratio ranges between 21% and 41% in different studied scenarios and adequate voltage profile enhancement is achieved. ? 2021","output":"Optimal reconfiguration for vulnerable radial smart grids under uncertain operating conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in uncertainty and negative psychological outcomes for patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases for several reasons. It is essential to understand the level of anxiety among rheumatic disease patients at the current situation of COVID-19.

Results: The survey was sent to 2987 patients, there were 933 responses, and 581 were complete (male = 175). Complete responses were considered for data analysis. Rheumatoid arthritis was the most frequent (50.6%) diagnosis followed by other conditions. Most of the patients (43%) were on combination disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug therapy, 12.7% of patients were on biological drugs, and 23.9% of patients were on glucocorticoids (GCs). Statistically significant higher anxiety scores were observed in females (8.79  9.3), fibromyalgia patients (19.78  14.8), patients on GCs (9.26  8.8), and biological agents (10.65  10.6). Difficulty in meeting rheumatologists and getting medications was expressed by 327 (56.2%) and 73 (29.7%) respondents, respectively.

However, it is unclear how, and under what conditions, perceived discrimination relates to relative deprivation, a subjective cognition and affective experience in which individuals or groups perceive themselves as disadvantaged, compared to their peers. Therefore, this study aimed to construct a moderated mediation model to examine the roles of locus of control and duration since migration in the relationship between perceived discrimination and relative deprivation among Chinese rural-to-urban migrant adolescents. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study using a convenience sampling method in three coastal cities in southeast China. We recruited 625 Chinese rural-to-urban migrant adolescents, who completed a battery of questionnaires assessing perceived discrimination, relative deprivation, locus of control, and demographic variables. Regression-based statistical mediation and moderation were conducted using the PROCESS macro for SPSS. RESULTS: After controlling for sex and age, perceived discrimination was positively associated with migrant adolescents relative deprivation, and external locus of control partially mediated this connection. Furthermore, the mediating effect was moderated by the duration of the migration. In relatively recently migrated adolescents, perceived discrimination was significantly related to relative deprivation through a greater external locus of control; however, this indirect association was not significant for adolescents with long-term migratory duration. CONCLUSION: The results of our analysis expand our understanding of the link between perceived discrimination and relative deprivation. Moreover, these findings may provide practical guidance for interventions among Chinese rural-to-urban migrant adolescents to raise their social status and improve their mental health by addressing the macro-social psychological causes of relative deprivation.","output":"Perceived discrimination and relative deprivation in Chinese migrant adolescents: the mediating effect of locus of control and moderating effect of duration since migration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A worldwide event like the 2020 Coronavirus outbreak can only reinforce the interest in modelling trade diversification as a key factor in countries vulnerability to external shocks.

Main funding source(s): Special Research Fund (BOF), Hasselt University INTRODUCTION: The transportation sector is one of the major sectors influencing climate change, contributing around 16% of total Greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. Aviation contributes to 12% of the transport related emissions. Among other climate change impacts, elevated heat exposure is associated with increased cardiac events and exposure to air pollution caused by GHG emissions has also well-known association with increased cardiovascular related morbidity and mortality. The global temperature rise should be restricted to less than 2 C which requires keeping carbon emission (CO2) less than 2900 billion tonnes by the end of the 21st century. Assuming air travel a major contributing source to GHG, this study aims to raise the awareness about potential carbon emissions reduction due to air travel of international events like a scientific conference. PURPOSE: Due to the global pandemic of COVID-19, the Preventive cardiology conference 2020 which was planned to be held at Malaga Spain, instead was held in virtual online way. This study aims to calculate the contribution of reduced CO2 emissions in tons due to ESC preventive cardiology conference 2020, which was then held online and air travel of the registered participants was avoided. METHODS: Anonymized participant registration information was used to determine the country and city of the 949 registered participants of the Preventive Cardiology conference 2020. It is assumed that participants would have travelled from the closest airports from their reported city locations to Malaga airport, Spain. At first, the closest city airports were determined using Google maps and flights information, then the flight emissions (direct and indirect CO2-equivalent emissions) per passenger for the given flight distances were calculated. The CO2 emissions (tons) were calculated for round trips in economy class from the participants of 68 nationalities (excluding 60 participants from Spain as they are assumed to take other modes of transport than airplane). RESULTS: In total, 1156.51 tons of CO2 emissions were saved by turning the physical conference into a virtual event. This emission amount is equivalent to the annual CO2 production of 108 people living in high-income countries. CONCLUSION: The pandemic situation has forced us to rethink the necessity of trips by air and has shown us the feasibility of digitally organized events.

As of July 2020, there were 8,475 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ethiopia, and a total of 52 cases and 1 death were reported in Debre Berhan where this study was conducted. Under these conditions, we sought to assess what undergraduate students at Debre Berhan University knew about COVID-19 and how it shaped their attitudes and practices regarding this disease. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to assess undergraduate student knowledge, attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 in Debre Berhan University, Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from March 18C24, 2020 among undergraduate students at Debre Berhan University. A two-stage cluster sampling technique was employed with a total sample size of 634. Proportional allocation of samples was used to the randomly selected colleges, and a systematic random sampling technique was employed to recruit the students. The data were checked for completeness, coded, entered into Epi-Data VS 3.1, and then exported into STATA? Version 14 software for analysis. Descriptive statistics were conducted. Binary logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors. Factors were selected with the entry method. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the associations between variables and knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP). RESULTS: From a total of 546 included participants, more than half of them, 307 (57%) were males. Seventy-three percent of them heard about novel coronavirus from social media. In this study, 73.8% of the participants were knowledgeable, and their overall attitude was favorable. Approximately 71.4% correctly responded that the main clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, fatigue, dry cough, and shortness of breath. Nearly half, 229 (42%) of the students approved that they had no concern of being infected with COVID-19. Moreover, most participants showed poor practices; more than half of the study subjects were not maintaining a physical distance. In multivariable analyses, people older than 25 years (AOR = 1.6, 95% CI; 1.2, 4.6) and those who lived in urban areas (AOR = 4.3, 95% CI; 2.6, 15.8) were significantly more knowledgeable about COVID-19. Furthermore, those students that have information about COVID-19 (AOR = 2.3, 95% CI; 1.6, 8.7) was significantly associated with the attitude undergraduate students had about COVID-19 as compared with its counterpart. CONCLUSION: The undergraduate students at Debre Berhan University were moderately knowledgeable about COVID-19 and had an optimistic attitude towards its resolution. However, this optimism may lead to poor public health practices within this community. Therefore, greater efforts need to be made through more comprehensive and directed actions and awareness campaigns to increase the knowledge, attitude and practice of the students.","output":"Assessment of undergraduate student knowledge, attitude, and practices towards COVID-19 in Debre Berhan University, Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 virus has emerged and rapidly evolved into a current global pandemic.

Even with our growing understanding of the cognitive neuroscience of music, the answer to this question remains unclear. One method for conceiving possible representations is to use artificial neural networks, which can provide biologically plausible models of cognition. One could train networks to solve musical problems, and then study how these networks encode musical properties. However, researchers rarely examine network structure in detail because networks are difficult to interpret, and because many assume that networks capture informal or subsymbolic properties. Here we report very high correlations between network connection weights and discrete Fourier phase spaces used to represent musical sets. This is remarkable because there is no clear mathematical relationship between network learning rules and discrete Fourier analysis. That networks discover Fourier phase spaces indicates that these spaces have an important role to play outside of formal music theory. Finding phase spaces in networks raises the strong possibility that Fourier components are possible codes for musical cognition.","output":"Artificial Neural Networks Solve Musical Problems With Fourier Phase Spaces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE The territorial involvement and the clinical benefit of endovascular therapy (EVT) of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) occlusion may vary between patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in isolated posterior cerebral artery occlusions (IPCAOs) and the prognostic factors of EVT. METHODS Forty-eight patients with acute PCA occlusion who underwent EVT between Mar 2008 and Apr 2021 from 2 tertiary centers were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical characteristics, imaging and perfusion abnormalities, and angiographic and clinical outcomes were analyzed. Ischemic changes were assessed with the posterior circulation Acute Stroke Prognosis Early Computed Tomography Score (pc-ASPECTS). Perfusion abnormalities were assessed using automated software for Tmax volume measurement and identification of Tmax involved in PCA eloquent areas. RESULTS The IPCAO sites were P1 (n = 17) and P2 (n = 31). Overall successful recanalization (mTICI 2b/3) was achieved in 68.8% (33/48) and excellent outcome (90-day mRS 0-1) in 52.1% (25/48) of the patients. Excellent/non-excellent outcome was associated with male sex (p = 0.036), admission NIHSS (p = 0.002), pc-ASPECTS (p = 0.035), Tmax > 6 s involvement of the midbrain-thalamus (p = 0.008), first-line stent-retriever thrombectomy (p = 0.036), complete recanalization (p = 0.009), and modified first pass effect (FPE, p = 0.047). Tmax>6 s involvement of the midbrain-thalamus was an independent predictor for non-excellent outcome on multivariable analysis. CONCLUSION Acute stroke from IPCAO may be successfully treated with EVT.

While significant improvements have been made in climate models, they often struggle to simulate local-to-regional extreme rainfall (e.g., MYR). Yet, large-scale climate modes (LSCMs) are relatively well represented in climate models. Since there exists a close relationship between MYR and various LSCMs, it might be possible to develop causality-guided statistical models for MYR prediction based on LSCMs. These statistical models could then be applied to climate model simulations to improve the representation of MYR in climate models. In this pilot study, it is demonstrated that skillful causality-guided statistical models for MYR can be constructed based on known LSCMs. The relevancy of the selected predictors for statistical models are found to be consistent with the literature. The importance of temporal resolution in constructing statistical models for MYR is also shown and is in good agreement with the literature. The results demonstrate the reliability of the causality-guided approach in studying complex circulation systems such as the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). Some limitations and possible improvements of the current approach are discussed. The application of the causality-guided approach opens up a new possibility to uncover the complex interactions in the EASM in future studies.

Light-activated rhodopsin catalyses the exchange of GDP for GTP on multiple transducin molecules. Activated transducin then stimulates cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase by releasing an inhibitory action of the phosphodiesterase -subunits. This leads to a decrease in cGMP levels in the rod, and closure of plasma membrane cationic channels gated by cGMP(1C4). In this and other systems, turn-off of the response requires the GTP bound to G protein to be hydrolysed by an intrinsic GTPase activity(5C7). Here we report that the interaction of transducin with cGMP phosphodiesterase, specifically with its -subunits, accelerates GTPase activity by several fold. Thus the -subunits of the phosphodiesterase serve a function analogous to the GTPase-activating proteins that regulate the class of small GTP-binding proteins. The acceleration can be partially suppressed by cGMP, most probably through the non-catalytic cGMP-binding sites of phosphodiesterase  and -subunits. This cGMP regulation may function in light-adaptation of the photo-response as a negative feedback that decreases the lifetime of activated cGMP phosphodiesterase as light causes decreases in cytoplasmic cGMP.","output":"Regulation of deactivation of photoreceptor G protein by its target enzyme and cGMP"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In their recent analysis, Hanlon et al. estimated the years of life lost (YLL) in people who have died with COVID-19 by following and expanding on the WHO standard approach.

Respiratory illness is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients with the disease spectrum ranging from asymptomatic subclinical infection, to severe pneumonia progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome. There is growing evidence describing pathophysiological resemblance of SARS-CoV-2 infection with other coronavirus infections such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 receptors play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of the virus. Disruption of this receptor leads to cardiomyopathy, cardiac dysfunction, and heart failure. Patients with cardiovascular disease are more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and they are more likely to develop severe symptoms. Hypertension, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy and coronary heart disease are amongst major cardiovascular disease comorbidities seen in severe cases of COVID-19. There is growing literature exploring cardiac involvement in SARS-CoV-2. Myocardial injury is one of the important pathogenic features of COVID-19. As a surrogate for myocardial injury, multiple studies have shown increased cardiac biomarkers mainly cardiac troponins I and T in the infected patients especially those with severe disease. Myocarditis is depicted as another cause of morbidity amongst COVID-19 patients. The exact mechanisms of how SARS-CoV-2 can cause myocardial injury are not clearly understood. The proposed mechanisms of myocardial injury are direct damage to the cardiomyocytes, systemic inflammation, myocardial interstitial fibrosis, interferon mediated immune response, exaggerated cytokine response by Type 1 and 2 helper T cells, in addition to coronary plaque destabilization, and hypoxia.","output":"Myocardial injury and COVID-19: Possible mechanisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The early identification of patients suffering from SARS-CoV-2 infection in primary care is of outmost importance in the current pandemic.

Privacy-centric analysis treats data as private property, frames the relationship between individuals and governments as adversarial, entrenches technology platforms as gatekeepers, and supports a conception of emergency public health authority as limited by individual consent and considerable corporate influence that is in some tension with the more communitarian values that typically inform public health ethics. To overcome the barriers to ethical and effective DCT, and develop infrastructure and policy that supports the realization of potential public benefits of digital technology, a public resource conception of aggregate data should be developed.","output":"Public Goods From Private Data -- An Efficacy and Justification Paradox for Digital Contact Tracing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia has caused great potential problems to the lives and property of people around the world The novel coronavirus pneumonia has the characteristics of strong transmission and wide influence In order to better explore the transmission mechanism of novel coronavirus pneumonia, and realize the detection and early warning of the spread of novel coronavirus pneumonia;this article uses the SIR model to explore the mechanism of the spread of the Novel coronavirus Finally, the network relationship of emergency supplies during the novel coronavirus pneumonia epidemic situation was analyzed ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Transmission mechanism of Novel coronavirus based on SIR model and emergency supplies network's relation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Solving the problem of malaria requires a highly skilled workforce with robust infrastructure, financial backing and sound programme management coordinated by a strategic plan. Here, the capacity of National Malaria Control Programmes (NMCPs) was analysed to identify the strengths and weaknesses underpinning the implementation of vector surveillance and control activities by the core elements of programme capacity, being strategic frameworks, financing, human resources, logistics and infrastructure, and information systems. RESULTS: Across nearly every country surveyed, the vector surveillance programmes were hampered by a lack of capacity and capability. Only 8% of NMCPs reported having sufficient capacity to implement vector surveillance. In contrast, 57%, 56% and 28% of NMCPs had the capacity to implement long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), indoor residual spraying (IRS) and larval source management (LSM) activities, respectively. Largely underlying this was a lack of up-to-date strategic plans that prioritize vector surveillance and include frameworks for decision-making and action. CONCLUSIONS: Strategic planning and a lack of well-trained entomologists heavily hamper vector surveillance. Countries on the path to elimination generally had more operational/field staff compared to countries at the stage of control, and also were more likely to have an established system for staff training and capacity building. It is unlikely that controlling countries will make significant progress unless huge investments also go towards increasing the number and capacity of programmatic staff.","output":"Capacity of National Malaria Control Programmes to implement vector surveillance: a global analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Data regarding antibody responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in patients infected with COVID-19 are not yet available. In this study, we aimed to evaluate serum antibody responses in patients regardless of the outcome. We measured the circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody levels in 60 subjects with a certified history of SARS-CoV-2 infection by using immunoenzymatic, chemiluminescent, and Neutralization assays. Half patients had a severe infection, the other half were pauci-symptomatic. We analyzed their antibody response to see the trend of the humoral response. Our results showed a significant difference in circulating IgG level among the two groups. The neutralizing antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 was significantly higher among those who had severe disease. Furthermore, ten subjects from each group were screened twice, and a declining antibody trend was observed in pauci-symptomatic individuals. These findings provide evidence that humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in pauci-symptomatic people is weak and may not be long-lasting. This may have implications for immunity strategy and prevention, since it is still not clear whether a time-dependent decrease of both circulating and neutralizing antibodies to nonprotective levels could occur in a longer time span and whether potential vaccines are able to induce a herd immunity and a durable response.","output":"Antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in infected patients with different clinical outcome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A healthy patient presented to Klinikum Altmhlfranken Wei?enburg Hospital, Germany, with two\\\\morning attacks of painful muscle spasm in left upper and lower limbs, without altered consciousness.

We, therefore investigated, whether GPCR-fAABs are detectable in 31 patients suffering from different Long-COVID-19 symptoms after recovery from the acute phase of the disease. The spectrum of symptoms was mostly of neurological origin (29/31 patients), including post-COVID-19 fatigue, alopecia, attention deficit, tremor and others. Combined neurological and cardiovascular disorders were reported in 17 of the 31 patients. Two recovered COVID-19 patients were free of follow-up symptoms.

The increasing use of vaccines has elevated the need to establish new manufacturing strategies. One of the major approaches is cell-based production, which creates a need for high cell density to enable higher cell production levels. This has led to development of the technology of cell carriers, including micro and macro cell carriers. To follow the production process, quantifying the number of cells on these carriers is required, as well as the tracking of their viability and proliferation. However, owing to various carriers' unique structures, tracking the cell's is challenging using current traditional assays that were originally developed for monolayers of adherent cells. The current \\"gold standard\\" method is counting cell nuclei, separating cells from the carrier, staining with crystal violet, and visually counting under a microscope. This method is tedious and counts both live and dead cells. A few other techniques were developed but were specific to the carrier type and involved specialized equipment. In this study, we describe a broadly ranging method for counting cells on carriers that was developed and employed as part of the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine. The method is based on the Alamar blue dye, a well-known, common marker for cell activity, and was found to be successful in tracking cell adsorption, cell growth, and viability on carriers. No separation of the cells from the carriers is needed, nor is any specialized equipment; the method is simple and rapid and provides comprehensive details necessary for process control of viral vaccine production in cells.

Mental health difficulties influence students lives, such as academic performance, relationships satisfaction, and quality of life. Moreover, different kinds of obstacles often hinder help-seeking behavior. Such evidence strongly suggests the need to implement prevention and promotion strategies to increase health and well-being in educational contexts. This article presents a study protocol for implementing and evaluating NoiBene, an evidence-based group intervention that aims to promote mental health and well-being, improve a series of transversal competencies (e.g., emotional awareness, commitment to values, assertiveness, goal setting), and decrease dysfunctional transdiagnostic mechanisms (i.e., perfectionism, repetitive thinking, experiential avoidance). A randomized controlled trial will be conducted to evaluate the protocols efficacy. Participants will be assigned to one of the three conditions: the NoiBene Group condition (NB-G), the NoiBene guided web-based condition (NB-WB), or the waiting list condition (WLC). The NB-G intervention consists of six face-to-face group meetings, each dedicated to specific issues related to well-being or vulnerabilities. Every meeting includes an explanation of the theoretical contents, individual and group exercises, and role-plays. The NB-WB intervention covers the same topic addressed in the NB-G intervention. In this case, participants carry out a series of online modules, including theoretical explanations, practical exercises, useful activities, and self-monitoring tools. Students will individually meet the Tutor once every 2 weeks. The primary outcome will include an increase in mental health and well-being. Secondary outcomes will include changes in emotional awareness, assertiveness, perfectionism, rumination, worry, self-criticism, experiential avoidance, and academic performance and satisfaction. We expect that participants in both NoiBene conditions will show these outcomes. However, we hypothesized that the NB-G conditions will be more effective than the NB-WB in improving assertiveness. Besides treatment efficacy, we expect that students can benefit from the NB-G or NB-WB differently based on their specific behavioral and motivational patterns. Outcomes will be assessed at pre-, post-intervention and 6-months follow-up. In conclusion, we believe that NoiBene is a promising tool that can improve students well-being, and it could have positive implications for preventing mental health disorders among students.","output":"NoiBene, a Group Intervention for Promoting Mental Health Among University Students: A Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The United Kingdom entered lockdown on the 23 March 2020 due to the COVID\\\\19 pandemic.

METHOD: A proforma was designed to capture the demographics, presenting complaints, type of dental\\\\facial injury, treatment need and the treatment received for all paediatric patients presenting face to face with dental\\\\facial trauma to King's College Hospital during the lockdown period (23 March\\\\ 14 June 2020). RESULTS: Four hundred and twenty calls were triaged, converting to 102 patients seen face\\\\to\\\\face for dental\\\\facial trauma. The remainder were able to be triaged virtually. Injuries seen included 56 (54.9%) dentoalveolar injuries, 37 (36.2%) lacerations, five (4.9%) suspected facial fractures and four (3.9%) dog bites. Males and females were equally affected. The majority of incidents occurred in the home environment (n = 60, 58.8%), with the remainder (n = 42, 41.2%) occurring outside the home environment. The main causes of dental\\\\facial trauma were falls (n = 47, 46.1%) and bicycles/scooters (n = 29, 28.4%).

In the scramble to adapt to online learning, university professors were overwhelmed with material aimed at facilitating a supportive learning experience and preserving student academic performance in online contexts yet were ill-equipped to cope with the increased volume of mental health issues encountered. Many studies attest to the association between poor mental health and academic performance. It has been shown that students often report their mental health issues to university professors who are called upon to cope with these issues as best they can. This paper outlines strategies undertaken, in the context of a novel undergraduate mental health program, to address emergent mental health issues during Covid-19 student isolation. These practical, cost effective interventions can be used to successfully give voice to ongoing student mental health issues in a post-Covid world and to help professors feel equipped and empowered enough to contribute to stemming the tide of rising rates of mental illness meaningfully, appropriately and professionally.

In delivery of an undergraduate mental health program, the lecturer's expertise, familiarity with students and familiarity with the student's academic and learning environment, needs to be coupled with the expertise of a mental health professional. 2. It is recommended that the undergraduate mental health program includes some of the following: the giving of talks, question and answer sessions, one-on-one informal reviews with the mental health professional, anonymous invitations to share concerns through Padlets, post-it note surveys, anonymous questionnaires, the creation of podcasts or videos, information sheets, online Blackboard posts, panel discussions or more. 3. Padlet walls, post-it note surveys and questionnaires are ideal vehicles for anonymous and voluntarily self-reporting to alleviate shame and stigma issues. 4. Current Mental Health training for lecturers in universities predominantly do not reflect the realities of the classroom and are often ineffective.Integrating key learnings into lectures from the topics discussed by a mental health expert in the mental health program is a strategic way to not only re-inforce the messages but establish a caring and trusting student-teacher relationship","output":"Facilitating a supportive learning experience: The lecturer's role in addressing mental health issues of university students during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Respiratory infections are the most frequent reason for primary health care consultation. The main causes of respiratory tract infections in children are viruses and the most common types are upper respiratory tract infections: common cold, pharyngitis, otitis media and sinusitis. Pneumonia is much more serious. As well as viruses, bacteria are often involved in respiratory tract infections. Three bacterial species are most commonly isolated: Streptococcus pneumoniae, non-encapsulated Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis. The most common bacterial cause of pharyngitis is Streptococcus pyogenes. Bacteria isolated from community-acquired infection usually are sensitive to the majority of suitable drugs, but during the past two decades, significant antibiotic resistance has emerged. Resistance to penicillins has spread among H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae. The mechanism of penicillin resistance in H. influenzae is mainly by production of -lactamases TEM-1 and ROB-1, whereas in S. pneumoniae resistance is an effect of the changes in penicillin binding proteins. Among respiratory pathogens, resistance to tetracyclines, macrolides, trimethoprimCsulphamethoxazole and fluoroquinolones has also appeared. Several mechanisms depending on changes in target, active efflux and modifying enzymes are involved.","output":"Epidemiological aspects of antibiotic resistance in respiratory pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Little has been reported on the yield and characteristics of colorectal neoplasia detected by the two-sample faecal immunochemical test (FIT), particularly the difference between subjects with two-positive results on the two-sample FIT and those with one-positive results. We aimed to assess risk stratification among patients with positive two-sample FIT to prioritise colonoscopy. DESIGN: A retrospective cross-sectional study. SETTING: A single-centre, representative endoscopy clinic in Japan. PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive patients who underwent colonoscopy were enrolled. Indications for colonoscopy included two-positive results on the two-sample FIT (FIT (+/+)), one-positive results on the two-sample FIT (FIT (+/?)), and other reasons (non-FIT group, including presence of symptoms, screening or surveillance). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were detection rates of colorectal cancers, including in situ (all cancers) and invasive cancers, based on the indications for colonoscopy. Secondary outcomes were cancer features, such as location, size, T stage and histological subtype. RESULTS: Of the 8724 patients, 264 underwent colonoscopy following FIT (+/+), 1018 following FIT (+/?) and 7442 for reasons other than positive FIT. Detection rates of all (and invasive) cancers in the FIT (+/+), FIT (+/?) and non-FIT groups were 12.1% (8.3%), 1.9% (0.3%) and 0.4% (0.2%), respectively. The cancer detection rates were much higher in the FIT (+/+) group than in the FIT (+/?) group, which in turn had higher rates than the non-FIT group. Moreover, the FIT (+/+) group showed more advanced T stages on tumour, node, metastasis (TNM) classification (Tis/T1/T2/T3/T4: 10/7/4/10/1) than the FIT (+/?) group (16/1/2/0/0, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Two-positive results for two-sample FIT showed a much higher yield for more advanced colorectal cancers than the one-positive result.

AEC2 dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of pulmonary diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), highlighting the importance of human in vitro models of the alveolar epithelium. However, AEC2-like cells captured in cell culture have yet to be directly compared to their in vivo counterparts at single cell resolution. Here, we apply single cell RNA sequencing to perform head-to-head comparisons between the global transcriptomes of freshly isolated primary (1) adult human AEC2s, their isogenic cultured progeny, and human iPSC-derived AEC2s (iAEC2s) cultured in identical conditions. We find each population occupies a distinct transcriptomic space with both types of cultured AEC2s (1 and iAEC2s) exhibiting similarities to and differences from freshly purified 1 cells. Across each cell type, we find an inverse relationship between proliferative states and AEC2 maturation states, with uncultured 1 AEC2s being most quiescent and mature, their cultured progeny being more proliferative/less mature, and cultured iAEC2s being most proliferative/least mature. iAEC2s also express significantly lower levels of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes compared to 1 cells, suggesting immunological immaturity. Cultures of either type of human AEC2 (1 or iAEC2) do not generate detectable type 1 alveolar cells in these defined conditions; however, iAEC2s after co-culture with fibroblasts can give rise to a subset of cells expressing transitional cell markers recently described in fibrotic lung tissue of patients with pulmonary fibrosis or in mouse models of pulmonary fibrosis. Hence, we provide direct comparisons of the transcriptomic programs of 1 and engineered AEC2s, two in vitro model systems that can be harnessed for studies of human lung health and disease.","output":"Impact of cell culture on the transcriptomic programs of primary and iPSC-derived human alveolar type 2 cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 has caused over 100 million deaths and continues to spread rapidly around the world.

Aim and objectives: We present the demographic and clinical characteristics of lepromatous leprosy (LL) patients who had Covid-19 infection. Materials and methods: This study recruited patients hospitalized in Elazig Leprosy Hospital. Details of the patients were collected as follows: age, gender, presence of comorbidity, leprosy classification, clinical presentation, presence of leprosy reactions and complaints at the time of admission;laboratory and computed tomography (CT) findings and treatments applied. Results: This study included 9 patients with lepromatous leprosy (LL classification). Six patients were PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2, 7 patients had thoracic CT involvement. The mean age was 78.7 years (range 65-95). Complaints on admission included fatigue (n:7), cough (n:4) and fever (n:3) followed by sore throat (n:1), headache (n:1) and dysphonia (n:1). Two patients were asymptomatic, PCR positivity was detected in one and CT positivity was detected in another during screening. All patients received treatment with favipiravir and enoxaparin. No leprosy reactions occurred. All patients were discharged with recovery after completion of treatment. Conclusion: We expected that the risk for catching COVID-19 may be higher in LL patients who have a cellular immunity deficiency, and that the course of the infection may be more severe in COVID-19-infected LL patients, for the same reason. However, we have seen a decrease in the clinical severity of the COVID-19 and no patient losses.

Due to the unstable nature of the virus, leading to the emergence of new variants that are claimed to be more and rapidly transmissible, there is a need for further consideration of the alternative potential pathways of the virus transmissions to provide the needed and effective control measures. This review aims to address this important issue by examining the transmission pathways of SARS-CoV-2 via indirect contacts such as fomites and aerosols, extending to water, food, and other environmental compartments. This is essentially required to shed more light regarding the speculation of the virus spread through these media as the available information regarding this is fragmented in the literature. The existing state of the information on the presence and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in water-food-environmental compartments is essential for cause-and-effect relationships of human interactions and environmental samples to safeguard the possible transmission and associated risks through these media. Furthermore, the integration of effective remedial measures previously used to tackle the viral outbreaks and pandemics, and the development of new sustainable measures targeting at monitoring and curbing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 were emphasized. This study concluded that alternative transmission pathways via human interactions with environmental samples should not be ignored due to the evolving of more infectious and transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants.","output":"Monitoring the presence and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in water-food-environmental compartments: State of the knowledge and research needs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Comorbidities are associated with the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19).

RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes elevation of plasma IL-37. Higher early IL-37 responses correlated with earlier viral RNA negative conversion, chest CT image improvement and cough relief, consequently resulted in earlier hospital discharge.

The COVID-19 disease includes, also damage to other organ systems as well as coagulopathy. The present report describes a case of COVID-19 presenting with acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) and subsequent acute limb ischemia (ALI). PRESENTATION OF CASE: An 84-years old hospitalized female patient presenting diabetes and recent COVID-19 reported acute onset of abdominal pain and typical findings of AMI. The CT-angiography confirmed the AMI secondary to a superior mesenteric artery (SMA) occlusion. The patient was managed through an endovascular approach using a SMA mechanical thrombectomy and stenting with a good result. DISCUSSION: Treatment of this life-threatening condition includes surgical resection of the necrotic bowel, restoration of blood flow to the ischemic intestine and supportive measure - gastrointestinal decompression, fluid resuscitation, hemodynamic support. Endovascular management of AMI is preferred over the standard surgical approach due to a reduced mortality and morbidity rates. Imaging findings of intestinal necrosis, however, represent an indication for AMI surgical treatment with explorative laparotomy. Different endovascular solutions have been employed to address AMI including mechanical thrombectomy, local thrombolysis, and PTA-stenting. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 clinical presentation can be atypical, including gastrointestinal symptoms. If a first embolic event occurs, an aggressive anticoagulation treatment could be inefficient to reduce the risk of subsequent embolization events. The limited life expectancy of such revascularization procedures should orientate towards less invasive treatments.","output":"Staged acute mesenteric and peripheral ischemia treatment in COVID-19 patient: Case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In the general population, mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are highly efficacious. Early reports suggest a diminished antibody response in immunosuppressed adult solid organ transplant (SOT) patients, but this has not been reported in pediatrics. METHODS: Adolescent kidney transplant recipients (KTR) at our center who received both doses of an mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine had SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein antibody presence evaluated 4C8 weeks after their second dose of the vaccine as part of routine clinical care. RESULTS: Thirteen of 25 fully vaccinated patients (52%) had a positive spike antibody. Median age of participants was 19 years old (IQR 18C20) and the median time from transplant was 5 years (IQR 4C9 years). KTR were treated with an immunosuppression regimen including a calcineurin inhibitor, corticosteroid, and antimetabolite (9 with mycophenolate, 3 with azathioprine, and 1 without an antimetabolite due to viremia). Of those who had an antibody response, fewer had a mycophenolate-containing immunosuppressant regimen than non-responders. There was a trend toward better vaccine response and higher anti-S antibody titers at lower doses of mycophenolate. Three patients with prior COVID-19 infection all had a positive antibody response. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest vaccine response in adolescent KRT is lower than that of the general population, but similar to that previously described in adult SOT patients and slightly better than that seen in adult KTR. This data demonstrates vaccination is safe and supports immunizing KTR who remain hesitant. Future studies should focus on better understanding of the cellular immune response to vaccination and strategies to enhance vaccine immunogenicity in pediatric SOT patients.

In this work, we performed a longitudinal analysis of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 proteins in 104 serum samples from 49 critical COVID-19 patients using a peptide-based SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray. Our data show that the binding epitopes of IgM and IgG antibodies differ across SARS-CoV-2 proteins and even within the same protein. Moreover, most IgM and IgG epitopes are located within nonstructural proteins (nsps), which are critical in inactivating the hosts innate immune response and enabling SARS-CoV-2 replication, transcription, and polyprotein processing. IgM antibodies are associated with a good prognosis and target nsp3 and nsp5 proteases, whereas IgG antibodies are associated with high mortality and target structural proteins (Nucleocapsid, Spike, ORF3a).

Objectives. To investigate the impact of lockdown measures on the number of patients who visited a tertiary urban trauma centre. Methods. The period of investigation was from 1 February to 30 June 2020 and was segmented into three intervals: pre-lockdown (February and March 2020), hard lockdown (April and May 2020) and immediately post lockdown (June 2020). The electronic HECTIS health record registry was interrogated for the total number of patients that were seen per month. These were further categorised according to mechanism of injury (stab, gunshot, blunt assault and road traffic injuries). Penetrating (stab and gunshot) and blunt assault victims were collectively grouped as violent trauma. Results. The mean total number of patients seen decreased by 53% during the hard lockdown period. There was a moderate reduction (15%) in patients with gunshot injuries seen during the hard lockdown phase, but there was an 80% increase in the post-lockdown period. The proportion of patients injured in road traffic collisions pre lockdown, hard lockdown and immediate post lockdown was 16.4%, 8.9% and 11.1%, respectively. Patients injured in road traffic collisions decreased by 74% during the hard lockdown period and maintained a reduction of 32% during the immediate post-lockdown period. The mean total number of patients who visited the trauma unit returned to pre-lockdown levels in June. Conclusions. There was an overall trend of reduced number of patients who visited the trauma unit during the hard lockdown period; however, these numbers returned to pre-lockdown levels during the immediate post-lockdown period. The number of road traffic injury admissions remained reduced during all three phases of lockdown, while the number of gunshot victims increased substantially during the post-lockdown period.","output":"The effect of lockdown on intentional and nonintentional injury during the COVID-19 pandemic in Cape Town, South Africa: A preliminary report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Antigen tests have emerged as an alternative to SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic PCR, thought to be valuable especially for the screening of bigger communities. To check appropriateness of the antigen based testing, we determined sensitivity of two point-of-care antigen tests when applied to a cohort of COVID-19 symptomatic, COVID-19 asymptomatic and healthy persons. METHODS: We examined nasopharyngeal swabs with antigen test 1 (Panbio Covid-19 Ag Rapid Test, Abbott) and antigen test 2 (Standard F Covid-19 Ag FIA, SD Biosensor). An additional nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab of the same individual was checked with PCR (Allplex SARS-nCoV-2, Seegene). Within a 4-day period in October 2020, we collected specimens from 591 subjects. Of them, 290 had COVID-19 associated symptoms. RESULTS: While PCR positivity was detected in 223 cases, antigen test 1 and antigen test 2 were found positive in 148 (sensitivity 0.664, 95%CI 0.599, 0.722) and 141 (sensitivity 0.623, 95%CI 0.558, 0.684) patients, respectively. When only symptomatic patients were analysed, sensitivity increased to 0.738 (95%CI 0.667, 0.799) for the antigen test 1 and to 0.685 (95%CI 0.611, 0.750) for the antigen test 2. The substantial drop in sensitivity to 12.9% (95%CI 0.067, 0.234) was observed for samples with the PCR threshold cycle above >30. CONCLUSIONS: Low sensitivity of antigen tests leads to the considerable risk of false negativity. It is advisable to implement repeated testing with high enough frequency if the antigen test is used as a frontline screening tool, and to follow with PCR if it is applied to vulnerable populations.","output":"The sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests in the view of large-scale testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the rapid development of economy and the increasing improvement of agricultural production level, people's demand for fruits is also increasing year by year. China is the largest fruit production and consumption country in the world. According to relevant statistics reported for China, by the end of 2019, the total amount of various fruits sold had reached about 270 million tons, with apples accounting for 48% of the global output and pears accounting for 69% of the national total output. However, China's fruit picking is still dominated by manual picking process, which takes a lot of manpower and time to complete, therefore resulting in low fruit picking efficiency. Some farmers are unable to complete fruit picking in a short time, resulting in a large number of fruits unable to be listed, resulting in huge losses. To solve this problem, this paper focuses on the visual recognition and path planning for intelligent fruit-picking robot. Using robot to complete fruit picking is the best way at present. This paper establishes a picking robot recognition and positioning system based on stereo vision, which is used to identify and locate the fruits planted in the orchard area. The coordinate error of the target point of the intelligent fruit-picking robot coordinate system is less than 10 mm, which has high accuracy. Then, the path of intelligent fruit-picking robot is planned based on visual feedback algorithm and biological stimulation neural network. Our empirical evaluations suggest that the proposed robot walks in the planting park in the shape of \\"zigzag\\" and realizes full-coverage path planning after 6 turns. The results show the efficiency of the intelligent method.

The etiology includes infectious agents (mostly viruses), systemic diseases and toxins. We aim to characterize infants and children with myocarditis at post-mortem presenting as sudden deaths. METHODS Retrospective evaluation of 813 post-mortems in infants and children dying suddenly and unexpectedly between 2009-2019. Data retrieved included histological features, microbiology and clinical history. RESULTS 23 of 813 post-mortems reviewed corresponded to acute myocarditis and 1 to dilated cardiomyopathy related to remote Parvovirus infection. PCR identified enterovirus (7), parvovirus (7 cases, 2 also with HHV6 and 1 case with EVB), Influenza A (1), Parainfluenza type 3 (1). Two cases corresponded to hypersensitivity myocarditis, 1 was Group A Streptococcus and 5 idiopathic myocarditis. Enterovirus was frequent in infants (7/10), and in newborns was associated with meningoencephalitis or congenital myocarditis. More than 50% were less than 2 years of age and all remained clinically unsuspected. CONCLUSION Myocarditis represents almost 3% of all sudden pediatric deaths. Enterovirus and parvovirus were the most common viruses.

Series report that up to 75% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 receive broad-spectrum antibiotics;however, the incidence of bacterial coinfection is consistently reported to be low. The diagnosis of bacterial superinfection of the lungs (BSL) is clinical, which presents the possibility of overdiagnosis and overutilization of antibiotics. The aim of this study was to describe the outcomes of patients who were treated for a bacterial superinfection of the lungs (BSL) compared to those who were not. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of all consecutive patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 hospitalized at our center. We defined BSL as a documented episode of pneumonia treated with antibiotics. We collected information on demographics, comorbidities, and microbiological markers. We compared patients with and without a diagnosis of BSL in terms of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, intubation, length on mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay (LOS) and 7-day and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: Five hundred eighty-two patients had a diagnosis of COVID-19, of which 105 had BSL. Patients with BSL were older compared to those without BSL (mean age 74 vs 70 years) and more likely to be male (57% vs 47%), but they were similar in proportion of White patients (64 vs 63.6) and Charlson comorbidity index (5 vs 4). Patients with BSL had a higher likelihood of admission to the ICU (63% vs 19%) and higher intubation rates (31% vs 9%). BSL patients had longer mechanical ventilation (9 vs 3 days) and greater length of stay (13 vs 7). Only 17 BSL patients had sputum cultures, of which 10 were positive. None of the BSL patients had a positive Legionella urinary antigen or Streptococcus pneumoniae urinary antigen, and only 6/57 (10.5%) had a positive MRSA nasal screen. Seven-day and 30-day mortality were not statistically different between BSL and non-BSL patients (p=0.18, p=0.65 respectively). Interestingly, Cox proportional hazard analysis adjusted for age, sex, race, CCI and ICU stay yielded a significantly reduced mortality at 7 and 30-day among BSL patients (HR=0.2 CI [.1-0.7], p=.0106, HR=0.5 [CI.3-0.8], p=0.0101, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with BSL received more intense supportive care, and had a longer ICU stay, yet did not have a greater mortality. When adjusting for age, sex, race, CCI and ICU, there was a significant reduction in mortality. It is tempting to interpret these finding as an effect of antibiotics;however, we did not record COVID-19-specific treatments such as steroids, tocilizumab and remdesivir. It is likely that the BSL patients received more steroids, which have been associated with reduced mortality. In our population, microbiological testing was performed in a minority of patients, and it was therefore not a reliable marker of true infection. It is possible that many patients in the BSL group did not truly have a bacterial infection. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Patients with a diagnosis of BSL were sicker, but we observed no difference in unadjusted mortality. Studies on the outcomes of the BSL among COVID-19 patients should account for the effect of concurrent COVID-19 specific therapy.

Egypt has been repeatedly affected by RVF epidemics, mainly associated to the importation of animals from sub-Saharan countries, where the disease is endemic. The objective of our study was the improvement of the surveillance and control strategies implemented in Egypt. In order to do that, first we evaluated the legal trade of live animals into and within Egypt. Then, we assessed the risk of Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) transmission within the country using a multi-criteria evaluation approach. Finally, we combined the animal trade and the risk of RVFV transmission data to identify those areas and periods in which the introduction of RVFV is more likely. Our results indicate that the main risk of RVFV introduction is posed by the continuous flow of large number of camels coming from Sudan. The risk of RVFV transmission by vectors is restricted to the areas surrounding the Nile river, and does not vary significantly throughout the year. Imported camels are taken to quarantines, where the risk of RVFV transmission by vectors is generally low. Then, they are taken to animal markets or slaughterhouses, many located in populated areas, where the risk of RVFV transmission to animals or humans is much higher. The measures currently implemented (quarantines, vaccination or testing) seem to have a limited effect in reducing the risk of RVFV introduction, and therefore other (risk-based) surveillance strategies are proposed.","output":"Understanding the legal trade of cattle and camels and the derived risk of Rift Valley Fever introduction into and transmission within Egypt"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, I considered the novel coronavirus pandemic as general as possible from the aspects of emerging risks and the relationship between science and policy For the former, it was proposed to institutionalize mechanisms such as national risk assessments carried out in other countries, and for the latter, to visualize the process from scientific facts to the determination of risk management measures In addition, responding to the novel coronavirus requires the involvement of experts not only from a medical point of view, but also from a behavioral point of view","output":"COVID-19 as an Emerging Risk: How to Bridge the Gap between Science and Policy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although few reports have described methods for cleaning endoscopes that can be used during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many reports have been published on personal protection and caution during endoscopic procedures.

The cytokine storm during influenza virus infection, whereby the amplified innate immune response is primarily responsible for pulmonary damage, has been well characterized. Now we describe a novel event where virus-specific T cells induce a cytokine storm. The paramyxovirus pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) is a model of human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV). Unexpectedly, when C57BL/6 mice were infected with PVM, the innate inflammatory response was undetectable until day 5 postinfection, at which time CD8(+) T cells infiltrated into the lung, initiating a cytokine storm by their production of gamma interferon (IFN-) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-). Administration of an immunomodulatory sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor 1 (S1P1R) agonist significantly inhibited PVM-elicited cytokine storm by blunting the PVM-specific CD8(+) T cell response, resulting in diminished pulmonary disease and enhanced survival. IMPORTANCE A dysregulated overly exuberant immune response, termed a \\"cytokine storm,\\" accompanies virus-induced acute respiratory diseases (VARV), is primarily responsible for the accompanying high morbidity and mortality, and can be controlled therapeutically in influenza virus infection of mice and ferrets by administration of sphingosine-1-phosphate 1 receptor (S1P1R) agonists. Here, two novel findings are recorded. First, in contrast to influenza infection, where the cytokine storm is initiated early by the innate immune system, for pneumonia virus of mice (PVM), a model of RSV, the cytokine storm is initiated late in infection by the adaptive immune response: specifically, by virus-specific CD8 T cells via their release of IFN- and TNF-. Blockading these cytokines with neutralizing antibodies blunts the cytokine storm and protects the host. Second, PVM infection is controlled by administration of an S1P1R agonist.","output":"Animal model of respiratory syncytial virus: CD8+ T cells cause a cytokine storm that is chemically tractable by sphingosine-1-phosphate 1 receptor agonist therapy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Decision-making on end-of-life is an inevitable, yet highly complex, aspect of intensive care decision-making. End-of-life decisions can be challenging both in terms of clinical judgement and social interaction with families, and these two processes often become intertwined. This is especially apparent at times when clinicians are required to seek the views of surrogate decision makers (i.e., family members) when considering palliative care. Methods Using a vignette-based interview methodology, we explored how interactions with family members influence end-of-life decisions by intensive care unit clinicians (n = 24), and identified strategies for reaching consensus with families during this highly emotional phase of care. Results We found that the enactment of end-of-life decisions were reported as being affected by a form of loss aversion, whereby concerns over the consequences of not reaching a consensus with families weighed heavily in the minds of clinicians. Fear of conflict with families tended to arise from anticipated unrealistic family expectations of care, family normalization of patient incapacity, and belief systems that prohibit end-of-life decision-making. Conclusions To support decision makers in reaching consensus, various strategies for effective, coherent, and targeted communication (e.g., on patient deterioration and limits of clinical treatment) were suggested as ways to effectively consult with families on end-of-life decision-making.","output":"At the end: A vignette-based investigation of strategies for managing end-of-life decisions in the intensive care unit."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In New Zealand, housing is typically low density, with light timber framing being the dominant form of construction with more than 90% of the market. From 2020, as a result of the global pandemic, there was a shortage of timber in New Zealand, resulting in increased popularity for light steel framing, the main alternative to timber for housing. At the same time, the New Zealand government is committed to sustainability practises through legislation and frameworks, such as the reduction of whole-of-life carbon emissions for the building industry. New Zealand recently announced reducing its net greenhouse gas emissions by 50% within 2030. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a technique for assessing the environmental aspects associated with a product over its life cycle. Despite the popularity of LCA in the construction industry of New Zealand, prior research results seem varied. There is no unified NZ context database to perform an LCA for buildings. Therefore, in this paper, a comprehensive study using LCA was conducted to quantify and compare the quantity of carbon emissions from two commonly designed houses in the Auckland region, one built from light timber and the other from light steel, both designed for a lifespan of 90 years. The cradle-to-cradle system boundary was used for the LCA. From the results of this study, it was found that the light steel house had 12.3% more carbon in total (including embodied and operational carbons) when compared to the light timber house, of which the manufacturing of two houses had a difference of 50.4% in terms of carbon emissions. However, when the end-of-life (EOL) analysis was included, it was found that the extra carbon could be offset due to the steels recyclability, reducing the amount of embodied carbon in the manufacturing process. Therefore, there was no significant difference in carbon emissions between the light steel and the light timber building, with the difference being only 12.3%.","output":"A Comparative Study on the Life Cycle Assessment of New Zealand Residential Buildings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Au centre hospitalier de Valenciennes, deux pharmaciens cliniciens ont intgr, au cours de la deuxime vague, une des units prenant en charge des patients atteints de la COVID-19 afin dapporter leur expertise auprs du personnel soignant issu de diffrents services de ltablissement.

However, episodic positive selection was detected at one site. CONCLUSIONS: Local control of the DENV-2 epidemic in Guangzhou requires effective measures to prevent and monitor imported cases. Moreover, the shift between the Malaysia/Indian subcontinent genotype lineages, which originated at different time points, may account for the rise in DENV-2 cases in Guangzhou. Meanwhile, the low rate of dengue haemorrhagic fever in Guangzhou may be explained by the dominance of the less virulent Malaysia/Indian subcontinent genotype.","output":"Circulation of genotypes of dengue virus serotype 2 in Guangzhou over a period of 20 years"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19(1), features a receptor-binding domain (RBD) for binding to the host cell ACE2 protein(1C6). Neutralizing antibodies that block RBD-ACE2 interaction are candidates for the development of targeted therapeutics(7C17). Llama-derived single-domain antibodies (nanobodies, ~15 kDa) offer advantages in bioavailability, amenability, and production and storage owing to their small sizes and high stability. Here, we report the rapid selection of 99 synthetic nanobodies (sybodies) against RBD by in vitro selection using three libraries. The best sybody, MR3 binds to RBD with high affinity (K(D) = 1.0 nM) and displays high neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses (IC(50) = 0.42 g mL(?1)). Structural, biochemical, and biological characterization suggests a common neutralizing mechanism, in which the RBD-ACE2 interaction is competitively inhibited by sybodies. Various forms of sybodies with improved potency have been generated by structure-based design, biparatopic construction, and divalent engineering. Two divalent forms of MR3 protect hamsters from clinical signs after live virus challenge and a single dose of the Fc-fusion construct of MR3 reduces viral RNA load by 6 Log(10).

The results showed that TGEV/PEDV infection reduced NHE3 activity and Na+ uptake in IPEC-J2 cells. Further studies revealed that the use of NHE3-specific inhibitors could reduce the amount of cell membrane NHE3, thereby decreasing Na+ uptake and ultimately leading to diarrhea.

Focus groups included a brief survey distributed online via Qualtrics followed by a virtual, synchronous focus group conducted via Zoom that lasted between 50 and 75 minutes. Focus groups were stratified by age (18- to 24-year-old participants and 25- to 34-year-old participants), outlined the components of an example PrEP telehealth randomized controlled trial, and included questions on domains of the study designresearch motivations, study funding, recruitment activities, informed consent details, randomization, follow-up, and end of study activities. Participants were asked targeted questions regarding the ethics and trustworthiness of the study and ways in which researchers could gain their trust through the protocol used in the PrEP telehealth clinical trial. RESULTS: The focus groups included 2 groups of 18- to 24-year-old participants and 5 groups of 25- to 34-year-old participants. The mean age of participants was 27.2 years (SD 4.4 years). Of the 28 participants, 10 (36%) reported a bachelors degree to be their highest completed education level and 6 (21%) reported some graduate degree or higher to be their highest completed education level. Most participants (16/28, 57%) reported that they worked full-time and that they were single or not in a committed relationship (21/28, 75%). Most participants (24/28, 86%) reported that they used at least one drug before sex in the 6 months prior to the study. All participants reported that they heard about PrEP and 36% (10/28) were current PrEP users. Overall, the focus groups yielded themes related to the impact of researcher intentions, study funding, recruitment activities, informed consent details, randomization, and study team interactions during and after the study on trust and participation in the clinical trial. CONCLUSIONS: Medical and research mistrust persists among BSMM. This study identified several ethical and culturally responsive activities to build trust and improve participation of young BSMM in PrEP telehealth clinical trials. Future studies should assess the relative impact of implementing these findings on research participation in a PrEP telehealth clinical trial.","output":"Identifying Ethical and Culturally Responsive Research Activities to Build Trust and Improve Participation of Black Sexual Minority Men in Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis Telehealth Clinical Trials: Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Investigating vaccine effectiveness (VE) in real-world conditions is crucial, especially its variation across different settings and populations. We undertook a test-negative control study in Galicia (Northwest Spain) to assess BNT162b2 effectiveness against acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection as well as COVID-19 associated hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality. A total of 44,401 positive and 817,025 negative SARS-CoV-2 test results belonging to adults were included. Adjusted odds ratios of vaccination and their 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated using multivariate logistic-regression models. BNT162b2 showed high effectiveness in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections in all age categories, reaching maximum VE 14 days after administering the second dose [18C64 years: VE = 92.9% (95%CI: 90.2C95.1);65C79 years: VE = 85.8% (95%CI: 77.3C91.9), and 80 years: VE = 91.4% (95%CI: 87.9C94.1)]. BNT162b2 also demonstrated effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 hospitalization for all age categories, with VE more pronounced for those aged 80 years [VE = 60.0% (95%CI: 49.4C68.3)]. Moreover, there was a considerable reduction in ICU admission [VE = 88.0% (95%CI: 74.6C95.8)] and mortality [VE = 38.0% (95%CI: 15.9C55.4)] in the overall population.

This study focuses on a case of Sookmyung Womens University in South Korea, which has operated an online discussion clinic for university general education for more than a year as a case study. There are two main research methods. A frequency analysis was conducted to confirm what kind of counseling the students preferred at the discussion clinic based on the answers written in the students applications. The students whose applications were used for the analysis were divided into 57 teams, and there were two to six members per team. The results were as follows: In the survey results, students wanted help with the preparation process necessary for the discussion and the practical strategies for facilitating discussions. They wanted personalized counseling, demonstrating that discussion education provided in the foundational curriculum is insufficient. Second, the educational model of the discussion clinic and educational examples were examined. The findings confirmed that online discussion education is effective if the system is technically supplemented. Instructors and researchers are prepared to meet students demands for feedback and individual counseling, even if these are not provided through face-to-face discussions. Additionally, face-to-face guidance can be operated more effectively by taking advantage of online systems. The findings also demonstrate that further research on designing and operating online discussion centers is required. This study is a preceding study on developing online systems and educational guidelines for higher educational institutions to present new insights into smart learning.

Three common vaccines, developed by Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna/NIAID, and Johnson & Johnson/Janssen (J&J) against SARS-CoV-2, induce antibodies to a variety of immunogenic epitopes including the epitopes located in ACE-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. It is commonly accepted that blocking RBD with antibodies prevents binding of the virus to the host cells and protects against infection. Here, we measure and compare the apparent anti-RBD antibody affinities in serum of the recipients of Pfizer, Moderna, and J&J vaccines to the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain as well as to its Delta and Omicron variants. Methods: We are using our recently published method to determine the apparent affinity of anti-spike protein antibodies directly in human serum. It is based on probing antibody-antigen equilibria with a small number of antigen-coated magnetic microparticles and imaging them on a fluorescence microscope. In our previous study, we used this method to monitor the development of high-affinity antibodies in convalescent SARS-CoV-2 patients and vaccinated individuals. Serum samples were collected 35-60 days after receiving the first dose of vaccine. Findings: Recipients of two doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, as well as recipients of the single-dose J&J vaccine, develop high-affinity antibodies to RBD derived from the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain and 5-10 times weaker affinity antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 Delta. The antibody affinity to the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is significantly diminished ( 1000-fold). Interpretation: Individuals immunized with all three major vaccines develop high-affinity antibodies to the RBD from the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain. However, the same vaccine-induced antibodies demonstrated 10-fold and 1000-fold weaker affinities toward Delta- and Omicron-RBD, respectively, which may affect the efficacy of the vaccines against these strains of SARS-CoV-2. Measuring antibody affinities provides a useful tool for assessing adaptive immunity.","output":"Affinity of Anti-Spike Antibodies to Three Major SARS-CoV-2 Variants in Recipients of Three Major Vaccines (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients who present with a periprosthetic joint infection in a single joint may have multiple prosthetic joints.

Though inner preputial skin graft (IPG) was described even earlier than BMG, its usage lately has fallen out of favour. The aim of the study was to evaluate the outcome of a SU with IPG from a tertiary care centre. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of prospectively maintained clinical data was conducted at our tertiary care centre enrolling 80 patients with anterior urethral stricture from January 2015 to January 2018. Patients were evaluated for the aetiology, length and site of the urethral stricture. All patients underwent dorsolateral SU with IPG. Post-operative assessment including uroflowmetry and sexual outcomes using IIEF and MSHQ-EJD questionnaires was done at 3 weeks, 3 months, 12 months and half-yearly thereafter. Success was defined by the stable maximum urinary flow value > 14 ml/s or urethral calibration with 16 French Foley catheter. RESULTS: Mean age of patients was 40 years (18C69). The most common aetiology was post-instrumentation (65%) and 60% had stricture at penobulbar site. Mean stricture length was 65 mm. At a mean follow-up of 48 months (range 30C66 months), successful outcomes were seen in 69/80 (87%). Patients with failure were managed with optical internal urethrotomy (OIU). Uroflowmetry and obstructive symptoms significantly improved and sexual function remained unaffected using IPG for SU. CONCLUSIONS: Preputial graft is a tissue familiar to the urologist, located very close to the surgical field, easily harvested and operated under regional anaesthesia.

Southern and Northern Africa have been heavily impacted by such measures. According to UNCTAD statistics (2021), the average annual growth rate of exports in Northern and Southern Africa fell by 27.61% and 6.96%, respectively in 2020. Yet, the effective operationalization of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) could have limited some of the pandemic's economic impacts. Using a computable general equilibrium model, this paper first analyzes the pandemic's economic impact and then assesses the ability of the AfCFTA to mitigate the economic impacts of COVID-19. The simulation results show that the AfCFTA would mitigate the economic impact in Southern and Northern Africa. It reduces the decline in intra-regional exports by 7.87 percentage points in 2021.

Here, this study explores the difficulties people with dyslexia face, their general experiences with passwords, the coping strategies they use and the advice they can provide to developers and others who struggle with passwords. This paper collects empirical data through semi-structured interviews with 13 participants.

Race is a sociocultural construct, necessitating investigation into how sociocultural factors contribute. METHODS: This cross-sectional study linked laboratory data of adult patients between February 29 and May 15, 2020 with socio-demographics variables from the 2018 American Community Survey (ACS). Medical sites included healthcare organizations in Michigan, New York, North Carolina, California, Florida, Pennsylvania, and Washington. Race was treated as a proxy for racism and not biological essentialism. Laboratory data included patient age, sex, race, ethnicity, test result, test location, and residential ZIP code. ACS data included economic and educational variables contributing to an SES Index, population density, proportion Medicaid, and racial composition for corresponding ZIP code. Associations between race/socioeconomic variables and test results were examined using odds ratios (OR). RESULTS: Of 126 452 patients [mean (SD) age 51.9 (18.4) years; 52 747 (41.7%) men; 68 856 (54.5%) White and 27 805 (22.0%) Black], 18 905 (15.0%) tested positive. Of positive tests, 5238 (SD 27.7%) were White and 7223 (SD 38.2%) were Black. Black race increased the odds of a positive test; this finding was consistent across sites [OR 2.11 (95% CI 1.95C2.29)]. When subset by race, higher SES increased the odds of a positive test for White patients [OR 1.10 (95% CI 1.05C1.16)] but decreased the odds for Black patients [OR 0.92 (95% CI 0.86C0.99)]. Black patients, but not White patients, who tested positive overwhelmingly resided in more densely populated areas.

Methods In a retrospective cohort study, 23 dialysis patients awaiting transplant underwent RKT at John Hunter Hospital, Australia between 2008 and 2015. Patients were >60 years old and accepted onto the National Organ Matching Service. This RKT Group was divided into donor renal cancers 30 mm and >30-50 mm. Adverse event profiles for RKT recipients were compared with 22 standard live donor recipients using logistic regression analyses. Recipient and transplant survivals for RKT were compared with 2050 controls from Australian New Zealand Dialysis Transplant Registry using Cox regression models. To increase statistical power for survival analyses, data from 25 RKT recipients from Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane were added, thus creating 48 RKT recipients. Results There were no significant differences in mortality, transplant failure nor AEs between the 2 cancer Groups. RKT increased the risks of Adverse event profiles (odds ratio: 6.48 [2.92-15.44]; P < 0.001).

Methods: RC's were run 2x weekly. 117 pwCF were surveyed to evaluate previous experience of RC, usefulness of this consultation and preference in continuing. We asked 9 MDT members about their perception and opinion of RC. Results: 55% pwCF and 100% MDT responded.100% found RC useful and 90% stating time efficiency despite 62% having no previous experience. 80% of pwCF preferred video over telephone calls. 72% of respondents had concerns re: lack of lung function measurement, 56% were concerned re: lack of physical examination which was also raised by the MDT. Confidentiality was identified as a concern but 72% of pwCF felt they had no problem discussing sensitive issues but these would be preferable F2F. Benefits included reduced clinic time (80%), convenience of not travelling/parking at hospital (90%) and ease of clinic allocation irrespective of microbiology infection control concerns (70%). Flexibility of access, not requiring time off work, a relaxed discussion of more relevant issues and improvements in clinical flow were noted. F2F consultations remain valuable as these build relationships and allow thorough examination. Conclusion: 64% pwCF and all MDT agreed that alternating RC would be a preferable format, with frequency depending on clinical need.

Previous studies have shown that positive interactions can reduce stress and enhance the immune system. However, little is known on how the frequency and duration of daily handling affects a cats likelihood of developing URD. The goal of this study was to record the daily frequency and duration of handling of clinically healthy cats that were relinquished at a closed admission shelter and determine if these parameters were associated with a statistically significant increased risk of developing URD. While no parameters were statistically significantly associated with an increased hazard of developing URD, we found that cats that did not develop URD were handled more frequently than cats that did develop URD. Our results suggest that increased frequency and duration of handling does not appear to increase the risk of URD signs and may reduce the incidence of URD development. These results are important for the shelter community in developing handling and hygiene protocols for shelter cats. ABSTRACT: Reducing stress is important to maintaining the health of shelter cats and decreasing the risk of upper respiratory disease (URD). The aim of this study was to determine if the frequency and/or duration of daily routine handling of shelter cats affects the likelihood of URD development. At a closed admission shelter, each cat free of URD on intake was given a cage card for recording handling data. These data included: date and times when the cat was handled, duration of handling, if and when the cat developed signs of URD, and the handler identity. Cox regression was used to determine the relationship between these factors and URD development. We found cats that did not develop URD were handled significantly more than cats that did (1.1 times per day vs. 0.7 times per day, p < 0.001). Increased frequency of handling had a borderline significant effect on the hazard of developing URD (HR 0.37; CI: 0.13C1.1; p = 0.066). No other parameters were significantly associated with the development of URD; however, small sample size may be responsible for this finding. A larger study is needed to elucidate the relationship between handling and URD development.","output":"The Effects of Frequency and Duration of Handling on the Development of Feline Upper Respiratory Infections in a Shelter Setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction and importance: Since COVID 19 was described for the first time in December 2019, we have not stopped discovering its different clinical manifestations.

Methods: A total of 100 female patients undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy were enrolled in this study and randomly divided into two groups (n = 50, each). In group A, the patients were treated with dexmedetomidine and sufentanil for postoperative analgesia. In group B, the patients were treated with sufentanil alone for postoperative analgesia. All patients were evaluated with a self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) 1 day before the operation. The patients pain was evaluated using the numerical rating scale (NRS) 1 day after the operation, and data were recorded. Results: In these 100 patients, the highest preoperative SAS score was 48, and the average score was 40.99  4.55 points, which is higher than the norm in China. There were significant differences in preoperative SAS scores among patients with different occupations and previous surgical experience (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in SAS scores among patients with different education levels (P > 0.05). The postoperative NRS score of group A was significantly higher than that of group B, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The correlation coefficients between SAS scores and NRS scores in groups A and B were 0.836 and 0.870, respectively, presenting with a significantly positive correlation. Conclusion: Preoperative anxiety is an important predictor of postoperative pain. Patients undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy have preoperative anxiety. The degree of anxiety is influenced by the occupation and previous operation experience of the patients, and patients with higher preoperative anxiety have greater postoperative pain. In addition, we should not neglect the management of postoperative pain because of the small trauma of laparoscopic surgery, and dexmedetomidine combined with sufentanil can improve the postoperative analgesic effect.","output":"Preoperative Anxiety and Postoperative Pain in Patients With Laparoscopic Hysterectomy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus pandemic caused global devastation with over 2 million deaths and put unprecedented pressure on health care facilities world-wide The response to the pandemic differed globally as countries faced different challenges Within Gynaecological oncology, a multitude of guidance was published by various countries and organisations which demonstrated major themes These consisted of implementations aimed at reducing transmission, managing limited resources, treatment prioritisation whilst continuing urgent oncological surgery where possible and the use of alternative therapies in the management of oncology patients to reduce hospital admission Due to the novelty of this virus and its global effects, published guidance is currently limited to best practice and small-scale trials This review aims to summarise the global response to coronavirus with respect to Gynaecological oncology and suggests potential interventions to limit the spread of the virus during resurgence or in the event of a future global pandemic It also discusses the current trials recruiting relevant to the field of Gynaecological oncology to better inform the specialty on the management of cancer patients during COVID-19","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on Gynaecological oncology;a global perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Telehealth and telerehabilitation in spinal cord injury (teleSCI) is a growing field that can improve access to care and improve health outcomes in the spinal cord injury population.

OBJECTIVE: We explore the hypotheses that rapport building, documentation, and time efficiency might be improved in the ED by providing patients a digital tool that uses Bayesian reasoningCbased techniques to gather relevant symptoms and history for handover to clinicians. METHODS: A 2-phase pilot evaluation was carried out in the ED of a German tertiary referral and major trauma hospital that treats an average of 120 patients daily. Phase 1 observations guided iterative improvement of the digital tool, which was then further evaluated in phase 2. All patients who were willing and able to provide consent were invited to participate, excluding those with severe injury or illness requiring immediate treatment, with traumatic injury, incapable of completing a health assessment, and aged <18 years. Over an 18-day period with 1699 patients presenting to the ED, 815 (47.96%) were eligible based on triage level. With available recruitment staff, 135 were approached, of whom 81 (60%) were included in the study. In a mixed methods evaluation, patients entered information into the tool, accessed by clinicians through a dashboard. All users completed evaluation Likert-scale questionnaires rating the tools performance. The feasibility of a larger trial was evaluated through rates of recruitment and questionnaire completion. RESULTS: Respondents strongly endorsed the tool for facilitating conversation (61/81, 75% of patients, 57/78, 73% of physician ratings, and 10/10, 100% of nurse ratings). Most nurses judged the tool as potentially time saving, whereas most physicians only agreed for a subset of medical specialties (eg, surgery). Patients reported high usability and understood the tools questions. The tool was recommended by most patients (63/81, 78%), in 53% (41/77) of physician ratings, and in 76% (61/80) of nurse ratings. Questionnaire completion rates were 100% (81/81) by patients and 96% (78/81 enrolled patients) by physicians. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot confirmed that a larger study in the setting would be feasible. The tool has clear potential to improve patientChealth care provider interaction and could also contribute to ED efficiency savings.

NIBB is not invasive but maintains a high level of precision by using breast immobilization via breast compression and image-guidance, and therefore does not require large PTV margins. We present the primary outcomes of this prospective phase II study (XXXXX). METHODS Eligible patients with early-stage breast cancer underwent NIBB APBI using a dose 34Gy in 10 fractions delivered daily or BID. Treatment was delivered using an Ir-192 HDR source via specialized applicators. Two orthogonal treatment axes were used for each fraction. The primary endpoints were late toxicity and cosmesis assessed at 2 and 5 years. Toxicity was assessed using CTCAE v3.0. Cosmesis was assessed using the NRG/RTOG scale. Ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) was defined as any recurrence or new primary in the treated breast. RESULTS 40 patients underwent protocol treatment. Median patient age was 68yrs (50-92yrs). Mean tumor size was 1.1cm (0.3-3.0cm) with 62.5% invasive carcinoma and 37.5% DCIS. 39% elected to receive endocrine therapy. No grade  3 late toxicities were observed at any time point. Grade 2 toxicity was 5% and 10% at 2 and 5 years, respectively. Telangiectasia grade 1 and 2 occurred in 27.5% and 5%, respectively. Breast separation of >7cm was associated with telangiectasia, p<0.01. Good to excellent cosmetic outcome was 95% at 2 years and 100% at 5 years. With a median follow up of 68 months, the actuarial 5-year freedom-from-IBTR was 93.3% (+/-4.8%) and OS was 93.7% (+/-4.4%). CONCLUSION NIBB to deliver APBI is well tolerated with a low incidence of significant late toxicity and has favorable cosmetic outcomes.

In the absence of specific antiviral treatments capable of neutralizing the etiological agent, one therapeutic approach is to control the cytokine storm responsible for the most severe forms of the disease. The characteristic cytokine profile of severely affected patients is increased levels of interleukin (IL)-1?, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#945;). AREAS COVERED: This article discusses the pathogenesis of COVID-19 as a rationale for using the biological and targeted synthetic drugs used in rheumatology (anti-TNF, anti-IL-1 and anti-IL-6 agents and baricitinib) to treat the disease, and provides key information concerning their potential benefits and adverse effects. EXPERT OPINION: Interleukin inhibition seems to be a promising means of treating COVID-19 patients when respiratory function declines (or even earlier) if there are laboratory data indicating the presence of a cytokine storm because the interleukins are key drivers of inflammation. However, it is important to consider the risks and benefits of biological agents carefully, and critically analyze the evidence concerning their use in COVID-19 patients.","output":"The effect of drugs used in rheumatology for treating SARS-CoV2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to acute respiratory syndrome in patients, which can be due in part to dysregulated immune signalling. We analyze here the occurrences of CpG dinucleotides, which are putative pathogen-associated molecular patterns, along the viral sequence. Carrying out a comparative analysis with other ssRNA viruses and within the Coronaviridae family, we find the CpG content of SARS-CoV-2, while low compared to other betacoronaviruses, widely fluctuates along its primary sequence. While the CpG relative abundance and its associated CpG force parameter are low for the spike protein (S) and comparable to circulating seasonal coronaviruses such as HKU1, they are much greater and comparable to SARS and MERS for the 3'-end of the viral genome. In particular, the nucleocapsid protein (N), whose transcripts are relatively abundant in the cytoplasm of infected cells and present in the 3'UTRs of all subgenomic RNA, has high CpG content. We speculate this dual nature of CpG content can confer to SARS-CoV-2 high ability to both enter the host and trigger pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in different contexts. We then investigate the evolution of synonymous mutations since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a new application of selective forces on dinucleotides to estimate context driven mutational processes, we find that synonymous mutations seem driven both by the viral codon bias and by the high value of the CpG force in the N protein, leading to a loss in CpG content. Sequence motifs preceding these CpG-loss-associated loci match recently identified binding patterns of the Zinc Finger anti-viral Protein (ZAP) protein.

General data of the patients, as well as intraoperative and postoperative data, were gathered and statistically analyzed. RESULTS Overall, 146 patients were subjected to LSG. In 84 patients a running suture was placed, and in 62 patients no suture was placed. No significant differences were found between the two groups in demographic data. No significant differences were found also in the intraoperative data, such as number of trocars, number and type of cartridges, drain placement, and operative time (4521 versus 4020 minutes, respectively; P<.05). Intraoperative complications were significantly more in the group with the suture placement (33.3% versus 16.1%, respectively; P<.05).

Our approach is based on a four-stage workflow process that incorporates the interplay of recent developments in four major emerging technologies: artificial intelligence, molecular dynamics, surface-display in microorganisms, and microfluidics. Implementing this framework is challenging because to obtain reliable results, the in silico algorithms to search for candidate AMPs need to overcome issues of the state-of-the-art approaches that limit the possibilities for multi-space data distribution analyses in extremely large databases. We expect to tackle this challenge by using a recently developed classification algorithm based on deep learning models that rely on convolutional layers and gated recurrent units.

Secondary data and document analyses were the main forms of data collection used, while content and thematic analyses were used to analyse the data. The results showed that the COVID-19 outbreak imposed both economic and human costs to the industry. The outbreak decimated the industry, which saw the value of shipping companies stock falling by up to 80% in March 2020, with major sources of revenue shut due to the suspension of cruises.

In emergency management, a holistic approach is needed which recognises the important interrelationships between animal welfare, human well-being, and the physical and social environment. It is also vital to break down barriers of collaboration between individuals, organisations, and the community. One Welfare, a concept with humanCanimal-environment interdependencies at its core, provides a framework to achieve this. Successful implementation of a transformative change will require positive strategies to deal with challenges and to ensure that animals are truly integrated into emergency management, not just included as an aside. ABSTRACT: Responding to emergencies requires many different individuals and organisations to work well together under extraordinary circumstances. Unfortunately, the management of animal welfare in emergencies remains largely disconnected from emergency management overall. This is due predominately to professional silos and a failure to understand the importance of humanCanimal-environment (h-a-e) interdependencies. One Welfare (OW) is a concept with these interrelationships at its core. This paper argues that by adopting an OW framework it will be possible to achieve a transdisciplinary approach to emergency management in which all stakeholders acknowledge the importance of the h-a-e interdependencies and work to implement a framework to support this. Acknowledging that such a transformational change will not be easy, this paper proposes several strategies to overcome the challenges and optimise the outcomes for animal welfare emergency management (AWEM). These include legislation and policy changes including h-a-e interface interactions as business as usual, improving knowledge through interprofessional education and training, incorporating One Welfare champions, and recognising the role of animals as vital conduits into communities.","output":"Strategies for Implementing a One Welfare Framework into Emergency Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess whether youth cigarette and electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use are associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms, testing, and diagnosis.

OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether the association between symptoms (or cluster of symptoms) and positive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) was different according to patients' age and presence of multimorbidity. METHODS: The study included 6680 participants in the EPICOVID19 web-based survey, who reported information about symptoms from February to June 2020 and who underwent at least one NPS. Symptom clusters were identified through hierarchical cluster analysis. The associations between symptoms (and clusters of symptoms) and positive NPS were investigated through multivariable binary logistic regression in the sample stratified by age (<65 vs &#8805;65 years) and number of chronic diseases (0 vs 1 vs &#8805;2). RESULTS: The direct association between taste/smell disorders and positive NPS was weaker in older and multimorbid patients than in their younger and healthier counterparts. Having reported no symptoms reduced the chance of positive NPS by 86% in younger (95%CI: 0.11-0.18), and by 46% in older participants (95%CI: 0.37-0.79). Of the four symptom clusters identified (asymptomatic, generic, flu-like, and combined generic and flu-like symptoms), those associated with a higher probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection were the flu-like for older people, and the combined generic and flu-like for the younger ones. CONCLUSIONS: Older age and pre-existing chronic diseases may influence the clinical presentation of Covid-19. Symptoms at disease onset tend to aggregate differently by age.

We have been actively observing and managing these patients and have recorded the salient features including risk factors, the presenting complaints and also the trends of mortality. We aimed to have risk factors stratification, prevalent symptoms at the time of presentation to the hospital and to determine factors contributing to mortality due to COVID-19 in population of Nowshera (Pakistan). Methodology: In this cross sectional study, 75 cases with returned PCR results were included from 15th February 2020 to 18th April 2020. Data were entered in a format in SPSS version 25, prepared in accordance with the objectives of the study. Results: Out of a total of 75 patients, 20 (26.67%) were females and 55 (73.33%) were males. The mean age was 3618 y. Out of these, 29 (38.67%) patients were COVID-19 positive by PCR technique, and 46 (61.33%) were negative. The probability of virus detection was higher in male gender (OR = 1.5, Relative Risk (RR) = 1.2). A significant relation of viral infectivity was noted with history of travel to an epidemic area (p = 0.01 OR = 3.85, RR = 1.5) and history of contacts with COVID-19 infected person/s (p = 0.018, OR = 3. 5, RR = 2.3). A high mortality rate of 3/29 (10.34%) for positive COVID-19 cases was recorded. The probability of worse outcome in term of death in COVID-19 positive patients was (p = 0.5, OR = 2.1). Regarding symptoms selection; contact and travel history without any symptoms has a reliability index (RI) of 12/35 (34%) for infectivity. Cough, fever with shortness of breath (RI; 8/12(67%) for positive cases followed by fever and cough with RI of 6/10 (60%) cases etc. Sore throat (RI; 1/13(8%) and flue only (RI;0/3(0%) proved non-reliable symptoms. When plotted the survival graphs of COVID positive vs. COVID negative cases, a similar pattern was recorded that showed the mortality rate in the positive cases was not solely due to COVID-19, though being opportunistic infection, it would have contributed. We recorded refractory COVID-19 in 4/29 (13.79%) cases. Conclusion: We conclude that male gender with history of travel to an epidemic area and contact with COVID-19 patients are strong predisposing factors. Cough, fever with shortness of breath are reliable symptoms for COVID-19 in our suspects. COVID-19 being an opportunistic infection contributes to a higher mortality in respiratory and cardiac patients.","output":"Risk factors and symptoms stratification and mortality of COVID-19 in population of Nowshera (Pakistan)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A once-in-a-century pandemic has sparked an unprecedented health and economic crisis Less examined is how predatory financial investors have shaped the crisis and profited from it We examine how U S shadow banks, such as private equity, venture capital, and hedge fund firms, have affected hardship and inequality during the crisis First, we identify how these investors helped to hollow out the health care industry and disenfranchise the low-wage service sector, putting frontline workers at risk We then outline how, as the downturn unfolds, shadow banks are shifting their investments in ways that profit on the misfortunes of frontline workers, vulnerable populations, and distressed industries After the pandemic subsides and governments withdraw stimulus support, employment will likely remain insecure, many renters will face evictions, and entire economic sectors will need to rebuild Shadow banks are planning accordingly to profit from the fallout of the crisis We argue that this case reveals how financial investors accumulate capital through private and speculative investments that exploit vulnerabilities in the economic system during a time of crisis To conclude, we consider the prospects for change and inequality over time","output":"Profiting on Crisis: How Predatory Financial Investors Have Worsened Inequality in the Coronavirus Crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that economic crisis is a preeminent stressor (i e , economic stress) that may worsen working conditions and expose individuals to negative acts at work (i e , workplace bullying) Following an occupational health perspective that considers contextual factors as risk factors for workplace bullying, this study aims to examine the mediation effects of organizational orientation to employee welfare in the economic stress-workplace bullying relationship A cross-sectional study with the participation of 1004 Italian workers from several organizations was conducted Our results indicate that economic stress (composed of two dimensions: fear of the economic crisis and perceived non-employability) is associated with workplace bullying through the total mediation of organizational orientation to employee welfare These results have relevant implications for psychosocial risk assessment in turbulent times","output":"Fear of Non-Employability and of Economic Crisis Increase Workplace Harassment through Lower Organizational Welfare Orientation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Featured ApplicationThis study shows the use of a by-product from the manufacture of a novel antiseptic/disinfectant (HOCl) to obtain a protein isolate from defatted soybean flour (a co-product from the soybean oil industry);an optimization process was carried out to create an industrial symbiosis.Defatted soybean flour is generated during the oil extraction process of soybean, and it has a protein content of ~50%.

The aims of this study were to identify the key characteristics of remote home monitoring models for COVID-19 infection, explore the experiences of staff implementing these models, understand the use of data for monitoring progress against outcomes, and document variability in staffing and resource allocation. METHODS: This was a multi-site mixed methods study conducted between July and August 2020 that combined qualitative and quantitative approaches to analyse the implementation and impact of remote home monitoring models developed during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in England. The study combined interviews (n = 22) with staff delivering these models across eight sites in England with the collection and analysis of data on staffing models and resource allocation. FINDINGS: The models varied in relation to the healthcare settings and mechanisms used for patient triage, monitoring and escalation. Implementation was embedded in existing staff workloads and budgets. Good communication within clinical teams, culturally-appropriate information for patients/carers and the combination of multiple approaches for patient monitoring (app and paper-based) were considered facilitators in implementation. The mean cost per monitored patient varied from 400 to 553, depending on the model. INTERPRETATION: It is necessary to provide the means for evaluating the effectiveness of these models, for example, by establishing comparator data. Future research should also focus on the sustainability of the models and patient experience (considering the extent to which some of the models exacerbate existing inequalities in access to care).","output":"The implementation of remote home monitoring models during the COVID-19 pandemic in England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to the implementation of social distancing measures such as work-from-home orders that have drastically changed peoples travel-related behavior. As countries are easing up these measures and people are resuming their pre-pandemic activities, the second wave of COVID-19 is observed in many countries. This study proposes a Community Activity Score (CAS) based on inter-community traffic characteristics (in and out of community traffic volume and travel distance) to capture the current travel-related activity level compared to the pre-pandemic baseline and study its relationship with confirmed COVID-19 cases. Fourteen other travel-related factors belonging to five categories (Social Distancing Index, residents staying at home, travel frequency and distance, mobility trend, and out-of-county visitors) and three social distancing measures (stay-at-home order, face-covering order, and self-quarantine for out-of-county travels) are also considered to reflect the likelihood of exposure to the COVID-19. Considering that it usually takes days from exposure to confirming the infection, the exposure-to-confirm temporal delay between the time-varying travel-related factors and their impacts on the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is considered in this study. Honolulu County in the State of Hawaii is used as a case study to evaluate the proposed CAS and other factors on confirmed COVID-19 cases with various temporal delays at a county-level. Negative Binomial models were chosen to study the impacts of travel-related factors and social distancing measures on COVID-19 cases. The case study results show that CAS and other factors are correlated with COVID-19 spread, and models that factor in the exposure-to-confirm temporal delay perform better in forecasting COVID-19 cases later.

We identified maternal infections using diagnostic and laboratory testing data. We compared the risk of pregnancy outcomes using Cox proportional hazard models treating COVID-19 as a time-varying exposure and adjusting for baseline covariates. RESULTS: 2,655 (3.4%) pregnancies had a documented SARS-CoV-2 infection; 3.4% required admission to intensive care, invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO treatment. COVID-19 during pregnancy was not associated with risk of miscarriage, antepartum hemorrhage, or stillbirth, but was associated with 2-3 fold higher risk of induced abortion (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.60, 95% CI 1.17-5.78), c-section (aHR 1.99, 95% CI 1.71-2.31), clinician-initiated preterm birth (2.88; 95% CI 1.93, 4.30), spontaneous preterm birth (aHR 1.79, 95% CI 1.37-2.34), fetal growth restriction (aHR 2.04, 95% CI 1.72-2.43), and postpartum hemorrhage (aHR 2.03, 95% CI 1.6-2.63).

A district general hospital's surgical department identified that ward rounds based on a paper-based handover system did not adhere to good COVID-19 pandemic infection control measures, including social distancing, reduction of footfall, and reducing contact events during documentation. Surgical E-Handover was introduced as a quality improvement project focussing on increasing efficiency and improving patient safety and compliance with COVID-19 social distancing measures. Other objectives were to reduce the risk of information governance breaches. During the COVID pandemic, there was a significant investment in digital technology, which supported rapid advancement in the use of electronic healthcare solutions to deliver new ways of working. We used the opportunity of the emergency situation to disrupt existing work patterns and introduce surgical E-Handover. Methods A quality improvement team of stakeholders was assembled, and a project to introduce E-Handover was carried out using the trust quality improvement methodology aligned to the Institute of Healthcare Improvement (IHI). Questionnaires were sent out pre- and post-implementation to evaluate the impact of using E-Handover during ward rounds. Results The efficiency of ward rounds was improved and improving compliance with COVID 19 social distancing measures was highly successful. These outcomes were achieved by reducing footfall during ward rounds, as key clinical information was available at the bedside (p<0.001). Doctors spent less time in crowded clinical multi-disciplinary team (MDT) rooms, and the integrated paper healthcare records were not accessed by multiple staff members simultaneously. The implementation of the E-Handover improved the safety and efficiency of the surgical department, particularly with reference to potential information governance breaches (p<0.001). Conclusion Surgical E-Handover, as compared to a printed patient list, significantly improved clinical efficiency and adherence to COVID-19 social distancing measures.

Sub-optimal Se status is common, occurring in a significant proportion of the population across the world including parts of Europe and China. Human and animal studies have shown that Se status is a key determinant of the host response to viral infections. In this review, we address the question whether Se intake is a factor in determining the severity of response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Emphasis is placed on epidemiological and animal studies which suggest that Se affects host response to RNA viruses and on the molecular mechanisms by which Se and selenoproteins modulate the inter-linked redox homeostasis, stress response and inflammatory response. Together these studies indicate that Se status is an important factor in determining the host response to viral infections. Therefore, we conclude that Se status is likely to influence human response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and that Se status is one (of several) risk factors which may impact on the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in populations where Se intake is sub-optimal or low.

Little prospective data existed to guide practice, and professional surgical societies issued recommendations grounded mainly in common sense and expert consensus, such as medical therapy for early-stage breast and prostate cancer patients. To understand the patient experience of delay in cancer surgery during the pandemic, we interviewed breast and prostate cancer patients whose surgeries were delayed due to the pandemic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with early-stage breast or prostate cancer who suffered surgical postponement at Brigham and Womens Hospital (BWH) were invited to participate. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 21 breast and prostate cancer patients. Interviews were transcribed, and qualitative analysis using ground-theory approach was performed. RESULTS: Most patients reported significant distress due to cancer and COVID. Key themes that emerged included the lack of surprise and acceptance of the surgical delays but endorsed persistent cancer- and delay-related worries. Satisfaction with patientCphysician communication and the availability of a delay strategy were key factors in patients acceptance of the situation; perceived lack of communication prompted a few patients to seek care elsewhere. DISCUSSION: The clinical effect of delay in cancer surgery will take years to fully understand, but there are immediate steps that can be taken to improve the patient experience of delays in care, including elicitation of individual patient perspectives and ongoing communication. More work is needed to understand the wider experiences of patients, especially minority, socioeconomically disadvantaged, and uninsured patients, who encounter delays in oncologic care.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between vitamin D status at admission and different markers of inflammation, coagulation, and sepsis in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHOD: We conducted a retrospective study on 137 consecutive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and available data on serum 25(OH)D levels, who were admitted to our Institution between March 1 and April 30, 2020. Patients were divided into two groups: survivors (n = 78; 57%) and non-survivors (n = 59; 43%). RESULTS: At admission, all patients showed hypovitaminosis D. Median total serum 25(OH)D levels at admission were significantly higher in survivors than non-survivors (12 ng/mL vs 8 ng/mL; p < 0.01). Non-survivors exhibited significantly higher median levels of white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte count ratio (NLR), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), ferritin, interleukin 6 (IL-6), D-dimer, fibrinogen, and procalcitonin (PCT) compared to survivors at three different time points during hospitalization. In a multivariate analysis performed by a logistic regression model, serum 25(OH)D levels were significantly inversely associated with risk of COVID-19-related in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.85-0.98; p = 0.01). According to receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, hsCRP, NLR, ferritin, and D-dimer were the best predictive biomarkers for poor prognosis of COVID-19, whereas IL-6, PCT, fibrinogen, 25(OH)D, WBC count, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#945;) may serve as supportive biomarkers for worse clinical course of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: We found a markedly high prevalence (100%) of hypovitaminosis D in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, suggesting a possible role of low vitamin D status in increasing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent hospitalization. The inverse association between serum 25(OH)D levels and risk of in-hospital mortality observed in our cohort suggests that a lower vitamin D status upon admission may represent a modifiable and independent risk factor for poor prognosis in COVID-19.","output":"Low Vitamin D Status at Admission as a Risk Factor for Poor Survival in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19: An Italian Retrospective Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"THE COVID-19 pandemic began to emerge by the end of 2019, creating an unprecedented and dramatic world-wide catastrophe The SARS-CoV-2 virus has already changed the global map and forced the world to start a new era in which no one can predict the volume of social, economic and environmental changes that will occur world-wide Soil and air are two compartments of the agroecosystem that represent two vital columns of the environment's structure Due to social distancing, lockdowns and quarantines, air pollution was reduced in several cities worldwide, whereas this relationship for soil as a complex system still needs more investigation The most immediate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on soils and vice versa probably depend primarily on human activities Management of soils may include restoring soils from and increasing resilience to viral impacts and sustaining crop yields for long-term sustainability to keep the soil healthy for future generations Therefore, this review is an attempt to highlight the mutual impact of COVID-19 on pollution of soil and air Many open questions are discussed in this review article, including the expected environmental impacts of COVID-19 on soil and air, does soil play a role in spreading COVID-19, soil pollution status under the COVID-19 outbreak, and what are the projected management scenarios for soil and air pollution under the COVID-19 outbreak?","output":"Soil and Air Pollution in the Era of COVID-19: A Global Issue"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: One day after the pandemic was announced, Tennessee declared a state of emergency on March 12, 2020 with implementation of a stay-at-home order on March 23, 2020 Data regarding the routes and patterns of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 are limited We initiated an investigation after clusters of confirmed COVID-19 cases attended a large social gathering Methods: We were notified of clinical providers who attended a Silent School Auction on March 7, 2020, of which several confirmed-cases were identified as targeted participants To derive a standardized REDCap web-survey, we conducted a hypothesis-generating interview with three confirmed attendees to collect event details Once finalized, enrollment included collecting sociodemographic, epidemiologic, and clinical data Attendees were classified as: 1) confirmed if they had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test;2) suspected if they developed symptoms 21-days before or after the auction;and 3) asymptomatic if no symptoms were noted Results: From March 20-June 16, 100/166 (60%) of attendees were enrolled, with a median age of 41 years, 54% female, and 99% white Of those, 34 and 32 were confirmed- and suspect-cases, respectively Table 1 compares sociodemographic behaviors of all attendees, with the majority of confirmed-cases eating late in the evening From March 6 to March 8, 58 participants reported attending other social events, of which three (i e , church service, women's retreat, and a birthday party) were common among 43 attendees and five individuals reported onset of mild respiratory symptoms prior to the event (Figure 1) Confirmed-cases were more likely to report having shortness of breath, chest tightness, loss of taste, loss of smell, and fever compared to suspect-cases (Figure 2) and no one required hospitalization Dining tables from the school auction depicted a clustering of cases occurring at each table, with some individuals visiting more than one table during the event (Figure 3) Conclusion: We identified several COVID-19 cases from a single event that occurred prior to social mitigation strategies Our investigation highlights the importance of staying home when sick and the significance of social distancing to halt transmission of COVID-19 (Table Presented)","output":"Outbreak of COVID-19 among school auction attendees: Was it a silent auction or silent transmission?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on primary data collected from the households of Dangs district in South Gujarat, India, the paper shows that every year a third of young adults migrate to Surat district and neighbouring areas for half a year to work as sugarcane harvesters.

After seven days of cultivation, 89% of enterocytes presented microvilli and showed a two- to five-fold higher susceptibility to PEDV and TGEV. A significant increase of PEDV and TGEV infection was correlated with a higher expression of APN, which was indicative that APN plays an important role in porcine coronavirus infections. However, PEDV and TGEV infected both APN positive and negative enterocytes. PEDV and TGEV Miller showed a higher infectivity in APN positive cells than in APN negative cells. In contrast, TGEV Purdue replicated better in APN negative cells. These results show that an additional receptor exists, different from APN for porcine coronaviruses. Subsequently, treatment of enterocytes with neuraminidase (NA) had no effect on infection efficiency of TGEV, implying that terminal cellular sialic acids (SAs) are no receptor determinants for TGEV.

However, they lack antiviral efficacy upon oral administration. Translation of in vitro to in vivo exposure is necessary for understanding the disconnect between the two to develop effective therapeutic strategies. METHODS: We employed an in vitro ion-trapping kinetic model to predict the changes in the cytosolic and lysosomal concentrations of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in cell lines and primary human airway cultures. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic model with detailed respiratory physiology was used to predict regional airway exposure and optimize dosing regimens. RESULTS: At their reported in vitro effective concentrations in cell lines, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine cause a significant increase in their cytosolic and lysosomal concentrations by altering the lysosomal pH. Higher concentrations of the compounds are required to achieve similar levels of cytosolic and lysosomal changes in primary human airway cells in vitro. The predicted cellular and lysosomal concentrations in the respiratory tract for in vivo oral doses are lower than the in vitro effective levels. Pulmonary administration of aerosolized chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine is predicted to achieve high bound in vitro-effective concentrations in the respiratory tract, with low systemic exposure. Achieving effective cytosolic concentrations for activating immunomodulatory effects and adequate lysosomal levels for inhibiting viral replication could be key drivers for treating viral respiratory infections. CONCLUSION: Our analysis provides a framework for extrapolating in vitro effective concentrations of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to in vivo dosing regimens for treating viral respiratory infections.

Despite liver failure or immunosuppressive therapy, the capacity for Treg expansion during the manufacturing process was preserved. These experiments did not identify performance or quality issues that disqualified use of post-transplant PBMC, the currently favored protocol design. However, as Treg input correlated with output, significant CD4-lymphopenia in both pre- and post-transplant patients limited Treg yield. We therefore turned to leukapheresis post-transplant to improve absolute yield. To make deceased donor use feasible, we also developed protocols to substitute splenocytes for PBMC as allostimulators. In addition to demonstrating that this Treg expansion strategy works in a liver transplant context, this preclinical study illustrates how characterizing cellular input populations and their performance can both inform and respond to clinical trial design and Treg manufacturing requirements.","output":"Ex vivo generation of regulatory T cells from liver transplant recipients using costimulation blockade."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has severely harmed every aspect of our daily lives, resulting in a slew of social problems.

We use fact-checking organizations to classify news as real, mixed, or fake, and machine learning algorithms to classify tweets as real or fake to measure and compare community resilience (CR). Based on the news articles and tweets collected, we quantify CR based on two key factors, community wellbeing and resource distribution, where resource distribution is assessed by the level of economic resilience, and community capital. Based on the estimates of these two factors, we quantify CR from both news articles and tweets and analyze the extent to which CR measured from the news articles can reflect the actual state of CR measured from tweets.

In 2018, the Anglo-American Group outlined aspirations for mining host communities to meet the SDG3 health targets. To progress from aspiration to action we designed and implemented a mixed-methods approach to attain a deeper understanding of the health and wellbeing priorities within the local context of host communities of fifteen mines in South Africa. METHODS: To identify local needs and priorities relating to SDG3 targets in host communities, stakeholder workshops and key informant interviews were conducted between June and August 2019. A baseline assessment of health data, related to each of the SDG3 targets and indicators and to each host community location, was also conducted. Findings emerging from the qualitative and quantitative baseline assessments were compared to identify the extent to which health issues aligned and health and wellbeing priority areas for action. RESULTS: A total of 407 people participated in the workshops, and 85 key informants were interviewed. Quantitative data were available at sub-national level for seven of the nine SDG3 targets and eleven of the 21 indicators. Key priority areas for action identified through alignment of the qualitative and quantitative data were maternal mortality (SDG3.1), HIV (SDG3.3.1), tuberculosis (SDG3.3.2), substance abuse (SDG3.5), and road traffic accidents (SDG3.6) We found consistency in the individual, interpersonal, community, societal, and structural factors underlying these priority areas. At a structural level, poor access to quality healthcare was raised at every workshop as a key factor underlying the achievement of all SDG3 targets. Of the five priority areas identified, HIV, TB and substance abuse were found to overlap in the study communities in terms of risk, burden, and underlying factors. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a mixed method approach for identifying local health needs and prioritised SDG3 targets in mining host communities. Consistency in reporting suggests the need for effective, efficient and feasible interventions to address five priority areas. Given the prominent economic role of the mining sector in South Africa, it can play a critical role in implementing programmatic activities that further progress towards achieving the SDG3 targets.","output":"Health and wellbeing needs and priorities in mining host communities in South Africa: a mixed-methods approach for identifying key SDG3 targets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Genetic counseling has been a profession for over 40 years, and training programs accredited by the Accreditation Council for Genetic Counseling are required to have students supervised in at least 50 patient-facing cases prior to graduation.

The endocannabinoid system (ECS) acts as a modulator in the activation of the microcirculation, immune system, and autonomic nervous system, along with controlling pharmacological functions such as emotional responses, homeostasis, motor functions, cognition, and motivation. The ECS contains endogenous cannabinoids, cannabinoid receptor (CBRs), and enzymes that regulate their biosynthesis, transport, and degradation. Moreover, phytocannabinoids and synthetic cannabinoids that mimic the action of endocannabinoids also play an essential role in the modulation of the ECS. Cannabinoids, the main constituents of cannabis (Cannabis sativa L.), are therapeutic compounds that have received international attention in the health field due to their therapeutic properties. Recently, they have been tested for the treatment of COVID-19 due to their antiviral properties. Indeed, cannabinoid-type compounds, and in particular cannabidiol (CBD), isolated from glandular trichomes found in the calyx of cannabis flowers with reported antiviral properties is hypothesized to be a therapeutic option in the ministration of SARS-CoV-2 consorted with COVID-19 disease. The relevant articles were determined from the database search published mainly in Web of Science, Google scholar, PubMed, Crossref, and ClinicalTrials.gov database during the pandemic period. The articles were evaluated for the therapeutic potentials, mechanisms of action of cannabinoids, the roles of the ECS in the immune system, impact of cannabinoids in SARS-CoV-2 septic, especially if they address the application of cannabinoids as drugs for the curability and management of SARS-CoV-2 and its novel variants.

In addition to these, the most recent scientific evidence emphasizes their use in the treatment of the coronavirus infected patients. In brief, all preclinic and clinic studies that have been reported show that, through the cannabinoid system, cannabinoids, particularly CBD, have many mechanisms that are effective in the treatment of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2.

To this end, lipid components of the vaccine formulation play an important role in stabilizing and protecting the mRNA molecule for long-term storage. The purpose of the current study was to measure molecular-level dynamics as a function of temperature in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to gain microscopic insight into its thermal stability. Materials and Methods: We used quasielastic and inelastic neutron scattering to probe (1) the vaccine extracted from the manufacturer-supplied vials and (2) unperturbed vaccine in the original manufacturer-supplied vials. The latter measurement was possible due to the high penetrative power of neutrons. Results: Upon warming from the low-temperature frozen state, the vaccine in its original form exhibits two-step melting, indicative of a two-phase morphology. Once the melting is completed (above 0 C), vaccine re-freezing cannot restore its original two-phase state. This observation is corroborated by the changes in the molecular vibrational spectra. The molecular-level mobility measured in the resulting single-phase state of the re-frozen vaccine greatly exceeds the mobility measured in the original vaccine. Conclusions: Even a brief melting (above 0 C) leads to an irreversible alteration of the two-phase morphology of the original vaccine formulation. Re-freezing of the vaccine results in a one-phase morphology with much increased molecular-level mobility compared to that in the original vaccine, suggesting irreversible deterioration of the vaccines in-storage stability. Neutron scattering can be used to distinguish between the vibrational spectra characteristic of the original and deteriorated vaccines contained in the unperturbed original manufacturer-supplied vials.","output":"Melting and Re-Freezing Leads to Irreversible Changes in the Morphology and Molecular-Level Dynamics of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The petrochemical industry has made the economic development of many local communities possible, increasing employment opportunities and generating a complex network of closely-related secondary industries.

Hyponatremia at admission was linked with a 2.18-fold increase in the likelihood of needing ventilatory support (95% CI 1.34-3.45, p= 0.0011). Hyponatremia was not a risk factor for in-hospital mortality, except for the subgroup of hypovolemic hyponatremia. Sodium values were not associated with the risk for AKI and length of hospital stay. CONCLUSION: Abnormal sodium levels during hospitalization are risk factors for poor prognosis, with hypernatremia and hyponatremia being associated with a greater risk of death and respiratory failure, respectively. Serum sodium values could be used for risk stratification in patients with COVID-19.","output":"Dysnatremia is a predictor for morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has required faculty and students to adapt to an unprecedented challenge and rapidly transition from traditional face-to-face instruction to distance learning formats through virtual classrooms. While most campuses trained faculty to ensure quality and maintenance of the curriculum through virtual classrooms, less consideration has been given to training students, who face equal challenges in adapting to this abrupt change in the delivery of the curriculum. Few approaches have been developed for students to facilitate their involuntary transition to virtual classrooms and maintenance of appropriate online learning behaviours and etiquette. Presented here are a series of propositions to help to maintain and enhance the quality of college student engagement and activity in the virtual classroom. These guidelines are from one example of the State University of New York public educational system perspective, at the pandemics epicentre, while serving a diverse student population. Initiating a meaningful dialogue between faculty, who are engaged in efforts to cope and adapt to the pandemic, may prove useful in re-envisioning and re-designing future curriculum. This may facilitate future discussions on creating best practices guidelines for asynchronous/synchronous virtual classrooms post the pandemic. The present rapid communication suggests a framework for faculty to develop such guidelines to address the current gap in the literature.","output":"Reimagining higher education during and post-COVID-19: Challenges and opportunities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to the threat posed by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the UK prime minister announced on the 23rd of March strict lockdowns and introduced a new way of living and working, at least temporarily.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of WFH on the individuals' perception about their future financial situation and their mental well-being. We apply a difference-in-differences (DiD) framework using data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) combined with the UKHLS COVID-19 survey conducted in April 2020. Our findings suggest that those who have not experienced a shift from working at the employer's premises to WFH became more concerned about their future financial situation. However, we find that WFH has a negative impact on mental well-being. On the other hand, we find no difference in the mental well-being when we consider those who work from home on occasion. The findings of this study have policy implications for government, firms and health practitioners. In particular, a balance between WFH and at the employer's premises may provide both financial security and maintain the mental and psychological well-being at satisfying levels.","output":"Implications of COVID-19: The Effect of Working From Home on Financial and Mental Well-Being in the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) among adolescents between 12 and 17 years of age was approximately 900 per 100,000 population from April 1 through June 11, 2021. The safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of the mRNA-1273 vaccine in adolescents are unknown. METHODS: In this ongoing phase 2C3, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned healthy adolescents (12 to 17 years of age) in a 2:1 ratio to receive two injections of the mRNA-1273 vaccine (100 g in each) or placebo, administered 28 days apart. The primary objectives were evaluation of the safety of mRNA-1273 in adolescents and the noninferiority of the immune response in adolescents as compared with that in young adults (18 to 25 years of age) in a phase 3 trial. Secondary objectives included the efficacy of mRNA-1273 in preventing Covid-19 or asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. RESULTS: A total of 3732 participants were randomly assigned to receive mRNA-1273 (2489 participants) or placebo (1243 participants). In the mRNA-1273 group, the most common solicited adverse reactions after the first or second injections were injection-site pain (in 93.1% and 92.4%, respectively), headache (in 44.6% and 70.2%, respectively), and fatigue (in 47.9% and 67.8%, respectively); in the placebo group, the most common solicited adverse reactions after the first or second injections were injection-site pain (in 34.8% or 30.3%, respectively), headache (in 38.5% and 30.2%, respectively), and fatigue (in 36.6% and 28.9%, respectively). No serious adverse events related to mRNA-1273 or placebo were noted. The geometric mean titer ratio of pseudovirus neutralizing antibody titers in adolescents relative to young adults was 1.08 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94 to 1.24), and the absolute difference in serologic response was 0.2 percentage points (95% CI, ?1.8 to 2.4), which met the noninferiority criterion. No cases of Covid-19 with an onset of 14 days after the second injection were reported in the mRNA-1273 group, and four cases occurred in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: The mRNA-1273 vaccine had an acceptable safety profile in adolescents. The immune response was similar to that in young adults, and the vaccine was efficacious in preventing Covid-19.

A significant fraction of these variants impact transcription factors binding to enhancer elements and alter gene expression. To functionally interrogate the activity of such variants we developed snpSTARRseq, a high-throughput experimental method that can interrogate the functional impact of hundreds to thousands of non-coding variants on enhancer activity. snpSTARRseq dramatically improves signal-to-noise by utilizing a novel sequencing and bioinformatic approach that increases both insert size and number of variants tested per loci. Using this strategy, we interrogated 70 of 140 known prostate cancer (PCa) risk-associated loci and demonstrated that 26 (37%) of them harbor 36 SNPs that significantly altered enhancer activity. Combining these results with chromosomal looping data we could identify interacting genes and provide a mechanism of action for 20 PCa GWAS risk regions. When benchmarked to orthogonal methods, snpSTARRseq showed a strong correlation with in vivo experimental allelic-imbalance studies whereas there was no correlation with predictive in silico approaches.

Yet, bats are frequently associated with infectious human diseases such as SARS, MERS, and Ebola. As early as the end of January 2020, several virological studies have suggested bats as a probable origin for SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. How does the public view the role of bats in COVID-19? Here we report pilot data collected shortly after the outbreak of COVID-19 using two online surveys, combined with a conservation intervention experiment, primarily on people who are receiving or have received higher education in China. We found that 84% of the participants of an online survey (n = 13 589) have misunderstood the relationship between bats and COVID-19, which strengthened negative attitudes towards bats. Knowledge of bats, gender, and education level of the participants affected their attitudes towards bats. Participants who indicated a better knowledge of bats had a more positive attitude towards bats. The proportion of female participants who had negative attitudes towards bats was higher than that of male participants. Participants with a higher education level indicated a more positive attitude towards bats after the outbreak of COVID-19. A specially prepared bat conservation lecture improved peoples' knowledge of bats and the positive attitudes, but failed to correct the misconception that bats transmit SARS-CoV-2 to humans directly. We suggest that the way virologists frame the association of bats with diseases, the countless frequently inaccurate media coverages, and the natural perceptual bias of bats carrying and transmitting diseases to humans contributed to the misunderstandings. This probably led to a rise in the events of evicting bats from dwellings and structures by humans and the legislative proposal for culling disease-relevant wildlife in China.

In this study, persistent respiratory symptoms and pulmonary function tests were investigated in children with COVID-19. Fifty children with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were included in the study. Patients were evaluated for ongoing respiratory symptoms and pulmonary function tests 3 months after infection. Patients with and without persistent symptoms were compared in terms of demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and also disease severity. Three months after infection, persistent respiratory symptoms were found to be present in 28% of patients; cough, chest pain and tightness, dyspnea, and exertional dyspnea were the most common symptoms. Three patients had an obstructive deficit, and one had a restrictive deficit. Four patients had impaired diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO).

Additionally, RNA-seq revealed early cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and an unexpected downregulation of ACE2 mRNA. Further, compared to the transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) inhibitor camostat, the nucleotide analog prodrug Remdesivir potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung organoids. Therefore, human lung organoids can serve as a pathophysiological model for SARS-CoV-2 infection and drug discovery.","output":"Human Embryonic Stem Cell-derived Lung Organoids: a Model for SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Drug Test"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeCOVID-19 has been a big reset to human resource (HR) processes. Organizations HR functions around the world have been working hard to effect a response that falls under four main headings: jobs and work continuity;physical health and well-being;need for mental health, resilience, family support and dealing with uncertainty;and remote work. Knowledge of whether and how these responses have been adopted by health organizations or their potential impact is scarce.Design/methodology/approachThis paper discusses some of the HR strategies adopted or recommended for adoption by health systems/organizations with specific reference to the aforementioned HR response categories.FindingsThe evidence available illustrates that the HR responses adopted by health organizations are mostly in line with those adopted by organizations from other sectors, though not without some variances. The findings also suggest that COVID has acted as a technological catalyst for HR practices in health organizations.Research limitations/implicationsThe background readings that informed this study also helped to identify some literature gaps that could be addressed by future research and practice.Practical implicationsThe state of the art presented in this paper may be of value to health leaders and health HR managers in further strengthening their responses to both pre-existing and post-COVID people-related challenges.Originality/valueThis work is timely considering existing literature gaps and the fact that the existing evidence gets outdated quickly as the emergency progresses.","output":"Human resource management-related responses of health organizations to Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper examines the factors which determine the impact of network communication and network connections on the likelihood of contracting the new coronavirus in the European and Latin American countries.

Symptoms of this rare interstitial pulmonary disease can be either acute or sub-acute and it can rapidly progress to death. Diagnosis should be considered in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) if patients symptomatology and radiology correlates with non-responding or progressive pneumonia and when morphology, on biopsies, encompasses criteria of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and organizing pneumonia (OP) balancing in between. Three clinical cases of patients presenting severe lung disease requiring mechanical ventilation and prolonged intensive care fitted on the variable spectra of AFOP histopathology and had poor outcome: a 23 year-old women had AFOP in the context of antiphospholipid syndrome pulmonary compromise; a 35 year-old man developed a letal intensive care pneumonia with AFOP pattern registered in post-mortem biopsy; and a 79 year-old man died 21 days after intensive care unit treatment of a sub-pleural organizing pneumonia with intra-alveolar fibrin, seen in post-mortem biopsy. The predominance of acute fibrin alveolar deposition pattern is helpful in raising AFOP differential diagnosis while organizing pneumonia pattern establishes a wider range of diagnosis that can go till solitary pulmonary nodule, remaining indefinite to suggest diagnosis.

Duplex ultrasound (DUS) screening and blood tests were conducted in patients admitted from June 2012 to December 2020 for surgical treatment of pelvic and acetabular fractures. Univariate analyses were performed on data of demographics, comorbidities, time from injury to surgery, injury mechanism, accompanied injury, and laboratory results. The optimal cutoff values of continuous variables with statistical significance were obtained by using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was then employed to examine the independent values in terms of predicting preoperative DVT. A total of 607 patients with pelvic and acetabular fractures were included, among whom 82 (13.5%) patients sustained preoperative DVTs. Specifically, 31.7% (26/82) were diagnosed with proximal DVTs. Fifty-two (63.4%) patients had DVT within 7 days after injury, and 67 (81.7%) patients within 10 days. The multivariate logistic regression analysis identified 6 factors independently associated with the presence of preoperative DVT, including age > 46 years (odds ratio [OR] = 2.94), BMI > 26.73 kg/m(2) (OR = 3.91), time from injury to surgery > 9 days (OR = 5.39), associated injury (OR = 7.85), ALB < 32.8 g/L (OR = 2.71) and FIB > 3.095 g/L (OR = 3.34).

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A methodological study design to develop a multi-site, Living COVID-19 Registry of COVID-19 patients admitted in Fondazione Don Gnocchi centres started in March 2020. RESULTS: The integration of the living systematic reviews and focus group methodologies led to a development of a registry which includes 520 fields filled in for 748 COVID-19 patients recruited from 17 Fondazione Don Gnocchi centres. The result is an evidence and experience-based registry, according to the evolution of a new pathology which was not known before outbreak of March 2020 and with the aim of building knowledge to provide a better quality of care for COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: A Living COVID-19 Registry is an open, living and up to date access to large-scale patient-level data sets that could help identifying important factors and modulating variable for recognising risk profiles and predicting treatment success in COVID-19 patients hospitalized. This innovative methodology might be used for other registries, to be sure which the data collected is an appropriate means of accomplishing the scientific objectives planned.

By late April, they had fallen by over 40%. To a first approximation, this collapse was broad based, hitting all U.S. states, regardless of the timing of stay-at-home policies. UI claims and BLS employment data also largely match these patterns. Nearly all industries and occupations saw contraction in postings and spikes in UI claims, with little difference depending on whether they are deemed essential and whether they have work-from-home capability. Essential retail, the front line job most in-demand during the current crisis, took a much smaller hit, while leisure and hospitality services and non-essential retail saw the biggest collapses. This set of facts suggests the economic collapse was not caused solely by the stay-at-home orders, and is therefore unlikely to be undone simply by lifting them.","output":"Labor Demand in the time of COVID-19: Evidence from vacancy postings and UI claims"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Burnout and professional satisfaction is an often an overlooked component for healthcare outcomes; the COVID-19 pandemic represents an unprecedented stressor that could contribute to higher levels of burnout. OBJECTIVES: Our primary objective was to evaluate the association of a battery of fulfillment, job satisfaction change, COVID-19 concerns, and coping measures. Our secondary objective was to determine whether the fulfillment and coping measures differed by gender and by experience levels among a battery of physician specialties. METHODS: The study was a purposive sample of convenience. Study participants included all trainees and attending orthopedic surgeons from our academic institution; all participants were invited to complete a survey built around a validated measure of professional fulfillment aimed at assessing response to acute change and stressors. We performed univariate statistics and a matrix correlational analysis to correlate different survey domains with variables of interest. RESULTS: The survey was sent electronically to 138 individuals; 63 surveys were completed (response ratea??=a??45.7%). Twenty-seven (42.8%) individuals met the threshold criteria for fulfillment whereas 10 (15.9%) met the threshold for burnout. We found that surgeon perspectives on COVID-19 were not associated with burnout or professional fulfillment. Burnout was inversely associated with professional fulfillment (Ra??=a??-0.35). Support seeking was noted to be correlated with professional fulfillment (Ra??=a??0.37).

However, the clinical utility of HMCAS in settings of reperfusion therapy and the level of prognostic association is still unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the association of HMCAS sign with clinical outcomes and its prognostic capacity in acute ischaemic stroke patients treated with reperfusion therapy. Prospective and retrospective studies from the following databases were retrieved from EMBASE, MEDLINE and Cochrane. Association of HMCAS with functional outcome, symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage (sICH) and mortality were investigated. The random effect model was used to calculate the risk ratio (RR). Subgroup analyses were performed for subgroups of patients receiving thrombolysis (tPA), mechanical thrombectomy (EVT) and/or combined therapy (tPA + EVT). HMCAS significantly increased the rate of poor functional outcome by 1.43-fold in patients (RR 1.43; 95% CI 1.30C1.57; p < 0.0001) without any significant differences in sICH rates (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.68C1.23; p = 0.546) and mortality (RR 1.34; 95% CI 0.72C2.51; p = 354) in patients with positive HMCAS as compared to negative HMCAS.

Governments are looking for evidence to balance the demand of their citizens to ease some of the restriction, against the fear of a new peak in infections. In this study, we wanted to quantify the relative contribution of mobility restrictions, and that of behavioral changes that occurred already before the lockdowns, on the reduction of transmission during lockdowns in Western countries in early 2020. METHODS: Incidence data of cases and deaths from the first wave of infections for 35 Western countries (32 European, plus Israel, USA and Canada) were analyzed using epidemiological compartment models in a Bayesian framework. Mobility data was used to estimate the timing of changes associated with a lockdown, and was correlated with estimated reductions of R(t). RESULTS: Across all countries, the initial median estimate for R(t) was 3.6 (95% IQR 2.4C5.2), and it was reduced to 0.78 (95% IQR 0.58C1.01) during lockdown. 48% (18C65%) of the reduction occurred already in the week before lockdown, with lockdown itself causing the remaining drop in transmission. A lower R(t) during lockdown was independently associated with an increased time spent at home (0.21 per 10% more time, p < 0.007), and decreased mobility related to retail and recreation (0.07 per 10% less mobility, p < 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: In a Western population unaware of the risk, SARS-CoV-2 can be highly contagious with a reproduction number R(0) > 5.

In the context of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), MDSCs (in the donor graft and in the recipient, after allo-HSCT) might mediate immune suppression through multiple mechanisms. However, it remains unclear how MDSCs can be distinguished from their normal myeloid counterparts in the hematopoietic stem cell donor graft and during immune reconstitution after allo-HSCT in the recipient. Our ability to understand their exact role in allo-HSCT is limited by the absence of a specific gene signature or surface markers for identifying MDSCs among myeloid cells and by their plasticity in different microenvironments. According to various studies, MDSCs might induce transplant tolerance and control graft vs. host disease (GVHD), but their impact on the graft vs. tumor effect (GVT) is not fully understood. In fact, we know that MDSCs commonly expand in patients with cancer, and they are thought to promote hematological malignancy progression. However, little is known about whether depleting them might be an effective strategy for enhancing GVT effects. Here, we review data published over the past 40 years on allo-HSCT to delineate the different MDSC subsets, and their abilities to induce transplant tolerance and preserve the GVT effect.

Nurses are trained to perform an integral role in the provision of equitable healthcare and their attitudes towards homelessness may therefore influence the care that women experiencing homelessness receive. This study aimed to examine correlations between attitudes towards homelessness and caring behaviours, and to test if these correlations differed between the groups of women experiencing homelessness, registered nurses, and nursing students. METHODS: A cross-sectional design using convenience sampling was used to recruit women experiencing homelessness (n = 37), registered nurses (n = 90), and nursing students (n = 138) in Stockholm, Sweden between August 2019 and December 2020. The participants answered two questionnaires: the Attitudes Toward Homelessness Inventory and the Caring Behaviours Inventory-24. Correlations between ordinal variables were calculated using Spearmans rank correlation . Tests of equality between two independent correlations were performed using a Z-test applied to Fishers z-transformed correlations. An advisory board of women with lived experience of homelessness supported the interpretation of the results. RESULTS: Weak, negative correlations were identified between the Attitudes Toward Homelessness Inventory and Caring Behaviours Inventory-24. The Attitudes Toward Homelessness Inventory mean total scores (SD) were 4.1 (0.6), 4.2 (0.6), 4.1 (0.5) points for the women experiencing homelessness, registered nurse, and nursing student groups, respectively, with the corresponding scores for the Caring Behaviours Inventory-24 being 4.1 (1.1), 5.2 (0.5), 4.8 (0.7) points, respectively.

However, many current computational methods of such calculations are either inefficient or inaccurate in practice. Utilizing implicit solvent models in the molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) framework allows for efficient calculations without significant loss of accuracy. Here, GBNSR6, a new flavor of the generalized Born model, is employed in the MM/GBSA framework for measuring the binding affinity between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the human ACE2 receptor. A computational protocol is developed based on the widely studied Ras-Raf complex, which has similar binding free energy to SARS-CoV-2/ACE2. Two options for representing the dielectric boundary of the complexes are evaluated: one based on the standard Bondi radii and the other based on a newly developed set of atomic radii (OPT1), optimized specifically for protein-ligand binding. Predictions based on the two radii sets provide upper and lower bounds on the experimental references: -14.7(&#916;GbindBondi)<-10.6(&#916;GbindExp.)<-4.1(&#916;GbindOPT1) kcal/mol. The consensus estimates of the two bounds show quantitative agreement with the experiment values.

The introduced set of rules arises from the principles established internationally and, in turn, influences these principles. Thus, the EU regulatory framework on insurance is relevant to understand the potential evolution of the international standards on insurance. The analysis focuses on the rules protecting the policyholders, as this is the main objective of the insurance regulation and supervision of the European Union. Therefore, this study examines the recent Insurance Distribution Directive (IDD) salient features in light of the overall regulatory framework governing the insurance business in the European Union.

With distributed sources contributing to about half of the overall emission, CO 2 capture from the atmosphere (direct air capture, DAC) is more relevant than ever. We here report an electrochemically-mediated DAC system which utilizes affinity of redox-active quinone moieties towards CO 2 molecules, and unlike incumbent chemisorption technologies which require temperature or pH swing, rely solely on the electrochemical voltage for CO 2 capture and release. We demonstrate the design and operation of a DAC system with stackable bipolar cells using quinone chemistry. Specifically, poly(vinylanthraquinone) (PVAQ) negative electrode undergoes a two-electron reduction reaction and reversibly complexes with CO 2 , leading to CO 2 sequestration from the feed stream. The subsequent PVAQ oxidation, conversely, results in release of CO 2 . We report the performance of both small- and meso-scale cells for DAC with feed CO 2 concentrations as low as 400 ppm (0.04%), and successfully demonstrate energy consumption as low as ~113 kJ per mole of CO 2 captured. Notably, the bipolar cell construct is modular and expandable, equally suitable for small and large plants.

While considerable information regarding COVID-19 is being published every day, it is challenging to filter out the most relevant or appropriate information for our individual practice. The Spine Society of Singapore convened via a teleconference on April 24, 2020 to collaborate on a national level and share collective wisdom in order to tackle the ongoing crisis. In the teleconference, 13 spine surgeons from across various hospitals in Singapore constituted the panel of experts. The following topics were discussed: repurposing of surgeons, continuity of spine services, introduction of telemedicine, triaging of spinal surgeries, preoperative testing, new challenges in performing spine surgery, and preparing for the post-pandemic era. While some issues required only the sharing of best practices, the Delphi panel method was adopted to form a consensus on others. Existing spine specific triage guidelines were debated and a locally accepted set of guidelines was established. Although preoperative testing is currently not performed routinely, the panel voted in favor of its implementation because they concluded that it is vital to protect themselves, their colleagues, and their patients. Solutions to operating room specific concerns were also discussed. This article reflects the opinions and insights shared during this meeting and reviews the evidence relevant to the issues that were raised. The rapid consensus reached during the teleconference has enabled us to be concerted, and thus stronger, in our national efforts to provide the best standard of care via our spine services in these challenging times.

Although patients with vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) have high levels of antibodies to platelet factor 4 (PF4)-polyanion complexes, the exact mechanism of the development of thrombosis is still unknown. Here we reported serum studies as well as proteomics and genomics analyses demonstrating a massive complement activation potentially linked to the presence of anti-PF4 antibodies in a patient with severe VITT. At admission, complement activity of the classical and lectin pathways were absent (0% for both) with normal levels of the alternative pathway (73%) in association with elevated levels of the complement activation marker sC5b-9 (630 ng/mL [n.v. 139-462 ng/mL]) and anti-PF4 IgG (1.918 OD [n.v. 0.136-0.300 OD]). The immunoblotting analysis of C2 showed the complete disappearance of its normal band at 110 kDa. Intravenous immunoglobulin treatment allowed to recover complement activity of the classical pathway (91%) and lectin pathway (115%), to reduce levels of sC5b-9 (135 ng/mL) and anti-PF4 IgG (0.681 OD) and to normalize the C2 pattern at immunoblotting. Proteomics and genomics analyses in addition to serum studies showed that the absence of complement activity during VITT was not linked to alterations of the C2 gene but rather to a strong complement activation leading to C2 consumption.

Currently, such assays are exclusively restricted to nucleic acid detection. In this investigation, a virus protein serum assay has been proposed in a one-step and reagent-less route. Specifically, in this assay, the main protease of the virus is targeted by a short probe mimicking its substrate. While the probe-protein interaction brings them together, a fluorescent thiol targeting molecule reacts with the free thiol groups on the target protein near the probe, generating a fluorescence signal proportional to the concentration of the target. This induces an electroactive 2D peptide nano-network on the sensing surface only in the presence of the target protein. The sensitivity of the method is enhanced through potential electrochemical scanning during incubation with serum samples. The successful detection of the virus marker protein in the serum of the infected patients encourages further development of incorporation of this method into clinical practice.","output":"Thiol-sensitive probe enables dynamic electrochemical assembly of serum protein for detecting SARS-Cov-2 marker protease in clinical samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence and the rapid spread of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) have resulted in a global public health crisis.

Family psychoeducation (FP) has been shown to lessen caregiver burden, improve caregiver functioning, and improve outcomes in patients. However, the impact of FP delivered specifically to caregivers on patient outcomes has not been well explored, particularly for early schizophrenia. Furthermore, there is a lack of research examining the benefits of telehealth-based psychoeducation for caregivers on either patient or caregiver outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The Family Intervention in Recent-Onset Schizophrenia Treatment (FIRST) study is a randomized controlled trial of patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and their caregivers, which is designed to evaluate the effect of telehealth-based, caregiver-focused, study-provided psychoeducation versus usual care (UC) on patient treatment failure (TF). The impact of study-provided psychoeducation on caregiver burden is also investigated. METHODS: Eligible patients and their designated caregivers were randomly assigned to either the study-provided psychoeducation (16 sessions of telehealth-based psychoeducation over 6 months) or UC group, stratified by antipsychotic treatment (paliperidone palmitate or oral antipsychotic). The major TF events (ie, psychiatric hospitalization or intervention, arrest or incarceration, and suicide attempts) were assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months after baseline. A proportional means model using mean cumulative function was used to assess between-group differences in the mean cumulative number of TF events over 12 months. Caregiver burden was assessed using the Involvement Evaluation Questionnaire and 12-item Short Form Health Survey. RESULTS: A total of 148 pairs of participants were enrolled in the study, of whom 96 (64.9%) patients and 94 (63.5%) caregivers completed the 12-month follow-up. The mean number of sessions in the study-provided psychoeducation group was 7.7 (SD 5.9). No differences were observed between the study-provided psychoeducation and UC groups in patient outcomes (rates of TF: 70% vs 67%; P=.90) or measures of caregiver burden (assessment of caregiver distress and physical and mental health). However, post hoc analyses revealed lower relapse rates in patients who received paliperidone palmitate than in those who received oral antipsychotics at all time points. Although the FIRST study did not meet the primary end point, several key lessons were identified to inform future caregiver-focused, telehealth-based FP interventions. Lack of study-provided psychoeducation, focus on caregiver-only intervention, difficulties with enrollment, and caregiverCtreatment team coordination may have affected the outcomes of the FIRST study. CONCLUSIONS: Key insights from the FIRST study suggest the potential importance of supporting sufficient caregiver engagement; communication between clinicians, patients, and family members regarding treatment plans; and solidifying the relationship between clinicians providing psychoeducation to the caregiver and patient treatment team.

RCT evidence for other respiratory viral illnesses shows no significant benefit of masks in limiting transmission but is of poor quality and not SARS-CoV-2 specific. There is an urgent need for evidence from randomized controlled trials to investigate the efficacy of surgical and cloth masks on transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and user reported outcomes such as comfort and compliance.","output":"Efficacy of surgical masks or cloth masks in the prevention of viral transmission: Systematic review, meta-analysis, and proposal for future trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on CoVs, the genomic structure is arranged in a +ssRNA with approximately 30 kb in length which is the biggest known RNA viruses including a 5'-cap structure and 3'-poly-A tail.

The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy in preserving the oncological surgical practice at our Institution during the most critical months of the COVID-19 epidemic by analyzing the surgical pathology activity. METHODS: The number of oncological surgical resections submitted to histopathological examination from 9th March 2020 to 8th May 2020 were collected as well staging/grading data and compared with the previous three pre-COVID-19 years (2017-2019). RESULTS: Overall, no decrease was observed for most tumor sites (5/9) while breast resections showed the largest drop (109 vs. 160; -31.9%), although a full recovery was already noticed during the second half of the period. Conversely, the selected control benchmarks showed a sharp decrease (-80.4%). Distribution of pathological TNM stages (or tumor grades for central nervous system tumors) showed no significant differences during the lockdown compared with previous years (p > .05).

One of the most notable effects however was the rapid and sudden transition of nearly all courses at most institutions to an online environment. And while there are a growing number of courses offered online already, this transition to nearly 100% remote education presented numerous challenges for instructors and students of face-to-face and hybrid style courses. Since student perceptions are closely tied to recruitment and retention, it is important to know if there are differences in student perceptions present in the way different courses are taught. This study extends the work of other authors that have investigated student perceptions by looking specifically at how the COVID-19 pandemic may have changed student views of course difficulty and quality both overall and across discipline or institution categories. Course evaluations from 837 courses from 191 different schools archived on RateMyProfessors.com were used in a general linear model where a statistically significant overall decline of 6% in perceived course difficulty and 4% decline in perceived quality was detected. In addition to calculating this mean decrease, courses were also categorized on the basis of academic discipline (Business, Engineering and Mathematics, Humanities, Natural Sciences, Social Sciences), institution type (2-Year, 4-Year), and whether instructors had previous experience teaching online courses (No, Yes) to determine any variation in differences that may have appeared as a result of more nuanced details in course type or delivery. Most notably, declines in course difficulty were slightly more apparent with instructors that had no previous online teaching experience. No other discipline, institution type, or teaching experience interactions were detected with either difficulty or quality variation. These data suggest that there were very real changes in perceived quality and difficulty but that these changes were largely universal irrespective of discipline, institution type, or prior experience teaching online (with exception of course difficulty).","output":"Variation in Student Perceptions of Higher Education Course Quality and Difficulty as a Result of Widespread Implementation of Online Education During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Proactive approaches in preventing future epidemics include pathogen discovery prior to their emergence in human and/or animal populations. Playing an important role in pathogen discovery, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) enables the characterization of microbial and viral genetic diversity within a given sample. In particular, metagenomic HTS allows the unbiased taxonomic profiling of sequences; hence, it can identify novel and highly divergent pathogens such as viruses. Newly discovered viral sequences must be further investigated using genomic characterization, molecular and serological screening, and/or invitro and invivo characterization. Several outbreak and surveillance studies apply unbiased generic HTS to characterize the whole genome sequences of suspected pathogens. In contrast, this study aimed to screen for novel and unexpected pathogens in previously generated HTS datasets and use this information as a starting point for the establishment of an early warning system (EWS). As a proof of concept, the EWS was applied to HTS datasets and archived samples from the 2018C9 West Nile virus (WNV) epidemic in Germany. A metagenomics read classifier detected sequences related to genome sequences of various members of Riboviria. We focused the further EWS investigation on viruses belonging to the families Peribunyaviridae and Reoviridae, under suspicion of causing co-infections in WNV-infected birds. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the reovirus genome sequences clustered with sequences assigned to the species Umatilla virus (UMAV), whereas a new peribunyavirid, tentatively named Hedwig virus (HEDV), belonged to a putative novel genus of the family Peribunyaviridae. In follow-up studies, newly developed molecular diagnostic assays detected fourteen UMAV-positive wild birds from different German cities and eight HEDV-positive captive birds from two zoological gardens. UMAV was successfully cultivated in mosquito C6/36 cells inoculated with a blackbird liver. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the power of the applied EWS for the discovery and characterization of unexpected viruses in repurposed sequence datasets, followed by virus screening and cultivation using archived sample material. The EWS enhances the strategies for pathogen recognition before causing sporadic cases and massive outbreaks and proves to be a reliable tool for modern outbreak preparedness.","output":"In actionan early warning system for the detection of unexpected or novel pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Communication within the circle of care is central to coordinated, safe, and effective care; yet patients, caregivers, and health care providers often experience poor communication and fragmented care. Through a sequential program of research, the Loop Research Collaborative developed a web-based, asynchronous clinical communication system for team-based care. Loop assembles the circle of care centered on a patient, in private networking spaces called Patient Loops. The patient, their caregiver, or both are part of the Patient Loop. The communication is threaded, it can be filtered and sorted in multiple ways, it is securely stored, and can be exported for upload to a medical record. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to implement and evaluate Loop. The study reporting adheres to the Standards for Reporting Implementation Research. METHODS: The study was a hybrid type II mixed methods design to simultaneously evaluate Loops clinical and implementation effectiveness, and implementation barriers and facilitators in 6 health care sites. Data included monthly user check-in interviews and bimonthly surveys to capture patient or caregiver experience of continuity of care, in-depth interviews to explore barriers and facilitators based on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), and Loop usage extracted directly from the Loop system. RESULTS: We recruited 25 initiating health care providers across 6 sites who then identified patients or caregivers for recruitment. Of 147 patient or caregiver participants who were assessed and met screening criteria, 57 consented and 52 were enrolled on Loop, creating 52 Patient Loops. Across all Patient Loops, 96 additional health care providers consented to join the Loop teams. Loop usage was followed for up to 8 months. The median number of messages exchanged per team was 1 (range 0-28). The monthly check-in and CFIR interviews showed that although participants acknowledged that Loop could potentially fill a gap, existing modes of communication, workflows, incentives, and the lack of integration with the hospital electronic medical records and patient portals were barriers to its adoption. While participants acknowledged Loops potential value for engaging the patient and caregiver, and for improving communication within the patients circle of care, Loops relative advantage was not realized during the study and there was insufficient tension for change. Missing data limited the analysis of continuity of care. CONCLUSIONS: Fundamental structural and implementation challenges persist toward realizing Loops potential as a shared system of asynchronous communication. Barriers include health information system integration; system, organizational, and individual tension for change; and a fee structure for health care provider compensation for asynchronous communication.","output":"A Clinical Communication Tool (Loop) for Team-Based Care in Pediatric and Adult Care Settings: Hybrid Mixed Methods Implementation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Like other countries, Burkina Faso is affected by the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) This study analyzes the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on Burkina Faso's economy For this purpose, we have made use of a single country's computable general equilibrium model and formulated two alternative scenarios based on the likely duration of the pandemic In the first scenario, we assume that the pandemic will last three (3) months, while in the second scenario, it spreads over six (6) months The results indicate significant impacts on both macroeconomic and sectoral level and on households' well-being First, economic growth could drop from 5 7 percent in 2019 to a range between +1 38 percent and -1 75 percent in 2020 Moreover, the unemployment is expected to grow (between +1 93 percent and +5 92 percent) because of a sharp drop in sectoral productions (ranging from -3 percent to -12 percent) In addition, our findings reveal a contraction of sectoral exports by -6 percent for extraction products (especially gold) to -16 percent for agricultural products (especially the cotton) Finally, the rise of consumer prices and growing unemployment will greatly dampen the purchasing power of households for all socio-professional categories","output":"How could the covid-19 pandemic impact the economy of Burkina Faso?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Approximately 35% of individuals over age 70 report difficulty with mobility. Muscle weakness has been demonstrated to be one contributor to mobility limitations in older adults. The purpose of this study was to examine the moderating effect of brain-predicted age difference (an index of biological brain age/health derived from structural neuroimaging) on the relationship between leg strength and mobility. Methods In community dwelling older adults (N = 57, 74.7  6.93 years; 68% women), we assessed the relationship between isokinetic leg extensor strength and a composite measure of mobility [mobility battery assessment (MBA)] using partial Pearson correlations and multifactorial regression modeling. Brain predicted age (BPA) was calculated from T1 MR-images using a validated machine learning Gaussian Process regression model to explore the moderating effect of BPA difference (BPAD; BPA minus chronological age). Results Leg strength was significantly correlated with BPAD (r = -0.317, p < 0.05) and MBA score (r = 0.541, p < 0.001). Chronological age, sex, leg strength, and BPAD explained 63% of the variance in MBA performance (p < 0.001). BPAD was a significant moderator of the relationship between strength and MBA, accounting for 7.0% of MBA score variance [R 2 = 0.044, F(1,51) = 6.83, p = 0.01].

METHODS: An online survey was disseminated to all hospital staff via electronic channels. The clinical audit sphinx software was used for data collection and analysis. RESULTS: The total number of responses was n = 728, almost double the rate from 2018 (N = 393). A total of 78% (N = 551) of participants were vaccinated last year. A total of 94% (N = 677) of participants reported their intention to be vaccinated this year. The main barriers listed were being unable to find time (32%, N = 36), side effects (30%, N = 33) and thinking that it does not work (21%, N = 23). The most popular suggestions for how to increase uptake were more mobile immunisation clinics (72%, N = 517) and more information on the vaccine (50%, N = 360).

The concept of senescence is evolved, and the novel understanding of senescence-associated reprogramming/stemness has emerged. This new concept emphasizes senescence as not only cell cycle arrest but describes that subsets of senescent cells induced by chemotherapy can re-enter cell cycles, proliferate rapidly, and acquire \\"stemness\\" status. Cancer therapeutics, including chemo-radiation triggers toxicity effects through damaging mitochondria, primarily through the upregulation of mtROS production leading to subsequent mtDNA and telomeric DNA damage elicitng DNA damage responses (DDR). The ultimate goal of this review is to highlight the new concept of senescence-associated stemness that is induced by cancer treatment and its adverse effects on the vascular system. We will describe how chemo-radiation exerts toxicity effects by simultaneously producing reactive oxygen species in mitochondria and promoting DDR in the nucleus. We discuss the potential of clinical targeting poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase which might prevent downstream mitochondrial dysfunction and confer protection to cancer survivors. Overall we emphasize the importance of recognizing the consequences of cardio-toxic effects of several cancer treatments and therefore developing personalized therapeutic approaches to screen for inflammatory and cardiac testing for better patient survival.","output":"Mitochondria and chronic effects of cancer therapeutics: The clinical implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A) is a rare but severe complication in adults infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, the pathophysiology remains elusive, as the limited number of reports preclude a broader understanding of this syndrome. We conducted this systematic review to explore the clinical spectrum of MIS-A, in particular its rheumatological manifestations. Meta-analyses of case-series were also performed. We identified 28 patients from 14 case reports and two case series of MIS-A. This disease occurred equally in both genders, with a mean age of 33+10 years old, and predominantly in those of African descent (40%). Rheumatological manifestations consisted of Kawasaki Disease (KD)-like symptoms. Ninety percent of patients had positive COVID-19 serology tests, while 48% of patients were negative for COVID-19 RT-PCR test. Twelve patients were admitted to ICU and unfortunately two died. Although the signs and symptoms of MIS mimicked KD, the gastro-intestinal findings were more prominent in the former group. The demographic make-up was also different, with MIS-A occurring mostly in those of African descent. Importantly, unlike their paediatric counterparts, the adult group did not have coronary artery abnormalities. Long-term monitoring is needed as safety data is scarce. Of note, although the prognosis of MIS-A is excellent, the life-threatening nature of this syndrome demands intensive care unit level of care and mechanical support. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a constellation of KD symptoms in an adult patient should alert the clinician to the possibility of MIS-A.","output":"Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis of the rheumatological spectrum of complications post COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The historic outbreak of the novel coronavirus (SARS CoV-2) sent concern and even panic around the world due to the unknown nature of this disease As a result, the US implemented a whole-of government approach to tackle the outbreak of this deadly virus The national and global impact of an uncontrolled COVID-19 outbreak, threatens the US healthcare system and our way of life with potential to cause riveting economic and national security instability As a result of the health impact on American society, the US military must also take precaution to preserve and defend our nation's fighting force This charge has created a unique opportunity for military medicine to take the lead at the front line to combat this biologic viral threat","output":"A Comprehensive Overview of the US Army Dentistry Response to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study uses a relational work design perspective to explore substitutes for leadership behaviors that promote team meaningfulness and performance.

Upon incubation, ARC (170 nm mean size, ?41 mV ) did not affect viability, cell proliferation, and expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and E-selectin under basal conditions, but reduced expression of both molecules and secretion of IL-6 induced by lypopolysaccharide (LPS), Pam3CSK4 or Escherichia coli.

We aimed to determine if hs-TnT levels and their timing are independent predictors of adverse events in these patients. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review was performed for all patients hospitalized at our institution between 23 March 2020 and 13 April 2020 who were found to be COVID-19-positive. Clinical, demographic, and laboratory variables including initial and peak hs-TnT were recorded. Univariable and multivariable analyses were completed for a primary composite endpoint of in-hospital death, intubation, need for critical care, or cardiac arrest. RESULTS: In the 276 patients analysed, initial hs-TnT above the median (&#8805;17 ng/L) was associated with increased length of stay, need for vasoactive medications, and death, along with the composite endpoint (OR 3.92, p < 0.001). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that elevated initial hs-TnT was independently associated with the primary endpoint (OR 2.92, p = 0.01). Late-peaking hs-TnT (OR 2.19 for each additional day until peak, p < 0.001) was also independently associated with the composite endpoint.

The aim of this study was to develop a risk perception scale for public health emergencies and test its validity and reliability during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods: Guided by the theoretical model of risk perception, an initial scale was generated through literature review, group meetings, resident interviews, and expert consultation. A pretest and item screening were then conducted to develop a formal risk perception scale for public health emergencies. Finally, the reliability and validity of the scale were validated through a questionnaire survey of 504 Chinese adults. Results: The final scale had 9 items. The content validity index of the scale was 0.968, and the content validity index of individual items ranged from 0.83 to 1.00. Three common factors, dread risk perception, severe risk perception, and unknown risk perception, were extracted for exploratory factor analysis, and together they explained 66.26% of the variance in the score.

Participants included 349 individuals (Age Range = 26-89) from the Notre Dame Study of Health & Well-being (NDHWB) who completed a 28-day, daily diary study at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Older individuals were less stress reactive than younger individuals. Within individuals, however, stress reactivity was buffered by daily positive affect, and exacerbated by daily pandemic worry. Finally, although daily positive affect buffered daily stress reactivity, this effect was weaker on days individuals were more worried about the COVID-19 pandemic.

Several COVID-19 vaccines play a significant role in a high degree of protection against the DV. The primary purpose of this meta-analysis is to estimate the pooled effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines against the DV in terms of risk ratio (RR) among fully vaccinated, compared to unvaccinated populations. Methods: We carried out a systematic review, with meta-analysis of original studies focused on COVID-19 vaccines effectiveness against a DV clinical perspective among fully COVID-19 vaccinated populations, compared to placebo (unvaccinated populations), published between 1 May 2021 and 30 September 2021. Eleven studies containing the data of 17.2 million participants were identified and included in our study. Pooled estimates of COVID-19 vaccines effectiveness (i.e., risk ratio, RR) against the DV with 95% confidence intervals were assessed using random-effect models. Publication bias was assessed using Eggers regression test and funnel plot to investigate potential sources of heterogeneity and identify any differences in study design. Results: A total population of 17.2 million (17,200,341 people) were screened for the COVID-19 vaccines effectiveness against the DV. We found that 61.13% of the study population were fully vaccinated with two doses of COVID-19 vaccines. The weighted pooled incidence of COVID-19 infection was more than double (20.07%) among the unvaccinated population, compared to the fully vaccinated population (8.16%). Overall, the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine against the DV was 85% (RR = 0.15, 95% CI: 0.07C0.31). The effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines varied slidably by study designs, 87% (RR = 0.13, 95% CI: 0.06C0.30) and 84% (RR = 0.16, 95% CI: 0.02, 1.64) for cohort and case-control studies, respectively. Conclusions: The effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines were noted to offer higher protection against the DV among populations who received two vaccine doses compared with the unvaccinated population.

The tests revealed 34% of samples with presence of GM proteins. It is concluded that the biosafety standards in force in Brazil do not allow the assurance of on-Farm conservation of maize. The sectors that contribute to agrobiodiversity conservation and do not benefit from using GM seeds are taking on the burden of this process.

Feedback from paediatricians with cardiology expertise (PEC) would be an important exercise to learn how we have coped with outpatient cardiology work in the current pandemic and how we could prepare for the future.ObjectivesTo get feedback from PECs about their current joint clinic backlog and their experiences how they have managed to provide cardiology services over the past 1 yearMethodsSurveys were sent to group of Paediatricians with special expertise in cardiology group via link for preset questionnaire.Results44 PECs responded to the survey. A range between 0C16 outreach clinics were cancelled during the current pandemic with the average being 5 clinics per PEC. About 40% of the respondents had around 50 patients awaiting appointments as a result of backlog whereas 27% had between 100C400 patients on their list. A wide variety of methods were used from seeing only the urgent patients, vetting each patient and prioritising the list, continuing with remote clinics etc. but around 18% of the respondents felt that they are struggling with their workload. Some PECs have increased their PEC cardiac clinics to cope with the increased numbers. Reassuringly 90% of the respondents did not see any increase in complaints or unexpected patient deterioration due to delayed reviews. 45% of the respondents felt that 10% of their outpatient work could be done remotely whereas 37% felt that 20C50% of their work could be completed remotely. 95% of the PECs did not see any of their cardiac patients deteriorating secondary to Covid infections and most of the respondents agreed with the RCPCH guidance of clinically extremely vulnerable group in regards to classification of children with complex congenital heart disease.

Anti-TCV hyperimmune turkey serum and normal turkey serum were used as positive or negative control serum for optimization of the ELISA system. Goat anti-turkey immunoglobulin G (light plus heavy chains) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was used as detector antibody. The performance of the ELISA system was evaluated with 45 normal turkey sera and 325 turkey sera from the field and the cutoff point was determined. Serum samples of turkeys experimentally infected with TCV collected sequentially from 1 to 63 days postinfection were applied to the established antibody-capture ELISA using IBV antigens. The optimum conditions for differentiation between anti-TCV hyperimmune serum and normal turkey serum were serum dilution at 1:40 and conjugate dilution at 1:1600. Of the 325 sera from the field, 175 were positive for TCV by immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) assay. The sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA relative to IFA test were 93.1% and 96.7%, respectively, based on the results of serum samples from the field turkey flocks using the optimum cutoff point of 0.18 as determined by the logistic regression method. The ELISA values of all 45 normal turkey sera were completely separated from that of IFA-positive sera. The ELISA results of serum samples collected from turkeys experimentally infected with TCV were comparable to that of the IFA assay.

METHODS: Retrospective study of all HIV-infected patients (n = 147) admitted to a single intensive care unit (ICU) for ARF between 1996 and 2006. RESULTS: ARF revealed the diagnosis of HIV infection in 43 (29.2%) patients. Causes of ARF were bacterial pneumonia (n = 74), Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP, n = 52), other opportunistic infections (n = 19), and noninfectious pulmonary disease (n = 33); the distribution of causes did not change over the 10-year study period. Two or more causes were identified in 33 patients. The 43 patients on ART more frequently had bacterial pneumonia and less frequently had opportunistic infections (P = 0.02). Noninvasive ventilation was needed in 49 patients and endotracheal intubation in 42. Hospital mortality was 19.7%. Factors independently associated with mortality were mechanical ventilation [odds ratio (OR) = 8.48, P < 0.0001], vasopressor use (OR, 4.48; P = 0.03), time from hospital admission to ICU admission (OR, 1.05 per day; P = 0.01), and number of causes (OR, 3.19; P = 0.02).

Methods: STEMI cases undergoing PPCI from January 23 to March 29 between 2019 and 2020 were retrospectively compared. PPCI parameters mainly included total ischemic time (TIT), the period from symptom onset to first medical contact (S-to-FMC), the period from FMC to wire (FMC-to-W) and the period from door to wire (D-to-W). Furthermore, the association of COVID-19 pandemic with delayed PPCI risk was further analyzed. Results: A total of 14 PPCI centers were included, with 100 and 220 STEMI cases undergoing PPCI in 2020 and 2019, respectively. As compared to 2019, significant prolongations occurred in reperfusion procedures (P < 0.001) including TIT (420 vs. 264 min), S-to-FMC (5 vs. 3 h), FMC-to-W (113 vs. 95 min) and D-to-W (83 vs. 65 min).

Consequently, improved therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is a newly potential therapy that can recognize specific surface antigen without major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restriction. Mucin 1 (MUC1) is an attractive candidate antigen as it is highly expressed and associated with poor prognosis and survival in CCA. We, therefore, set forth to create the fourth-generation CAR (CAR4) construct containing anti-MUC1-single-chain variable fragment (scFv) and three co-stimulatory domains (CD28, CD137, and CD27) linked to CD3 and evaluate anti-MUC1-CAR4 T cells in CCA models. Compared to untransduced T cells, anti-MUC1-CAR4 T cells produced increased levels of TNF-, IFN- and granzyme B when exposed to MUC1-expressing KKU-100 and KKU-213A CCA cells (all p < 0.05).

There is international concern that vulnerable defendants are not identified, undermining their right to a fair trial. AIMS To explore the prevalence of a wide range of mental disorders in criminal defendants and estimate the proportion likely to be unfit to plead. METHOD We employed two-stage screening methodology to estimate the prevalence of mental illness, neurodevelopmental disorders and unfitness to plead, in 3322 criminal defendants in South London. Sampling was stratified according to whether defendants attended court from the community or custody. Face-to-face interviews, using diagnostic instruments and assessments of fitness to plead, were administered (n = 503). Post-stratification probability weighting provided estimates of the overall prevalence of mental disorders and unfitness to plead. RESULTS Mental disorder was more common in those attending court from custody, with 48.5% having at least one psychiatric diagnosis compared with 20.3% from the community. Suicidality was frequently reported (weighted prevalence 71.2%; 95% CI 64.2-77.3). Only 16.7% of participants from custody and 4.6% from the community were referred to the liaison and diversion team; 2.1% (1.1-4.0) of defendants were estimated to be unfit to plead, with a further 3.2% (1.9-5.3) deemed 'borderline unfit'. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of mental illness and neurodevelopmental disorders in defendants is high.

The aim of this review was to quantify the isolated effect of age on severe COVID-19 outcomes. We searched Pubmed to find relevant studies published in 2020. Two independent reviewers evaluated them using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. We extracted the results and assessed seven domains of bias for each study. After adjusting for important age-related risk factors, the isolated effect of age was estimated using meta-regression. Twelve studies met our inclusion criteria: four studies for COVID-19 disease severity, seven for mortality, and one for admission to ICU. The crude effect of age (5.2% and 13.4% higher risk of disease severity and death per age year, respectively) substantially decreased when adjusting for important age-dependent risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease/cerebrovascular disease, compromised immunity, previous respiratory disease, renal disease). Adjusting for all six comorbidities indicates a 2.7% risk increase for disease severity (two studies), and no additional risk of death per year of age (five studies). The indication of a rather weak influence of age on COVID-19 disease severity after adjustment for important age-dependent risk factors should be taken in consideration when implementing age-related preventative measures (e.g., age-dependent work restrictions).","output":"The Age-Related Risk of Severe Outcomes Due to COVID-19 Infection: A Rapid Review, Meta-Analysis, and Meta-Regression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To identify the prevalence and therapeutic consequences of spontaneous intracranial artery dissection (IAD) at the acute phase of ischemic stroke. METHODS We reviewed clinical and imaging data of consecutive patients attending our center for mechanical thrombectomy (MT) between January 2012 and November 2017. IAD was defined according to published criteria and our own angiographic criteria (no clot following MT, and normalization of the vessel caliber after stenting). RESULTS IAD was retrospectively diagnosed in 13/391 (3%) patients (inter-rater agreement =0.885, P<0.001). It was an extending of extracranial dissection in 7/13 (54%) patients. A total of 21 recanalization approaches (with or without IV tissue plasminogen activator) were analyzed in 13 patients. A medical approach was used in 7/21 (33%), MT in 7/21 (33%) (stent retriever=6, thromboaspiration=1), and permanent stenting in 7/21 (33%). A rescue recanalization was necessary after 8/14 (57%) approaches without stenting. Stenting was associated with a best rate of recanalization (P=0.001) and with a trend towards a lower rate of ischemic recurrence (P=0.057). Stenting of a circulating false lumen failed to recanalize the artery in two patients. At the last follow-up, no patient had developed a subarachnoid hemorrhage due to the dissection. The outcome at 3 months was favorable in 8/13 (62%) patients. One patient died at 3 weeks owing to a severe cerebellar infarction. CONCLUSION IAD is a rare diagnosis that should be systematically considered in patients with intracranial large vessel occlusion, especially in patients with extracranial artery dissection and when MT does not retrieve any clot.

DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. SETTING Hospitals throughout the United States. PATIENTS Five percent random national sample of elderly Medicare beneficiaries (age  66 yr) who underwent 1 of 227 operations previously defined as high risk during an inpatient stay at an acute care hospital between January 1, 2005, and November 30, 2009. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS We identified 117,917 episodes for older patients who had high-risk surgery; 4% received prolonged mechanical ventilation during the hospitalization. Patients who received prolonged mechanical ventilation had higher 1-year mortality rate than patients who did not have prolonged ventilation (64% [95% CI, 62-65%] vs 17% [95% CI, 16.4-16.9%]). Thirty-day survivors who received prolonged mechanical ventilation had a 1-year mortality rate of 47% (95% CI, 45-48%). Thirty-day survivors who did not receive prolonged ventilation were more likely to be discharged home than patients who received prolonged ventilation 71% versus 10%. Patients who received prolonged ventilation and were not discharged by postoperative day 30 had a substantially increased 1-year mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 4.39 [95% CI, 3.29-5.85]) compared with patients discharged home by day 30.

We find that in LADs with the highest deprivation quartile, where there is a 1 percentage point increase in Black-African (regression coefficient 2.86; 95% CI 1.08C4.64), Black-Caribbean (9.66: 95% CI 5.25C14.06) and Bangladeshi (1.95: 95% CI 1.14C2.76) communities, there is a significantly higher age-adjusted COVID-19 mortality compared to respective control populations. In addition, the spatial regression results indicated positive significant correlation between the age-adjusted mortality in one LAD and the age-adjusted mortality in a neighbouring LAD, suggesting a spillover effect. Our results suggest targeted public health measures to support those who are deprived and belong to BAME communities as well as to encourage restricted movement between different localities to limit disease propagation.","output":"The interaction of ethnicity and deprivation on COVID-19 mortality risk: a retrospective ecological study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infections cause varying degrees of haemostatic dysfunction which can be detected by clot waveform analysis (CWA), a global haemostatic marker. CWA has been shown to predict poor outcomes in severe infections with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. The effect of less severe bacterial and viral infections on CWA has not been established. We hypothesized that different infections influence CWA distinctively. Patients admitted with bacterial infections, dengue and upper respiratory tract viral infections were recruited if they had an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) measured on admission. APTT-based CWA was performed on Sysmex CS2100i automated analyser using Dade Actin FSL reagent. CWA parameters [(maximum velocity (min1), maximum acceleration (min2) and maximum deceleration (max2)] were compared against control patients. Infected patients (n = 101) had longer aPTT than controls (n = 112) (34.37  7.72 s vs 27.80  1.59 s, p < 0.001), with the mean ( SD) aPTT longest in dengue infection (n = 36) (37.99  7.93 s), followed by bacterial infection (n = 52) (33.96  7.33 s) and respiratory viral infection (n = 13) (29.98  3.92 s).

Responsibility is a useful lens through which to examine the current state of food poverty in the UK in the context of the Covid-19 crisis, noting that this concept contains several paradoxes. Currently, responsibility involves the voluntary sector, the food industry and the state, a situation which the author has been exploring for the last five years in an ethnographic study of food poverty and food aid in the UK. Food aid organizations, especially food banks, have mushroomed during the period of austerity. This reveals the first paradox: namely, that the existence of food banks conveys the message that something is being done, but in actuality this is very far from being sufficient to meet the needs of either the old or new food insecure. The second paradox is that at the onset of the crisis, a government which had been responsible for inflicting austerity on the country for 10 years, dramatically reversed some of its policies. However, predictably, this did not change the situation vis--vis food insecurity. The third paradox is that the frequent rhetoric invoking the two world wars has not resulted in lessons being learned C notably, the creation of a ministry to deal with food and rationing, as in the Second World War. The final paradox relates to Brexit and its likely deleterious effects on food security, particularly if no deal is achieved with the European Union, as seems likely. The voluntary food aid sector, try as it may, cannot possibly assume responsibility for the long-standing and now hugely increased problems of food insecurity.

Managing orthopaedic emergencies effectively, while at the same time protecting patients and staff, remains a challenge. We explore how the UK lockdown affected the rate, distribution, and type of orthopaedic emergency department (ED) presentations, using the same period in 2019 as reference. This article discusses considerations for the ED and trauma wards to help to maintain the safety of patients and healthcare providers with an emphasis on more remote geography. METHODS: The study was conducted from 23 March 2020 to 5 May 2020 during the full lockdown period (2020 group) and compared to the same time frame in 2019 (2019 group). Included are all patients who attended the ED at Raigmore Hospital during this period from both the local area and tertiary referral from throughout the UK Highlands. Data was collected and analyzed through the ED Information System (EDIS) as well as ward and theatre records. RESULTS: A total of 1,978 patients presented to the ED during the lockdown period, compared to 4,777 patients in the same timeframe in 2019; a reduction of 58.6%. Orthopaedic presentations in 2020 and 2019 were 736 (37.2%) and 1,729 (36.2%) respectively, representing a 57.4% reduction. During the lockdown, 43.6% of operations were major procedures (n = 48) and 56.4% were minor procedures (n = 62), representing a significant proportional shift. CONCLUSION: During the COVID- 19 lockdown period there was a significant reduction in ED attendances and orthopaedic presentations compared to 2019. We also observed that there was a proportional increase in fractures in elderly patients and in minor injuries requiring surgery. These represented the majority of the orthopaedic workload during the lockdown period of 2020. Given this shift towards smaller surgical procedures, we suggest that access to a minor operating theatre in or close to ED would be desirable in the event of a second wave or future crisis.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on orthopaedic emergency presentations in a remote and rural population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent data from across the globe show that COVID-19 is disproportionately affecting those who are already adversely impacted by social determinants of health.

The major limitations arise from their inadequacy in demonstrating direct linkages between resilience and development, a narrow characterisation of proposed indicators, and the complexity of deploying them to real world problems.

CR3022 binds strongly to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, but chooses a different site rather than the receptor-binding motif (RBM) of RBD, allowing its combined use with other mAbs against new emerging virus variants. Totally 235,000 mAbs structures were generated using the RosettaAntibodyDesign software, resulting in top 10 scored CR3022-RBD complexes with critical mutations and compared to the native one, all having the potential to block virus-host cell interaction. Of these 10 finalists, two candidates were further identified in the CG simulations to be clearly best against all virus variants, and surprisingly, all 10 candidates and the native CR3022 did exhibit a higher affinity for the Omicron variant with its highest number of mutations (15) of them all considered in this study. The multiscale protocol gives us a powerful rational tool to design efficient mAbs. The electrostatic interactions play a crucial role and appear to be controlling the affinity and complex building. Clearly, mAbs carrying a lower net charge show a higher affinity.

It then integrates this predictive model into a prescriptive model to optimize vaccine allocation, formulated as a bilinear, non-convex optimization model. To solve it, this paper proposes a coordinate descent algorithm that iterates between optimizing vaccine allocations and simulating the dynamics of the pandemic. We implement the model and algorithm using real-world data in the United States.

We sought to identify incidence, antimicrobial susceptibilities, and outcomes associated with bacterial/fungal secondary infections in a large cohort of patients with COVID-19. Methods: We evaluated adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between 2 March and 31 May 2020 and hospitalized &gt;24 hours. Data extracted from medical records included diagnoses, vital signs, laboratory results, microbiological data, and antibiotic use. Microbiologically confirmed bacterial and fungal pathogens from clinical cultures were evaluated to characterize community- and health care-associated infections, including describing temporal changes in predominant organisms on presentation and throughout hospitalization. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate risk factors for HAIs. Results: A total of 3028 patients were included and accounted for 899 positive clinical cultures. Overall, 516 (17%) patients with positive cultures met criteria for infection. Community-associated coinfections were identified in 183 (6%) patients, whereas HAIs occurred in 350 (12%) patients. Fifty-seven percent of HAIs were caused by gram-negative bacteria and 19% by fungi. Antibiotic resistance increased with longer hospital stays, with incremental increases in the proportion of vancomycin resistance among enterococci and ceftriaxone and carbapenem resistance among Enterobacterales. Intensive care unit stay, invasive mechanical ventilation, and steroids were associated with HAIs.

This study aimed to investigate the correlation of COVID-19 case and death rates with possible causal climatological and sociodemographic factors for the March to May 2020 (first wave) period in a worldwide scale by statistically processing data for over one hundred countries. The weather parameters considered herein were air temperature, relative humidity, cumulative precipitation, and cloud cover, while sociodemographic factors included population density, median age, and government measures in response to the pandemic. The results of this study indicate that there is a statistically significant correlation between average atmospheric temperature and the COVID-19 case and death rates, with chi-square test p-values in the 0.001-0.02 range. Regarding sociodemographic factors, there is an even stronger dependence of the case and death rates on the population median age (p = 0.0006-0.0012). Multivariate linear regression analysis using Lasso and the forward stepwise approach revealed that the median age ranks first in importance among the examined variables, followed by the temperature and the delays in taking first governmental measures or issuing stay-at-home orders.","output":"Investigation of the Importance of Climatic Factors in COVID-19 Worldwide Intensity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the wound complication rate in patients undergoing transumbilical single-incision laparoscopic (SIL) surgery. BACKGROUND SIL surgery claims to be less invasive than conventional laparoscopy. Small SIL series have raised concerns toward a higher wound complication rate related to the transumbilical incision. METHODS In a 44-month period, 1145 consecutive SIL procedures were included. The outcomes were assessed according to the intention-to-treat analysis principle. All procedures were followed for a minimum of 6 months postoperatively, and wound complications were recorded as bleeding, infection (superficial/deep), or hernia. Patients were classified as having a wound complication or not. For all comparisons, significance level was set at P<0.05. RESULTS Pure transumbilical SIL surgery was completed in 92.84%, and additional trocars were used in 7.16%. After a median follow-up of 22.1 (range, 7.67-41.11) months, 29 wound complications (2.53%) had occurred [bleeding 0%/infection 1.05% (superficial 0.9%/deep 0.17%)/early-onset hernia 0.09%/late-onset hernia 1.40%, respectively]. Factors associated with complications were higher patient body mass index (28.164.73 vs 26.404.68 kg/m; P=0.029), longer skin incisions (3.771.62 vs 2.961.06 cm; P=0.012), and multiport SIL versus single-port SIL (8.47% vs 2.38%; P=0.019) in complicated versus uncomplicated procedures. Furthermore, a learning curve effect was noted after 500 procedures (P=0.015). CONCLUSIONS With transumbilical SIL surgery, the incidence of wound complications is acceptable low and is further reduced once the learning curve has been passed.","output":"Wound complications in 1145 consecutive transumbilical single-incision laparoscopic procedures."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Despite increases in the female surgical trainee workforce over the last decade male trainees still dominate the surgical specialties. It is well recognised that there is strong gender disparity in surgery. The wider challenges further experienced by pregnant surgical trainees are also well documented. METHOD: NHS digital data on the surgical workforce and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists COVID-19 guidance for pregnant healthcare workers was reviewed. RESULTS: Women account for 27% of the surgical workforce and the average time taken to complete training is longer for female trainees. Current guidelines for pregnant healthcare workers advise strict social distancing measures up to 28 weeks gestation with avoidance of high-risk areas including operating theatres. A non-patient facing role is advised from 28 weeks onward. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has created additional barriers for women in surgery. Restrictions for pregnant trainees, whilst vital for their wellbeing, has denied access to some essential training opportunities necessary for progression. It will likely further isolate them from the workforce and hinder their advancement into senior roles where they are already underrepresented. Although it is recognised that surgical training in general has been impacted by COVID-19 there is an argument that this disproportionately affects pregnant trainees.","output":"141 The COVID-19 Pandemic: A Disproportionate Impact on Pregnant Surgical Trainees?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Since 2011, there have been ongoing massive unexplained increases of sargassum seaweed strandings along the coastlines of Caribbean countries. The objective of our study was to describe the clinical characteristics of patients exposed to noxious emissions of decomposing sargassum seaweed. METHODS This observational study included patients from January 2018 to December 2018 for complaints attributed to decomposing sargassum seaweed. History and geographical characteristics of sargassum seaweed strandings as well as detection of ambient air hydrogen sulfide (H2S) levels were documented during the inclusion period. FINDINGS A total of 154 patients were included. Mean exposure period was 3 months. Neurological (80%), digestive (77%) and respiratory (69%) disorders were the most frequent reasons for medical visit. Temporal distribution of medical visits was related to history of strandings. Geographical origins of patients were consistent with the most impacted areas of strandings as well as the most elevated ambient air H2S levels. INTERPRETATION The toxicological syndrome induced by sargassum seaweed exposure is close to the toxidrome associated with acute H2S exposure in the range of 0-10 ppm. Our study suggests that patients living in massive stranding areas may be exposed to H2S > 5 ppm for 50 days per year.","output":"Sargassum seaweed health menace in the Caribbean: clinical characteristics of a population exposed to hydrogen sulfide during the 2018 massive stranding."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax proteins with variant interspersed repeats (VIR) are the key proteins used by the parasite to escape from the host immune system through the creation of antigenic variations. However, few studies have been done to elucidate their role as targets of immunity. Thus, this study evaluated the naturally-acquired immune response against VIR proteins in vivax malaria-infected individuals in the Republic of Korea (ROK). METHODS: Seven recombinant VIR proteins and two synthetic peptides previously studied in other countries that elicited a robust immune response were used to investigate the antibody and cellular immune response in 681 P. vivax-infected people in ROK. The expression of IgM, IgG, and IgG subclasses against each VIR antigen or against PvMSP1-19 was analysed by ELISA. PvMSP1-19, known as a promising vaccine candidate of P. vivax, was used as the positive control for immune response assessment. Furthermore, the cellular immune response to VIR antigens was evaluated by in vitro proliferative assay, cellular activation assay, and cytokine detection in mononuclear cells of the P. vivax-infected population. RESULTS: IgM or IgG were detected in 52.4% of the population. Among all the VIR antigens, VIR25 elicited the highest humoral immune response in the whole population with IgG and IgM prevalence of 27.8% and 29.2%, respectively, while PvMSP1-19 elicited even higher prevalence (92%) of IgG in the population. As for the cellular immune response, VIR-C2, PvLP2, and PvMSP1-19 induced high cell activation and secretion of IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and G-CSF in mononuclear cells from the P. vivax-infected population, comparable with results from PvMSP1-19. However, no significant proliferation response to these antigens was observed between the malaria-infected and healthy groups. CONCLUSION: Moderate natural acquisition of antibody and cellular responses in P. vivax-infected Korean malaria patients presented here are similar to that in other countries. It is interesting that the immune response to VIR antigens is conserved among malaria parasites in different countries, considering that VIR genes are highly polymorphic. This thus warrants further studies to elucidate molecular mechanisms by which human elicit immune response to the malaria parasite VIR antigens.

The purpose of this study is to use machine learning to identify clinical phenotypes for critically ill patients with MV in intensive care units (ICUs). METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted with 5013 patients who had undergone MV and treatment in the Department of Critical Care Medicine, Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Statistical and machine learning methods were used. All the data used in this study, including demographics, vital signs, circulation parameters and mechanical ventilator parameters, etc., were automatically extracted from the electronic health record (EHR) system. An external database, Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III), was used for validation. RESULTS: Phenotypes were derived from a total of 4009 patients who underwent MV using a latent profile analysis of 22 variables. The associations between the phenotypes and disease severity and clinical outcomes were assessed. Another 1004 patients in the database were enrolled for validation. Of the five derived phenotypes, phenotype I was the most common subgroup (n = 2174; 54.2%) and was mostly composed of the postoperative population. Phenotype II (n = 480; 12.0%) led to the most severe conditions. Phenotype III (n = 241; 6.01%) was associated with high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and low mean airway pressure. Phenotype IV (n = 368; 9.18%) was associated with high driving pressure, and younger patients comprised a large proportion of the phenotype V group (n = 746; 18.6%). In addition, we found that the mortality rate of Phenotype IV was significantly higher than that of the other phenotypes. In this subgroup, the number of patients in the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score segment (9,22] was 198, the number of deaths was 88, and the mortality rate was higher than 44%. However, the cumulative 28-day mortality of Phenotypes IV and II, which were 101 of 368 (27.4%) and 87 of 480 (18.1%) unique patients, respectively, was significantly higher than those of the other phenotypes. There were consistent phenotype distributions and differences in biomarker patterns by phenotype in the validation cohort, and external verification with MIMIC III further generated supportive results.

Data regarding patterns of use and effectiveness of self-referred, open-access online interventions are lacking. We evaluated an online-based treatment designed to address stress, depression, and conflict management, the Dartmouth PATH Program, in a freely available and self-guided format during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim is to determine users levels of stress and depression, and the nature of problems and triggers they reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. A secondary objective is to assess the acceptability and usability of the PATH content and determine whether such a program would be useful as a stand-alone open-access resource. The final objective is understanding the high dropout rates associated with online behavioral programs by contrasting the use pattern and program efficacy of individuals who completed session one and did not return to the program with those who came back to complete more sessions. METHODS: Cumulative anonymous data from 562 individuals were analyzed. Stress triggers, stress responses, and reported problems were analyzed using qualitative analysis techniques. Scores on usability and acceptability questionnaires were evaluated using the sign test and Wilcoxon signed rank test. Mixed-effects linear modeling was used to evaluate changes in stress and depression over time. RESULTS: A total of 2484 users registered from April through October 2020, most of whom created an account without initiating a module. A total of 562 individuals started the program and were considered in the data analysis. The most common stress triggers individuals reported involved either conflicts with family or spouses and work or workload. The most common problems addressed in the mood module were worry, anxiousness, or stress and difficulty concentrating or procrastination. The attrition rate was high with 13% (21/156) completing the conflict module, 17% (50/289) completing session one of the mood module, and 14% (16/117) completing session one of the stress module. Usability and acceptability scores for the mood and stress modules were significantly better than average. In those who returned to complete sessions, symptoms of stress showed a significant improvement over time (P=.03), and there was a significant decrease in depressive symptoms over all time points (P=.01). Depression severity decreased on average by 20% (SD 35.2%; P=.60) between sessions one and two. CONCLUSIONS: Conflicts with others, worry, and difficulty concentrating were some of the most common problems people used the programs to address. Individuals who completed the modules indicated improvements in self-reported stress and depression symptoms. Users also found the modules to be effective and rated the program highly for usability and acceptability. Nevertheless, the attrition rate was very high, as has been found with other freely available online-based interventions.

INTRODUCTION: Off-label use of drugs with potential for QT interval prolongation was common in COVID-19 patients. We tested a portable EKG recording device to measure and monitor corrected QT (QTc) intervals in a cohort of COVID-19 patients treated with azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, or combinations of these drugs. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients hospitalized with pneumonia and confirmed SARS-CoV 2 infection were included in an observational single-centre study. Six-lead EKG recordings were obtained using a KardiaMobile6L? at physicians discretion. In a subgroup of 16 patients with early discharge, a device was provided for at-home daily monitoring. Significant QTc interval prolongation was observed in patients taking a combination of 2 or 3 drugs (426  33 vs 408  33 ms, p = 0,002; and 435  30 vs 394  31 ms, p = 0,001, respectively). The use of the device prompted a change in the treatment of 9 patients (13%) because of prolongation of QTc interval and anticoagulation was started in one patient because of atrial fibrillation diagnosis. In the subgroup of patients with daily recording, QTc interval prolongation peaked at day 2  1,8, with a shorter final QT interval than that recorded before drug initiation (350,0  31,4 vs 381,0  21,2; p = 0,019), pointing to a possible role of the disease itself in QT interval modification. To assess the consistency of measurements of QTc interval, a random sample of 120 EKG recordings were analyzed by two different physicians. Inter-operator intraclass correlation coefficient was 0,702, 95% CI (0,578-0,789). CONCLUSIONS: Portable EKG-recording device was useful for QTc interval monitoring in COVID-19 patients receiving drugs with QTc prolonging potential, allowing physicians to adapt management. Significant QT prolongation was observed in these patients.","output":"Monitoring of QTc interval in patients with COVID-19.

Short of a truly effective preventive or curative vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, it is becoming increasingly clear that multiple pathophysiologic processes seen with COVID-19 as well as SARS-CoV-2 itself should be targeted. Because alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) embraces a panoply of biologic activities that may antagonize several pathophysiologic mechanisms induced by SARS-CoV-2, we hypothesize that this naturally occurring molecule is a promising agent to ameliorate COVID-19. We posit at least seven different mechanisms by which AAT may alleviate COVID-19. First, AAT is a serine protease inhibitor (SERPIN) shown to inhibit TMPRSS-2, the host serine protease that cleaves the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, a necessary preparatory step for the virus to bind its cell surface receptor ACE2 to gain intracellular entry. Second, AAT has anti-viral activity against other RNA viruses HIV and influenza as well as induces autophagy, a known host effector mechanism against MERS-CoV, a related coronavirus that causes the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. Third, AAT has potent anti-inflammatory properties, in part through inhibiting both nuclear factor-kappa B (NF&#954;B) activation and ADAM17 (also known as tumor necrosis factor-alpha converting enzyme), and thus may dampen the hyper-inflammatory response of COVID-19. Fourth, AAT inhibits neutrophil elastase, a serine protease that helps recruit potentially injurious neutrophils and implicated in acute lung injury. AAT inhibition of ADAM17 also prevents shedding of ACE2 and hence may preserve ACE2 inhibition of bradykinin, reducing the ability of bradykinin to cause a capillary leak in COVID-19. Fifth, AAT inhibits thrombin, and venous thromboembolism and in situ microthrombi and macrothrombi are increasingly implicated in COVID-19. Sixth, AAT inhibition of elastase can antagonize the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), a complex extracellular structure comprised of neutrophil-derived DNA, histones, and proteases, and implicated in the immunothrombosis of COVID-19; indeed, AAT has been shown to change the shape and adherence of non-COVID-19-related NETs. Seventh, AAT inhibition of endothelial cell apoptosis may limit the endothelial injury linked to severe COVID-19-associated acute lung injury, multi-organ dysfunction, and pre-eclampsia-like syndrome seen in gravid women. Furthermore, because both NETs formation and the presence of anti-phospholipid antibodies are increased in both COVID-19 and non-COVID pre-eclampsia, it suggests a similar vascular pathogenesis in both disorders. As a final point, AAT has an excellent safety profile when administered to patients with AAT deficiency and is dosed intravenously once weekly but also comes in an inhaled preparation. Thus, AAT is an appealing drug candidate to treat COVID-19 and should be studied.","output":"Hypothesis: Alpha-1-antitrypsin is a promising treatment option for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: It is important to achieve herd immunity by vaccinating as many people as possible to end the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigated the relationship between willingness to receive vaccination and sources of health information among those who did not want to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Methods: This prospective cohort study collected data using a self-administered questionnaire survey. The baseline survey was conducted during December 22-25, 2020, and the follow-up survey during February 18-19, 2021. Participants were aged 20-65 years and worked at the time of the baseline survey (N=33,087). After excluding 6,051 invalid responses, we included responses from 27,036 participants at baseline. In total, 19,941 people responded to the follow-up survey (74% follow-up rate). We excluded 7,415 participants who answered \\"yes\\" to the question \\"If a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available, would you like to get it?\\" in the baseline survey. We finally analyzed 12,526 participants. Results: The odds ratio for change in willingness to be vaccinated from \\"no\\" to \\"yes\\" differed by source of health information. Compared with workers that used TV as a source of information, significantly fewer people who reported getting information from the Internet and friends/colleagues were willing to get the vaccine. Conclusions: It is important to approach workers who do not watch TV when implementing workplace vaccination programs. It is likely that willingness to be vaccinated can be increased through an active company policy whereby the top management recommend vaccination, coupled with an individual approach by occupational health professionals.","output":"Association between willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine and sources of health information among Japanese workers: a cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is a continuing risk for COVID-19 transmission in school settings while transmission is ongoing in the community, particularly among unvaccinated populations. To ensure that schools continue to operate safely and to inform implementation of prevention strategies, it is imperative to gain better understanding of the risk behaviors of staff and students. This secondary analysis describes the prevalence of COVID-19 risk behaviors in an exposed population of students and school staff in the pre-vaccine era and identifies associations between these behaviors and testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: From December 2020CJanuary 2021, school staff and students exposed to confirmed COVID-19 cases in a Georgia school district were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and surveyed regarding risk behaviors in and out of school. Prevalence of risk behaviors was described by age group and school level, and associations with SARS-CoV-2 positivity were identified using chi squared tests. RESULTS: Overall, 717 students and 79 school staff participated in the investigation; SARS-CoV-2 positivity was 9.2%. In the 2 weeks prior to COVID-19 exposure, 24% of participants reported unmasked indoor time at school, 40% attended social gatherings with non-household members, and 71% visited out-of-school indoor locations, including 19% who ate indoors in restaurants. Frequencies of risk behaviors increased by age. Among students, 17% participated in school sports, of whom 86% participated without a mask. SARS-CoV-2 positivity was significantly associated with school sports and unmasked time in sports. Among K-5 students, positivity was associated with exposure to a teacher index case. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis highlights the high prevalence of risk behaviors in an unvaccinated population exposed to COVID-19 in school and identifies an association between student sports participation and SARS-CoV-2 positivity. These findings illustrate the importance of school-level prevention measures to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission, including limiting close-contact indoor sports and promoting consistent mask use in unvaccinated individuals.

Few analyses have specifically looked at quantifying the financial impact of the pandemic on practicing neurosurgeons. A survey analysis was performed to address this need. METHODS: A 19-question survey was distributed to practicing neurosurgeons in the United States and its territories. The questions evaluated respondents' assessments of changes in patient and procedural volume, salary and benefits, practice expenses, staffing, applications for government assistance, and stroke management. Responses were stratified by geographic region. RESULTS: The response rate was 5.1% (267/5224). Most respondents from each region noted a >50% decrease in clinic volume. Respondents from the Northeast observed a 76% decrease in procedure volume, which was significantly greater than that of other regions (P = 0.003). Northeast respondents were also significantly more likely to have been reassigned to nonneurosurgical clinical duties during the pandemic (P < 0.001). Most respondents also noted decreased salary and benefits but experienced no changes in overall practice expenses. Most respondents did not experience significant reductions in nursing or midlevel staffing. These trends were not significantly different between regions.

The Clinician & Group Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CG-CAHPS) is a survey developed and distributed by Press Ganey Associates, and is the most widely used outpatient satisfaction survey in the United States. We compared pre-COVID-19 CG-CAHPS scores from patients who received in-person care at the PRBTC between April 2019 and March 2020 to COVID-19 pandemic CG-CAHPS scores (i.e. those who received either telemedicine or in-person care at the PRTBTC) from April 2020 to March 2021. RESULTS: Approximately 1448 surveys were completed for both in-person and telemedicine visits. During the pandemic, 48.6% of surveys represented telemedicine, with monthly variations from 84.6% (April 2020) to 21.4% (March 2021). Patient satisfaction scores pre-COVID-19 were similar to those during the pandemic: overall provider rating from 0-10 (9.28 v 9.36), knowledge of medical history (96.9% v 95.4%), listens carefully (96.6% v 96.9%), shows respect (97.2% v 98.1%), and time spent (93.2% v 95.5%).

Lopinavir-ritonavir (LPV/r) was originally used for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) infection. It was also used in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) with positive results. Nonetheless, results from recent randomized controlled trials and observational studies on COVID-19 patients were unfavorable. We sought to evaluate the clinical outcomes associated with early treatment with LPV/r for pediatric COVID-19 patients. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 933 COVID-19 patients aged  18 years were admitted between 21 January 2020 and 31 January 2021 in Hong Kong. Exposure was receiving LPV/r within the first two days of admission. Time to clinical improvement, hospital discharge, seroconversion and hyperinflammatory syndrome, cumulative costs, and hospital length of stay were assessed. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard and linear models were performed to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) of time-to-event and continuous outcomes, respectively. RESULTS: LPV/r users were associated with longer time to clinical improvement (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.38C0.70; p < 0.001), hospital discharge (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.38C0.70; p < 0.001) and seroconversion (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.43C0.80; p < 0.001) when compared with controls. LPV/r users were also associated with prolonged hospital length of stay (6.99 days, 95% CI 6.23C7.76; p < 0.001) and higher costs at 30 days (US$11,709 vs US$8270; p < 0.001) as opposed to controls. CONCLUSION: Early treatment with LPV/r for pediatric COVID-19 patients was associated with longer time to clinical improvement.

One possible aspect of these observations that has yet to be explored in detail is what role arthropods that have been associated with human skin infestation, such as Demodecidae or Pyemotidae species, play in viral transmission. It seems likely that arthropod-coronavirus interactions may take place through the molecular attraction forces between the chitin found on the exoskeleton of mites commonly found on human skin and the lipids present on the viral envelope of the SARS-CoV-2.

This population upheld specific characteristics in terms of age and sex, lack of significant comorbidities, and a general scarcity of risk factors for sustaining a severe COVID-19 illness. We present the measures taken to increase vaccination compliance, and the vaccination rate that followed these actions. Our secondary goal was to compare between vaccination rates in frontline battalions and highly essential military units (group A) and rear administration and support military units (group B). METHODS: This was a retrospective review that included 70 military units that were composed of 18,719 individuals of both sexes, mostly free of significant comorbidities. We divided the challenges of maximizing vaccination rates into two main categories: vaccine compliance (including communication and information) and logistical challenges. We compared the vaccination rates in groups A and B using a multivariable linear regression model. A P-value of .05 was considered significant. RESULTS: The mean age in 70 military units was 22.77  1.35 (range 18-50) years, 71.13% males. A total of 726 (3.88%) individuals have been found positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March 1st, 2020 and February 18th, 2021. On February 18th, 2021, 54 days after the vaccination campaign was launched, 15,871 (84.79%) of the study population have been vaccinated by the first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, expressing an 88.21% compliance rate (excluding recovered COVID-19 cases who were not prioritized to be vaccinated at this stage).

This pilot study evaluated the Russia-specific version of the Animated Alcohol Assessment Tool with regard to (1) its usability and acceptability in a primary healthcare setting, (2) the plausibility of its alcohol consumption assessment results and (3) the adequacy of its Russia-specific vessel and beverage selection. METHODS: Convenience samples of 55 patients (47% female) and 15 healthcare practitioners (80% female) in 2 Russian primary healthcare facilities self-administered the Animated Alcohol Assessment Tool and rated their experience on the Mobile Application Rating Scale C User Version. Usage data was automatically collected during app usage, and additional feedback on regional content was elicited in semi-structured interviews. RESULTS: On average, patients completed the Animated Alcohol Assessment Tool in 6:38 min (SD = 2.49, range = 3.00C17.16). User satisfaction was good, with all subscale Mobile Application Rating Scale C User Version scores averaging >3 out of 5 points.

Due to the value of technology-enhanced and multimodal strategies, it was hypothesized that simultaneous digital and physical learning could enhance student understanding of cross-sectional anatomy. A novel learning approach introduced at a United Kingdom university medical school combined visualization table-based thoracic cross-sections and digital models with a three-dimensional printed heart. A mixed-method experimental and survey approach investigated student perceptions of challenging anatomical areas and compared the multimodal intervention to a two-dimensional cross-section control. Analysis of seven-point Likert-type responses of new medical students (n = 319) found that clinical imaging (mean 5.64 SD 1.20) was significantly more challenging (P < 0.001) than surface anatomy (4.19 1.31) and gross anatomy (4.92 1.22). Pre-post testing of students who used the intervention during their first anatomy class at medical school (n = 229), identified significant increases (P < 0.001) in thoracic cross-sectional anatomy interpretation performance (mean 31.4% 15.3) when compared to the subsequent abdominal control activity (24.1% 17.6). Student test scores were independent of mental-rotation ability.

Empiric therapeutic anticoagulation has been recommended by some authors (Barnes et al. 2020; Kollias et al. 2020). The risks and benefits of empiric therapeutic anticoagulation in COVID-19 is unclear and subject to further investigation. The objective of our observational study was to determine if there was a survival benefit with the empiric use of therapeutic anticoagulation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 compared to prophylactic doses of anticoagulation. Materials and methods We performed a retrospective, multi-institutional cohort study of patients over the age of 18, admitted to hospital with COVID-19, between March 10, 2020, and May 3, 2020. We excluded patients who were discharged or died on the same or following day of hospital admission. Our exposed group was defined as any patient who received therapeutic anticoagulation during the hospitalization, with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), unfractionated heparin (UFH), direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOAC) or warfarin. Our control group consisted of patients who received a prophylactic dose of anticoagulation during their hospital stay. The primary endpoint was the time from admission to discharge or death. Patients without a primary endpoint event had their data censored on May 20, 2020. Cox proportional-hazards regression models were used to estimate the association between treatment and in-hospital mortality by adjusting for demographic and clinical factors. Before conducting the outcome analyses, multiple imputations (10 imputations) were performed for missing data. Due to the non-randomized nature of the study and the reduction of the effects of confounding, inverse probability weighting was utilized. Secondary objectives included requirement for intubation, duration of intubation, length of hospital stay, and readmission rates. Results A total of 1033 patients were included in the study. Among them, 381 patients (36.8%) received therapeutic doses of anticoagulation with UFH, LMWH, warfarin, or DOAC. The remaining 652 patients (63.1%) received prophylactic doses of anticoagulation. Baseline characteristics showed that the group with therapeutic anticoagulation had higher body mass index, higher rates of congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, and admission d-dimer levels (Table 1) and significantly higher mortality rate (28.6% vs. 20.2%; p=0.002) (Figure 1, survival curve). However, there was no difference in the risk of in-hospital mortality between the groups using unadjusted and adjusted Cox regressions (Table 2). No benefit was seen in the subgroup analysis of intubated patients as well. In addition, the exposed group had higher rates of intubation (13.3 % versus 7.7%; p = 0.01) and were more likely to be re-admitted (10.3% versus 5.2 %; p = 0.007; survivors only). Median length of stay was significantly longer in the exposed group (7 vs. 6 days; p=0.028; survivors only). Conclusion Our result showed that therapeutic anticoagulation in hospitalized COVID19 patients was not associated with a reduction in in-hospital mortality compared to prophylactic anticoagulation. In addition, patients in the fully anticoagulated group were intubated more often, had a longer length of stay, and higher readmission rate. Well-designed prospective randomized studies are needed to define the dose of anticoagulation in COVID 19 patients. Limitation Retrospective cohort design, as well as multi-institutional nature.

Food is a major milestone for the needs of the people of Indonesia, therefore it needs special attention from many parties in meeting the needs of the community and about how to improve food welfare during the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"Efforts to Defend Countries through Food Security in the Pandemic COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there were many unknowns: transmission vectors of the virus, appropriate intervention strategies and if being immunocompromised due to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), for example, or medications put a person at increased risk for severe COVID-19. Imposing and relaxing of public health restrictions at different times and in different regions in Canada led to different epidemiologies of the virus in different provinces and territories. In order to understand the waxing and waning of waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is necessary to understand the effective reproductive number (R(t)) and the countervailing forces that exert upward or downward pressure on the spread of the virus at a given point in time. As many regions in Canada deal with a third wave, the primary forces affecting the R(t) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 are variants of concern and the increasing vaccinations of Canadians leading to increased population-level immunity. Fortunately, for the IBD population, current research suggests that those with IBD are not at increased risk of contracting COVID-19, nor of having a more severe disease course when compared to the general population.","output":"Crohns and Colitis Canadas 2021 Impact of COVID-19 and Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Canada: EpidemiologyThe Trends of Disease Over Time"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the great challenges in the ecology of infectious diseases is to understand what drives the emergence of new pathogens including the relationship between viruses and their hosts. In the case of the emergence of SevereAcute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), several studies have shown coronavirus diversity in bats as well as the existence of SARS-CoV infection in apparently healthy bats, suggesting that bats may be a crucial host in the genesis of this disease. To elucidate the biogeographic origin of SARS-CoV and investigate the role that bats played in its emergence, we amplified coronavirus sequences from bat species captured throughout Thailand and assessed the phylogenetic relationships to each other and to other published coronavirus sequences. To this end, RdRp sequence of Coronavirinae was targeted by RT-PCR in non-invasive samples from bats collected in Thailand. Two new coronaviruses were detected in two bat species: one Betacoronavirus in Hipposideros larvatus and one Alphacoronavirus in Hipposiderosarmiger. Interestingly, these viruses from South-East Asia are related to those previously detected in Africa (Betacoronavirus-b) or in Europe (Alphacoronavirus & Betacoronavirus-b). These findings illuminate the origin and the evolutionary history of the SARS-CoV group found in bats by pushing forward the hypothesis of a Betacoronavirus spill-over from Hipposideridae to Rhinolophidae and then from Rhinolophidae to civets and Human. All reported Betacoronaviruses-b (SARS-CoV group) of Hipposideridae and Rhinolophidae respectively cluster in two groups despite their broad geographic distribution and the sympatry of their hosts, which is in favor of an ancient and genetically independent evolution of Betacoronavirus-b clusters in these families. Moreover, despite its probable pathogenicity, we found that a Betacoronavirus-b can persistently infect a medium-sized hipposiderid bat colony. These findings illustrate the importance of the host phylogeny and the host/pathogen ecological interactions in the description and the understanding of pathogen emergence. The hosts phylogeny, biogeography and behaviour, combined with already described roles of pathogen plasticity and anthropic changes are likely to be co-factors of disease emergence. Elucidating the common ancestor of Hipposideridae and Rhinolophidae is key to understanding the evolutionary history of actual betacoronaviruses and therefore to get an insight of the deep origin of SARS-CoV.","output":"SARS-Coronavirus ancestors foot-prints in South-East Asian bat colonies and the refuge theory"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The structure of beta-coronavirus MERS-CoV S1-CTD demonstrated an interesting subject of how two structurally similar viral RBDs recognize different protein receptors Same as SARS-CoV, the S1-CTD, MERS-CoV S1-CTD viruses also contains two subdomains, but, in contrast to the loop-dominated MERS-CoV, RBM contains a 4-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet, showing a relatively flat surface to bind DPP4 The protein sequences were obtained from NCBI web sites, and the proteins of COVID-19, such as protein sequences, were applied for analyzing the conserved domain Some proteins were also utilized for constructing 3-D structures via homology modeling We also show that N-terminal deletions of alpha 2 that no longer block STAT1 nuclear import Covid-19 spike protein structures, along with peptide-like inhibitor structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, including small-molecule inhibitors, have been simulated via Molecular dynamic and docking methods Several genomes of various coronaviruses using BAST and MAFFT software have been evaluated, and a few genomes have been selected","output":"Variety of Spike Protein in COVID-19 Mutation: Stability, Effectiveness and Outbreak Rate as a Target for Vaccine and Therapeutic Development"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:D}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function V(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const R=d(O,[["render",V]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/20.md","filePath":"drive/20.md"}'),P={name:"drive/20.md"},z=Object.assign(P,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[w(R)]))}});export{E as __pageData,z as default};
