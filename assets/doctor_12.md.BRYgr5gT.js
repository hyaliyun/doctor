This study investigates the depression level and coping responses toward the lockdown, referred as the movement control order (MCO) during COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia and its impact on quality of life. METHOD: This cross-sectional study was conducted from April to May 2020. The outcomes were assessed using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress ScaleC21, Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced Inventory, and World Health Organisation Quality of LifeCBREF Scale (WHOQOL-BREF) in both English and validated Malay versions. RESULTS: Mild-to-severe depression was found in 28.2% (n = 149) of the 528 respondents. Respondents with mild-to-severe depression were significantly younger (33.09  10.08 versus 36.79  12.47 years), without partner (71.8% versus 45.6%), lived in the red zone (85.9% versus 71.0%), and had lower household income as defined in the category of B40 (51.7% versus 39.3%) compared to those without depression (all p < 0.01). The avoidant coping score was significantly higher (25.43  5.69 versus 20.78  5.65), while the religious coping score was significantly lower (5.10  2.07 versus 5.94  2.11) among those with mild-to-severe depression compared to those without depression (both p < 0.001). Respondents with mild-to-severe depression also had significantly lower mean score in each domain of WHOQOL-BREF compare to those without depression [(physical health, 13.63  2.66 versus 16.20  2.11), (psychological, 12.5  2.79 versus 16.10  2.14), (social relationships, 12.17  3.49 versus 15.28  2.93), environment (14.50  2.39 versus 16.21  2.14), all p < 0.001] after controlling for age, marital status, zone, household income, and coping scores. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 lockdown had adverse mental health effects. Our study highlighted that approximately one in three individual experienced mild-to-severe depression during the nationwide MCO. The varied impact of the pandemic on mental health could be due to different population characteristics and coping strategies used. Identifying those at higher risk to develop depression during MCO for COVID-19 pandemic could help mental healthcare service providers to plan services for those susceptible, thereby mitigating the pandemics effect on quality of life.","output":"Depression level and coping responses toward the movement control order and its impact on quality of life in the Malaysian community during the COVID-19 pandemic: a web-based cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), two regions with large growth potential, have become increasingly connected over the last 20 years.

China's retreat from certain markets, due to the ongoing rebalancing process, could open new opportunities for LAC exporters but also entail some challenges. Our results show that China's rebalancing will have an overall positive effect on LAC's GDP and exports in the long run, but this effect is small and uneven across countries, leading to winners and losers. We also provide evidence that other countries, such as India, are currently trying to fill the gap left by China and could undermine LAC's competitive advantage in some export markets. In this context, reduction of trade barriers and further integration within the region and/or with the rest of the world would lead to unequivocally positive outcomes for all LAC countries.

To study the characteristics of asthenic syndrome and the potential for treating it in the postcovid period. Materials and methods. A continuous sampling method was used to select 129 patients (mean age 49.8  8.9 years) after COVID-19. Study patients were selected at the clinical out-patient and polyclinic facilities in Samara in the period JulyCAugust, 2020. All patients signed informed consent. The envelope method was used to randomize patients into two groups: the study group (n = 64) received ethylmethylhydroxypyridine succinate (Neurox) 1 tablet (125 mg) three times daily for four weeks; medications in the reference group (n = 65) did not include any substances of the pharmacological antihypoxant/antioxidant/nootrope groups. Three visits (V) were made: the first (V(1)) was before inclusion in the study; the second (V(2)) was at 14 days; the third (V(3)) was on day 28 from treatment initiation. The dynamics of overall status (weakness, fatigue, concentration of attention, vertigo, headache, sleep impairment) were evaluated on a visual analog scale (VAS); the subjective perception of the severity of asthenia (tiredness, physical and mental fatigue, decreased motivation and activity) was evaluated using the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, MFI-20); cognitive functions were assessed using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSA); and autonomic tone was assessed using the Krd? index. Results. At the end of the study (V(3)), statistically significant changes in measures (VAS, MFI-20) were seen only in patients of the study group; the Krd?

STUDY DESIGN This is a prospective randomized single-center study in a cohort of 100 consecutive patients which underwent external septorhinoplasty and concomitant hybrid type of turbinoplasty. METHODOLOGY Patients were randomly assigned into two groups. The first group included 50 patients who underwent piezo-assisted outfracturing of the inferior turbinates in combination with bipolar coagulation. The second group included 50 patients who underwent a treatment based on turbinate bipolar coagulation and partial resection of the inferior border of the turbinate. The severity of nasal obstruction was measured in both patient groups with a patient-related outcome questionnaire (NOSE) and objective measures (anterior rhinomanometry and acoustic rhinometry). Assessments were conducted prior to surgery and 3 months after the surgery. RESULTS There was a significant improvement in the values of the NOSE questionnaire with no relevant difference between the two study groups. Acoustic rhinometry and rhinomanometry also showed no statistically significant differences between the two study groups. No differences in postoperative healing were found, and postoperative complications were comparable low in both groups. However, the piezo-assisted procedure was quicker to perform with only minimal bleeding. CONCLUSION During septorhinoplasty, the combination of thermo-coagulation with piezo-assisted turbinoplasty was as efficient as with partial turbinectomy to establish normal nasal breathing.

In this paper, we present simulation results obtained from the individual-based model, JO_SCPLOWUNEC_SCPLOW, for English school opening after a prior vaccination campaign using an optimistic set of assumptions about vaccine efficacy and the likelihood of prior-reinfection. We take a scenario-based approach to modelling potential interventions to assess relative changes rather than real-world forecasts. Specifically, we assess the effects of vaccinating those aged 16-17, those aged 12-17, and not vaccinating children at all relative to only vaccinating the adult population, addressing what might have happened had the UK began teenage vaccinations earlier. Vaccinating children in the 12-15 age group would have had a significant impact on the course of the epidemic, saving thousands of lives overall in these simulations. In the absence of such a vaccination campaign our simulations show there could still be a significant positive impact on the epidemic (fewer cases, fewer deaths) by continuing NPI strategies in schools. Our analysis suggests that the best results in terms of lives saved are likely derived from a combination of the now planned vaccination campaign and NPIs in schools.","output":"Vaccinations or Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions:Safe Reopening of Schools in England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Concerns about reduced milk transfer with nipple shield (NS) use are based on evidence from studies with methodological flaws. Milk removal during breastfeeding can be impacted by infant and maternal factors other than NS use. The aim of this study was to control electric breast pump vacuum strength, pattern and duration across multiple study sessions to determine if NS use reduces milk removal from the breast. METHODS: A within-subject study with two groups of breastfeeding mothers (infants < 6 months) were recruited; Control Group (CG): no breastfeeding difficulties; Pain Group (PG) used NS for persistent nipple pain. Mothers completed three randomised 15 min pumping sessions using the Symphony vacuum curve (Medela AG); no NS, fitted NS, and a small NS. Sessions were considered valid where the applied vacuum was within 20 mmHg of the set vacuum. Milk removal was considered as pumped milk volume, and also percentage of available milk removed (PAMR), which is calculated as the pumped volume divided by the estimated milk volume stored in the breast immediately prior to pumping. RESULTS: Of 62 sessions (all: n = 31 paired sessions) a total of 11 paired sessions from both PG (n = 03) and CG (n = 08) were valid (subset) with and without a fitted NS. Only 2 small shield sessions were valid and so all small shield measurements were excluded. Both pumped volumes and PAMR were significantly lower with NS use for all data but not for subset data. (All: Volume and PAMR median: no NS: 76.5 mL, 69%, Fitted NS: 32.1 mL, 41% respectively (volume p = 0.002, PAMR p = 0.002); Subset: Volume and PAMR median: no NS: 83.8 mL, 72%; Fitted NS: 35.2 mL, 40% (volume p = 0.111 and PAMR p = 0.045). The difference in PAMR, but not volume, was statistically significant when analysed by linear mixed modelling. A decrease of 10 mmHg was associated with a 4.4% increase in PAMR (p = 0.017).

One such measure was a total lockdown for several weeks across the country. A complex and unexpected outcome of the lockdown which has medical, ethical, economic, and social dimensions is related to alcohol consumption. The lockdown and consequent acute non-availability of alcohol resulted in people with alcohol dependence going into withdrawals, black marketing of alcohol, and in extreme cases suicide resulting from the alleged frustration of not having access to alcohol. The health dilemmas around this situation are biological (e.g. pushing people into risky situations-potentially fatal alcohol withdrawal, consumption of illicit or other non-consumable alcohol) and psychosocial (e.g. isolation increasing the risk of relapses, loss of control over the decision to abstain which can be detrimental to recovery, restriction of access to services for alcohol problems). The legal and rights-related dilemmas are centred around whether States have the right to impinge on individual autonomy on the grounds of public health, the capacity of the health systems to provide appropriate services to cope with those who will struggle with the unavailability of alcohol, the constitutionality of the Central government's impinging on jurisdiction of states under the guise of a health emergency caused by the pandemic, and the ability of the State to make unbiased decisions about this issue when it is highly dependent on the revenue from the sale of alcohol and associated industries. The way forward could be a pragmatic and utilitarian approach involving continued access to alcohol, while observing all physical distancing norms necessary during the pandemic, for those who want to continue drinking; and implementing innovative measures such as tele-counselling for those who wish not to return back to drinking.","output":"COVID-19 and forced alcohol abstinence in India: The dilemmas around ethics and rights"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Results from an extensive vegetation survey of 1971 boreal forest stands, encompassing a full spectrum of succession and site types in the regions of Ontario and Quebec south of James Bay, are reported. Noncentered principal component analysis plus varimax rotation (nodal component analysis) is applied to overstory and understory data in order to detect vegetational noda. The overstory data are inherently more structured (i.e., contain more distinct subgroups) than those of the understory. An exception is seen with groups in which Abies balsamea plays a prominent role. These are interpreted as stages in various successions of which only one, a Betula papyrifera to A. balsamea sequence, represents the complete transition from one canopy dominant to another. The understory noda are summarized in terms of the compositional and environmental features of stands belonging to each nodum. Relationships among the understory noda are summarized in a multidimensional scaling ordination which is derived directly from similarity values (conjunction coefficients) representing the overlap between pairs of noda. Two major environmental gradients seem to affect understory composition. These are a site moisturenutrient concentration gradient and a general fertilityproductivity gradient. Canopy composition and understory vegetation are compared by nodal conjunction between the two analyses. Groups of noda, representing wet bog forests and also upland mesic forests, show moderate to good coincidence but beyond this little canopy specificity emerges. These results indicate that overstoryunderstory coincidence is due primarily to similar site requirements. Understory species' response to an overstory succession is examined.

In a pre-registered study using an online U.S. sample, we found that individuals reporting high levels of antisociality engage in fewer social distancing measures: they report leaving their homes more frequently (p = .024) and standing closer to others while outside (p < .001). These relationships were observed after controlling for sociodemographic variables, illness risk, and use of protective equipment. Independently, higher education and leaving home for work were also associated with reduced distancing behavior.

The proteins PfRh5-PfRipr-PfCyRPA-Pfp113 assemble into a complex at the apical end of the merozoite and are together essential for erythrocyte invasion. They have also been shown to induce neutralizing antibodies and appear to be less polymorphic than other invasion-associated proteins, making them high priority blood-stage vaccine candidates. Using available whole genome sequencing data (WGS) and new capillary sequencing data (CS), this study describes the genetic polymorphism in the Rh5 complex in P. falciparum isolates obtained from Kilifi, Kenya. METHODS: 162 samples collected in 2013 and 2014 were genotyped by capillary sequencing (CS) and re-analysed WGS from 68 culture-adapted P. falciparum samples obtained from a drug trial conducted from 2005 to 2007. The frequency of polymorphisms in the merozoite invasion proteins, PfRh5, PfRipr, PfCyRPA and PfP113 were examined and where possible polymorphisms co-occurring in the same isolates. RESULTS: From a total 70 variants, including 2 indels, 19 SNPs [27.1%] were identified by both CS and WGS, while an additional 15 [21.4%] and 36 [51.4%] SNPs were identified only by either CS or WGS, respectively. All the SNPs identified by CS were non-synonymous, whereas WGS identified 8 synonymous and 47 non-synonymous SNPs. CS identified indels in repeat regions in the p113 gene in codons 275 and 859 that were not identified in the WGS data.

RESULTS: Findings revealed that although ex-POWs and controls did not differ in their level of exposure to COVID-19, ex-POWS reported higher levels of fear of COVID-19 and COVID-19 ASD than controls. Suffering during captivity, measured at 1991, and participants' appraisal of the extent to which their war-related experiences affected adjustment to COVID-19 were significantly associated with fear of COVID-19 and COVID-19 ASD. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the study demonstrate the long-term effects of exposure to traumatic experiences (captivity) during young adulthood on adjustment to an unrelated collective stress, such as COVID-19, 40 years later.","output":"Echoes from the past: adjustment of aging former prisoners of war to the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: No information exists in the literature regarding the effect of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) infection on subsequent in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle attempt. We, therefore, aim to assess the influence of COVID-19 infection on IVF treatments. DESIGN: An observational study. SETTING: A tertiary, university-affiliated medical center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All consecutive couples undergoing ovarian stimulation (OS) for IVF, before and after recovering from COVID-19 infection, and reached the ovum pick-up (OPU) stage. The stimulation characteristics and embryological variables of couples undergoing IVF treatments after recovering from COVID-19 infection were assessed and compared to their IVF cycles prior to COVID-19 infection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Stimulation characteristics and embryological variables. RESULTS: Nine couples (seven with the female partner infection and two with the male partner) resumed IVF treatment 8-92 d after recovering from the COVID-19 infection (negative polymerase chain reaction [PCR]). No in-between cycles differences were observed in OS and embryological variables between the cycles before and after recovering from the COVID-19 infection, except for a significantly lower proportion of top-quality embryos. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 infection did not affect patients' performance or ovarian reserve in their immediate subsequent IVF cycle, except for a reduced proportion of top-quality embryos (TQEs). We therefore suggest, to postpone IVF treatment for a least 3 months (duration of folliculogenesis and spermatogenesis) after recovering from COVID-19 infection, aiming to recruit healthy gametes that were not exposed to COVID-19 infection during their development.","output":"Does COVID-19 infection influence patients' performance during IVF-ET cycle?: an observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Novel COVID-19 virus is extensively being studied for its long-term effects. A predominant trend of development of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) in Covid-19 patients is being observed, and hence further relation is explored in this study. Methods: This is an observational inductive retrospective study conducted for four months in a tertiary care hospital. The study included subjects who recovered from COVID-19 and were treated post-COVID-19 in the hospital. The subjects who had stable glucose counts were excluded. The data obtained from the medical record department encompassed demographic details and clinical data of the patient. The data were tabulated, and observations were reported using descriptive analysis. Results: Among 5632 admitted patients for COVID-19, 694 came for follow-up. 105 patients were re-admitted, but 11 had newly developed DM, and 14 observed uncontrolled DM managed by medical attention. The reported incidence rate in Newly-Diagnosed DM was 0.195%, and the person above 41 y was at greater risk. Similarly, the incidence rate in Uncontrolled-DM was 13.33%, and persons above 47 y were at greater risk. It was found that both these categories of patients had comorbidities, and the development of this was seen between the 25th-40th day. In both cases, males were more prone than females. Conclusion: The study reports a bi-directional relationship between Covid-19 and DM. The use of steroids may have stepped-up this relationship. Cautious use of steroids, changes in the hospital formulary, and further quantitative clinical investigations are primary recommendations that may prevent such episodes.","output":"Assessment of the possible causes of diabetes mellitus developed in patients post covid-19 treatment in a tertiary care hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Italy, COVID-19 lockdown was imposed from 8 March until 3 May 2020 with negative consequences on the lifestyles and health of people.

A total of 3666 participants took part in this cross-sectional study (2838 students and 828 workers, of whom 73.0% were female). T-test, Chi-square test and the two-way ANOVA were used. Results showed that 43.3% of participants perceived a weight gain. Workers experienced a more substantial increase in body weight (0.7 kg) compared to students (0.3 kg; p = 0.013). A significant difference between preobese/obese workers (0.9 kg) and students (-0.3 kg; p < 0.001) was found. Overall, 57.0% of the sample was characterized by high levels of sedentary activities. Sedentary people noticed a higher weight gain (0.4 kg) compared to less sedentary people (0.3 kg; p = 0.048). More than 45% of participants reported a worsening of sleep quality and showed a perceived increase in body weight (0.5 kg) in comparison to those who improved their sleep quality (no weight change; p = 0.001).

Spike protein is one of the surface proteins of SARS-CoV-2 that is essential for its infectious function. Therefore, it received lots of attention for the preparation of antiviral drugs, vaccines, and diagnostic tools. In the current study, we use computational methods of chemistry and biology to study the interaction between spike protein and its receptor in the body, angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). Additionally, the possible interaction of two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials, including graphene, bismuthene, phosphorene, p-doped graphene, and functionalized p-doped graphene, with spike protein is investigated. The functionalized p-doped graphene nanomaterials were found to interfere with spike protein better than the other tested nanomaterials. In addition, the interaction of the proposed nanomaterials with the main protease (M(pro)) of SARS-CoV-2 was studied. Functionalized p-doped graphene nanomaterials showed more capacity to prevent the activity of M(pro). These 2D nanomaterials efficiently reduce the transmissibility and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 by both the deformation of the spike protein and inhibiting the M(pro). The results suggest the potential use of 2D nanomaterials in a variety of prophylactic approaches, such as masks or surface coatings, and would deserve further studies in the coming years.

To address this, we construct a large corpus of 126k domain-expert (science teacher) relevance ratings that augment a corpus of explanations to standardized science exam questions, discovering 80k additional relevant facts not rated as gold. We build three strong models based on different methodologies (generation, ranking, and schemas), and empirically show that while expert-augmented ratings provide better estimates of explanation quality, both original (gold) and expert-augmented automatic evaluations still substantially underestimate performance by up to 36% when compared with full manual expert judgements, with different models being disproportionately affected.

OBJECTIVE: To study whether the number of children admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for DKA due to new-onset T1D increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, and whether SARS-CoV-2 infection plays a role. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study comprises two datasets: (1) children admitted to PICU due to new-onset T1D and (2) children diagnosed with new-onset T1D and registered to the Finnish Pediatric Diabetes Registry in the Helsinki University Hospital from 1 April to 31 October in 2016-2020. We compared the incidence, number and characteristics of children with newly diagnosed T1D between the prepandemic and pandemic periods. RESULTS: The number of children admitted to PICU due to new-onset T1D increased from an average of 6.25 admissions in 2016-2019 to 20 admissions in 2020 (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 3.24 [95% CI 1.80 to 5.83]; p=0.0001). On average, 57.75 children were registered to the FPDR in 2016-2019, as compared with 84 in 2020 (IRR 1.45; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.86; p=0.004). 33 of the children diagnosed in 2020 were analysed for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and all were negative. CONCLUSIONS: More children with T1D had severe DKA at diagnosis during the pandemic. This was not a consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

METHODS: Consecutive patients with CAM between March 1 and May 10, 2021, with a minimum follow-up of 1 month were included. We recorded the presence of diabetes, use of steroids, and need for non-invasive ventilation (NIV) from the case files. The features of orbital involvement, treatment administered, and outcomes, i.e., death, orbital exenteration, or recovery were noted. Cumulative probability of adverse outcomes, defined as either death or exenteration, was reported using survival analysis. RESULTS: We treated 67 cases of CAM and found an incidence of 13.6 cases per 1,000 patients post-moderate to severe COVID-19. Uncontrolled diabetes (90%) with ketoacidosis (40%) and prior systemic steroids (84%) were the strongest predispositions. The onset of CAM was 15.1  9.5 days (range: 6C42 days) after recovery from COVID-19. The cumulative probability of an adverse outcome was 38% (95% confidence intervals [CI] = 23.7C56.9%) on day 20. The patients who required NIV during COVID-19 were at seven times higher risk of experiencing an adverse outcome (hazard ratios [HR] = 6.92, 95% CI = 2.9C16.2) while those who received amphotericinC -B had a 61% lower risk (HR = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.16C0.97). CONCLUSION: The current outbreak of CAM was seen predominantly in uncontrolled diabetics, especially with ketoacidosis and steroid intake.

Here we report on a medical student telephone initiative set-up by a GP trainee, which aimed to support patients at high risk and vulnerable to the Coronavirus Disease of 2019 [Covid-19]. In addition, it was hoped the project would mitigate a digital divide, enable proactive anticipatory planning, and provide an active learning environment to compensate for the pandemics impact on medical education. Methods: : 33 medical students conducted daily telephone conversations with high risk and vulnerable patients. They confirmed public health messages, offered details for voluntary support groups, established need for medication delivery, explored levels of digital connectivity, and prompted discussions around end-of-life choices. Students had access to online reflective resources and daily remote debriefing sessions with the GP trainee. A convergent mixed-methods evaluation was subsequently undertaken, using quantitative process and descriptive data and individual qualitative interviews were conducted according to a maximal variation sampling strategy with students, GPs, and the GP trainee. Inductive thematic analysis was then applied with cross-validation, respondent validation, and rich evidential illustration aiding integrity. Results: : 97 high risk and 781 vulnerable calls were made. Individuals were generally aware of public heath information, but some struggled to interpret and apply it within their own lives. Therefore respondents felt students provided additional practical and psychological benefits, particularly with regard to strengthening the links with the community voluntary groups. The project was widely liked by students who reported high levels of skill development and widened awareness, particularly valuing the active learning environment and reflective feedback sessions. Conclusion: This study demonstrates utilization of medical students as wider assets within the primary health care team, with an initiative that enables support for vulnerable patients whilst promoting active medical education. Ongoing integration of students within normal primary health care roles, such as chronic disease or mental health reviews, could provide similar opportunities for supported active and reflective learning.","output":"Medical student support for vulnerable patients during COVID-19 C a convergent mixed-methods study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Situational awareness and anticipatory guidance for nurses receiving a patient after surgery are key to patient safety. Little work has defined the role of artificial intelligence (AI) to support these functions during nursing handoff communication or patient assessment. We used interviews and direct observations to better understand how AI could work in this context. Materials and Methods: 58 handoffs were observed of patients entering and leaving the post-anesthesia care unit at a single center. 11 nurses participated in semi-structured interviews. Mixed inductive-deductive thematic analysis extracted major themes and subthemes around roles for AI supporting postoperative nursing. Results: Four themes emerged from the interviews: (1) Nurse understanding of patient condition guides care decisions, (2) Handoffs are important to nurse situational awareness; problem focus and information transfer may be improved by AI, (3) AI may augment nurse care decision making and team communication, (4) User experience and information overload are likely barriers to using AI. Key subthemes included that AI-identified problems would be discussed at handoff and team communications, that AI-estimated elevated risks would trigger patient re-evaluation, and that AI-identified important data may be a valuable addition to nursing assessment. Discussion and Conclusion: Most research on postoperative handoff communication relies on structured checklists.

Despite appreciable research, identification of targeted populations for testing and tracking the spread of COVID-19 at a larger scale is an intimidating challenge. There is a need to quickly identify the infected individual or community to check the spread. The diagnostic testing done at large-scale for individuals has limitations as it cannot provide information at a swift pace in large populations, which is pivotal to contain the spread at the early stage of its breakouts. Recently, scientists are exploring the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the faeces discharged in municipal wastewater. Wastewater sampling could be a potential tool to expedite the early identification of infected communities by detecting the biomarkers from the virus. However, it needs a targeted approach to choose optimized locations for wastewater sampling. The present study proposes a novel fuzzy based Bayesian model to identify targeted populations and optimized locations with a maximum probability of detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater networks. Consequently, real time monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater using autosamplers or biosensors could be deployed efficiently. Fourteen criteria such as population density, patients with comorbidity, quarantine and hospital facilities, etc. are analysed using the data of 14 lac individuals infected by COVID-19 in the USA. The uniqueness of the proposed model is its ability to deal with the uncertainty associated with the data and decision maker's opinions using fuzzy logic, which is fused with Bayesian approach. The evidence-based virus detection in wastewater not only facilitates focused testing, but also provides potential communities for vaccine distribution.

Quantitative analysis of viewing patterns demonstrated that the majority of students accessed the videos multiple times, while qualitative data suggest that students generally had positive responses to the videos. However, thematic analysis of interviews with tutors showed that while they considered the content helpful, they also had reservations about the length and use of the videos.

The 30-kb positive-stranded RNA genome of coronaviruses encodes a replication/transcription machinery that is unusually complex and composed of 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps). SARS-CoV nsp12, the canonical RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), exhibits poorly processive RNA synthesis in vitro, at odds with the efficient replication of a very large RNA genome in vivo. Here, we report that SARS-CoV nsp7 and nsp8 activate and confer processivity to the RNA-synthesizing activity of nsp12. Using biochemical assays and reverse genetics, the importance of conserved nsp7 and nsp8 residues was probed. Whereas several nsp7 mutations affected virus replication to a limited extent, the replacement of two nsp8 residues (P183 and R190) essential for interaction with nsp12 and a third (K58) critical for the interaction of the polymerase complex with RNA were all lethal to the virus. Without a loss of processivity, the nsp7/nsp8/nsp12 complex can associate with nsp14, a bifunctional enzyme bearing 3'-5' exoribonuclease and RNA cap N7-guanine methyltransferase activities involved in replication fidelity and 5'-RNA capping, respectively. The identification of this tripartite polymerase complex that in turn associates with the nsp14 proofreading enzyme sheds light on how coronaviruses assemble an RNA-synthesizing machinery to replicate the largest known RNA genomes.

METHODS: We undertook a retrospective study looking at whether the delay caused by COVID-19 had an impact on the lesion size at the time of surgery, and consequently, on the choice of surgical repair. Results were compared to an equivalent time period a year prior to the onset of COVID-19. Elective surgery was stepped down at our hospital between March and June 2020. We collected data on patients that underwent BCC excisions between July 2020 and April 2021 and for an equivalent time period from 2019 to 2020.

This study compared breast cancer stage at diagnosis and rates of neoadjuvant therapy among women presenting to our institution before and during COVID-19. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of patients with a new breast cancer diagnosis from March 2020CAugust 2020 (during-COVID-19) were compared with March 2019CAugust 2019 (pre-COVID-19). We compared stage at diagnosis, clinical/demographic features, and neoadjuvant therapy use between the time periods. RESULTS: A total of 573 patients included: 376 pre-COVID-19, 197 during-COVID-19. Method of cancer detection was by imaging in 66% versus 63% and by physical findings/symptoms in 34% versus 37% of patients comparing pre-COVID-19 to during-COVID-19, p = 0.47. Overall clinical prognostic stage did not differ significantly (p = 0.39) between the time periods, nor did cM1 disease (2% in each period); 23% pre-COVID-19 and 27% during-COVID-19 presented with cN+ disease (p = 0.38). Neoadjuvant therapy use was significantly higher during-COVID-19 (39%) versus pre-COVID-19 (29%, p = 0.02) driven by increased neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) use (7% to 16%, p = 0.002), whereas neoadjuvant chemotherapy use did not change (22% vs. 23%, p = 0.72).

To investigate the effect of this feedback relationship on epidemic dynamics, we developed a compartmental model that couples a disease spread framework with competition of two mutually exclusive health opinions (health-positive and health-neutral) associated with different health behaviors. The model is based on the assumption that individuals switch health opinions based on exposure to opinions of others through interpersonal communications. To model opinion switch rates, we considered a family of functions and identified the ones that allow health opinions to co-exist. In the disease-free population, either the opinions cannot co-exist and one of them is always dominating (monobelief equilibrium) or there is at least one stable co-existence of opinions equilibrium. In the latter case, there is multistability between the co-existence equilibrium and the two monobelief equilibria. When two opinions co-exist, it depends on their distribution whether the infection can invade. If presence of the infection leads to increased switching to a health-positive opinion, the epidemic burden becomes smaller than indicated by the basic reproduction number. Additionally, a feedback between epidemic dynamics and health opinion dynamics may result in (sustained) oscillatory dynamics and a switch to a different stable opinion distribution. Our model captures feedback between spread of awareness through social networks and infection dynamics and can serve as a basis for more elaborate individual-based models.","output":"The effect of competition between health opinions on epidemic dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Testicular cancer severely affects male health, so finding effective diagnosis and prognostic indicators and exploring its pathogenesis are very important. Purpose: This study aims to explore the hub genes that play important roles in the occurrence and development of testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT). Methods: Data were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus datasets (GSE3218 and GSE1818) and verified in The Cancer Genome Atlas database and the Genotype-Tissue Expression database and the Human Protein Atlas database. A protein-protein interaction network was constructed to obtain hub genes. GEO2R, R software and packages were used to analyze differentially expressed genes (DEGs), receiver operating characteristic curve assessment, Cox regression analysis, Kaplan-Meier survival curve assessment, Gene Ontology analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis, the relationship with clinicopathological information, gene set enrichment analysis, the correlation with immune cells' infiltration, and the expression in pan-cancers of the hub genes. Results: PLK4, TRIP13, TPR, KIF18A, CDKN3, HMMR, PBK, PTTG1, CKS2, SYCP1, HSPA2, and MKI67 were selected as the hub genes. mRNA of PLK4, TRIP13, CDKN3, SYCP1, HSPA2, and MKI67 had high diagnostic values, and higher expression of CDKN3 and HSPA2 mRNA were poor prognostic factors for progression-free interval of TGCT. The hub genes involved organelle division and cell cycle, chromosome and centromeric region, heat shock protein binding, and more. Downregulated TPR and PLK4 were selected as research targets for continued study, and they may participate in multiple signaling pathways. The expression of TPR and PLK4 correlated with the infiltration of a variety of immune cells and differed in pan-cancers.

This study examined the impact of previous use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) on the critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Data from an international, prospective, observational cohort study involving 354 hospitals spanning 54 countries were included. A cohort of 737 COVID-19 patients with pre-existing hypertension admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) in 2020 were targeted. Multi-state survival analysis was performed to evaluate in-hospital mortality and hospital length of stay up to 90 days following ICU admission. RESULTS: A total of 737 patients were included538 (73%) with pre-existing hypertension had received ACEi/ARBs before ICU admission, while 199 (27%) had not. Cox proportional hazards model showed that previous ACEi/ARB use was associated with a decreased hazard of in-hospital death (HR, 0.74, 95% CI 0.58C0.94). Sensitivity analysis adjusted for propensity scores showed similar results for hazards of death. The average length of hospital stay was longer in ACEi/ARB group with 21.2 days (95% CI 19.7C22.8 days) in ICU and 6.7 days (5.9C7.6 days) in general ward compared to non-ACEi/ARB group with 16.2 days (14.1C18.6 days) and 6.4 days (5.1C7.9 days), respectively. When analysed separately, results for ACEi or ARB patient groups were similar for both death and discharge. CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill COVID-19 patients with comorbid hypertension, use of ACEi/ARBs prior to ICU admission was associated with a reduced risk of in-hospital mortality following adjustment for baseline characteristics although patients with ACEi/ARB showed longer length of hospital stay.

The prognostic power of commercially available gene signatures is mostly restricted to estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. On the contrary, immune-related gene signatures predict prognosis only in ER-negative breast cancer. This study aimed to develop a better prognostic signature for breast cancer. METHODS: The expressions of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes from 30 independent microarray datasets with a total of 4813 samples were analyzed. A prognostic lncRNA signature was developed based on likelihood-ratio Cox regression analysis. Survival analysis was used to compare the prognostic efficiencies of our signature and 10 previously reported prognostic gene signatures. RESULTS: Cox regression analysis on 30 independent datasets showed that the 6-lncRNA signature identified in this study performed as well as five commercially available signatures in recurrence prediction for ER-positive breast cancer. In ER-negative breast cancer, this lncRNA signature was as prognostic as three immune-related gene signatures. Moreover, our lncRNA signature also demonstrated a good capacity to predict recurrence risk for triple-negative breast cancer. Function analysis showed that several lncRNAs in this signature were probably involved in cell proliferation and immune processes. CONCLUSIONS: A six-LncRNA signature was identified that is prognostic for ER-positive, ER-negative, and triple-negative breast cancers and thus deserves further validation in prospective studies.","output":"Identification of a prognostic LncRNA signature for ER-positive, ER-negative and triple-negative breast cancers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Recent epidemiological data indicate that minority groups, especially Hispanic communities, experience higher rates of infection, hospitalization, and death due to COVID-19. It is important to understand the nature of this health disparity and the socioeconomic or behavioral factors that are placing Hispanic communities and other minority populations at higher risk for morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this project is to assess current COVID-19-related knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) among a predominantly Hispanic population from Orange County, California, and identify risk factors that may contribute to increased susceptibility and vulnerability to contracting SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Our Orange County-wide community survey consists of quantitative survey questions in four domains: demographic information, COVID-19 knowledge questions, COVID-19 attitude questions, and COVID-19 practices questions. The survey questions are adapted from recent global KAP studies. Participants are being recruited from Amistad Medical Clinic, a private primary health clinic group in Orange County that treats a predominantly Hispanic population. Patients recruited during telehealth visits are surveyed remotely by telephone, and those recruited during in-person clinic visits are surveyed in person. Surveys are conducted by trained members of the study team who are native to the community setting. RESULTS: As of October 12, 2020, we had recruited and enrolled 327 participants. Data collection occurred June 26th to October 30th. Data analysis is ongoing. CONCLUSIONS: Very few current COVID-19 studies focus on the perspective and experience of minority populations. Because Hispanic communities are disproportionately affected by COVID-19, it is important to understand the factors the contribute to this disparity and the next steps that should be taken to reduce the COVID-19 burden in this population.

Existing volume visualization methods, however, cannot cope with its very low signal-to-noise ratio. In order to design more powerful transfer functions, we propose to leverage soft segmentation as an explicit component of visualization for noisy volumes. Our technical realization is based on semi-supervised learning where we combine the advantages of two segmentation algorithms. A first weak segmentation algorithm provides good results for propagating sparse user provided labels to other voxels in the same volume. This weak segmentation algorithm is used to generate dense pseudo labels. A second powerful deep-learning based segmentation algorithm can learn from these pseudo labels to generalize the segmentation to other unseen volumes, a task that the weak segmentation algorithm fails at completely. The proposed volume visualization uses the deep-learning based segmentation as a component for segmentation-aware transfer function design. Appropriate ramp parameters can be suggested automatically through histogram analysis. Finally, our visualization uses gradient-free ambient occlusion shading to further suppress visual presence of noise, and to give structural detail desired prominence. The cryo-ET data studied throughout our technical experiments is based on the highest-quality tilted series of intact SARS-CoV-2 virions.

In this regard, a number of outbreaks have been recently reported due to inappropriate processing of alcoholic beverages. Shiraz, a city located in the southern part of Iran, faced one of such outbreaks in 2020 during COVID-19 pandemic. There is no sufficient literature on the electrocardiographic findings in methanol toxicity. This study aimed to address this gap in the literature. Method : A total of 356 cases with methanol toxicity referred to Shiraz University of Medical Science Tertiary Hospitals (Faghihi and Namazi) in March and April, 2020. The clinical findings of blindness and impaired level of consciousness, lab data such as arterial blood gas, electrolytes, and creatinine, and the most common findings from ECGs were collected. Results : The most common ECG findings were J point elevation (68.8%), presence of U wave (59.2%), QTc prolongation (53.2% in males and 28.6% in females), and fragmented QRS (33.7%). An outstanding finding in this study was the presence of myocardial infarction in 5.3% of the cases. This finding, to the best of our knowledge, has only been reported in a few case reports. Brugada pattern (8.1%) and Osborn wave (3.7%) were the other interesting findings.

Recent studies have suggested that home-based peanut OIT could be a safe and effective option for low-risk peanut-allergic children. In the period between September 1, 2020, and January 31, 2021, nine preschoolers with a history of mild allergic reactions to peanut underwent home-based peanut OIT. Eight of them (88.9%) completed the build-up phase at home in 11C28 weeks, tolerating a daily maintenance dose of 320 mg peanut protein. During the build-up, six patients (75.0%) reported urticaria, three (33.3%) reported gastrointestinal tract symptoms, and one (14.3%) reported oral pruritis. None of the patients developed anaphylaxis, required epinephrine, or attended emergency services related to OIT. One or two virtual follow-up visits were completed per patient during the build-up phase. Our case series shows that home-based OIT could be offered to the low-risk preschoolers during the COVID-19 pandemic when non-emergency services are limited and could be considered beyond the pandemic, especially for the families living in the rural or remote areas that may otherwise be unable to access OIT.","output":"Home-Based Peanut Oral Immunotherapy for Low-Risk Peanut-Allergic Preschoolers During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"None.","output":"The risk of the collapse of public health centres under the current system to prevent the spread of COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article is a descriptive analysis of the organizational steps undertaken to transform eight OR (operating rooms) of the University Hospital Lausanne CHUV into a dedicated ICU (intensive care unit) during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Through its Emerging Viral Pathogen Guidance for Antimicrobial Pesticides, the US Environmental Protection Agency has approved numerous surface disinfectant products for use against SARS-CoV-2. Despite their widespread use and range of associated health hazards, the majority of active ingredients in antimicrobial products, such as surface disinfectants, lack established occupational exposure limits (OELs) to assist occupational health professionals in characterizing risks from exposures to these chemicals. Based on established approaches from various organizations, a framework for deriving OELs specific to antimicrobial agents was developed that relies on a weight-of-evidence evaluation of the available data. This framework involves (1) a screening-level toxicological assessment based on a review of the existing literature and recommendations, (2) identification of the critical adverse effect(s) and doseCresponse relationship(s), (3) identification of alternative health-based exposure limits (HBELs), (4) derivation of potential OELs based on identified points of departure and uncertainty factors and/or modification of existing alternative HBELs, and (5) selection of an appropriate OEL. To demonstrate the use of this framework, a case study is described for selection of an OEL for a disinfectant product containing quaternary ammonium compounds (quats). Three potential OELs were derived for this product based on irritation toxicity data, developmental and reproductive toxicity (DART) data, and modification of an existing HBEL. The final selected OEL for the quats-containing product was 0.1 mg/m(3), derived from modification of an existing HBEL.

Although airway neutrophilia is associated with severity, poor response to glucocorticoids and exacerbations, the pathophysiological role of neutrophils in asthma remains poorly understood. Twenty-four patients with asthma and 22 healthy controls (HCs) were prospectively recruited. Highly purified peripheral blood neutrophils (> 99%) were evaluated for ROS production and activation status upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Plasma levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO), CXCL8, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), granulocyteCmonocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) were measured by ELISA. Plasma concentrations of citrullinated histone H3 (CitH3) and circulating free DNA (dsDNA) were evaluated as NET biomarkers.

In this time of the coronavirus pandemic, the whole world is looking for a rapid, sensitive, specific, and reliable test to put a check on the spread of infection. The development of a biosensor for COVID-19 detection can also provide a promising tool for the rapid screening of suspected patients and community surveillance. A biological recognition element (BRE) is an important component of a biosensor that provides a site for specific attachment of a particular analyte. A biological recognition element is a biomolecule or a fraction of a molecule, and the selection of an appropriate biological recognition element is the most crucial step in research, fabrication, and application of biosensors under field conditions. Although the first biosensor was discovered nearly 58. years ago, tremendous progress has been made to fabricate different types of biosensors for the detection of pathogenic bacteria, viruses, fungi, environmental pollutants, allergens, toxins, etc. A biological recognition element, which is the key to the development of a biosensor, may be categorized as conventional or synthetic. Conventional biological recognition elements that include antibodies and enzymes are very commonly used nowadays for the fabrication of biosensors. Synthetic recognition elements include oligonucleotides, peptide nucleic acids, locked nucleic acids, aptamers, G-quadraplexes, molecularly imprinted polymers, etc. Modern biotechnology and genetic engineering tools have enabled us to develop recombinant biological recognition elements in vitro. The research and development in nanotechnology have opened up a large path for in vivo biosensors. These advances have paved the way for the generation of BREs other than those available in nature with high affinity.

We aim to describe the technique in accessing the C2-C3 disk space and efficacy of treating multilevel disease beginning at the C2 vertebral body. This includes an extensive technical report and surgical pearls. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA Compression at the level of C2 can be daunting to access because of steep approach required. Few studies have described the technique in reaching the C2 level, with less information describing the efficacy of a 5-level anterior fusion starting at C2. METHODS Patients who underwent surgery between 2000 and 2016 were identified utilizing the department billing database and ICD codes. Patients age, operative indications, levels treated, length of hospital stay, fusion outcome, and operative complications were explored. Independent analysis of fusion was performed. RESULTS The average length of hospital stay was 3.9 days. Eight patients reported significant improvement of hand weakness, numbness, and/or gait at 6 months follow-up. The most frequent complication was dysphagia (23%). One patient experienced recurrent symptoms secondary to nonunion, and another patient suffered a postoperative neurological worsening because of anterior spinal artery syndrome.

Multiple etiologies have been proposed, including delayed diagnosis and treatment. Guidelines recommend ruling out malignancy in men and women presenting with hematuria. This study sought to determine the difference in timing from presentation with hematuria to diagnosis of bladder cancer in women versus men. METHODS This is a retrospective population-based study examining the timing from presentation with hematuria to diagnosis of bladder cancer, based on data from the MarketScan databases, which include enrollees of more than 100 health insurance plans of approximately 40 large US employers from 2004 through 2010. All study patients presented with hematuria and were subsequently diagnosed with bladder cancer. The primary outcome measure was number of days between initial presentation with hematuria and diagnosis of bladder cancer by sex. RESULTS A total of 5416 men and 2233 women met inclusion criteria. Mean days from initial hematuria claim to bladder cancer claim was significantly longer in women (85.4 versus 73.6 days, P < .001), and the proportion of women with >6 month delay in bladder cancer diagnosis was significantly higher (17.3% versus 14.1%, P < .001). Women were more likely to be diagnosed with urinary tract infection (odds ratio = 2.32, 95% confidence interval = 2.07-2.59) and less likely to undergo abdominal or pelvic imaging (odds ratio = 0.80, 95% confidence interval = 0.71-0.89).

RESULTS: The prevalence of myocardial injury in our COVID-19 population is of 16%. The patients with cardiac injury were older, had a greater number of cardiovascular comorbidities and higher values of acute phase and inflammatory markers and leucocytes. They required more frequently hospitalization in Intensive Care Unit (10 [32.3%] vs 18 [11.4%]; p = .003) and the mortality rate was significantly higher (17 [54.8%] vs. 15 [9.5%], p < .001).

We then applied this classifier, with fixed weights, to an independent cohort of subjects with confirmed COVID-19 from Athens, Greece (N=71) using NanoString nCounter. Finally, we developed a proof-of-concept rapid, isothermal qRT-LAMP assay for the 5-mRNA host signature using the QuantStudio 6 qPCR platform. RESULTS: In 71 patients with COVID-19, the 5 mRNA classifier had an AUROC of 0.88 (95% CI 0.80-0.97) for identifying patients with severe respiratory failure and/or 30-day mortality (Figure 1). Applying a preset cutoff based on training data, the 5-mRNA classifier had 100% sensitivity and 46% specificity for identifying mortality, and 88% sensitivity and 68% specificity for identifying severe respiratory failure. Finally, our proof-of-concept qRT-LAMP assay showed high correlation with the reference NanoString 5-mRNA classifier (r=0.95). Figure 1. Validation of the 5-mRNA classifier in the COVID-19 cohort.

[Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Our 5-mRNA classifier demonstrated very high accuracy for the prediction of COVID-19 severity and could assist in the rapid, point-of-impact assessment of patients with confirmed COVID-19 to determine level of care thereby improving patient management and healthcare burden.

This study aims to assess the patients' perceptions on the risk or benefit of RAAS-I use focusing on the differences between the two waves of the pandemic in Northern Greece. Design and method: Patients visiting the emergency (non-COVID) department or the outpatient clinics of a tertiary hospital were invited to participate by completing a short questionnaire. This observational study was conducted during the first (April to June 2020) and the much more forceful second wave (November 2020) of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: In total 341 patients (183 women, 53.7%) taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor type 1 blockers (ARBs) participated (mean age 64.79.7 years). About half the patients (188, 55.1%) were taking RAAS-i for hypertension, while the rest for other indications (heart failure, coronary artery disease, etc.). The vast majority (319, 93.5%) were aware of the issue that some antihypertensive drugs might be harmful (mainly from TV reports). Several differences were noted between the participants of the first and the second wave (Table 1). In particular, more patients of the second wave, than of the first wave, knew if they were taking RAAS-I and had contacted their doctor with eventually 14 of them altering their therapeutic regimen. Moreover, the second wave patients, in contrast to the first wave participants, reported higher chances of getting COVID-19, with the majority of them believing they are more susceptible to SARS-COV-2 and expecting more severe disease course. Disturbingly, only few of the patients of the second wave and none of the first had been informed of the position of major scientific societies that patients should continue taking RAAS-i. Conclusions: Greek patients are aware of the issue relating the RAAS-i with the COVID-19 pandemic. Second wave participants seem more worried, seeking medical advice and inquiring drug substitution. Nevertheless they still lack information from scientific societies. Further research is warranted to assess whether patient oriented informative campaigns could comfort their concerns.","output":"Patients' perceptions on the use of renin-angiotensinaldosterone system inhibitors: Comparison between the first and the second COVID-19 pandemic waves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As some communities in the United States consider opening or begin to open public beaches, CDC offers the following considerations for steps beach managers can take to help protect their staff and beach visitors, both in the water and on land, and slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 Public beaches (such as swim areas at oceans, lakes, and other natural bodies of water) may be managed by local, state, territorial, federal, or tribal agencies or private entities Beach managers can determine, in collaboration with local health officials, whether and how to implement these considerations, making adjustments to meet the unique needs and circumstances of the local community Implementation should be guided by what is feasible, practical, and acceptable, and be tailored to the needs of each community These considerations are meant to supplement  not replace  any local, state, territorial, federal, or tribal health and safety laws, rules, or regulations with which beaches managers must comply","output":"Considerations for Public Beaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim was to investigate the role of online stakeholder groups, Instructional Design and Student satisfaction in predicting Quality of distance education during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Nurses in critical care units (CCUs) and hospital emergency services (HESs) have provided care to patients with COVID-19 under pressure and uncertainty. OBJECTIVE: To identify needs related to safety, organisation, decision-making, communication and psycho-socio-emotional needs perceived by critical care and emergency nurses in the region of Madrid, Spain, during the acute phase of the epidemic crisis. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study (the first phase of a mixed methods study) with critical care and emergency nurses from 26 public hospitals in Madrid using an online questionnaire. RESULTS: The response rate was 557, with 37.5% reporting working with the fear of becoming infected and its consequences, 28.2% reported elevated workloads, high patient-nurse ratios and shifts that did not allow them to disconnect or rest, while taking on more responsibilities when managing patients with COVID-19 (23.9%). They also reported deficiencies in communication with middle management (21.2%), inability to provide psycho-social care to patients and families and being emotionally exhausted (53.5%), with difficulty in venting emotions (44.9%).

The search and selection criteria were restricted to English language. Study eligibility criteria: Inclusion criteria were pregnant women with a confirmed Coronavirus related illness, defined as either SARS, MERS or COVID-19. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: We used meta-analyses of proportions to combine data and reported pooled proportions. The pregnancy outcomes observed included miscarriage, preterm birth, pre-eclampsia, preterm prelabor rupture of membranes, fetal growth restriction, and mode of delivery. The perinatal outcomes observed were fetal distress, Apgar score < 7 at five minutes, neonatal asphyxia, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, perinatal death, and evidence of vertical transmission. Results: 19 studies including 79 women were eligible for this systematic review: 41 pregnancies (51.9%) affected by COVID-19, 12 (15.2%) by MERS, and 26 (32.9%) by SARS. An overt diagnosis of pneumonia was made in 91.8% and the most common symptoms were fever (82.6%), cough (57.1%) and dyspnea (27.0%). For all CoV infections, the rate of miscarriage was 39.1% (95% CI 20.2-59.8); the rate of preterm birth < 37 weeks was 24.3% (95% CI 12.5-38.6); premature prelabor rupture of membranes occurred in 20.7% (95% CI 9.5-34.9), preeclampsia in 16.2% (95% CI 4.2-34.1), and fetal growth restriction in 11.7% (95% CI 3.2-24.4); 84% were delivered by cesarean; the rate of perinatal death was 11.1% (95% CI 84.8-19.6) and 57.2% (95% CI 3.6-99.8) of newborns were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. When focusing on COVID-19, the most common adverse pregnancy outcome was preterm birth < 37 weeks, occurring in 41.1% (95% CI 25.6-57.6) of cases, while the rate of perinatal death was 7.0% (95% CI 1.4-16.3).

To date, evidence on determinants, prevalence, and trends of undernutrition and anemia for the entire West and Central African region is missing. This paper provides evidence on trends and levels of adolescent anemia and undernutrition in West and Central Africa. METHODS: We pooled all Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) for West and Central African countries that were conducted between 1986 and 2017 to analyze levels and trends of adolescent anemia and undernutrition. We investigated the association of adolescent undernutrition and anemia within this region with World Bank income level classification of the country. RESULTS: Our findings suggest that the regional prevalence of adolescent anemia and undernutrition remained high at 45% and 19% respectively over the last 20 years. Anemia increased in about one third of countries and undernutrition in about two thirds over the studied period. On the aggregated level, these trends are largely masked and both levels remained stable in the entire region between the years 1998 and 2017. The results of the multivariable regression analysis indicate an association of adolescence with undernutrition and anemia, which was independent of socio-economic factors such as income, education, and place of residence. CONCLUSION: We conclude that levels of adolescent undernutrition and anemia remain high with little progress over the last 20 years and that adolescence is a significant correlate of both anemia and undernutrition. Given the recognition of the international community that adolescent nutrition is an important public health concern in resource-poor settings, there is an urgent need to improve data availability, quality, and use for decision-making and to design successful high-impact interventions to combat adolescent malnutrition in low- and middle-income countries.","output":"Levels and trends of adolescent girls undernutrition and anemia in West and Central Africa from 1998 to 2017"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus (COVID\\\\19) has affected life expectancy and disturbed economic growth.

The aim of this study was to measure the association between history of bariatric surgery and the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: Data source included PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Google Scholar, and pre-print servers between January and November 1, 2020. Literature was screened and selected to extract the relevant data. The two outcomes of this meta-analysis were the difference in mortality and hospitalization rates in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection with and without history of bariatric surgery. Random-effect models were used to estimate the pooled effects. RESULTS: The systematic review yielded 3 retrospective studies on 9022 patients. The risk of mortality without previous bariatric surgery was 133 per 1000 cases and its risk with previous bariatric surgery was 33 per 1000 (summary OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.19C0.26). No heterogeneity was observed between the included studies (I(2) = 0%, P = 0.98 for heterogeneity). In the pooled analysis, the hospitalization rate in patients without previous bariatric surgery was 412 per 1000 cases and its rate in patients with previous bariatric surgery was 164 per 1000 (summary OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.12C0.65). No heterogeneity was observed between the included studies (I(2) = 0%, P = 0.71 for heterogeneity). There was a substantial risk of bias across the studies for confounding and selection bias.

While previous studies have analyzed geographic outcomes of the match in prior years, the effects of COVID-19 have not been determined. This study aims to contribute 2021 match data to determine the effects of COVID-19 on the geographic distribution of the integrated plastic surgery match. METHODS: Official match results for each program were populated by searching official program institutional websites and social media pages. Trainees home medical institutions and current integrated plastic surgery residency programs were noted. Statistical analysis compared geographic distribution in COVID-19 affected (2021) and non-COVID-19 affected (2015-2020) match years. RESULTS: Of 85 integrated plastic surgery programs, 80% (n = 68) of programs and 1,015 matched trainees were included in this study. The average percentage of institutional matches in COVID-19-affected match year was 25.12%, compared to 16.67% for non-COVID-19-affected match years (p = 0.0012). The odds ratio of matching at a home institution in 2021 compared to prior years was 1.68 (95% CI 1.11-2.53). CONCLUSIONS: Our study is consistent with previous studies that demonstrate strong match preferences for affiliated medical students but also adds that this trend may be amplified in the post-COVID-19 era. While multiple factors may be involved in geographic distributions of residency match outcomes, the results of this study suggest that COVID-19 restrictions on travel and exposure to outside programs may have contributed to an even higher percentage of matches within the same institution.","output":"Effect of COVID-19 on Geographic Distribution of the Integrated Plastic Surgery Match"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Lung cancer is the major cause of cancer related deaths in the world. New therapies have improved outcomes. Unfortunately, overall 5 year survival is ~20%. Therefore, better understanding of tumor biology and the microenvironment may lead to new therapeutic targets. The lung microbiome has recently emerged as a major mediator of host inflammation and pathogenesis. Understanding how the lung microbiota exerts its effects on lung cancer and the tumor microenvironment will allow for novel development of therapies. ABSTRACT: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death. Over the past 5C10 years lung cancer outcomes have significantly improved in part due to better treatment options including immunotherapy and molecularly targeted agents. Unfortunately, the majority of lung cancer patients do not enjoy durable responses to these new treatments. Seminal research demonstrated the importance of the gut microbiome in dictating responses to immunotherapy in melanoma patients. However, little is known regarding how other sites of microbiota in the human body affect tumorigenesis and treatment responses. The lungs were traditionally thought to be a sterile environment; however, recent research demonstrated that the lung contains its own dynamic microbiota that can influence disease and pathophysiology. Few studies have explored the role of the lung microbiome in lung cancer biology. In this review article, we discuss the links between the lung microbiota and cancer, with particular focus on immune responses, metabolism and strategies to target the lung microbiome for cancer prevention.","output":"The Lung Microbiome: A Central Mediator of Host Inflammation and Metabolism in Lung Cancer Patients?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 landed in a United States that is deeply divided in opportunity, health, and hope;a reality that is manifest in the million lives lost to deaths of despair in the past decade.

We have developed one such approach based on previously described broad-range reverse transcription PCR/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (RT-PCR/ESI-MS) technology. METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Analysis of base compositions of RT-PCR amplicons from influenza core gene segments (PB1, PB2, PA, M, NS, NP) are used to provide sub-species identification and infer influenza virus H and N subtypes. Using this approach, we detected and correctly identified 92 mammalian and avian influenza isolates, representing 30 different H and N types, including 29 avian H5N1 isolates. Further, direct analysis of 656 human clinical respiratory specimens collected over a seven-year period (1999C2006) showed correct identification of the viral species and subtypes with >97% sensitivity and specificity. Base composition derived clusters inferred from this analysis showed 100% concordance to previously established clades. Ongoing surveillance of samples from the recent influenza virus seasons (2005C2006) showed evidence for emergence and establishment of new genotypes of circulating H3N2 strains worldwide. Mixed viral quasispecies were found in approximately 1% of these recent samples providing a view into viral evolution. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Thus, rapid RT-PCR/ESI-MS analysis can be used to simultaneously identify all species of influenza viruses with clade-level resolution, identify mixed viral populations and monitor global spread and emergence of novel viral genotypes.

The alpha defensin test has been recently reported as a promising diagnostic test for periprosthetic joint infection. The goal of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of alpha defensin testing. METHODS One hundred and eighty-three synovial alpha defensin and synovial fluid C-reactive protein (CRP) tests performed in 183 patients undergoing evaluation for periprosthetic joint infection were reviewed. Results were compared with the Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) criteria for periprosthetic joint infection. RESULTS Alpha defensin tests were performed prior to surgical treatment for infection, and 37 of these patients who had these tests were diagnosed by MSIS criteria as having infections. Among this group, the alpha defensin test had a sensitivity of 81.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 64.8% to 92.0%) and a specificity of 95.9% (95% CI, 91.3% to 98.5%). There were 6 false-positive results, 4 of which were associated with metallosis. There were 7 false negatives, all of which were associated with either draining sinuses (n = 3) or low-virulence organisms (n = 4). A combined analysis of alpha defensin and synovial fluid CRP tests was performed in which a positive result was represented by a positive alpha defensin test and a positive synovial fluid CRP test (n = 28). Among this group, the sensitivity was calculated to be 73.0% (95% CI, 55.9% to 86.2%) and the specificity was calculated to be 99.3% (95% CI, 96.2% to 99.9%). An additional combined analysis was performed where a positive result was represented by a positive alpha defensin test or positive synovial fluid CRP test (n = 64). Among this group, the sensitivity was calculated to be 91.9% (95% CI, 78.1% to 98.3%) and the specificity was calculated to be 79.5% (95% CI, 72.0% to 85.7%). CONCLUSIONS Alpha defensin in combination with synovial fluid CRP demonstrates very high sensitivity for diagnosing periprosthetic joint infection, but may yield false-positive results in the presence of metallosis or false-negative results in the presence of low-virulence organisms. When both alpha defensin and synovial fluid CRP tests are positive, there is a very high specificity for diagnosing periprosthetic joint infection. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Diagnostic Level III.

This need led to the development of home-based online treatment channels, previously unfamiliar, and unaccepted in this population. The implementation of this model had to take into consideration many of the difficulties inherent in the use of online treatment in Jewish Ultra-Orthodox mental health patients. Aims: We sought to investigate our online home-based treatment model implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic in previously hospitalized young Ultra-Orthodox women with EDs. Method: We briefly review the literature on: (1) The Jewish Israeli Ultra-Orthodox culture;(2) Young women in Ultra-Orthodox society;and (3) EDs in Jewish Israeli Ultra-Orthodox women. We then present the inpatient ED department for Ultra-Orthodox young women and describe the online treatment model adapted to this population during the COVID-19 pandemic. We highlight the difficulties, dilemmas, and advantages of our online model with the description of three patients. Findings: Online therapy can serve as a barrier to treatment in some cases, due to physical (lack of suitable online devices except phones), familial (over-crowded families), and religious circumstances, as well as because of the patients' reluctance to take part in this treatment. In other cases, virtual home-based treatment can lead to a positive change. This may be the case in patients who find the distancing online model suitable for them, and in parents who are committed to treatment, using their greater physical and emotional presence at home during the COVID-19 pandemic for the good if their ill-daughters. Discussion: This paper highlights the difficulties and possibilities inherent in a virtual home-based treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic for Ultra-Orthodox young women previously hospitalized because of an ED. This model can be effective for some patients and families if undertaken by a multidisciplinary team that is not only knowledgeable about the treatment of EDs and the use of online strategies but also knowledgeable and culturally sensitive to the specific needs and codes of Ultra-Orthodox populations.","output":"Virtual Online Home-Based Treatment During the COVID-19 Pandemic for Ultra-Orthodox Young Women With Eating Disorders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Knowledge about the pollen viability is important to ensure success in controlled hybridizations and, consequently, support breeding programs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Blood flow velocity and pressure were measured in peri-aneurysmal locations by use of an intravascular dual-sensor pressure and Doppler velocity guidewire before and after flow-diverting stent treatment of 4 unruptured cerebral aneurysms. These measurements defined inflow and outflow boundary conditions for computational models. Intra-aneurysmal flow rates, wall shear stress, and wall shear stress gradient were calculated. RESULTS Measurements of inflow velocity and outflow pressure were successful in all 4 patients. Computational models incorporating these measurements demonstrated significant reductions in intra-aneurysmal wall shear stress and wall shear stress gradient and a trend in reduced intra-aneurysmal blood flow.

Methods: Using data from the UCL COVID-19 Social Study, a large weekly online panel of UK adults from first three months of lockdown in the UK (n = 51,600), we tested whether within-person changes in confidence in government, mental wellbeing, social experiences and awareness of COVID-19 were longitudinally related to self-reported compliance levels with guidelines from authorities using random intercept cross-lagged panel models. Findings: We found evidence of a small longitudinal association between increased confidence in government to tackle the pandemic and higher self-reported compliance, but little evidence that factors such as mental health and wellbeing, worries about future adversities, and social isolation and loneliness were related to later compliance. We found higher self-reported compliance was longitudinally related to higher depressive symptoms. We found that low compliance was related to lower leisure engagement, providing care, and working outside the home.

Heart transplant patients represent a unique cohort of chronically immunosuppressed subjects in which SARS-CoV-2 may stimulate an unpredictable clinical course of infection. METHODS: Since February 2020, we enrolled all 47 cases (79% male) in a first cohort of patients, with a mean age of 61.8  14.5 years, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, out of 2,676 heart transplant recipients alive before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic at 7 heart transplant centers in Northern Italy. RESULTS: To date, 38 patients required hospitalization while 9 remained self-home quarantined and 14 died. Compared to the general population, prevalence (18 vs. 7 cases per 1,000) and related case fatality rate (29.7% vs. 15.4%) in heart transplant recipients were doubled.

In the lesion patterns on chest CTs, we found that pure ground-glass opacities(GGO)(69%, 95%CI 58C80%), consolidation(47%, 35C60%) and air bronchogram sign(46%,25C66%) were more common than the atypical lesion of crazy-paving pattern(15%, 8C22%). With regard to disease extent and involvement, 70%(95%CI 46C95%) of cases showed a location preference for the right lower lobe, 65%(58C73%) of patients presented with 3 lobes involvement, and meanwhile, 42%(32C53%) of patients had involvement of all five lobes, while 67%(55C78%) of patients showed a predominant peripheral distribution. An understanding of some important CT features might be helpful for medical surveillance and management. In terms of clinical features, muscle soreness(21%, 95%CI 15C26%) and diarrhea(7%, 4C10%) were minor symptoms compared with fever(80%, 74C87%) and cough(53%, 33C72%).

Mutations and recombination events mediate pathogen jumps between host species. The close phylogenetic relationship between humans and non-human primates allows the transmission of pathogens between these species. These pathogens cause severe impacts on public health and impair the conservation of habituated or non-habituated wild-living apes. Constant exposure of great apes to human actions such as hunting, deforestation, the opening of roads, and tourism, for example, contributes to increased interaction between humans and great apes. In spite of several studies emphasizing the risks of pathogen transmission between animals and humans, outbreaks of the reverse transmission of infectious agents threatening wildlife still occur on the African continent. In this context, measures to prevent the emergence of new diseases and conservation of primate species must be based on the One Health concept; that is, they must also ensure the monitoring of the environment and involve political and social aspects. In this article, we review and discuss the anthropological aspects of the transmission of diseases between people and wild primates and discuss new anthropozoonotic diseases in great apes in Africa from studies published between 2016 and 2020.

It is unclear how the curtailment of oral health services has affected underserved populations who already often have limited access to dental care due to cost, fear, stigma, and discrimination. OBJECTIVES: To explore the experiences of underserved populations and their community organizations when accessing oral health services and information in British Columbia and identify their coping mechanisms employed during the curtailment of oral health care services. METHODS: Semistructured, remote interviews were conducted with 13 staff and 18 members from 6 community-based organizations. These organizations serve men and women with a history of incarceration and/or experiencing poverty and homelessness, persons living with human immunodeficiency virus/AIDS, adults living with mental illness, and older adults in long-term care facilities. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded for emerging themes using NVivo 12 software. Thematic analysis was performed. RESULTS: The pandemic raised concerns and hesitancy among underserved populations and further reduced access to care. In turn, those with unmet dental needs resorted to coping mechanisms, including turning to community support or medical services, self-management of dental issues, and not dealing with dental issues altogether. Community organizers and members outlined needed resources such as assistance navigating the dental care system, having a contact for dental-related questions, and member preparation for dental service changes, while emphasizing the importance of positive relationships with dental providers. CONCLUSION: Underserved populations who already face barriers to oral health care services experienced increased difficulty in addressing their oral health needs and concerns during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Strategies aimed at reaching out to this population and those who support them are needed to help mitigate negative coping strategies and increased oral health disparities.

During 2016 and 2017, 886 acute gastroenteritis (AGE) stool samples from ten Brazilian states were analyzed by TaqMan(?)-based qPCR, to detect and quantify HBoV. Positive samples were genotyped by sequencing the VP1/2 overlap region, followed by phylogenetic analysis and co-infections were accessed by screening other gastroenteric viruses. HBoV was detected in 12.4% (n = 110) of samples, with viral load ranging from 1.6  10(2) to 1.2  10(9) genome copies per gram of stool. From these, co-infections were found in 79.1%, and a statistically lower HBoV viral load was found compared to viral loads of rotavirus, norovirus and adenovirus in double infected patients (p < 0.05). No significant differences were found between HBoV viral load in single or co-infections, age groups or genotypes. Phylogenetic analysis identified the circulation of HBoV-1 in 38%, HBoV-2 in 40% and HBoV-3 in 22%.

The mechanistic investigation of zoonotic diseases of the GI tract, in which animals can act as asymptomatic carriers, could provide important information for therapeutic approaches. In veterinary medicine, farm animals are no less relevant, as they can serve as models for the development of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches of GI diseases in the target species. However, farm animal-derived cell lines of the intestinal epithelium are rarely available from standardised cell banks and, in addition, are not usually specific for certain sections of the intestine. Immortalised porcine or bovine enterocytic cell lines are more widely available, compared to goat or sheep-derived cell lines; no continuous cell lines are available from the chicken. Other epithelial cell types with intestinal section-specific distribution and function, such as goblet cells, enteroendocrine cells, Paneth cells and intestinal stem cells, are not represented in those cell line-based models. Therefore, intestinal organoid models of farm animal species, which are already widely used for mice and humans, are gaining importance. Crypt-derived or pluripotent stem cell-derived intestinal organoid models offer the possibility to investigate the mechanisms of inter-cell or host-pathogen interactions and to answer species-specific questions. This review is intended to give an overview of cell culture models of the intestinal epithelium of farm animals, discussing species-specific differences, culture techniques and some possible applications for intestinal organoid models.

OBJECTIVES: Describe susceptibility patterns to several antimicrobials in gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from patients causing HAIs at three private tertiary care hospitals in Saudi Arabia over a 5-year period. METHODS: Data on trends of antimicrobial susceptibility among bacteria causing HAIs events in children and adults at three tertiary private hospitals located in Riyadh and Qassim, Saudi Arabia, were collected retrospectively between 2015 and 2019 using the surveillance data datasets. RESULTS: Over a 5-year period, 38,624 pathogens caused 17,539 HAI events in 17,566 patients. About 9450 (53.8%) of patients who suffered HAIs were females and the average age was 41.7  14.3 years (78.1% were adults and 21.9% were children). Gram-negative pathogens were 2.3-times more likely to cause HAIs compared to gram-positive bacteria (71.9% vs. 28.1%). The ranking of causative pathogens in decreasing order was: Escherichia coli (38%), Klebsiella species (15.1%), and Staphylococcus aureus (12.6%). Gram-positive isolates were mostly susceptible to linezolid (91.8%) whereas they were resistant to ampicillin (52.6%), cefoxitin (54.2%), and doxycycline (55.9%). Gram-negative isolates were mostly sensitive to tigecycline (95%) whereas they were resistant to cefotaxime (49.5%) and cefixime (59.6%). During the 5 years, there were relatively stable susceptibility patterns to all tested antimicrobials, except for cefotaxime which shown a susceptibility reduction by 41.4%, among Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species. An increase in the susceptibility of Acinetobacter and Enterobacter and Citrobacter species to all studied antimicrobials was observed except for colistin that had a slight sensitivity reduction in 2019 by 4.3% against Acinetobacter species. However, we noted reduced sensitivity of MRSA, CoNS and Enterococcus species to gentamicin; and increased resistance of MRSA to linezolid and vancomycin. CONCLUSION: The observed increase in susceptibility of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to studied antimicrobials is important; however, reduced sensitivity of MRSA, CoNS and Enterococcus species to gentamicin; and increased resistance of MRSA to linezolid and vancomycin is a serious threat and calls for effective antimicrobial stewardship programs.","output":"Antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria: a 5-year retrospective analysis at a multi-hospital healthcare system in Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Originating in December 2019 in China, SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as the deadliest pandemic in humankind's history.

We also evaluated the persistence of the virus on banknotes spiked with SARS-CoV-2 positive diluted human nasopharyngeal samples. Among the 425 banknote samples collected from different entities, 7.29% (n = 31) were tested positive for targeted genes. Twenty-four positive representative samples were assessed for n gene fragments by conventional PCR and sequenced. All the samples that carry viral RNA belonged to the GR clade, the predominantly circulating clade in Bangladesh. In the stability test, the n gene was detected for up to 72 h on banknotes spiked with nasopharyngeal samples, and CT values increase significantly with time (p < 0.05). orf1b gene was observed to be less stable, especially on old banknotes, and usually went beyond detectable limit within 8 to 10 h.

In response, the academic community has produced multiple forecasting models, approaches and algorithms to best predict the different indicators of COVID-19, such as the number of confirmed infected cases. Yet, researchers had little to no historical information about the pandemic at their disposal in order to inform their forecasting methods. Our work studies the predictive performance of models at various stages of the pandemic to better understand their fundamental uncertainty and the impact of data availability on such forecasts. We use historical data of COVID-19 infections from 253 regions from the period of 22nd January 2020 until 22nd June 2020 to predict, through a rolling window backtesting framework, the cumulative number of infected cases for the next 7 and 28 days. We implement three simple models to track the root mean squared logarithmic error in this 6-month span, a baseline model that always predicts the last known value of the cumulative confirmed cases, a power growth model and an epidemiological model called SEIRD. Prediction errors are substantially higher in early stages of the pandemic, resulting from limited data. Throughout the course of the pandemic, errors regress slowly, but steadily. The more confirmed cases a country exhibits at any point in time, the lower the error in forecasting future confirmed cases. We emphasize the significance of having a rigorous backtesting framework to accurately assess the predictive power of such models at any point in time during the outbreak which in turn can be used to assign the right level of certainty to these forecasts and facilitate better planning.","output":"Backtesting the predictability of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This renin-angiotensin system (RAS) interpretation is focused on differences in tissue dependence on RAS and on the topological hierarchy that allows mediators to act only on downstream tissues.

RESULTS: Overall, 4018 were analyzed. Most participants were female (70.7%), and the mean age was 21.7 years (SD 4.0). The mean MCS score was 44.5 (SD 17.3). Impaired mental health, defined by a MCS < 1st Quartile, was mainly associated with female sex; decreased time for learning; not having access to the outside with a garden, a terrace or a balcony; difficulties with the living situation and having someone in the home affected by the SARS-COV2 requiring hospitalization or not. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that living conditions during lockdown had a clear impact on the mental health of French post-secondary students. There is a need to improve prevention and to access distance education as well as an urgent need for measures to develop healthy coping strategies for students. This is significant challenge and will assist in moderating the risk for the development of further distress and mental health concerns.","output":"Effect of the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown on mental health among post-secondary students in the Grand Est region of France: results of the PIMS-CoV19 study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Previous studies on the pneumonia outbreak caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have focused on the general population and pregnant women, while little is known about the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on retardation during and after pregnancy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential influence of SARS-CoV-2 on infant neurobehavioral development. Methods: A case-control study was conducted in Wuhan Maternal and Child Health Hospital, China. Nine pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 9 controls matched by maternal age, parity, and status of chronic disease were included. Infantile neurobehavioral development was assessed through the Ages and Stages Questionnaires Edition 3 (ASQ-3). Results: The majority of pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 experienced cesarean section (7 of 9), which was higher than the control group (5 of 9). The throat swabs of all newborn were negative. We found that compared with the control group, neonates of mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy had lower scores in communication, gross movement, fine movement, problem solving, and personal-social domains; but only fine movement domain yielded statistical significance (P = 0.031).

We develop a method to quantify neighborhood activity behaviors at high spatial and temporal resolutions and test whether, and to what extent, behavioral responses to social-distancing policies vary with socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. We define exposure density ([Formula: see text]) as a measure of both the localized volume of activity in a defined area and the proportion of activity occurring in distinct land-use types. Using detailed neighborhood data for New York City, we quantify neighborhood exposure density using anonymized smartphone geolocation data over a 3-mo period covering more than 12 million unique devices and rasterize granular land-use information to contextualize observed activity. Next, we analyze disparities in community social distancing by estimating variations in neighborhood activity by land-use type before and after a mandated stay-at-home order. Finally, we evaluate the effects of localized demographic, socioeconomic, and built-environment density characteristics on infection rates and deaths in order to identify disparities in health outcomes related to exposure risk. Our findings demonstrate distinct behavioral patterns across neighborhoods after the stay-at-home order and that these variations in exposure density had a direct and measurable impact on the risk of infection. Notably, we find that an additional 10% reduction in exposure density city-wide could have saved between 1,849 and 4,068 lives during the study period, predominantly in lower-income and minority communities.","output":"Exposure density and neighborhood disparities in COVID-19 infection risk"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Hypertension is the most important modifiable risk factor for stroke and an important contributor to the racial disparities of stroke incidence. Thus, working within the communities in which racial disparities of stroke are prevalent is important.Trials working with such communities may have low participant retention at least partially attributable to social determinants of health such as limited time, transportation and access to medical care. Trial outcome adaptations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic allowed us to compare in-person to virtual retention strategies as a possible strategy to improve trial retention. Methods: Reach Out is a health system focused, multi-component, health theory based, mobile health behavioral intervention to reduce blood pressure (BP) among Emergency Department (ED) patients at a safety net hospital in the under-resourced, minority, majority community of Flint, Michigan. The primary outcome is change in systolic blood pressure. Outcomes were conducted inperson from 10/4/2019 to 3/13/2020 at various locations throughout the community that were convenient for each participant. As a result of COVID-19 and the resulting state mandated stay-athome order, outcomes were converted to phone, text, and picture-based elements. Virtual outcomes consists of: 1) a texted picture validating BP cuff is in correct body placement;2) 3 self-reported blood pressures;and 3) telephone outcome survey. Virtual outcomes were offered at times convenient to participants throughout the daytime, evening, and weekend. Results: Prior to COVID-19, 6-month outcomes were conducted in-person. Of possible in-person outcomes, 76 of 140 (54%) were completed. Tele-outcomes commenced on 4/9/2020.

Tyrol is known for numerous skiing areas. Thus, winter sport resorts became a starting point for COVID-19 infections spreading towards the rest of the state, Austria and other countries, leading to a mandatory quarantine for almost a million people, who were placed under a curfew and restrictions in daily life. Additionally, all ski resorts and hotels were closed. We aimed to analyze the influence of the COVID-19 quarantine on traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases in Tyrol. METHODS: We retrospectively compared demographical and injury characteristics from all TBI patients within the 2020 strict quarantine period with the respective time periods from 2016 to 2019. As our department is the only neurosurgical unit in Tyrol, all patients with moderate or severe TBI are transferred to our hospital. RESULTS: During 3 weeks of the full quarantine period, the weekly TBI cases load decreased significantly in comparison to the same time periods in the years 2016C2019. Furthermore, concomitant skull fractures decreased significantly (p < 0.016), probably reflecting different causative mechanisms. The other demographical and injury characteristics and particularly falls at home stayed relatively unchanged.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of patients consecutively enrolled from two major academic hospitals exclusively for COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, from January 26, 2020, to March 26, 2020. The primary outcome was adjusted in-hospital mortality in the LMWH group compared with the non-LMWH group using the propensity score. RESULTS: Overall, 525 patients with COVID-19 enrolled with a median age of 64 years (IQR 19), and 49.33% men. Among these, 120 (22.86%) were treated with LMWH. Compared with the non-LMWH group, the LMWH group was more likely to be older and male; had a history of hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease (CHD), or stroke; and had more severe COVID-19 parameters such as higher inflammatory cytokines or D-dimer. Compared with non-LMWH group, LMWH group had a higher unadjusted in-hospital mortality rate (21.70% vs. 11.10%; p = 0.004), but a lower adjusted mortality risk (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.20; 95% CI, 0.09-0.46).

P. gulae strains with type C fimbriae were previously shown to be more virulent than other types. In this study, we further examined the host toxicity mediated by P. gulae fimbriae by constructing recombinant FimA (rFimA) expression vectors for each genotype and raised antibodies to the purified proteins. Methods and Results: All larvae died within 204 h following infection with P. gulae type C at the low-dose infection, whereas type A and B did not. Among fimA types, the survival rates of the larvae injected with rFimA type C were remarkably decreased, while the survival rates of the larvae injected with rFimA type A and type B were greater than 50%. Clindamycin treatment inhibited the growth of type C strains in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in an increased rate of silkworm survival. Finally, type C rFimA-speci?c antiserum prolonged the survival of silkworm larvae stimulated by infection with P. gulae type C strain or injection of rFimA type C protein. Conclusion: These results suggested that type C fimbriae have high potential for enhancement of bacterial pathogenesis, and that both clindamycin and anti-type C rFimA-specific antibodies are potent inhibitors of type C fimbriae-induced toxicity.

Emerging evidence suggests patients auto-emit aerosols containing viable respiratory viruses. These aerosols could be further propagated when patients undergo certain treatments including continuous positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy. This study aimed to assess the degree of viable virus propagated from mask leak in a PAP circuit and the mitigation of virus propagation by an air filter combined with a plastic canopy. Methods: Bacteriophage PhiX174 (108copies/mL) was nebulised into a custom PAP circuit within a non-vented clinical room. Mask leak was systematically varied to allow 0, 7, 21, 28 and 42 L/min at the mask interface. Plates containing Escherichia coli host assessed the degree of viable virus (via plaque forming unit) settling on surfaces around the room. In order to contain virus spread, the efficacy of a simple, low-cost ventilated headboard, created from a plastic tarpaulin hood and a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter was tested. Findings: Increasing mask leak was associated with virus contamination in a dose response manner (chisquared=58.24, df=4, p<0.001). Clinically relevant levels of leak (>21 L/min) were associated with virus counts equivalent to using PAP with a standard vented mask. The highest frequency of viruses was detected on surfaces 1m from the leak source, however, viable viruses were recorded on all plates (up to 3.86m from source). A plastic hood with HEPA filtration significantly reduced viable viruses on all plates. HEPA exchange rates of 170 and 470m3/hr eradicated all evidence of virus contamination. Interpretation: Mask leak from PAP circuits may be a major source of environmental contamination and nosocomial spread of infectious respiratory diseases. Subclinical levels of leak should be treated as an infectious risk. Cheap and low-cost patient hoods with HEPA filtration are an effective countermeasure.","output":"Viable virus aerosol propagation by PAP circuit leak and mitigation with a ventilated patient hood: a model for improving health care worker safety in the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Multiple studies have highlighted the negative impact of COVID-19 and its particular effects on vulnerable sub-populations.

Using a cross-sectional design, participants completed an online questionnaire providing data on key sociodemographic and health variables, and completed a measure of positive change. The positive change measure spanned diverse domains (e.g., more quality time with family, developing new hobbies, more physical activity, and better quality of sleep). We used univariate analysis and stepwise regression to examine the contribution of a range of sociodemographic factors (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity, educational attainment, and employment status) in explaining positive change. RESULTS: There were clear sociodemographic differences across positive change scores. Those reporting higher levels of positive change were female, from younger age groups, married or living with their partner, employed, and in better health.

However, these were less stringent than other nations. It has not been assessed whether soft containment policies were sufficiently effective in promoting social distancing or reducing human contact. Methods Utilising the Google mobility index to assess social distancing behaviour in all Japanese prefectures between 15 February 2020 and 12 June 2021, mobility changes were assessed by an interrupted time-series analysis after adjusting for seasonality and various prefecture-specific fixed-effects and distinguishing potential heterogeneity across multiple SoEs and time passed after the declaration. Results The mobility index for retail and recreation showed an immediate decline after the declaration of the SoE by 12.78 percent-points (95%CI: -13.61 to -11.94) and a further decline after the initial period (beta: -0.93, 95%CI: -1.11 to -0.74), but gradually increased by 0.02 percent-points (95%CI: 0.02 to 0.02). This trend was similar for mobilities in other places. Among the three SoEs, the overall decline in human mobility outside the home in the third SoE was the least significant, suggesting that people were less compliant with social distancing measures during this period. Conclusion Although less stringent government responses to the pandemic may help promote social distancing by controlling human mobilities outside the home, their effectiveness may decrease if these interventions are repeated and enforced for extended periods, distorting one's health belief by heuristics biases.

Of note, immediate antibody responses were identified among severe cases, compared to non-severe cases. On the other hand, only one were seroconverted for asymptomatic carriers. The SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses were well-maintained during the observation period.

We aimed to describe a novel strategy to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on a tertiary referral proctology center during the first wave of infection in Italy. METHODS: All patients booked appointments at the Proctology Unit between March 9th and May 4th, 2020 were identified. Patients booked for a first visit underwent a structured remote consultation. Patients with perianal or sacrococcygeal abscesses, major anorectal bleeding, incoercible anal pain and red flags for malignancy were labelled as \\"non-deferrable.\\" A flowchart was designed to comply with adequate assistance of proctologic patients. Demographics, clinical data and outcomes of in-office procedures were collected. RESULTS: On a total of 548 booked visits, 198 (36.1%) were cancelled before remote consultation. Of the remaining 350, 112 (32.0%) attended a follow-up visit. Among 238 (68.0%) patients undergoing remote consultation, 88 (25.1%) were deemed \\"deferrable\\" and 148 (42.3%) \\"non-deferrable.\\" Two (0.6%) were hospitalized for COVID-19 while waiting for an outpatient visit. Twenty-five of 88 (28.4%) deferrable patients cancelled their appointment as felt no longer necessary. A total of 45 of 148 (30.4%) non deferrable patients (mean age, 46 years; 31% females) underwent in-office procedures, most often related to anal abscess and/or fistula (48.9%). Final diagnosis of malignancy occurred in four cases. A 55% increase in the number of in-office procedures was noted compared to the previous year. None of the attending patients nor staff members resulted COVID-19 positive during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the uncertainties accompanying the use of remote consultations in proctology, the results of this study may inform the development of strategies for restructuring activities in response to future emergencies of this magnitude.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on a tertiary referral proctology center: no one should be left behind"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 25-year-old woman with a background history of bronchial asthma and intellectual disability presented to hospital with progressively worsening dyspnoea.

We aimed to investigate the relationship between von Willebrand factor (VWF) biomarkers, intravascular hemolysis, coagulation, and organ damage in COVID-19 patients and study their association with disease severity and mortality. We conducted a retrospective study of 181 hospitalized COVID-19 patients randomly selected with balanced distribution of survivors and nonsurvivors. Patients who died had significantly lower ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13) activity, significantly elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels, significantly increased shistocyte/RBC fragment counts, and significantly elevated VWF antigen and activity levels compared with patients discharged alive. These biomarkers correlate with markedly elevated D-dimers. Additionally, only 30% of patients who had an ADAMTS13 activity level of less than 43% on admission survived, yet 60% of patients survived who had an ADAMTS13 activity level of greater than 43% on admission. In conclusion, COVID-19 may present with low ADAMTS13 activity in a subset of hospitalized patients. Presence of schistocytes/RBC fragment and elevated D-dimer on admission may warrant a work-up for ADAMTS13 activity and VWF antigen and activity levels.

Besides, adverse clinical events (ACE) among COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU who died and were alive were compared, and the factors associated with mortality were explored. Methods & Materials Patients admitted to a single centre ICU with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed of SARS-CoV-2 virus within February 2020-2021 were included in this study. Adverse clinical event (ACE) consists of the presence of pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), line-related thrombosis, stroke, myocardial infarction (MI) and peripheral artery disease (PAD) during their ICU admission. A composite of ACE comprised  1 PE, DVT, line-related thrombosis, stroke, MI and PAD. Mortality is defined as COVID-19 patients who died during ICU admission throughout data collection. Results Mean (SD) age was 56.6 (13.7) with 63.5% male and 61.6% Malay. Median (IQR) 7 (3-14) days of ICU admission, 64.2%, 53.2 % and 20.9% had underlying hypertension, diabetes, and obesity, respectively. Out of 534 patients included in the study, 122 patients died, with 64.8% developed  1 ACE compared to 39.1% patients who survived the infection. Higher proportion of deceased patients developed PE (47.5% vs. 34%; p=0.006), MI (16.4% vs. 4.6%; p<0.001), stroke (12.3% vs. 1.5%; p<0.001) and DVT (2.5% vs. 0.2%; p=0.04) than those who survived. Significant predictors of mortality on multivariate logistic regression model include age [OR 1.05 (95% CI 1.03 C 1.07)], length of ICU stay [OR 1.05 (1.02 C 1.07), chronic kidney disease [OR 2.30 (1.32 C 4.01), and presence of  1 ACE [OR 2.32 (1.45 C 3.72)]. Conclusion The overall mortality of COVID-19 patients admitted to a single centre ICU is high (22.8%), with greater proportion of patients who developed 1 ACE. Key factors associated with the mortality were age, length of ICU stays, underlying chronic kidney disease and presence of  1 ACE. This finding might be helpful to the healthcare providers in the early detection and prevention of ACE associated with mortality among COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU.","output":"Mortality Among COVID-19 Patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU): A Single-Centre Study from a Malaysian Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emergency settings in obese people require tailored multidisciplinary protocols and pathways to manage these complex patients.

Exodus from training and consultant grades is expensive.The problems of staffing an emergency department has not been previously addressed by focusing on how those who work in them manage to do so.Methods/DesignEthnography conducted at a UK emergency department for 12-weeks, totalling nearly 200-hours of observation. A second site was planned but not possible due to COVID-19.Interviews with emergency physicians of all grades from the two initially planned sites, with doctors who have left emergency medicine, and with individuals working for stakeholder organisations. 40 interviews in total, averaging 45 minutes.Systematic scoping review of the relevant academic and policy literature.Reflexive thematic analysis of the ethnographic field notes, interview transcripts and literature.Results/ConclusionsEmergency physicians are active in managing their working day to mitigate the labour and environment. These actions have multiple overlapping motives but are demonstrably forms of retention work. They utilise objects and the environment in creative ways (materialities), for example completing paperwork in the resuscitation room because it is calm and air-conditioned.They utilise humour in a primarily self-deprecating manner and prioritise education as a means of valuing other staff and creating variety in their workday. Emergency physicians describe teamwork as vital to retention, but this is disparate and developed over long periods of time and therefore better described as community.The principle sustainability strategies employed limit exposure to shop floor working. This is achieved through less-than-full-time working and portfolio careers.

We aim to explore the phenomenology of burnout and CFS in a historical context as this may provide some insight into the links and relationship between these conditions. METHOD A narrative review based on literature in the fields of history, social science and medicine. RESULTS The origins of CFS lie within medicine, whereas burnout developed in a psychological setting. As well as symptoms, burnout and CFS also share similar themes such as an overload process triggering illness onset, the need for restoration of depleted energy, external causal attributions and the characteristics of people suffering from these illnesses. However, these themes are expressed in either psychological or medical terms according to the historical background. CONCLUSION Despite their similarities, there have been few direct comparisons of the two concepts. Culture, illness perceptions and accountability are important issues in both conditions and could contribute to their differences. Comparing burnout and CFS within one sample frame, thus looking beyond the psychology/medicine divide, could be a useful first step towards understanding their relationship.","output":"Two sides of the same coin?

This study aimed to identify novel therapeutic molecules using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data of breast cancer from our hospital. Methods: 30 pairs of human breast cancer tissue and matched normal tissue were collected and RNA sequenced in our hospital. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were calculated with raw data by the R package edgeR, and functionally annotated using R package clusterProfiler. Tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) were estimated using a website tool TIMER 2.0. Effects of key genes on therapeutic efficacy were analyzed using RNA-seq data and drug sensitivity data from two databases: the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and the Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal (CTRP). Results: There were 2,953 DEGs between cancerous and matched normal tissue, as well as 975 DEGs between primary breast cancer and metastatic breast cancer. These genes were primarily enriched in PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, calcium signaling pathway, cAMP signaling pathway, and cell cycle. Notably, CD8(+) T cell, M0 macrophage, M1 macrophage, regulatory T cell and follicular helper T cell were significantly elevated in cancerous tissue as compared with matched normal tissue. Eventually, we found five genes (GALNTL5, MLIP, HMCN2, LRRN4CL, and DUOX2) were markedly corelated with CD8(+) T cell infiltration and cytotoxicity, and associated with therapeutic response.

Although the treatment of BPPV is relatively successful, many patients suffer recurrence after treatment. Therefore, identifying potential risk factors for BPPV recurrence may help improve treatment outcome and patient prognosis. However, some related risk factors for BPPV recurrence are relatively controversial and poorly studied. This meta-analysis aims to identify potential risk factors associated with BPPV recurrence, thereby reducing the recurrence rate of BPPV and improving the prognosis of patients. METHODS This meta-analysis was conducted through systematically searching PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for eligible English original studies published up to June 2020. All search results were reviewed based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria. We calculated the pooled odds ratios (ORs) or the mean differences (MDs) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to evaluate the effects of included risk factors on BPPV recurrence. RESULTS A total of 14 studies involving 3060 BPPV patients published between 2010 and 2019 were finally included, including six prospective studies and eight retrospective studies, with a NOS score ranged from 6 to 9. Our pooled results of this meta-analysis suggested that the recurrence of BPPV was closely related to female gender (OR = 1.42; 95% CI 1.17-1.74; P = 0.0004), hypertension (OR = 2.61; 95% CI 1.22-5.59; P = 0.01), diabetes mellitus (OR = 2.62; 95% CI 1.25-5.48; P = 0.01), hyperlipidemia (OR = 1.60; 95% CI 1.23-2.09; P = 0.0006), osteoporosis (OR = 1.72; 95% CI 1.03-2.88; P = 0.04) and vitamin D deficiency (MD = - 3.29; 95% CI - 5.32 to - 1.26; P = 0.001). CONCLUSION This meta-analysis indicated that female gender, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, osteoporosis, and vitamin D deficiency were risk factors for BPPV recurrence. However, the effects of other potential risk factors including advanced age, migraine, head trauma, and Menire's disease on BPPV recurrence need further investigations. Furthermore, most studies included in this meta-analysis were performed in Asia, so our results cannot easily be extended to the whole world population.

According to some experts, herd immunity for COVID-19 can be achieved by inoculating 67% of the population. India may find it difficult to achieve this service level target, owing to several infrastructural deficiencies in its vaccine supply chain. Effect of these deficiencies is to cause frequent lead time disruptions. In this context, we develop a novel modelling approach to identify few nodes, which require additional inventory allocations (strategic inventory reserves) to ensure minimum service level (67%) under the possibility of lead time disruptions. Later, through an illustrative case study on distribution of Japanese Encephalitis vaccine, we identify conditions under which strategic inventory reserve policy cannot be practically implemented to meet service level targets. Nodes fulfilling these conditions are termed as critical nodes and must be overhauled structurally to make the implementation of strategic inventory policy practically viable again. Structural overhauling may entail installation of better cold storage facilities, purchasing more quality transport vans, improving reliability of transport network, and skills of cold storage manager by training. Ideally, conditions for identifying critical nodes for COVID-19 vaccine distribution must be derived separately by substituting COVID-19 specific parametric values in our model. In the absence of the required data for COVID-19 scenario, JE specific criteria can be used heuristically to identify critical nodes and structurally overhaul them later for efficiently achieving service level targets.","output":"Strategies for Ensuring Required Service Level for COVID-19 Herd Immunity in Indian Vaccine Supply Chain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pediatric patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are increasing, and severe cases such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome are being reported.

The study aimed to establish a PBPK model of nafamostat in adults, then scale the adult PBPK model to children for predicting pediatric exposures of nafamostat and an optimal weight-based nafamostat dose in pediatric population. The developed model adequately described adult exposure data in healthy volunteers following i.v. administration with three doses (10, 20, and 40 mg). Scaling adult PBPK models to five pediatric groups predicted that as age advances from neonate to adult, the exposure of nafamostat slightly increased from neonate to infant, steadily decreased from infant to child, and then increased from child to adult after the administration of 0.2 mg/kg/h for 14 days, a dosing regimen being conducted in a clinical trial for COVID-19.

Though its pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been recently identified as a receptor for the entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into the cell. Here, we aimed to clarify the potential role of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2-induced acute lung injury and its underlying mechanism. As a receptor for coronavirus, ACE2 mediates the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells in a similar way as for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The high binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 correlates with its efficient spread among humans. On the other hand, ACE2 negatively regulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) primarily by converting angiotensin II to angiotensin 1C7, which exerts a beneficial effect on coronavirus-induced acute lung injury. Human recombinant ACE2 has been considered as a potential therapy for SARS-CoV-2 by blocking virus entry and redressing the imbalance of RAAS in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The level of ACE2 expression can be upregulated by treatment with an ACE inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin  type 1 receptor blocker (ARB).

The methods were developed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Risk of bias was assessed using the National Institutes of Heath quality assessment tools. STUDY SAMPLE: After rejecting 850 records, 28 case reports/series and 28 cross-sectional studies met the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: There are multiple reports of hearing loss (e.g. sudden sensorineural), tinnitus and rotatory vertigo in adults having a wide range of COVID-19 symptom severity.

Seizures generally account for approximately 1% of all emergency department (ED) visits (2,3). Persons of any age can experience seizures, and outcomes might range from no complications for those with a single seizure to increased risk for injury, comorbidity, impaired quality of life, and early mortality for those with epilepsy (4). To examine trends in weekly seizure- or epilepsy-related (seizure-related) ED visits? in the United States before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, CDC analyzed data from the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP). Seizure-related ED visits decreased abruptly during the early pandemic period. By the end of 2020, seizure-related ED visits returned almost to prepandemic levels for persons of all ages, except children aged 0-9 years. By mid-2021, however, this age group gradually returned to baseline as well. Reasons for the decrease in seizure-related ED visits in 2020 among all age groups and the slow return to baseline among children aged 0-9 years compared with other age groups are unclear. The decrease might have been associated with fear of exposure to COVID-19 infection in EDs deterring parents or guardians of children from seeking care, adherence to mitigation measures including avoiding public settings such as EDs, or increased access to telehealth services decreasing the need for ED visits (5).

Little is known about the mechanisms by which the virus causes central nervous system (CNS) symptoms, and therefore little guidance is available regarding potential workup or management options. CASES: We present a series of four consecutive cases, seen by our psychiatry consultation service over a one-week period, each of which manifested delirium as a result of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). DISCUSSION: The four cases highlighted here all occurred in older patients with premorbid evidence of cognitive decline. Unique features seen in multiple cases included rigidity, alogia, abulia, and elevated inflammatory markers. In all four cases, a change in mental status was the presenting symptom, and three of the four cases lacked significant respiratory symptoms. In addition to discussing unique features of the cases, we discuss possible pathophysiologic explanations for COVID-19 delirium. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium should be recognized as a potential feature of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and may be the only presenting symptom. Based on the high rates of delirium demonstrated in prior studies, hospitals should consider adding mental status changes to the list of testing criteria. Further research is needed to determine if delirium in COVID-19 represents a primary encephalopathy heralding invasion of the CNS by the virus, or a secondary encephalopathy related to systemic inflammatory response or other factors.","output":"Delirium in COVID-19: A case series and exploration of potential mechanisms for central nervous system involvement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the first known case of a COVID-19 infected patient in Wuhan, China on 8 December 2019, COVID-19 has spread to more than 200 countries, causing a worldwide public health crisis. The existing literature fails to examine what caused this sudden outbreak from a crisis management perspective. This article attempts to fill this research gap through analysis of big data, officially released information and other social media sources to understand the root cause of the crisis as it relates to Chinas current management system and public health policy. The article draws the following conclusions: firstly, strict government control over information was the main reason for the early silencing of media announcements, which directly caused most people to be unprepared and unaware of COVID-19. Secondly, a choice between addressing a virus with an unknown magnitude and nature, and mitigating known public panic during a politically and culturally sensitive time, lead to falsehood and concealment. Thirdly, the weak autonomous management power of local public health management departments is not conducive for providing a timely response to the crisis. Finally, the privatization of many state-owned hospitals led to the unavailability of public health medical resources to serve affected patients in the Wuhan and Hubei Province. This article suggests that China should adopt a Singaporean-style public health crisis information management system to ensure information disclosure and information symmetry and should use it to monitor public health crises in real time. In addition, the central government should adopt the territorial administration model of a public health crisis and increase investment in public health in China.","output":"What Caused the Outbreak of COVID-19 in China: From the Perspective of Crisis Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the Netherlands, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID?19) pandemic has resulted in excess mortality nationwide.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Prospective cohort study in 2 periods for internal (February-April 2020) and external (October-December 2020) validation. We included consecutive patients with severe COVID-19 who were transported by the emergency medical service of Catalonia. A risk model was developed to predict mortality based on variables recorded on first contact between the regional emergency coordination center and the transferring hospital. The model's performance was evaluated by means of calibration and discrimination, and the results for the first and second periods were compared. RESULTS Nine hundred patients were included, 450 in each period. In-hospital mortality was 33.8%. The 7 predictors included in the final model were age, comorbidity, need for prone positioning, renal insufficiency, use of high-flow nasal oxygen prior to mechanical ventilation, and a ratio of PaO2 to inspired oxygen fraction of less than 50. The performance of the model was good (Brier score, 0.172), and calibration and discrimination were consistent. We found no significant differences between the internal and external validation steps with respect to either the calibration slopes (0.92 [95% CI, 0.91-0.93] vs 1.12 [95% CI, 0.6-1.17], respectively; P = .150) or discrimination (area under the curve, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.75-0.84] vs 0.85 [95% CI, 0.81-0.89]; P = .121).

These enzymes play diverse biological roles, including host defence against bacteria, parasites and viruses. Several of these endogenous sPLA(2)s may play a defensive role in viral infections, as they display in vitro antiviral activity by both direct and indirect mechanisms.

We sought to investigate the perspectives of Canadian acute care physicians toward triaging scarce critical care resources in the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We rapidly deployed a brief survey to Canadian emergency and critical care physicians in April 2020 to investigate current attitudes toward triaging scarce critical care resources and identify subsequent areas for improvement. Descriptive and between-group analyses along with thematic coding were used. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 261 acute care physicians. Feelings of anxiety related to the pandemic were common (65 percent), as well as fears of psychological distress if required to triage scarce resources (77 percent). Only 49 percent of respondents felt confident in making resource allocation decisions. Both critical care and emergency physicians favored multidisciplinary teams over single physicians to allocate scarce critical care resources. Critical care physicians were supportive of decision making by teams not involved in patient care (3.4/5 versus 2.9/5 p = 0.04), whereas emergency physicians preferred to maintain their involvement in such decisions (3.4/5 versus 4.0/5 p = 0.007). Free text responses identified five themes for subsequent action including the need for further guidance on existing triage policies, ethical support in decision making, medicolegal protection, additional tools for therapeutic communications, and healthcare provider psychological support.

A study was then initiated to evaluate the presence of viral agents in the intestine of rabbits showing clinical signs of enteritis. Viral particles with morphological characteristics of the Coronaviridae family were observed by electron microscopy in most specimens of fecal material obtained from sick rabbits. Such particles were not seen in the feces of healthy animals. These particles, which have a density of 1.07-1.18g/cm3 on sucrose gradient, hemagglutinate rabbit red blood cells. Furthermore this virus has some antigenic relationship with the human coronavirus 229-E since immune serum to this virus blocks the hemagglutination of the rabbit erythrocytes. Antibody titers to this virus were detected in rabbit sera obtained from colonies with a high incidence of intestinal infections. When fecal material containing coronavirus particles were inoculated on various tissue culture systems, no cytopathic effects were observed.","output":"Preliminary report on the observation of a coronavirus in the intestine of the laboratory rabbit."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective To explore and analyze the clinical characteristics and prognosis of 248 patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) in Chongqing, so as to provide reference for clinical diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. Methods The clinical data of 248 patients with COV ID-19 admitted to the hospital from January 21 to March 11, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed, including 195 patients in the non-severe group (mild type/normal type) and the severe group (severe type/critical type).

The aim of the study was to determine the frequency of negative RT-PCR results at first clinical presentation as well as negative serological results after a follow-up of at least 3 weeks. Methods Among all patients seen for suspected COVID-19 in Liechtenstein (n=1921), we included initially RT-PCR positive index patients (n=85) as well as initially RT-PCR negative (n=66) for follow-up with SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. Antibodies were detected with seven different commercially available immunoassays. Frequencies of negative RT-PCR and serology results in individuals with COVID-19 were determined and compared to those observed in a validation cohort of Swiss patients (n=211). Results Among COVID-19 patients in Liechtenstein, false-negative RT-PCR at initial presentation was seen in 18% (12/66), whereas negative serology in COVID-19 patients was 4% (3/85). The validation cohort showed similar frequencies: 2/66 (3%) for negative serology, and 16/155 (10%) for false negative RT-PCR. COVID-19 patients with negative follow-up serology tended to have a longer disease duration (p=0.05) and more clinical symptoms than other patients with COVID-19 (p<0.05). The antibody titer from quantitative immunoassays was positively associated with the number of disease symptoms and disease duration (p<0.001). Conclusions RT-PCR at initial presentation in patients with suspected COVID-19 can miss infected patients. Antibody titers of SARS-CoV-2 assays are linked to the number of disease symptoms and the duration of disease. One in 25 patients with RT-PCR-positive COVID-19 does not develop antibodies detectable with frequently employed and commercially available immunoassays.","output":"Frequency of serological non-responders and false-negative RT-PCR results in SARS-CoV-2 testing: a population-based study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public awareness and discussion about animal experiments and replacement methods has greatly increased in recent years. The term 'the Three Rs', which stands for the Replacement, Reduction and Refinement of animal experiments, is inseparably linked in this context. A common goal within the Three Rs scientific community is to develop predictive non-animal models and to better integrate all available data from in vitro, in silico and omics technologies into regulatory decision-making processes regarding, for example, the toxicity of chemicals, drugs or food ingredients. In addition, it is a general concern to implement (human) non-animal methods in basic research. Toward these efforts, there has been an ever-increasing number of Three Rs centres and platforms established over recent years - not only to develop novel methods, but also to disseminate knowledge and help to implement the Three Rs principles in policies and education. The adoption of Directive 2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes gave a strong impetus to the creation of Three Rs initiatives, in the form of centres and platforms. As the first of a series of papers, this article gives an overview of the European Three Rs centres and platforms, and their historical development. The subsequent articles, to be published over the course of ATLA's 50th Anniversary year, will summarise the current focus and tasks as well as the future and the plans of the Three Rs centres and platforms. The Three Rs centres and platforms are very important points of contact and play an immense role in their respective countries as 'on the ground' facilitators of Directive 2010/63/EU. They are also invaluable for the widespread dissemination of information and for promoting implementation of the Three Rs in general.","output":"The Rise of Three Rs Centres and Platforms in Europe."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper investigates the extent of the flight to advanced economies by foreign investors at the onset of the COVID pandemic. Amid an overall decline of international positions, countries featuring higher GDP per capita, and belonging to the groups of advanced, G7, or Euro-area countries, appear to have been significantly less severely hit by the pandemic than developing countries. In particular, on comparing the growth rates of foreign liabilities at the end of the first quarter of 2020, the wedge between advanced and emerging countries is about 3%, and it is at least twice as large for G7 countries. This wedge is especially significant in the first quarter, and it is paired with the evidence of momentum trading by foreign investors.

In vitro studies indicate that the antiviral effect of chloroquine diphosphate (CQ) requires a high concentration of the drug. Objective To evaluate the safety and efficacy of 2 CQ dosages in patients with severe COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants This parallel, double-masked, randomized, phase IIb clinical trial with 81 adult patients who were hospitalized with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was conducted from March 23 to April 5, 2020, at a tertiary care facility in Manaus, Brazilian Amazon. Interventions Patients were allocated to receive high-dosage CQ (ie, 600 mg CQ twice daily for 10 days) or low-dosage CQ (ie, 450 mg twice daily on day 1 and once daily for 4 days). Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcome was reduction in lethality by at least 50% in the high-dosage group compared with the low-dosage group. Data presented here refer primarily to safety and lethality outcomes during treatment on day 13. Secondary end points included participant clinical status, laboratory examinations, and electrocardiogram results. Outcomes will be presented to day 28. Viral respiratory secretion RNA detection was performed on days 0 and 4. Results Out of a predefined sample size of 440 patients, 81 were enrolled (41 [50.6%] to high-dosage group and 40 [49.4%] to low-dosage group). Enrolled patients had a mean (SD) age of 51.1 (13.9) years, and most (60 [75.3%]) were men. Older age (mean [SD] age, 54.7 [13.7] years vs 47.4 [13.3] years) and more heart disease (5 of 28 [17.9%] vs 0) were seen in the high-dose group. Viral RNA was detected in 31 of 40 (77.5%) and 31 of 41 (75.6%) patients in the low-dosage and high-dosage groups, respectively. Lethality until day 13 was 39.0% in the high-dosage group (16 of 41) and 15.0% in the low-dosage group (6 of 40). The high-dosage group presented more instance of QTc interval greater than 500 milliseconds (7 of 37 [18.9%]) compared with the low-dosage group (4 of 36 [11.1%]). Respiratory secretion at day 4 was negative in only 6 of 27 patients (22.2%). Conclusions and Relevance The preliminary findings of this study suggest that the higher CQ dosage should not be recommended for critically ill patients with COVID-19 because of its potential safety hazards, especially when taken concurrently with azithromycin and oseltamivir. These findings cannot be extrapolated to patients with nonsevere COVID-19.

To increase the likelihood of the findings, we avoided many variables modeling and proposed a robust process to forecast COVID-19 cumulative cases. It will help international institutions to take optimal decisions about the world economy and response to the pandemic. Consequently, we used the data titled Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19) from Our World in Data about cases from 22 January 2020 to 30 November 2020. We computed Error Trend Season (ETS), Exponential smoothing with multiplicative error-trend, and ARIMA on the training data sets. In addition, we calculated the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) per model. Among those models, we notice that ETS (with additive error-trend and no season) has the smallest MAPE statistics compared to the others.

METHODS: This study comprised 580 women aged between 18 and 65 years old, who completed self-report measures, during the mandatory confinement in Portugal due to COVID-19. The total sample was divided into four groups, according to their BMI.

However, significant differences between the four groups were found in the reported body and eating-related difficulties (shape concern, weight concern, and binge eating behaviours), with the pre-obesity and obesity groups presenting significant higher levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that, even though the changes introduced to the eating and exercise routine are independent of BMI, the pre-obesity and obesity group represent a major vulnerability group for the development of eating disorders.

Patients were reviewed either by video or telephone consultation. The purpose of this survey was to assess patient satisfaction with this service. METHODS: Consecutive patients who were seen by remote consultation between September 2020 and November 2020 were identified. Approval for the survey was gained from the hospital Patient Experience and Survey department. A telephone survey was conducted between 4 and 8 weeks after the initial patient appointment. Data were obtained for patient demographic information, appointment details and patient satisfaction with their appointment, including preference for subsequent appointments and open feedback. RESULTS: Eighty-four remote consultations were identified and 51 (60.7%) patients completed the survey: 48 (94.1%) reported satisfaction with their remote consultation; 36 (70.5%) reported satisfaction for a subsequent remote consultation; and 33 (64.7%) patients reported they preferred being seen remotely rather than face-to-face. Qualitative data on patients thoughts about the service could be categorised into 4 themes: satisfaction with the interaction and service, conveniency, lack of clinical examination and satisfaction with the service given the current pandemic circumstances. CONCLUSION: This survey has shown that patients were satisfied with their remote consultation and the majority thought it was an acceptable method of consultation. This also allowed patients to continue being seen during a period of COVID-19 lockdown and reduce patient footfall through the hospital.

RESULTS: The data of 1,003 participants were analyzed. Of these, 14.2% worked in wards for confirmed COVID-19 cases and 15.2% had had direct contact with these patients. Treating patients with COVID-19 was associated with depression and anxiety, while dealing with COVID-19 test samples was associated with depression. Exposure to random or unspecified patients was also associated with depression. Lastly, social rejection and other negative experiences were associated with depression and anxiety. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 outbreak is correlated with healthcare workers' emotional stress, and specific types of jobs and duties involving close contact with these patients can be risk factors. Interestingly, even low-exposure groups reported significant depression and anxiety as a result of social stigma and uncertainty. Adequate and timely management measures for emotional stress are required for vulnerable and at-risk groups.","output":"COVID-19 Outbreak and Its Association with Healthcare Workers' Emotional Stress: a Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prediction of the COVID-19 incidence rate is a matter of global importance, particularly in the United States. As of 4 June 2020, more than 1.8 million confirmed cases and over 108 thousand deaths have been reported in this country. Few studies have examined nationwide modeling of COVID-19 incidence in the United States particularly using machine-learning algorithms. Thus, we collected and prepared a database of 57 candidate explanatory variables to examine the performance of multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network in predicting the cumulative COVID-19 incidence rates across the continental United States. Our results indicated that a single-hidden-layer MLP could explain almost 65% of the correlation with ground truth for the holdout samples. Sensitivity analysis conducted on this model showed that the age-adjusted mortality rates of ischemic heart disease, pancreatic cancer, and leukemia, together with two socioeconomic and environmental factors (median household income and total precipitation), are among the most substantial factors for predicting COVID-19 incidence rates. Moreover, results of the logistic regression model indicated that these variables could explain the presence/absence of the hotspots of disease incidence that were identified by Getis-Ord Gi* (p < 0.05) in a geographic information system environment. The findings may provide useful insights for public health decision makers regarding the influence of potential risk factors associated with the COVID-19 incidence at the county level.","output":"Artificial Neural Network Modeling of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Incidence Rates across the Continental United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Computing has become essential in modern-day problem-solving, making computational literacy necessary for practicing scientists and engineers. However, KC12 science education has not reflected this computational shift. Integrating computational thinking (CT) into core science courses is an avenue that can build computational literacies in all students. Integrating CT and science involves using computational tools and methods (including programming) to understand scientific phenomena and solve science-based problems. Integrating CT and science is gaining traction, but widespread implementation is still quite limited. Several barriers have limited the integration and implementation of CT in KC12 science education. Most teachers lack experience with computer science, computing, programming, and CT and therefore are ill-prepared to integrate CT into science courses, leading to low self-efficacy and low confidence in integrating CT. This theoretical paper introduces a novel instructional approach for integrating disciplinary science education with CT using unplugged (computer-free) activities. We have grounded our approach in common computational thinking in STEM frameworks but translate this work into an accessible pedagogical strategy. We begin with an overview and critique of current approaches that integrate CT and science. Next, we introduce the Computational Thinking through Algorithmic Explanations (CT-AE) instructional approach. We then explain how CT-AE is informed by constructionist writing-to-learn science theory.

This study will explore the target and molecular mechanism of Palovarotene's action on HO by network pharmacology study. We collected the relevant targets of Palovarotene and HO from the database, obtained the potential targets of Palovarotene acting on HO through Venn analysis, and constructed the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Then, Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) enrichment Analysis and Module-based Network Analysis were performed for potential targets, and in addition, PPI Network Topology Analysis and Gene-Phenotype Correlation Analysis were performed. The results suggested that MAPK1, MDM2, and other targets as well as P53 signaling pathway and PI3KCAkt signaling pathway may be closely related to Palovarotene treatment of HO. We carried out verification experiments to confirm our finding, alkaline phosphatase and alizarin red staining in vitro and Micro-CT as well as hematoxylin-eosin staining in vivo were performed to verify treatment for HO of Palovarotene, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was also used to explore the transcription changes of MAPK1, MDM2, and osteogenic genes.

It can rarely cause interstitial lung disease with a wide range of presentations from asymptomatic pulmonary radiological findings to fatal pneumonitis. Here, we present a case of rapid, acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to crizotinib-induced pneumonitis. Case presentation: A 63-year-old man with a medical history of head and neck squamous cell cancer with metastasis to pulmonary parenchyma, pleura and mediastinal lymph nodes presented with dyspnea, fever and non-massive hemoptysis four days after initiation of crizotinib therapy. The patient was febrile, tachycardic, tachypneic and hypoxemic upon presentation. Laboratory investigations were unremarkable. Respiratory viral panel and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were negative. Further investigations including sputum, blood and urine culture were unrevealing. Chest radiographs rapidly progressed from baseline imaging to scattered patchy multifocal infiltrates. One day later, computerized tomography of the chest revealed rapidly progressing diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities. Despite empiric anti-microbial therapy, the patient's respiratory status deteriorated, and he was transferred to medical intensive care unit. He was pulsed with IV methylprednisolone 500mg twice a day for 3 days, followed by a slow taper for presumed pneumonitis secondary to crizotinib which led to a rapid improvement in his respiratory status. Discussion: ALK inhibitors are a relatively novel therapy for several malignancies and the side effects are not well known. In clinical trials, crizotinib was associated with interstitial lung disease in 2.4% of cases and presented at a median time of 20 days to 2 months after initiation. Management is challenging because there are no guidelines currently available for diagnosis and treatment of ALK inhibitor associated pneumonitis. Diagnosis generally requires a recent history of drug exposure, abnormal thoracic radiography, and clinical and/or radiologic improvement after discontinuation of the offending agent. Given their increasing use to treat various malignancies, it is imperative for clinicians to have a high index of suspicion for crizotinib-induced pneumonitis. A multidisciplinary approach will lead to rapid diagnosis and early treatment of this serious adverse events associated with this novel drug.","output":"Rapid onset of acute respiratory failure due to crizotinib-induced pneumonitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant, also known as the UK or alpha variant, carries the spike 69/70 deletion mutation and has been reported to be more contagious and possibly more virulent than other variants. This study examines follow-up cardiovascular outcomes for patients infected with deletion-carrying SARS-CoV-2 alpha variant. Methods: From October 2020 to May 2021, all positive SARS-CoV-2 samples at Intermountain Healthcare were tested for the 69/70 deletion (n=92822). Patient characteristics, COVID-19 treatments, and follow-up outcomes were extracted from Intermountain records. Cox hazard regression analysis with multivariable adjustment was used to determine risk of subsequent major cardiovascular adverse event outcomes (MACE), which included all-cause death, heart failure (HF), and hospitalization for coronary artery disease (CAD) or atrial fibrillation (AF). Results: Overall, 4.2% of patients testing positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus carried the deletion mutation with prevalence increasing with time, ranging from 1.3% in October to 61.0% in May. Baseline characteristics, treatments, and outcomes stratified by non-mutant and deletion mutation status are shown in the Table. While the mutation did result in higher rates of COVID hospitalization (adjusted OR=1.68, p<0.001), there was no difference in overall MACE after adjustment by baselinecharacteristics and risk factors. There was a non-significant trend toward an increased rate of allcause death in patients carrying the mutant variant (adjusted HR=1.90, p=0.12). Conclusions: The SARS-CoV-2 deletion mutant, while resulting in an increased risk of COVID hospitalization and a trend toward increased death, did not increase the risk of subsequent CVD. Because of the recent emergence of the variant the long-term effects are not known. Thus, it remains important to minimize risk of exposure. Moreover, long-term surveillance of subsequent CVD risk is warranted.","output":"Sars-cov-2 b.1.1.7 variants do not increase risk of subsequent cardiovascular disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objetivo Determinar las probabilidades de transicin entre distintos tipos de atencin y estados para la poblacin infectada con la COVID-19 en Colombia, por grupos de edad","output":"Transiciones entre los estados de diagnstico de personas con la COVID-19 en Colombia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The only licensed vaccine against tuberculosis is BCG.

The review indicates that (a) tested interactive IN-OT effects were highly heterogeneous; (b) for most published interactions, no replication was attempted; (c) when attempted, replications were largely unsuccessful; (d) significance was unrelated to sample size; (e) statistical power was critically low and unrelated to the rate of significant results; and (f) research practices were characteristic of an exploratory approach. This concerning state of affairs makes it virtually impossible to tease apart true from false interactive IN-OT effects. We provide constructive directions on the basis of this observation and positive predictive value simulations for future research that should help extract true effects from noise and move the IN-OT field forward.","output":"How Can Intranasal Oxytocin Research Be Trusted?

It also stimulated extraordinary scientific achievement by bringing vaccines to the public in less than a year. In this article, we discuss the implications of current vaccination guidance for pregnant and lactating women, if their exclusion from the first wave of vaccine trials was justified, and if a change in the current vaccine development pathway is necessary. Pregnant and lactating women were not included in the initial severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine trials. Therefore, perhaps unsurprisingly, the first vaccine regulatory approvals have been accompanied by inconsistent advice from public health, governmental, and professional authorities around the world. Denying vaccination to women who, although pregnant or breastfeeding, are fully capable of autonomous decision making is a throwback to a paternalistic era. Conversely, lack of evidence generated in a timely manner, upon which to make an informed decision, shifts responsibility from research sponsors and regulators and places the burden of decision making upon the woman and her healthcare advisor. The World Health Organization, the Task Force on Research Specific to Pregnant Women and Lactating Women, and others have highlighted the long-standing disadvantage experienced by women in relation to the development of vaccines and medicines. It is uncertain whether there was sufficient justification for excluding pregnant and lactating women from the initial severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine trials. In future, we recommend that regulators mandate plans that describe the development pathway for new vaccines and medicines that address the needs of women who are pregnant or lactating. These should incorporate, at the outset, a careful consideration of the balance of the risks of exclusion from or inclusion in initial studies, patient and public perspectives, details of \\"developmental and reproductive toxicity\\" studies, and approaches to collect data systematically from participants who are unknowingly pregnant at the time of exposure. This requires careful consideration of any previous knowledge about the mode of action of the vaccine and the likelihood of toxicity or teratogenicity. We also support the view that the default position should be a \\"presumption of inclusion,\\" with exclusion of women who are pregnant or lactating only if justified on specific, not generic, grounds.

The results showed that DG possesses potent inhibitory effects on PPV when the virus was treated before incubation with ST cells and that virus infectivity decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Results were confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence assays and real-time quantitative PCR. In addition, deoxycholate was used as a control to exclude the possibility that DG acted as a detergent to inhibit PPV infectivity.

ATR-FTIR spectroscopy was used for chemical characterization of visually identified MPs by using standard protocols such as digestion using H(2)O(2), density separation using ZnCl(2), vacuum filtration with borosilicate glass micro filter papers and digital microscopy using a stereomicroscope connected with a camera. Range of mass abundance of identified MPs in river sediments, river water, tributaries sediment and tributary water was found to be 0.6C2.5 mg kg(?1), 0.7C3.8 mg L(?1), 0.9C4.5 mg kg(?1) and 0.6C1.1 mg L(?1) respectively. Meanwhile, in Schizothorax plagiostomus digestive tracts samples, it was 0.6C1.9 mg per fish. Numeric abundance of MPs in all matrices was found to be tributary sediment (202 items per kg) > river water (192 items per L) > river sediment (182 items per kg) > fish (153 items per fish) > tributary water (92 items per L).

This study describes the epidemiology and the outcome of major trauma patients admitted to centers in France during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: This retrospective observational study included all consecutive trauma patients aged 15 years and older admitted into 15 centers contributing to the TraumaBase? registry during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in France. This COVID-19 trauma cohort was compared to historical cohorts (2017-2019). RESULTS: Over a 4 years-study period, 5762 patients were admitted between the first week of February and mid-June. This cohort was split between patients admitted during the first 2020 pandemic wave in France (pandemic period, 1314 patients) and those admitted during the corresponding period in the three previous years (2017-2019, 4448 patients). Trauma patient demographics changed substantially during the pandemic especially during the lockdown period, with an observed reduction in both the absolute numbers and proportion exposed to road traffic accidents and subsequently admitted to traumacenters (348 annually 2017-2019 [55.4% of trauma admissions] vs 143 [36.8%] in 2020 p < 0.005).

Pooled analysis showed decline in rates of all strokes (26.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 22.4 to 29.7) and its subtypes; ischemic (25.3%; 95% CI, 21.0 to 30.0), hemorrhagic (27.6%; 95% CI, 20.4 to 35.5), transient ischemic attacks (41.9%; 95% CI, 34.8 to 49.3), and stroke mimics (45.6%; 95% CI, 33.5 to 58.0) during months of pandemic compared with the pre-pandemic period. The decline was most evident for mild symptoms (40% mild vs. 25%C29% moderate/severe). Although rates of intravenous thrombolytic (IVT) and endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) decreased during pandemic, the likelihood of being treated with IVT and EVT did not differ between the two periods, both in primary and in comprehensive stroke centers (odds ratio [OR], 1.08; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.24 and OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.09, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Rates of all strokes types decreased significantly during pandemic. It is of paramount importance that general population should be educated to seek medical care immediately for stroke-like symptoms during COVID-19 pandemic. Whether delay in initiation of secondary prevention would affect eventual stroke outcomes in the long run needs further study.","output":"Trends in Stroke Presentations before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The challenges of leading through the Covid-19 crisis have included not just remote staff members and customers but business coming to a standstill Returning to the workplace has been fraught with restrictions, limitations and safety concerns Leadership in the healthcare sector has been especially difficult, with pressures on already-limited resources, high infection-rates and death-rates, and increased need for total hygiene One of our co-authors, experienced in the past as a leader of a large hospital and now advising international healthcare authorities, was facing another war zone He had to listen to anyone with ideas of how to deal with the crisis;had considered unusual and new paths of action;had to act swiftly and with the conviction that any action was better than no action, with nearly everything based on improvisation, whilst surrounded by terrified patients and families and a lack of clarity from governments and the media","output":"Reflections of a Healthcare Leader in an Emerging Market in Europe: Leadership Lessons from the Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pyridoacridines are a class of strictly marine\\\\derived alkaloids that constitute one of the largest chemical families of marine alkaloids.

There are currently no vaccines or therapeutics available for COVID-19, which is causing an urgent search for a new drug to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The lipid membrane alternation efficiency of small antimicrobial lipopeptides enables them to block viral membrane fusion to the host cell. Lipopeptides could serve as potential antiviral agents, by interacting or competing with viral fusion proteins. METHODS: This study screened seven different lipopeptides (tsushimycin, daptomycin, surfactin, bacillomycin, iturin, srfTE, and LPD-12) and docked them individually against the spike (S)-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Based on the maximum docked score and minimum atomic contact energy, LPD-12 (-1137.38 kcal) was the appropriate molecule for proper binding with the S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 and thus significantly interrupted its affinity of binding with angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), which is the only receptor molecule found to be facilitating disease development. The results confirmed a strong binding affinity of LPD-12 with ACE2, with a binding free energy of -1621.62 kcal, which could also reciprocally prevent the binding of S-protein. CONCLUSTION: It can be concluded that LPD-12 may act as a potential therapeutic drug, by reducing the entry of SARS-CoV-2 to the human cells via the ACE2 receptor and related infections.","output":"LPD-12: a promising lipopeptide to control COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused numerous unexpected challenges for many families, and these long-lasting demands likely contribute to higher stress for parents. The aim of this study was to describe changes in parent stress longitudinally from before (retrospective) to two timepoints during COVID-19. Stressors that influenced parenting and strategies to manage parenting difficulties at each timepoint during COVID-19 are also described. Methods: Parents (N = 433;95% female) in the US with &gt;1 child aged 5-18 years completed an online survey in May 2020 (T1;at the peak of stay-at-home mandates) and in September 2020 (T2;children's return to school). Surveys included the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and questions on parenting-specific stress, stressors that influenced parenting, and strategies to manage parenting difficulties during COVID-19. Retrospective report of pre-COVID-19 stress was assessed at T1;current stress was assessed at T1 and T2. Repeated measures analysis of variance examined changes in stress over time. Results: Parent's stress increased from before COVID-19 to T1 (PSS score: 16.3  5.7 to 22.0  6.4, respectively;p &lt; 0.01), and decreased by T2 (19.2  6.0), but remained elevated above pre-COVID-19 values (p &lt; 0.01). Most parents (71.1%) reported an increase parenting-specific stress from before COVID-19 to T1, which continued to increase for 55% of parents at T2. Common stressors that impacted parenting during COVID-19 were changes in children's routines, worry about COVID-19, and online schooling demands. Common strategies parents used to manage parenting difficulties included doing family activities together, keeping in touch with family/friends virtually, and keeping children on daily routines. Conclusions: Parent stress increased substantially during COVID-19 and has not returned to pre-COVID-19 levels, suggesting the need for enhanced mental health resources and supports.

Motivated by the use of CT imaging at clinical institutes around the world as an effective complementary screening method to RT-PCR testing, we introduced COVID-Net CT, a neural network tailored for detection of COVID-19 cases from chest CT images as part of the open source COVID-Net initiative. However, one potential limiting factor is restricted quantity and diversity given the single nation patient cohort used. In this study, we introduce COVID-Net CT-2, enhanced deep neural networks for COVID-19 detection from chest CT images trained on the largest quantity and diversity of multinational patient cases in research literature. We introduce two new CT benchmark datasets, the largest comprising a multinational cohort of 4,501 patients from at least 15 countries. We leverage explainability to investigate the decision-making behaviour of COVID-Net CT-2, with the results for select cases reviewed and reported on by two board-certified radiologists with over 10 and 30 years of experience, respectively. The COVID-Net CT-2 neural networks achieved accuracy, COVID-19 sensitivity, PPV, specificity, and NPV of 98.1%/96.2%/96.7%/99%/98.8% and 97.9%/95.7%/96.4%/98.9%/98.7%, respectively. Explainability-driven performance validation shows that COVID-Net CT-2's decision-making behaviour is consistent with radiologist interpretation by leveraging correct, clinically relevant critical factors. The results are promising and suggest the strong potential of deep neural networks as an effective tool for computer-aided COVID-19 assessment.

We compared the amendment rates during those periods and types of amendments issued (identification [ID], report defect [RD], diagnostic information [DI]). METHODS: All pathology reports between March to June 2019 and March to June 2020 were extracted from the pathology information system.

A promising therapeutic alternative has been the use of small compounds that bind at the protein-protein interface or at distal \\"hotspots\\" and induce conformational changes that inhibit or stabilize protein-protein interactions (PPIs). In this work, we conduct large-scale all-atom explicit solvent simulations of the top scoring compounds from a recent large-scale high-throughput docking screening to investigate their interaction with the RBD domain of the spike (S) protein in complex with ACE2. We identify several promising candidates that exhibit a large negative free energy of binding to the RBD/ACE2 complex based on ab initio thermodynamic integration calculations. A systematic structural analysis of two glycosylation profiles of the RBD/ACE2 complex reveals the important role glycans play in modulating the binding of small-molecules. Cross correlation, fluctuation and strain analysis identify several of these compounds as effective PPI modulators that inhibit or stabilize the protein-protein interactions of RBD/ACE2 based on the glycosylation profile.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with mild and moderate COVID-19 in a quarantine station in Wuchang District, Wuhan. Using the real-time Internet information collection application and Centers for Disease Control for the Wuchang District, patient data were collected through patient self-reports and follow-ups. HSYF intervention was defined as the exposure. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who progressed to a severe disease status, and a stratification analysis was performed. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify influencing factors that may affect the outcome. Further, we used propensity score matching (PSM) to assess the effect of HSYF intervention on the conversion of mild and moderate to a severe disease status. Totally, 721 mild and moderate COVID-19 patients were enrolled, including 430 HSYF users (exposed group) and 291 non-users (control group). No cases in the exposed group and 19 (6.5 %, P < 0.001) cases in the control group progressed to severe disease, and the difference between the two groups (exposed group-control group) was -6.5 % [95 % confidence interval (CI): (-8.87 %, -4.13 %)]. Univariate regression analysis revealed sex (male), age, fever, cough, and fatigue as risk factors for progression to severe disease. After PSM, none of the HSYF users and 7 (4.7 %, P = 0.022) non-users transitioned to severe disease, and the difference between the two groups (exposed group-control group) was -4.7 % [95 % CI: (-8.2 %, -1.2 %)].

Demographics, clinical data and CT images of these patients were reviewed by 2 senior radiologists. RESULTS In total there were 25 patients (all males; mean age [SD], 21.642.40 years; range, 18-27 years). Patients with abnormal chest CT showed a relatively low normal absolute lymphocytes count (median: 2.2 x 109/L) and absolute monocyte count (median: 0.5 x 109/L). Lactate dehydrogenase was elevated in 5 (20%) of the patients. The procalcitonin level was normal while elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, platelet and C-reactive protein were common. Baseline chest CT showed abnormalities in 6 patients. The distribution of the lesions were; upper lobe 3 (12%) lower lobe 3 (12%) with peripheral distribution 4 (16%). Of the 25 patients included, 4 (16%) had ground glass opacification (GGO), 1 (4%) had a small peripheral subpleural nodule, and 1 (4%) had a dense solitary granuloma. Four patients had typical CT features of COVID-19. CONCLUSION We found that the CT imaging showed peripheral GGO in our patients.

The IgMSP and IgGSP assays were highly specific (100%) with no cross-reactivity to archived samples collected prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, including those from individuals with seasonal coronavirus infections. Clinical sensitivity was 96% after 15 days for both IgMSP and IgGSP assays individually. When considered together, the sensitivity was 100%. A combination of NC- and SP-specific serologic assays clearly differentiated na?ve, SARS-CoV-2-infected, and vaccine-related immune responses. Vaccination resulted in a significant increase in IgGSP and IgMSP values, with a major rise in IgGSP following the booster (second) dose in the na?ve group. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals had several fold higher IgGSP responses than na?ve following the primary dose, with a comparatively dampened response following the booster. This work illustrates the strong clinical performance of these new serological assays and their utility in evaluating and distinguishing serological responses to infection and vaccination.","output":"Clinical evaluation of the Abbott Alinity SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific quantitative IgG and IgM assays among infected, recovered, and vaccinated groups"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) across the world has led to millions of infection cases and caused a global public health crisis.

DESIGN: An observational study of 30 countries from different geographies and climates. For each country, a Fourier spectral analysis was performed with the series of the daily SARS-CoV-2 infections, looking for peaks in the frequency spectrum that could correspond to a recurrent cycle of a given length. SETTINGS: Public data of the daily SARS-CoV-2 infections from 30 different countries and five continents. PARTICIPANTS: Only publicly available data were utilised for this study, patients and/or the public were not involved in any phase of this study. RESULTS: All the 30 investigated countries have seen the recurrence of at least one COVID-19 wave, repeating over a period in the range 3C9 months, with a peak of magnitude at least half as large as that of the highest peak ever experienced since the beginning of the pandemic until December 2021. The distance in days between the two highest peaks in each country was computed and then averaged over the 30 countries, yielding a mean of 190 days (SD 100). This suggests that recurrent outbreaks may repeat with cycles of different lengths, without a precisely predictable seasonality of 1 year. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that COVID-19 outbreaks are likely to occur worldwide, with cycles of repetition of variable lengths.

We used high performance liquid chromatography to analyze the extract of Liupao tea and establish its fingerprint. The main index components of the fingerprint were determined using SARS-COV-2 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro ), and an in vitro drug screening model based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer was used to evaluate its inhibitory activity in vitro. The fingerprint results showed that the alcohol extract of Liupao tea contained gallic acid, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), caffeine, epicatechin gallate, rutin, and ellagic acid. The molecular docking binding energies of the six index components of SARS-CoV-2 3Clpro were all less than -5.0 kJ/mol and showed strong binding affinity. The results of in vitro activity showed that the IC50 of EGCG was 8.84 mol/L, which could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3Clpro to a certain extent.

In the current situation, health professions students are at risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection during their internship at healthcare facilities. Furthermore, those future healthcare workers will advise people to accept the COVID-19 vaccination. Therefore, the attitude of students towards vaccine acceptance and the predicting factors needs to be elucidated. This study applied the Health Belief Model to determine predictors of COVID-19 vaccine acceptability among health professions students. METHODS: Nine hundred eleven students participated in a cross-sectional online survey in Vietnam. Data were collected from 1st April to 30th June 2021. Data analysis was performed using SPSS software version 20.0 with Chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests before executing multinomial logistic regression to identify predictors of the COVID-19 vaccine acceptability RESULTS: The overall vaccine acceptance, hesitancy, and refusal rates were 58% (95% CI: 54.7% - 61.3%), 40.4% (95% CI: 37.2% - 43.7%) and 1.5% (95% CI: 0.8% - 2.6%), respectively. Regarding vaccination hesitancy, a predictor such as \\"Receiving recent flu shots had a negative correlation, whereas \\"Vaccines have little efficacy & serious adverse effects (Perceived barriers), nationality, and majors were positive correlates. For refusal, \\"Unvaccinated students feasibly infected COVID-19 during hospital internship (Perceived susceptibility) was a negative correlate. For predicting both hesitancy and refusal, \\"Mass media appreciating effectiveness and safety of vaccines\\" (Cues to action), and \\" Health professions students get serious complications of COVID-19 if not vaccinated\\" (Perceived severity) were negative predictors. In contrast, \\"Manufacturers do not disclose adverse effects of vaccines\\" (Cues to action), and \\"Adverse effect causes death\\" (Perceived barrier) were recognized as positive predictors. Strong Health Belief Model predictors of vaccine refusal were \\"Manufacturers do not disclose adverse effects of vaccines\\" (Cues to action) with OR= 5.299(95% CI: 1.687-16.641, p= 0.004), and \\"Adverse effect causes death\\" (Perceived barrier) with OR= 10.255 (95% CI = 3.528-29.814, p= 0.0005). CONCLUSION: Health professions students' acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination might be based on the perceived susceptibility to and severity of COVID-19, concerns about vaccine efficacy and safety, and the influence levels of information from various sources.

We aimed to assess the impact of national vaccination strategies on vaccine-preventable infectious diseases (VPDs) in Shanghai, China and to identify vulnerable groups that may benefit from future vaccination policies. METHODS: Infectious disease data from 1953 to 2018 was obtained from Xuhui District Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shanghai China. We used joinpoint regression to show incidence, mortality and fatality trends and to determine annual percent change in incidence of 12 VPDs among three eras of national immunization strategies: (1)1953C1977, (2)1978C2007, and(3)2008C2018. FINDINGS: Incidence, mortality, and fatality from VPDs have decreased drastically over the three eras, despite the inclusion of more diseases over time. Strikingly, the overall yearly incidence of VPDs shows an increasing trend from 2000 to 2018 in Shanghai (annual percentage changes, APC:7.7, p = 0.025). In the third era (2008C2018), the three VPDs with the highest incidence were varicella (80.2 cases/100,000), hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) (73.6 cases/100,000), and hepatitis (43.5 cases/100,000). A significant upward trend was also observed in hepatitis (APC:24.9, p<0.001), varicella (APC:5.9, p = 0.006), and HFMD (APC:11.8, p = 0.003) from 2008C2018. Hepatitis and tuberculosis are the only VPDs with fatality cases in this period. INTERPRETATION: Focus is needed in controlling adult hepatitis and tuberculosis, either by introducing adult booster vaccines or by research into more effective vaccines. Varicella and HFMD are on the rise, but vaccines for these are not included in national programs. Strategies funded by government agencies or encouraged by research incentives are needed for varicella and HFMD, such as two-dose and novel multi-valent vaccines, respectively.

Inpatient data were collected with an automatic surveillance system. RESULTS: A total of 134,637 inpatients including 60,332 (44.8%) elderly 60 years were included. The overall incidence of HAI was 2.0%. The incidence of HAI in elderly patients was significantly higher than that in non-elderly patients (2.6% vs. 1.5%, (2) = 202.421, P < 0.01) and increased with age. The top five sites of HAIs in the elderly were the lower respiratory tract, urinary tract, blood stream, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and surgical site. The five most common pathogens detected in elderly HAI patients were Candida albicans, Klebsiella pneumonia, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia in the elderly was lower than in the non-elderly, catheter-associated urinary tract infections were more common in elderly patients, and the rate of central line-associated bloodstream infection was similar between groups. The numbers of male patients and patients with comorbidities and special medical procedures (e.g., intensive care unit admission, cerebrovascular disease, brain neoplasms, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignant tumor, malignant hematonosis, and osteoarthropathy) were significantly higher in the elderly group, but the number of patients who underwent surgery was lower.

Neutrophils are critical players in COVID-19 pathogenesis. IL-17A plays a major role in protection against extracellular pathogens and neutrophil attraction and activation. We hypothesized that secukinumab, an anti-IL17A monoclonal antibody, could mitigate the deleterious hyperinflammation in COVID-19. Methods: BISHOP was an open-label, single-center, phase-II controlled trial. Fifty adults hospitalized Covid-19 patients, confirmed by a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, were randomized 1:1 to receive 300mg of secukinumab subcutaneously at day-0 (group A) plus standard of care (SoC: antiviral drugs, antimicrobials, corticosteroids, and/or anticoagulants) or SoC alone (group B). A second dose of 300mg of secukinumab could be administered on day-7, according to staff judgment. The primary endpoint was ventilator-free days at day-28 (VFD-28). Secondary efficacy and safety outcomes were also explored. Findings: An intention-to-treat analysis showed no difference in VFD-28: 23.7 (95%CI 19.6-27.8) in group A vs. 23.8 (19.9-27.6) in group B, p=0.62; There was also no difference in hospitalization time, intensive care unit demand, the incidence of circulatory shock, acute kidney injury, fungal or bacterial co-infections, and severe adverse events. Pulmonary thromboembolism was less frequent in group A (4.2% vs. 26.2% p=0.04). There was one death in each group. Viral clearance, defined by the viral load fold change (2-{Delta}{Delta}CT) in upper airways, between day-0 and day-7, was also similar: 0.17 (0.05-0.56) in group A vs. 0.24 (0.10-0.57) in group B.

Here we show that N-palmitoyl-N-monomethyl-N,N-dimethyl-N,N,N-trimethyl-6-O-glycolchitosan (GCPQ), a positively charged polymer that has been through an extensive Good Laboratory Practice toxicology screen, is able to reduce the infectivity of SARS-COV-2 in A549(ACE2+) and Vero E6 cells with a log removal value of ? 3 to ? 4 at a concentration of 10C100 g/ mL (p < 0.05 compared to untreated controls) and to limit infectivity in human airway epithelial cells at a concentration of 500 g/ mL (p < 0.05 compared to untreated controls). In vivo studies using transgenic mice expressing the ACE-2 receptor, dosed nasally with SARS-COV-2 (426,000 TCID(50)/mL) showed a trend for nasal GCPQ (20 mg/kg) to inhibit viral load in the respiratory tract and brain, although the study was not powered to detect statistical significance. GCPQs electrostatic binding to the virus, preventing viral entry into the host cells, is the most likely mechanism of viral inhibition. Radiolabelled GCPQ studies in mice show that at a dose of 10 mg/kg, GCPQ has a long residence time in mouse nares, with 13.1% of the injected dose identified from SPECT/CT in the nares, 24 h after nasal dosing.

Furthermore, we have identified proteasome activator PA28?3 as a nCoV N binding protein by co-immunoprecipitation assay. As a result of their interaction, nCoV N could be degraded by PA28?3-20S in vitro degradation assay. This was also demonstrated by blocking de novo protein synthesis with cycloheximide. The stability of nCoV N in PA28?3-knockout cells was greater than in PA28?3-wildtype cells. Notably, immunofluorescence staining revealed that knockout of the PA28?3 gene in cells led to the transport of nCoV N from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Overexpression of PA28?3 enhanced proteolysis of nCoV N compared to that in PA28?3-N151Y cells containing a dominant-negative PA28?3 mutation, which reduced this process.

With the above thesis in mind, questionnaire-based surveys were conducted amongst residents of five European countries: Poland, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Great Britain (England and Scotland). A specially devised, structured questionnaire was used to conduct anonymous internet surveys between 28 April and 16 July 2020. It contained questions pertaining to sociodemographic data, eating behaviours, the impact of the pandemic on the diet and physical activity. The questionnaire was made available to internet users in Poland, Italy, Spain, Great Britain (England and Scotland), and Portugal. The questionnaire was translated by native speakers into five languages: Polish, English, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese. Survey results were then analysed using StatSofts Statistica v. 13 software and Cytels StatXact v. 9.0.0. Age was the parameter that impacted changing eating behaviours to the largest extent during the pandemic. It was also found that during the pandemic, regular consumption of meals was most dependent on various factors. The negative impact of the pandemic within this scope was most profound amongst women, city residents regardless of gender and people over 35 years of age. A change in the frequency of consumption of selected product groups during the pandemic was also observed. Reduced consumption of meat and fish was identified. Especially among people under 35 living in Portugal, almost half45.5% (p = 0.0210) declared lower consumption of meat, and more than half54.5% (p = 0.011) reported lower consumption of fish. An analysis of the obtained results also showed an increase in the consumption of products with lower nutritional values, particularly amongst people under 35 years of age and also amongst residents of Great Britain (regardless of age). Moreover, the results showed that the pandemic may have had an impact on the weight reduction diet. A negative impact was declared by 16.5% of people, compared to 9.7% who said that the pandemic facilitated the use of the weight reduction diet (p = 0.006). The results of our survey also showed a decrease in the level of physical activity among people over 35 living in Poland (69.6%, p = 0.0497) and people living in Portuguese cities (72.73%, p = 0.0245). Our survey results showed that the impact of the pandemic on eating behaviours was particularly profound when it came to meal consumption regularity. Changes to the consumption of products with lower nutritional values, which may decrease immunity, have also been found during the pandemic. Our results showed that the problem associated with consuming products with lower nutritional values was particularly evident amongst people under 35.

In parasitic infections, atopic diseases such as atopic dermatitis and asthma, the numbers of the circulating eosinophils are frequently elevated. In conditions such as Hypereosinophilic Syndrome (HES) circulating eosinophil levels are even further raised. Although, eosinophils were identified more than hundred years ago, their roles in homeostasis and in disease still remain unclear. The most prominent feature of the eosinophils are their large secondary granules, each containing four basic proteins, the best known being the eosinophil cationic protein (ECP). This protein has been developed as a marker for eosinophilic disease and quantified in biological fluids including serum, bronchoalveolar lavage and nasal secretions. Elevated ECP levels are found in T helper lymphocyte type 2 (atopic) diseases such as allergic asthma and allergic rhinitis but also occasionally in other diseases such as bacterial sinusitis. ECP is a ribonuclease which has been attributed with cytotoxic, neurotoxic, fibrosis promoting and immune-regulatory functions. ECP regulates mucosal and immune cells and may directly act against helminth, bacterial and viral infections. The levels of ECP measured in disease in combination with the catalogue of known functions of the protein and its polymorphisms presented here will build a foundation for further speculations of the role of ECP, and ultimately the role of the eosinophil.","output":"Analysing the eosinophil cationic protein - a clue to the function of the eosinophil granulocyte"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Regarding the outbreak of the SARS Cov-2 virus pandemic worldwide, it seems necessary to provide new diagnostic methods to combat the virus.

The sequence of the complementary DNA (target DNA) is planned based on a substantial part of the SARS Cov-2 virus genome, and oligonucleotides of QDs-DNA nanoprobe are designed to complement it. The water-soluble CdTe QDs-DNA was prepared by replacing the thioglycolic acid (TGA) on the surface of QDs with capture DNA (thiolated DNA) through a ligand-exchange method. Subsequently, with the addition of complementary (target DNA) and quencher DNA (BHQ2-labeled DNA) into the QDs-DNA conjugates, sandwiched hybrids were formed. The resulting assembly brings the BHQ2-labeled DNA (as the acceptor), and the QDs (as the donor) into proximity, leading to quenching of fluorescence emission from the donor QDs through the FRET mechanism.

This study examines PCPs' concerns, impact on personal lives and work, and level of pandemic preparedness in the context of COVID-19 in Singapore. We also examine factors and coping strategies that PCPs have used to manage stress during the outbreak. METHODS: Two hundred and sixteen PCPs actively practicing in either a public or private clinic were cluster sampled via email invitation from three primary care organizations in Singapore from 6th to 29th March 2020. Participants completed a cross-sectional online questionnaire consisting of items on work- and non-work-related concerns, impact on personal and work life, perceived pandemic preparedness, stress-reduction factors, and personal coping strategies related to COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 158 questionnaires were usable for analyses. PCPs perceived themselves to be at high risk of COVID-19 infection (89.9%), and a source of risk (74.7%) and concern (71.5%) to loved ones. PCPs reported acceptance of these risks (91.1%) and the need to care for COVID-19 patients (85.4%). Overall perceived pandemic preparedness was extremely high (75.9 to 89.9%). PCPs prioritized availability of personal protective equipment, strict infection prevention guidelines, accessible information about COVID-19, and well-being of their colleagues and family as the most effective stress management factors.

BACKGROUND To prevent falls during patients' hospitalization, it is essential for them to accurately perceive their risk of falling. DESIGN This methodological study was performed to develop a fall risk perception questionnaire. METHODS After generating a preliminary questionnaire, two rounds of content validity testing were performed with nine experts. Following a pilot test, a convenience sample of 236 participants was recruited from an acute care hospital between May 2, 2018, and December 15, 2019. Construct, convergent, and known-group validity of the questionnaire were evaluated, and reliability was estimated by calculating the internal consistency reliability coefficients. The study adhered to STROBE guidelines. RESULTS Exploratory factor analysis yielded a three-factor solution with 27 items. The questionnaire showed statistically significant positive correlation with the Korean Falls Efficacy Scale-International and the Morse Fall Scale, thus establishing convergent validity. For known-group comparison, Morse Fall Scale scores were categorized into two groups by cut-off score. The risk for falls group had a significantly higher perceived fall risk than the no risk for falls group, thus establishing known-group validity. Cronbach's alpha values indicated good to excellent reliability for the overall questionnaire with 27 items and for each of the three subfactors. CONCLUSIONS The fall risk perception questionnaire demonstrated satisfactory reliability and validity in an acute care hospital setting.

Mathematical modeling and field observations have shown that, under seasonal variation, the incidence rates of some endemic infectious diseases fluctuate dramatically and the dynamics is often characterized by chaotic oscillations in the absence of specific vaccination programs. In fact, the existence of chaotic behavior has been precisely stated in the literature as a noticeable feature in the dynamics of the classical Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) seasonally forced epidemic model. However, in the context of epidemiology, chaos is often regarded as an undesirable phenomenon associated with the unpredictability of infectious diseases. As a consequence, the problem of converting chaotic motions into regular motions becomes particularly relevant. In this article, we consider the phase control technique applied to the seasonally forced SIR epidemic model to suppress chaos. Interestingly, this method of controlling chaos takes on a clear meaning as a weak perturbation on a seasonal vaccination strategy. Numerical simulations show that the phase difference between the two periodic forces - contact rate and vaccination - plays a very important role in controlling chaos.","output":"Controlling infectious diseases: the decisive phase effect on a seasonal vaccination strategy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a result of the coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, clinical research for substance use disorders (SUDs) has been impeded due to widespread stay-at-home mandates limiting the operations of non-essential work.

Macrophage tolerance is regulated by induction of negative regulators of TLR signaling, but its metabolic basis was not known. Here, we review recent studies that indicate that macrophage metabolism changes dynamically over the course of microbial exposure to influence a shift in the inflammatory response. In particular, an initial increase in oxidative metabolism boosts the induction of inflammatory responses, but is followed by a shutdown of oxidative metabolism that contributes to suppression of inflammatory responses.

A MenB vaccine directed against the polysaccharide capsule remains elusive due to poor immunogenicity and safety concerns. The vaccines licensed for the prevention of MenB disease, 4CMenB (Bexsero) and MenB-fHbp (Trumenba), are serogroup B substitute vaccines, comprised of subcapsular proteins and are designed to provide protection against most MenB disease-causing strains. In many high-income countries, such as the UK, adolescents are at increased risk of IMD and have the highest rates of meningococcal carriage. Beginning in the late 1990s, immunisation of this age group with the meningococcal group C conjugate vaccine reduced asymptomatic carriage and disrupted transmission of this organism, resulting in lower group C IMD incidence across all age groups. Whether vaccinating teenagers with the novel MenB protein-based vaccines will prevent acquisition or reduce duration of carriage and generate herd protection was unknown at the time of vaccine introduction and could not be inferred from the effects of the conjugate vaccines. 4CMenB and MenB-fHbp may also impact on non-MenB disease-causing capsular groups as well as commensal Neisseria spp. This study will evaluate the impact of vaccination with 4CMenB or MenB-fHbp on oropharyngeal carriage of pathogenic meningococci in teenagers, and consequently the potential for these vaccines to provide broad community protection against MenB disease. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Be on the TEAM (Teenagers Against Meningitis) Study is a pragmatic, partially randomised controlled trial of 24 000 students aged 16C19 years in their penultimate year of secondary school across the UK with regional allocation to a 0+6 month schedule of 4CMenB or MenB-fHbp or to a control group. Culture-confirmed oropharyngeal carriage will be assessed at baseline and at 12 months, following which the control group will be eligible for 4CMenB vaccination. The primary outcome is the carriage prevalence of potentially pathogenic meningococci (defined as those with genogroups B, C, W, Y or X), in each vaccine group compared separately to the control group at 12 months post-enrolment, that is, 12 months after the first vaccine dose and 6 months after the second vaccine dose. Secondary outcomes include impact on carriage of: genogroup B meningococci; hyperinvasive meningococci; all meningococci; those meningococci expressing vaccine antigens and; other Neisseria spp. A sample size of 8000 in each arm will provide 80% power to detect a 30% reduction in meningococcal carriage, assuming genogroup B, C, W, Y or X meningococci carriage of 3.43%, a design effect of 1.5, a retention rate of 80% and a significance level of 0.05. Study results will be available in 2021 and will inform the UK and international immunisation policy and future vaccine development. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study is approved by the National Health Service South Central Research Ethics Committee (18/SC/0055); the UK Health Research Authority (IRAS ID 239091) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. Publications arising from this study will be submitted to peer-reviewed journals. Study results will be disseminated in public forums, online, presented at local and international conferences and made available to the participating schools.

In this study, we present results of a large nationwide SARS-CoV-2 wastewater monitoring system in the United States. We profile 55 locations with at least six months of sampling from April 2020 to May 2021. These locations represent more than 12 million individuals across 19 states. Samples were collected approximately weekly by wastewater treatment utilities as part of a regular wastewater surveillance service and analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations. SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations were normalized to pepper mild mottle virus, an indicator of fecal matter in wastewater. We show that wastewater data reflect temporal and geographic trends in clinical COVID-19 cases and investigate the impact of normalization on correlations with case data within and across locations. We also provide key lessons learned from our broad-scale implementation of wastewater-based epidemiology, which can be used to inform wastewater-based epidemiology approaches for future emerging diseases. This work demonstrates that wastewater surveillance is a feasible approach for nationwide population-level monitoring of COVID-19 disease. With an evolving epidemic and effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, wastewater-based epidemiology can serve as a passive surveillance approach for detecting changing dynamics or resurgences of the virus.","output":"Nationwide Trends in COVID-19 Cases and SARS-CoV-2 RNA Wastewater Concentrations in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A concerning amount of biomedical research is not reproducible. Unreliable results impede empirical progress in medical science, ultimately putting patients at risk. Many proximal causes of this irreproducibility have been identified, a major one being inappropriate statistical methods and analytical choices by investigators. Within this, we formally quantify the impact of inappropriate redaction beyond a threshold value in biomedical science. This is effectively truncation of a dataset by removing extreme data points, and we elucidate its potential to accidentally or deliberately engineer a spurious result in significance testing. We demonstrate that the removal of a surprisingly small number of data points can be used to dramatically alter a result. It is unknown how often redaction bias occurs in the broader literature, but given the risk of distortion to the literature involved, we suggest that it must be studiously avoided, and mitigated with approaches to counteract any potential malign effects to the research quality of medical science.","output":"The new normal?

The anatomy of the right posterior Glissonean pedicle and the caudal view of laparoscopy make such resections suitable for the Glissonean pedicle-first approach. METHODS The study population included all consecutive patients treated with laparoscopic liver resection from August 2019 to February 2020. The approach is based on the ultrasonographic identification of the right posterior or segmental pedicle from the dorsal side of the liver after complete mobilization. The pedicle of interest is isolated through mini-hepatotomy and clamped. The segment anatomy is defined by ischemia. The transection starts from the ventral side, close to the right hepatic vein that is exposed and followed craniocaudally. RESULTS Ten patients underwent anatomical laparoscopic resection of right posterolateral segments. There were 7 colorectal liver metastases, 2 hepatocellular carcinoma, and 1 biliary cysto-adenoma. Five patients underwent Sg7 resection, one patient underwent a Sg7 subsegmentectomy, and 4 underwent Sg6-7 bisegmentectomy. The Glissonean pedicle-first approach was feasible in eight patients. The craniocaudal approach to the RHV was feasible in six patients, not indicated in three cases and was abandoned in one patient for technical difficulty. There was no operative morbidity or mortality. Median post-operative hospital stay was 5 days. CONCLUSIONS The Glissonean pedicle-first approach is safe and effective for laparoscopic anatomic resections of the right posterior sector. The craniocaudal approach to right hepatic vein from the ventral side is a convenient procedure to follow the segmental anatomy deep in the parenchyma.","output":"Laparoscopic right posterior anatomic liver resections with Glissonean pedicle-first and venous craniocaudal approach."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Persons living with HIV (PLWH) may be at increased risk for severe COVID-19-related illness Our community-based participatory research partnership collected and analyzed semi-structured interview data to understand the early impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on a sample of racially/ethnically diverse gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men living with HIV Fifteen cisgender men participated;their mean age was 28 Six participants were Black/African American, five were Spanish-speaking Latinx, and four were White Seventeen themes emerged that were categorized into six domains: knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19;COVID-19 information sources and perceptions of trustworthiness;impact of COVID-19 on behaviors, health, and social determinants of health;and general COVID-19-related concerns Interventions are needed to ensure that PLWH have updated information and adhere to medication regimens, and to reduce the impact of COVID-19 on social isolation, economic stability, healthcare access, and other social determinants of health within this vulnerable population","output":"A rapid qualitative assessment of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on a racially/ethnically diverse sample of gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men living with HIV in the US South"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Health and social care professionals' ability to address the needs of patients and their relatives at end of life is likely to have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. AIM: To explore health and social care professionals' experiences of providing end of life care during the COVID-19 pandemic to help inform current/future clinical practice and policy. DESIGN: A qualitative interview study. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen health and social care professionals working across a range of clinical settings in supporting dying patients during the first wave (March-June 2020) of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. RESULTS: Participants reported emotional and practical challenges to providing end of life care during the pandemic, including increases in patient numbers, reduced staffing levels and relying on virtual platforms for sensitive, emotive conversations with relatives. Participants were central to promoting connections between patients and their families at end of life and creating opportunities for a final contact before the death. However, the provision of support varied as a consequence of the pressures of the pandemic. Results are discussed under two themes: (1) challenges and facilitators to providing end of life care, and (2) support needs of relatives when a family member was dying during the COVID-19 pandemic.

While patients with tuberculosis commonly have multiple conditions at diagnosis, such as HIV, diabetes, and depression, to the authors' knowledge, there is limited information on the patterns of multimorbidity, and how the types and combinations of conditions could impact the healthcare utilization, expenditure, and TB outcomes. Methods: An observational cohort study of adult patients diagnosed with tuberculosis was conducted using the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s National TB Information System (NTBIS) linked to the Ningbo Regional Health Care Database (NRHCD) (2015C2020). Latent class analysis was used to identify comorbidity groups among the subset with 2 conditions including TB. Group-level health care use, expenditure, and treatment outcomes were compared with patients without chronic conditions using multivariate regression models. Results: A total of 9,651 patients with TB were identified, of whom approximately 61.4% had no chronic conditions, 17.4% had 1 chronic condition, and 21.3% had 2 chronic conditions. Among those with 1 chronic condition other than TB, 4 groups emerged: (1) general morbidity (54.4%); (2) cardiovascular morbidity without complications (34.7%); (3) cardiovascular morbidity with complications (5.0%); (4) respiratory morbidity (5.9%). The respiratory morbidity group experienced the highest expenditures, at 16,360 CNY more overall (95% CI, CNY 12,615C21,215) after adjustment compared with TB patients without chronic conditions. The respiratory morbidity and cardiovascular morbidity with complications group also had the lowest odds of favorable TB outcomes [adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49C0.93] and (aOR 0.59, 95% CI 0.42C0.83), respectively. The cardiovascular morbidity without complications group had the highest odds of successful TB treatment (aOR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.15C1.71). Conclusions: Multimorbidity is common among patients with TB. The current study identified four distinct comorbidity subgroups, all of which experienced high, yet differential, rates of health care use.

METHODS Patients with Milan criteria tumours listed between January 1999 and June 2007 were stratified into RFA (n= 77) and No Treatment groups (n= 93). RESULTS The primary effectiveness of RFA was 83% (complete radiographic response). RFA was associated with a longer median wait time to transplant (9.5 vs. 5 months). Tumour-specific drop-off events were equivalent between RFA (21%) and No Treatment (12%) groups (P= 0.11). Controlling for wait time, there was no difference in overall (P= 0.56) or tumour-specific drop-off (P= 0.94). Furthermore, there were no differences in 5-year overall or tumour-free survivals from list date or transplant. Using multivariate analysis, the likelihood of receiving a transplant and patient survivals were associated with tumour characteristics (AFP, tumour number and size) and not with bridge therapy or waiting time.

Here, we focused on the top 20 potential NAbs for the mechanism study. Of them, the top 4 NAbs could individually neutralize both authentic SARS-CoV-2 and SD614G pseudovirus efficiently. Our epitope mapping revealed that 16/20 potent NAbs overlapped the same steric epitope. Excitingly, we found that one of these potent NAbs (58G6) exclusively bound to a linear epitope on S-RBD (termed as 58G6e), and the interaction of 58G6e and the recombinant ACE2 could be blocked by 58G6. We confirmed that 58G6e represented a key site of vulnerability on S-RBD and it could positively react with COVID-19 convalescent patients plasma. We are the first, as far as we know, to provide direct evidences of a linear epitope that can be recognized by a potent NAb against SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD.

We found that more pessimistic or more optimistic fragmented messages about the pandemic have no overall significant average effect on perceptions and planned behavior of the respondents. The exploratory analyses showed that particular sociodemographic groups are more sensitive to these fragmented messages. While less educated people react to more pessimistic messages with an increased likelihood to intensify prevention measures, people aged 60 or older - the high-risk group for COVID-19 complications - react to more optimistic messages with a reduced probability to intensify prevention measures. Besides providing insights to the public administration literature on disaster management, the results reinforce the need for governments to consistently centralize communication efforts to guarantee that people are equipped with complete and accurate information to form their perceptions and adequate their behaviors towards a health crisis.","output":"Pandemics and communication: an experimental assessment/ Pandemias y comunicacin: una evaluacin experimental/ Pandemias e comunicao: uma avaliao experimental"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The monthly air traffic of a city is a time series with an obvious seasonal pattern, and is closely related to the economic situation and social environment of the city.

However, few studies have reported on the discovery of probiotic strains for deer antler fermentation to increase functional ingredient absorption. This study evaluated the ability of probiotic lactic acid bacteria to enhance the concentrations of bioactive molecules (e.g., sialic acid and gamma-aminobutyric acid [GABA]) in extracts of deer antler velvet. Seventeen strains of Lactobacillus spp. that were isolated from kimchi and infant feces, including L. sakei, L. rhamnosus, L. brevis, and L. plantarum, and those that improved the life span of Caenorhabditis elegans were selected for evaluation. Of the 17 strains, 2 (L. rhamnosus LFR20-004 and L. sakei LFR20-007) were selected based on data showing that these strains increased both the sialic acid and GABA contents of deer antler extract after fermentation for 2 d and significantly improved the life span of C. elegans. Co-fermentation with both strains further increased the concentrations of sialic acid, GABA, and metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids and amino acids. We evaluated the biological effects of the fermented antler velvet (FAV) on the antibacterial immune response in C. elegans by assessing worm survival after pathogen infection. The survival of the C. elegans conditioned with FAV for 24 h was significantly higher compared with that of the control worm group fed only normal feed (non-pathogenic E. coli OP50) exposed to E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella typhi, and Listeria monocytogenes. To evaluate the protective effects of FAV on immune response, cyclophosphamide (Cy), an immune-suppressing agent was treated to in vitro and in vivo. We found that FAV significantly restored viability of mice splenocytes and immune promoting-related cytokines (interleukin [IL]-6, IL-10, inducible nitric oxide synthase [iNOS], interferon [IFN]-, and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-) were activated compared to non-fermented deer antlers. This finding indicated the protective effect of FAV against Cy-induced cell death and immunosuppressed mice. Taken together, our study suggests that immune-promoting antler velvet can be produced through fermentation using L. rhamnosus LFR20-004 and L. sakei LFR20-007.","output":"Enhanced -aminobutyric acid and sialic acid in fermented deer antler velvet and immune promoting effects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hydatid cyst in the cervical region is an extremely rare condition that can create challenges for anesthesiologists.

A total of 112, 28 and 42 epitopes specific for Spike, Membrane and Nucleocapsid, respectively, with defined HLA-restriction were identified. Direct ex vivo staining of PBMC with tetramer reagents was used to define immunodominant and subdominant T cell epitopes and estimate the frequencies of these T cells in SARS-CoV-2 exposed and na?ve individuals. Majority of SARS-CoV-2 epitopes identified have <67% amino acid sequence identity with endemic coronaviruses and are unlikely to elicit high avidity cross-reactive T cell responses. Four SARS-CoV-2 Spike reactive epitopes, including a DPB1*04:01 restricted epitope, with 67% amino acid sequence identity to endemic coronavirus were identified. SARS-CoV-2 T cell lines for three of these epitopes elicited cross-reactive T cell responses to endemic cold viruses. An endemic coronavirus Spike T cell line showed cross-reactivity to the fourth SARS-CoV-2 epitope. Three of the Spike cross-reactive epitopes were subdominant epitopes, while the DPB1*04:01 restricted epitope was a dominant epitope. Frequency analyses showed Spike cross-reactive T cells as detected by tetramers were present at relatively low frequency in unexposed people and only contributed a small proportion of the overall Spike-specific CD4+ T cells in COVID-19 convalescent individuals. In total, these results suggested a very limited number of SARS-CoV-2 T cells as detected by tetramers are capable of recognizing ccCoV with relative high avidity and vice versa.

Patients with myasthenia gravis (MG), often treated with immunosuppressants, might be at higher risk of developing COVID-19 and of demonstrating a severe disease course. We aimed to study prevalence and describe features of COVID-19 in MG patients. METHODS: In May 2020, we conducted telephonic interviews with MG patients followed at our referral center. We collected structured data regarding MG and COVID-19, which was diagnosed as probable or confirmed according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control case definition. We compared confirmed-COVID-19 prevalence calculated from the beginning of the pandemic in MG patients with that of the overall Pavia district. RESULTS: We interviewed 162 MG patients (median age, 66 y; interquartile range 41-77; males 59.9%), 88 from the Pavia district. Three patients had SARS-CoV-2-confirmed by polymerase chain reaction and eight had probable-COVID-19. In the Pavia district, the prevalence of confirmed-COVID-19 among MG patients (1/88, 1.14%) and overall population (4777/546 515, 0.87%) did not differ (P = .538). Higher Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America clinicalclass and the need for recent rescue treatment, but not ongoing immunosuppressive treatments, were associated with COVID-19 risk. Of 11 MG patients with probable/confirmed-COVID-19, 3 required ventilator support, and 2 elderly patients died of COVID-19 respiratory insufficiency. Only 1 of11 patients experienced worsening MG symptoms, which improved after increasing their steroid dose.

Here, we generate a cell system to selectively manipulate the nucleo-cytoplasmic levels of acetyl-CoA using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-mediated gene editing and acetate supplementation of the culture media. Using this system and quantitative omics analyses, we demonstrate that acetyl-CoA depletion alters the integrity of the nucleolus, impairing ribosomal RNA synthesis and evoking the ribosomal protein-dependent activation of p53. This nucleolar remodeling appears to be mediated through the class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs).

Methods: Survey data were collected between November 27, 2020, and December 11, 2020, from 990 adolescents and emerging adults aged 13-23 years. Participants were recruited through advertisements on Facebook and Instagram with an effort to overrecruit SGM youth. Questions asked youth about their perception of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their physical and mental health, the types of prosocial activities engaged in during the pandemic, and how they felt they were doing now versus before the pandemic. Results: SGM youth reported a significantly greater impact from the pandemic than non-SGM youth. Both SGM youth and cisgender heterosexual females reported greater impact on their mental health compared with cisgender heterosexual males, with cisgender sexual minority females and gender minority youth reporting the highest mental health impact. Gender minority youth also reported feeling less connected to their families and less safe at home as a result of the pandemic.

Methods: Beyond summary statistics, the monthly (May, 1976 to December, 2020) number of observed FDA MD Applications are investigated via an assortment of time series techniques (including: Discrete Wavelet Transform, Running Moving Average Filter (RMAF), Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode with Adaptive Noise decomposition (CEEMDAN), and Seasonal Trend Loess (STL) decomposition) to exhaustively search and characterize such periodicities. Results: The data were found to be non-normal, non-stationary (fractional order of integration < 1), non-linear, and strongly persistent (Hurst > 0.5).

On the other hand, clinical studies have clarified that the COVID-19 clinical burden is mostly due to over-inflammation and immune-mediated multiorgan injury. This has led to downsizing the role of immunosuppression as a determinant of outcome, and early reports confirm the hypothesis that patients undergoing immunosuppressive treatments do not have an increased risk of severe COVID-19 with respect to the general population. Intriguingly, SARS-CoV-2 natural reservoirs, such as bats and mice, have evolved mechanisms of tolerance involving selection of genes optimizing viral clearance through interferon type I and III responses and also dampening inflammasome response and cytokine expression.

However, biomechanical changes in CCMs performed on stable and unstable surfaces have not yet been quantified. RESEARCH QUESTION: Do movement patterns, muscle activity, coordination strategies, knee joint loading and center of mass (CoM) movement differ during a CCM performed on stable and unstable surfaces? METHODS: Motion analysis was used to monitor limb kinematics and surface electromyography to analyze supporting leg muscle activity in sixteen healthy athletes during a single-limb support task involving a cyclic CCM on a stable and unstable surface. Angle-angle plots were used to explore coordination strategies in sagittal movement of the hip and shoulder, while differences in kinematics and muscle activity between stable and unstable conditions were evaluated using dependent t-tests (&#945;-level = 0.05). RESULTS: CCMs on an unstable surface were performed at a slower speed (p < .05), with a more flexed posture of the support knee (p < .05) and ankle (p < .05) and resulted in reduced hip and shoulder movement of the swing limbs (p < .05). Instability increased activation of selected muscles of the ankle and knee (p < .05), resulted in a two-fold increase in the peak knee adduction moment (p < .05), and was accompanied by greater CoM movement (p < .05). Three coordination patterns of the swing limbs observed when performing CCM on a stable surface, which were mostly preserved on the unstable surface. SIGNIFICANCE: Despite adopting several stabilization strategies, CCM undertaken on an unstable surface still evoked greater excursion of the center of mass and, as such, presented a greater challenge to sensorimotor control.

Our aim was to establish the risk of catching COVID-19 as a urology emergency inpatient in our Trust and to assess patients fears and attitudes towards seeking medical help for their acute urological problems. Materials & Methods: A single centre study was conducted. A retrospective audit of all urological emergency admissions was made over a 10-week period (mid- March C end of May) in 2019 and compared to (mid-March C end of May) 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of patients who developed new COVID-19 symptoms whilst an in-patient or had positive swabs within 28 days of discharge was obtained. We performed a post discharge telephone survey of patients based on a COVID-19 fear questionnaire (FC19-HVQ) adapted from the validated Fear of COVID-19 scale. Results: Compared to 2019 (n=187), 2020 (n=122) there was a 35% reduction in the number of patients presenting acutely to our department. 43 of the 122 (35%) patients were swabbed on admission due to possible symptoms of COVID-19. One patient was found to be COVID-19 positive. 5 patients had further swabs during their admission;one patient who was negative on admission became positive whilst an inpatient. Accordingly, the overall in-hospital infection rate with COVID-19 was 0.82% (1 patient) during or within 28 days of discharge. There was no mortality (0%) related to COVID -19. The majority of patients were afraid to visit A&E or be admitted to hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Fewer patients were afraid to visit their local Family Doctor (GP). 28% (n=14) of responders ignored their symptoms during the pandemic. Patients were reluctant to seek medical input during COVID-19 with up 64% (n=32) of them stating that they attempted treat themselves at home. There was also a degree of intentional delay to visit A&E and the hospital with 56% (n=28) of our patients admitting to having delayed their visit. Conclusions: The risk of contracting COVID-19 whilst a urology in patient in a COVID-19 epicentre was very low (0.82%) with no COVID-19 related mortality.

Pre-pandemic outer-inner city complementary relations between 'Outdoor Activities';in 11 surrounding national parks and the 'Gaming Industry';in Las Vegas have transformed into outer-inner city substitution relations in the COVID-19 pandemic. This represents the evolving deconcentration of tourism concentration facing the growing uncertainty in an inner-city due to health risks in a pandemic.

However, it has been implicitly assumed that this theory does not apply to brick-and-mortar selling situations due to higher supply side inventory costs and higher demand side consumer search costs. Academics and practitioners alike have thus advocated for the use of Pareto rules to make category assortment planning decisions about product inventory breadth and depth in the brick-and-mortar channel. This research directly challenges this received wisdom by noting that the widespread prevalence and use of mobile technology is causing information flows to speed up for consumers even while performing traditional shopping tasks. Such information flows should theoretically favor the strategic importance of niche products in the long tail of the sales distribution. A large-scale empirical analysis of consumer packaged goods brick-and-mortar retailing data indicates that this alternative prediction is indeed true. This research contributes to a larger body of research as well that has documented how major environmental forces are shifting the nature of retail strategy, particularly in the brick-and-mortar channel.","output":"The evolving role of hit and niche products in brick-and-mortar retail category assortment planning: A large-scale empirical investigation of U.S. consumer packaged goods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Exposure to viral or bacterial pathogens increases the number of neutrophils with a relative decrease in lymphocytes, leading to elevated neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR). This study aimed to investigate whether differences in NLR among real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive and -negative patients presenting with a prediagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia could be useful in the differential diagnosis. METHODS: The study included 174 patients admitted because of suspected COVID-19 infection between March and April 2020. Patients were divided into two groups: PCR-negative and PCR-positive. Hemogram, NLR, urea, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin, ferritin, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, troponin, and coagulation parameters were analyzed. RESULTS: On comparison of laboratory parameters between both groups at presentation, PCR-positive patients were significantly more likely to have leukopenia (p < 0.001), thrombocytopenia (p = 0.006), neutropenia (p < 0.001), lymphopenia (p = 0.001), and increased NLR (p = 0.003). Furthermore, PCR-positive patients showed significant elevations of ferritin (p = 0.012) and procalcitonin (p = 0.038) and significant lower potassium levels (p = 0.05). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pneumonia has become a major global health problem. Early diagnosis and treatment of these patients are crucial, as COVID-19 pneumonia shows a rapid progression in most cases. Thus, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated NLR, and elevated ferritin may be useful as supplementary diagnostic tests in these patients, which may allow early initiation of treatment and may contribute to preventing progression in patients with abnormal results.","output":"Relationship between leukocyte, neutrophil, lymphocyte, platelet counts, and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and polymerase chain reaction positivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article was published ahead of print on the official website of Chinese Jounal of Ophthalmology on February 19, 2020.

Among inflammatory cells involved, macrophages play a crucial role and are mediated by the local microenvironment to exhibit different phenotypes and polarization states. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review to uncover the phenotypic alterations of macrophages during OA and summarized the potential therapeutic interventions via modulating macrophages. METHODS A systematic review of multiple databases (PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Medline) was performed up to February 29, 2020. Included articles were discussed and evaluated by two independent reviewers. Relevant information was analyzed with a standardized and well-designed template. RESULTS A total of 28 studies were included. Results were subcategorized into two sections depending on sources from human tissue/cell-based studies (12 studies) and animal experiments (16 studies). The overall observation indicated that M1 macrophages elevated in both synovium and circulation during OA development, along with lower numbers of M2 macrophages. The detailed alterations of macrophages in both synovium and circulation were listed and analyzed. Furthermore, interventions against OA via regulating macrophages in animal models were highlighted. CONCLUSION This study emphasized the importance of the phenotypic alterations of macrophages in OA development. The classical phenotypic subcategory of M1 and M2 macrophages was questionable due to controversial and conflicting results. Therefore, further efforts are needed to categorize macrophages in an exhaustive manner and to use advanced technologies to identify the individual roles of each subtype of macrophages in OA.","output":"Phenotypic alteration of macrophages during osteoarthritis: a systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant capable of escaping neutralizing antibodies emphasizes the need for prophylactic strategies to complement vaccination in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. Nasal epithelium is rich in the ACE2 receptor and important for SARS-CoV-2 transmission by supporting early viral replication before seeding to the lung1. Intranasal administration of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies or antibody fragments has shown encouraging potential as a protective measure in animal models2-5. However, there remains a need for SARS-CoV-2 blocking agents that are more economical to produce in large scale, while less vulnerable to mutational variation in the neutralization epitopes of the viral Spike glycoprotein. Here we describe TriSb92, a highly manufacturable trimeric human nephrocystin SH3 domain-derived antibody mimetic targeted against a conserved region in the receptor-binding domain of the Spike. TriSb92 potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and its variants of concern, including Delta and Omicron. Intranasal administration of a modest dose of TriSb92 (5 or 50 micrograms) as early as eight hours before the challenge with SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 efficiently protected mice from infection. The target epitope of TriSb92 was defined by cryo-EM, which revealed triggering of a conformational shift in the Spike trimer rather than competition for ACE2 binding as the molecular basis of its strong inhibitory action.

The incidence of LV pseudoaneurysm after STEMI is ~ 0.3%. CASE REPORT: A 73-year-old man who presented with an acute syncopal episode and intermittent chest pain for 7 days was found to have an anterolateral myocardial infarction (MI) with lateral wall rupture and pseudoaneurysm formation. He had an LV thrombosis in the LV aneurysm. While this increased his risk of thromboembolic events, it likely stopped the evolution of the rupture and stabilized the pericardial effusion size. The patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), thrombectomy, and lateral wall repair.

However, evidence on racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19-related mortality rates within NHs and how that has changed over time has been limited. This study examines the impact of a high proportion of minority residents in NHs on COVID-19-related mortality rates over a 30-week period. DESIGN: Longitudinal study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Nursing Home COVID-19 Public Use File data from 50 states from June 1, 2020, to December 27, 2020. METHODS: We linked data from 11,718 NHs to (1) Nursing Home Compare data, (2) the Long-Term Care: Facts on Care in the U.S., and (3) US county-level data on COVID cases and deaths. Our primary independent variable was proportion of minority residents (blacks and Hispanics) in NHs and its association with mortality rate over time. RESULTS: During the first 6 weeks from June 1, 2020, NHs with a higher proportion of black residents reported more COVID-19 deaths per 1000 followed by NHs with a higher proportion of Hispanic residents. Between 7 and 12 weeks, NHs with a higher proportion of Hispanic residents reported more deaths per 1000, followed by NHs with a higher proportion of black residents. However, after 23 weeks (mid-November 2020), NHs serving a higher proportion of white residents reported more deaths per 1000 than NHs serving a high proportion of black and Hispanic residents. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The disparities in COVID-19-related mortality for nursing homes serving minority residents is evident for the first 12 weeks of our study period.

Here, we demonstrate that CD13 controls endothelial cell invasion in response to the serum peptide bradykinin by facilitating signal transduction at the level of the plasma membrane. Inhibition of CD13 abrogates bradykinin B(2) receptor internalization, leading to the attenuation of downstream events such as bradykinin-induced activation of Cdc42 and filopodia formation, and thus affects endothelial cell motility. Investigation into mechanisms underlying this block led us to focus on B(2)R internalization via membrane-dependent mechanisms. Membrane disruption by depletion of cholesterol or trypsinization halts B(2)R internalization, invasion, and filopodia formation, which can be recovered with addition of cholesterol. However, this functional recovery is severely impaired in the presence of CD13 antagonists, and the distribution of membrane proteins is disordered in treated cells, suggesting a role for CD13 in plasma membrane protein organization. Finally, exogenous expression of wild-type but not mutant CD13 further alters protein distribution, suggesting peptidase activity is required for CD13's regulatory activity. Therefore, CD13 functions as a novel modulator of signal transduction and cell motility via its influence on specific plasma membrane organization, thus regulating angiogenesis.","output":"CD13/APN regulates endothelial invasion and filopodia formation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to enhance the security of exchanged medical images in telemedicine, we propose in this paper a blind and robust approach for medical image protection.

The data were obtained from the Mortality Information System and the Central Information Office of the National Civil Registry. The estimates of expected deaths were obtained from quasi-Poisson generalized additive models, adjusting for overdispersion. From February 23 to June 13, 2020, 74,410 natural deaths were recorded in the four cities, with 46% excess deaths (95%CI: 44-47). The largest amount of excess deaths was in Manaus, with 112% (95%CI: 103-121), followed by Fortaleza with 72% (95%CI: 67-78), Rio de Janeiro with 42% (95%CI: 40-45), and S?o Paulo with 34% (95%CI: 32-36). Excess deaths were greater in males and non-significant in Epidemiologic Weeks (EW) 9-12, except in S?o Paulo, 10% (95%CI: 6-14). The peak in excess deaths generally occurred in EW 17-20.

METHODS: Four Super League matches in which SARS-CoV-2 positive players were subsequently found to have participated were analysed. Players were identified as increased-risk contacts, and player interactions and proximities were analysed by video footage and global positioning system (GPS) data. The primary outcome was new positive cases of SARS-CoV-2 within 14 days of the match in increased-risk contacts and other players participating in the matches. RESULTS: Out of 136 total players, there were 8 SARS-CoV-2 positive players, 28 players identified as increased-risk contacts and 100 other players in the matches. Increased-risk contacts and other players were involved in 11.49.0 (maximum 32) and 4.05.2 (maximum 23) tackles, respectively. From GPS data, increased-risk contacts and other players were within 2 m of SARS-CoV-2 positive players on 10.418.0 (maximum 88) and 12.520.7 (maximum 121) occasions, totalling 65.7137.7 (maximum 689) and 89.5169.4 (maximum 1003) s, respectively.

Common food additives vegetable glycerine (VG) and propylene glycol (PG) form the base of all E-liquids, but little is known about their inflammatory potential once inhaled. Here, the effect of base components PG and VG on inflammasome activation and cytokine release was investigated in macrophages and epithelial cells exposed to E-liquids and vaporised E-liquid extract (E-vapour). Base E-liquid and E-vapour did not induce cellular cytotoxicity and non-vapourised E-liquid had no effect on IL-8 release.

Moreover, these specialized compressors marginally improve the compression ratio over the best general-purpose compressors.

AC2 also improves memory usage against AC, with requirements about seven times lower, without being affected by the sequences input size. As an analysis application, we use AC2 to measure the similarity between each SARS-CoV-2 protein sequence with each viral protein sequence from the whole UniProt database. The results consistently show higher similarity to the pangolin coronavirus, followed by the bat and human coronaviruses, contributing with critical results to a current controversial subject.

ACE2 is widely expressed, including, in the lungs, cardiovascular system, gut, kidneys, central nervous system, and adipose tissue. ACE2 has recently been identified as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, the infective agent responsible for coronavirus disease 2019, providing a critical link between immunity, inflammation, ACE2, and cardiovascular disease. Although sharing a close evolutionary relationship with SARS-CoV, the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 differs in several key amino acid residues, allowing for stronger binding affinity with the human ACE2 receptor, which may account for the greater pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. The loss of ACE2 function following binding by SARS-CoV-2 is driven by endocytosis and activation of proteolytic cleavage and processing. The ACE2 system is a critical protective pathway against heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction including, myocardial infarction and hypertension, and against lung disease and diabetes mellitus. The control of gut dysbiosis and vascular permeability by ACE2 has emerged as an essential mechanism of pulmonary hypertension and diabetic cardiovascular complications.

Infrared temperature sensing guns have proved its effectiveness and therefore such devices are used to monitor the body temperature. These devices are either used on hands or forehead. As a result, there are many issues in monitoring the temperature of frontline healthcare professionals. Firstly, these healthcare professionals keep wearing PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) kits during working hours and as a result it would be very difficult to monitor their body temperature. Secondly, these healthcare professionals also wear face shields and in such cases monitoring temperature by exposing forehead needs removal of face shield. Doing so after regular intervals is surely uncomfortable for healthcare professionals. To avoid such issues, this paper is disclosing a technologically advanced face shield equipped with sensors capable of monitoring body temperature instantly without the hassle of removing the face shield. This face shield is integrated with a built-in infrared temperature sensor. A total of 10 such face shields were printed and assembled within the university lab and then handed over to a group of ten members including faculty and students of nursing and health science department. This sequence was repeated four times and as a result 40 healthcare workers participated in the study. Thereafter, feedback analysis was conducted on questionnaire data and found a significant overall mean score of 4.59 out of 5 which indicates that the product is effective and worthy in every facet. Stress analysis is also performed in the simulated environment and found that the device can easily withstand the typically applied forces. The limitations of this product are difficulty in cleaning the product and comparatively high cost due to the deployment of electronic equipment.","output":"Technologically Advanced Reusable 3D Face Shield for Health Workers Confronting COVID19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the large amounts of research currently being conducted and the high number of editorials warning about the potential mental health impacts, there is a stunning lack of mental health data on the effects of the pandemic. Yet, the pandemic may have sizable impacts on psychological distress and health behaviors -these effects may be long-lasting and may disproportionately affect some demographic groups more than others. Data came from a longitudinal international study of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on adults' psychological distress and wellbeing (N = 1567). We found high rates of depression (55% were diagnosable with probable depression at baseline), anxiety (65%), and risk for PTSD (51%). More than one-third of participants who reported that they drank alcohol indicated that their drinking had increased since the start of the pandemic. Over time, depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts and behaviors increased significantly, but acute stress symptoms decreased. Specific demographic groups (people of color and sexual and gender minorities) appeared to be at high risk of distress across analyses. Our findings suggest high rates of depression, anxiety, acute stress, and other signs of distress like isolation, hopelessness, and use of substances to cope - even at five-month follow-up.

The present study aims to accumulate the published mRNA Covid-19 vaccine-associated myocarditis cases, describe their clinical characteristics and determine the factors predisposing to critical illness. METHODS: Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, CENTRAL and Google Scholar were systematically searched from inception. Studies reporting adult myocarditis cases following BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccination were included. Individual participant data coming from case reports/series were pooled. Proportional random-effects meta-analysis was conducted by combining the pooled cohort and observational studies with aggregated data. RESULTS: Overall, 39 studies were included with a total of 129 patients. Most cases occurred in young males after the second vaccine dose. Myocarditis after the first dose was significantly associated with prior Covid-19 (p-value: 0.025). The most common electrocardiographic finding was ST-segment elevation, while late gadolinium enhancement was invariably observed in cardiac magnetic reasoning. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that signs of heart failure were predictive of subsequent critical illness (Odds ratio: 19.22, 95% confidence intervals-CI: 5.57C275.84). Proportion meta-analysis indicated that complete resolution of symptoms is achieved in 80.5% of patients (95% CI: 59.3C92.1), while the proportion of participants necessitating intensive care unit admission is 7.0% (95% CI: 3.8C12.9).

Methods: A cohort of 55 hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 positive patients was prospectively recruited - blood sampling was performed at baseline, post-treatment and hospital discharge. Serum IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP) and other laboratory investigations were compared between treatment groups and across timepoints. Acute serum IL-6 and CRP levels were then compared to those with suspected COVID-19 (SCOVID) and age and sex matched patients with SAB and patients hospitalized for any non-infectious condition (NIC). Results: IL-6 was elevated at admission in the SARS-CoV-2 cohort but at lower levels compared to matched SAB patients. Median (IQR) IL-6 at admission was 73.89 pg/mL (30.9, 126.39) in SARS-CoV-2 compared to 92.76 pg/mL (21.75, 246.55) in SAB (p=0.017); 12.50 pg/mL (3.06, 35.77) in patients with NIC; and 95.51 pg/mL (52.17, 756.67) in SCOVID. Median IL-6 and CRP levels decreased between admission and discharge timepoints. This reduction was amplified in patients treated with remdesivir and/or dexamethasone.

Limited understanding of the factors affecting the uptake and outcomes of different family support models hinders the implementation of best practices. We aimed to conduct a rapid pre-implementation evaluation of stakeholder-perceived facilitators and barriers to design implementation strategies to support a novel program using medical students to facilitate family-centered care in the ICU. METHODS: We conducted a 2-step process. In step 1, we gathered contextual data via interview-style open-ended questions sent to clinicians and navigator stakeholders via email. We used electronic data collection due to the physical distancing requirements, the need to prioritize brief data collection for respondent burden, and the need for rapid knowledge gain. A codebook based on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), an integrated framework from the field of implementation science, was used to analyze the findings. In step 2, a pilot of the intervention was implemented with 3 navigators over 2 weeks. Implementation strategies were developed to target barriers identified by the pre-implementation evaluation. RESULTS: Fourteen (70%) of the identified stakeholders responded to the survey. Ten constructs encompassing all five CFIR domains were present in responses as implementation influencers, with the Intervention domain most frequently represented. Through these results and operational feedback from navigators during the pilot period, stakeholders selected multiple implementation strategies: audit and provide feedback, develop educational materials, conduct ongoing training, promote adaptability, assess and redesign workflow, identify and prepare champions, and engage community resources.

However, limited reports suggest differing infection and death rates across geographic areas including populations that reside at higher elevations (HE). We aimed to determine if COVID-19 infection, death, and case mortality rates differed in higher versus low elevation (LE) U.S. counties. METHODS: Using publicly available geographic and COVID-19 data, we calculated per capita infection and death rates and case mortality in population density matched HE and LE U.S. counties. We also performed population-scale regression analysis to investigate the association between county elevation and COVID-19 infection rates. FINDINGS: Population density matching of LA (< 914m, n = 58) and HE (>2133m, n = 58) counties yielded significantly lower COVID-19 cases at HE versus LE (615 versus 905, p = 0.034). HE per capita deaths were significantly lower than LE (9.4 versus 19.5, p = 0.017). However, case mortality did not differ between HE and LE (1.78% versus 1.46%, p = 0.27).

The aims of this study were to investigate differences by assessing: (1) variance in diagnostic and investigative practice, using a case-based analysis of inter-rater agreement; (2) potential importance of any differences in terms of patient care; (3) relationships between clinical experience, diagnostic certainty, diagnostic peer-agreement and investigative approach. The objective was to develop novel individualised metrics to facilitate reflection and appraisal. METHODS Three neurologists with 6-23 years' experience at consultant level provided diagnosis, certainty (10-point Likert scale), and investigative approach for 200 consecutive general neurology outpatients seen by a newly qualified consultant in 2015. Diagnostic agreement was evaluated by percentage agreement. The potential importance of any diagnostic differences on patient outcome was assigned a score (6-point Likert scale) by the evaluating neurologist. Associations between diagnostic agreement, certainty and investigative approach were assessed using Spearman correlation, logistic and ordinal regression, and reported as individualised metrics for each rater. RESULTS Diagnostic peer-agreement was 3/3, 2/3, and 1/3 in 55.5%, 31.0%, 13.5% of cases, respectively. In 15.5%, differences in patient management were judged potentially important. Investigation rates were 42-73%. Mean diagnostic certainty ranged between 6.63/10 (SD 1.98) to 7.72/10 (SD 2.20) between least and most experienced consultants. Greater diagnostic certainty was associated with greater diagnostic peer-agreement (individual-rater regression coefficients 0.33-0.44, p<0.01) and lower odds of arranging investigations (individual-rater odds ratios 0.56-0.71, p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS It appears that variance in diagnostic and investigative practice between consultant neurologists exists and may result in differing management. Mean diagnostic certainty was associated with greater diagnostic peer-agreement and lower investigation rates. Metrics reflecting concordance with peers, and relationships to diagnostic confidence, could be developed in larger cohorts to inform reflective practice.","output":"Diagnostic and investigative approach of consultant neurologists in a real-world clinical setting: a pilot study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper documents the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the use of profession financial advisors across a broad sample of financial decision makers (N = 16,431).

This study aimed to observe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health outcomes among patients with mild to moderate illness in Fangcang shelter hospitals. METHODS: We conducted an observational, cross-sectional study of 129 patients with mild to moderate illness from Jiangxia Fangcang shelter hospitals in Wuhan, China. The participants were assessed by quantifying their symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and stressful life events and analyzing potential risk factors associated with these symptoms. Using correlation analysis, we examined associations between exposure to COVID-19 and subsequent psychological distress in response to the outbreak. RESULTS: In total, 49.6% of participants had depressive or anxiety symptoms. The depressive and anxiety symptoms were highly related to sleep disturbances and hypochondriasis (all r > 0.50, P < 0.01). The impact of the event was positively related to depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, sleep disturbances, hypochondriasis and life events (all r > 0.35, P < 0.01) but was negatively related to psychological resilience (r = C0.41, P < 0.01). The presence of the COVID-19 infection in this setting was associated with increased anxiety, depression and stress levels, and decreased sleep quality, and seriously affected patients quality of life as well as adversely affecting the course and prognosis of physical diseases.

In the past disease diagnosis, most medical staff fixed the images together for observation and then combined with their own work experience to judge. The diagnosis results are subjective, time-consuming, and inefficient. In order to improve the efficiency of diagnosis, this paper applies the deep learning algorithm to the online diagnosis and classification of CT images. Based on this, in this paper, the deep learning algorithm is applied to CT image online diagnosis and classification. Based on a brief analysis of the current situation of CT image classification, this paper proposes to use the Internet of things technology to collect CT image information and establishes the Internet of things to collect the CT image model. In view of image classification and diagnosis, the convolution neural network algorithm in the deep learning algorithm is proposed to diagnose and classify CT images, and several factors affecting the accuracy of classification are proposed, including the convolution number and network layer number. Using the CT image of the hospital brain for simulation analysis, the simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the deep learning algorithm. With the increase of convolution and network layer and the decrease of compensation, the accuracy of image classification will decline. Using the maximum pool method, reducing the step size can improve the classification effect. Using relu function as the activation function can improve the classification accuracy. In the process of large data set processing, appropriately adding a network layer can improve classification accuracy. In the diagnosis and analysis of brain CT images, the overall classification accuracy is close to 70%, and in the diagnosis of tumor diseases, the accuracy is higher, up to 80%.","output":"Online Diagnosis and Classification of CT Images Collected by Internet of Things Using Deep Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Schools are responsible for helping students in their vocational career development in the sense that they should sustain students in developing skills required by the job market.

Methods: An MR physics governed AI system was trained to generate optimized acquisition schedules and the corresponding quantitative reconstruction neural-network. The system (termed AutoCEST) is composed of a CEST saturation block, a spin dynamics module, and a deep reconstruction network, all differentiable and jointly connected. The method was validated using a variety of chemical exchange phantoms and an in-vivo mouse brain at 9.4T. Results: The acquisition times for AutoCEST optimized schedules ranged from 35-71s, with a quantitative image reconstruction time of only 29 ms. The resulting exchangeable proton concentration maps for the phantoms were in good agreement with the known solute concentrations for AutoCEST sequences (mean absolute error = 2.42 mM; Pearson's r=0.992 , p$<$0.0001), but not for an unoptimized sequence (mean absolute error = 65.19 mM; Pearson's r=-0.161, p=0.522). Similarly, improved exchange rate agreement was observed between AutoCEST and quantification of exchange using saturation power (QUESP) methods (mean absolute error: 35.8 Hz, Pearson's r=0.971, p$<$0.0001) compared to an unoptimized schedule and QUESP (mean absolute error = 58.2 Hz; Pearson's r=0.959, p$<$0.0001).

Here we show single cell-level mechanisms for T-cell dysregulation in severe COVID-19, demonstrating new pathogenetic mechanisms of T-cell activation and differentiation underlying severe COVID-19. By in silico sorting CD4+ T-cells from a single cell RNA-seq dataset, we found that CD4+ T-cells were highly activated and showed unique differentiation pathways in the lung of severe COVID-19 patients. Notably, those T-cells in severe COVID-19 patients highly expressed immunoregulatory receptors and CD25, whilst repressing the expression of FOXP3. Furthermore, we show that CD25+ hyperactivated T-cells differentiate into multiple helper T-cell lineages, showing multifaceted effector T-cells with Th1 and Th2 characteristics. Lastly, we show that CD25-expressing hyperactivated T-cells produce the protease Furin, which facilitates the viral entry of SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, CD4+ T-cells from severe COVID-19 patients are hyperactivated and FOXP3-mediated negative feedback mechanisms are impaired in the lung, which may promote immunopathology.

Repurposed drugs included potential primary SARS-CoV-2 treatment, adjunctive therapies, or therapeutics to treat side effects. The link prediction accuracy for nodes ranked highly for SARS coronavirus was 0.875 as calculated by human in the loop validation on existing COVID-19 specific data sets.

The analysis includes all surgery cases at a single site tertiary referral center in NYC across urologic subspecialities. The periods between January 1 and Dec 31 in 2020 and 2019 were chosen. We chose the same period in 2019 as the control to account for seasonal factors affecting surgical volume. RESULTS: There was a significant decline across all subspecialties in 2020 compared to 2019 (-19%;2,922 vs 2,359). There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of robotic surgery, elective surgery, and cases by subspecialty. The 2019 and 2020 patient cohorts were comparable (table 1). Controlling for surgeon preference in booking cases, endourology and oncology cases were the least likely to exhibit declines in volume (OR 1.2, 1.1-1.3;p<0.01). After elective surgeries were allowed to resume in May 2020 surgical volume recovered within 4-6 weeks. Overall, no rebound in surgical volume to correct for the suspension period was observed (figure 1). The 2020 graduating chief class logged 17% fewer cases in residency years U4 and U5 compared to the 2019 class (624 vs 753 cases), but minimum ACGME case counts at the time of graduation were met without issue. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID19 pandemic had a marked impact on urology resident rotation surgical volume with no rebound effect observed. A broader analysis across training sites is needed to estimate the full impact on the residency program. The effect of the lockdown measures on outcomes for untreated or underdiagnosed patients has yet to be established.

Nonetheless, as for other vaccines, COVID-19 vaccination is not completely free from side effects. Among the adverse events that have been reported after receiving COVID-19 vaccination, special emphasis has been given to an unexpected number of thrombocytopenic episodes with or without thrombotic complications, especially in recipients of adenovirus-based COVID-19 vaccines. Along with a specific clinical presentation, encompassing \\"atypical\\" thrombosis (especially cerebral venous [sinus] thrombosis, CVT) more prevalent in young female subjects, this new syndrome called vaccine-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (VITT) is characterized by, and thereby diagnosed for, the presence of three paradigmatic laboratory abnormalities, i.e., low platelet count (<150  109/L), elevated plasma D-dimer levels (>0.5 mg/L), accompanied by a positive test for anti-PF4 (platelet factor 4) antibodies assayed with ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) techniques. Timely identification of these important abnormalities by both clinicians and laboratory professional is essential for early diagnosis and management of VITT, since the outcome of this condition may be fatal in half or even more of effected patients with severe disease. Therefore, this narrative review aims to review here the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of VITT and other COVID-19 vaccine-associated thrombocytopenias.","output":"Cerebral Venous Thrombosis Developing after COVID-19 Vaccination: VITT, VATT, TTS, and More"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Land Use/Land Cover (LU/LC) data includes most of the information suitable for tackling many environmental issues.

The detection and diagnosis have been improved, as well. However, the daily reported cases remaining at a high level make the epidemic trend prediction difficult. METHODS: Since the traditional SEIR model does not evaluate the effectiveness of control strategies, a novel model in line with the current epidemic's process and control measures was proposed, utilizing multisource datasets including the cumulative number of reported, deceased, quarantined and suspected cases. RESULTS: Results show that the trend of the epidemic mainly depends on quarantined and suspected cases. The predicted cumulative numbers of quarantined and suspected cases nearly reached static states, and their inflection points have already been achieved, with the epidemic's peak coming soon. The estimated effective reproduction numbers using model-free and model-based methods are decreasing, as well as new infections, while newly reported cases are increasing. Most infected cases have been quarantined or put in the suspected class, which has been ignored in existing models.

Initial presenting symptoms usually vary from shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, and superior vena cava syndrome to nonspecific constitutional symptoms (eg, fever, weight loss, fatigue). However, the initial presentation of a mediastinal mass with acute pericarditis has not been reported in the literature as far as we know. CASE REPORT A 20-year-old man presented to the Cardiology Clinic with chest pain and new pericardial effusion on echocardiography, both fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of acute pericarditis. The patient also had venous engorgement on the neck, and a chest X-ray followed by computed tomography imaging showed a large mediastinal mass. The serum tumor marker a-fetoprotein (AFP) was markedly elevated. The biopsy and immunohistochemistry revealed a high-grade malignant neoplasm - yolk sac tumor, which is a type of non-seminomatous germ cell tumor. The acute pericarditis resolved after administration of NSAID and colchicine. The patient was then started on chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS The discussed case shows the rare presentation of an anterior mediastinal mass with acute pericarditis. This emphasizes the importance of a thorough review of systems and critical analysis of every sign and symptom at the time of initial presentation, which helps the physician to obtain appropriate imaging studies early in the course, leading to an early diagnosis and treatment of the disease, such as in this case of an extremely rare germ cell tumor.","output":"Yolk Sac Tumor in the Anterior Mediastinum Presenting as Acute Pericarditis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this study was to find out the association of ABO blood groups with the severity and outcome of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children.

DESIGN Nationally-representative cross-sectional surveys SETTING: All of India from 1997-2020 SAMPLE: About 10,000 maternal deaths among 4.3 million live births over two decades METHODS: We analysed trends in the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) from 1997 through 2020, estimated absolute maternal deaths, and examined causes of maternal death using nationally-representative data sources; partitioned UN-adjusted female (aged 15-49) deaths, live birth totals, based on the 2001-2014 Million Death Study cause of death data. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Maternal mortality burden and distribution of causes. RESULTS The MMR declined in India by about 70% from 398/100 000 live births (95% CI: 378-417) in 1997-98 to 99/100,000 (90-108) in 2020. About 1.30 million (1.26 - 1.35) maternal deaths occurred between 1997 and 2020, with about 23,800 (21,700-26,000) in 2020, most in poorer states (63%) and among women aged 20-29 years (58%). MMRs for Assam (215), Uttar Pradesh/Uttarakhand (192), and Madhya Pradesh/Chhattisgarh (170) were highest, surpassing India's 2016-18 estimate of 113 (103-123). Adjusted for education and other variables, risks of maternal death were highest in rural and tribal areas of northeastern and northern states. The leading causes of maternal death were obstetric haemorrhage (47%; higher in poorer states), pregnancy-related infection (12%), and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (7%).

We did a prospective study to estimate HIV incidence rates during pregnancy and lactation. METHODS We assessed 2188 HIV-negative sexually active women with 2625 exposure intervals during pregnancy and 2887 intervals during breastfeeding, and 8473 non-pregnant and non-lactating women with 24,258 exposure intervals. Outcomes were HIV incidence rates per 100 person years and incidence rate ratios estimated by Poisson multivariate regression, with the non-pregnant or non-lactating women as the reference group. We also assessed the husbands of the married women to study male risk behaviours. FINDINGS HIV incidence rates were 2.3 per 100 person years during pregnancy, 1.3 per 100 person years during breastfeeding, and 1.1 per 100 person years in the non-pregnant and non-lactating women. The adjusted incidence rate ratios were 2.16 (95% CI 1.39-3.37) during pregnancy and 1.16 (0.82-1.63) during breastfeeding. Pregnant women and their male partners reported significantly fewer external sexual partners than did the other groups. In married pregnant women who had a sexual relationship with their male spouses, the HIV incidence rate ratio was 1.36 (0.63-2.93). In married pregnant women in HIV-discordant relationships (ie, with HIV-positive men) the incidence rate ratio was 1.76 (0.62-4.03). INTERPRETATION The risk of HIV acquisition rises during pregnancy. This change is unlikely to be due to sexual risk behaviours, but might be attributable to hormonal changes affecting the genital tract mucosa or immune responses.

The dynamic changes of clinical signs were profiled across the four groups. A clinical staging proposal of the disease course over time was proposed from the perspective of the interaction between the virus and host. The prodromal phase, characterized by pneumonia, significant lymphopenia, and slightly elevated inflammatory markers, occurred in the first week after symptoms onset. In the second week, all the hematological and inflammatory markers were at the peak or bottom. Meanwhile, progressive pneumonia as well as the secondary damage of other organs (e.g. cardiac damage, coagulopathy, etc.) was significant during this period, making the disease progress into the apparent manifestation phase. In the third week, the improvement of the majority of clinical signs accompanied by a relatively high degree of inflammatory response defined the remission phase. After 3 weeks, patients were in the convalescent phase, in which all the indicators were maintained at a relatively normal level. We concluded that the disease course over time in non-severe patients with COVID-19 could be divided into four phases: the prodromal phase (in the first week), the apparent manifestation phase (in the second week), the remission phase (in the third week), and the convalescent phase (after 3 weeks), respectively.

Liquid biopsy based on circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has been shown to predict recurrence and treatment resistance in various types of cancers, but their utility has not been fully demonstrated in resectable PDAC. We have simultaneously tracked three circulating biomarkers, including CTCs, cfDNA, and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), over a period of cancer treatment using a microfluidic device and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). The microfluidic device is based on the combination of filtration and immunoaffinity mechanisms. We have measured CTCs, cfDNA, and ctDNA in a cohort of seven resectable PDAC patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery, and each patient was followed up to 10 time points over a period of 4 months. CTCs were detectable in all patients (100%) at some point during treatment but were detectable in only three out of six patients (50%) prior to the start of treatment. Median cfDNA concentrations remained comparable to negative controls throughout treatment. ddPCR was able to find KRAS mutations in six of seven patients (86%); however, these mutations were present in only two of seven patients (29%) prior to treatment. Overall, the majority of circulating biomarkers (81% for CTCs and 91% for cfDNA/ctDNA) were detected after the start of neoadjuvant therapy but before surgery. This study suggests that a longitudinal study of circulating biomarkers throughout treatment provides more useful information than those single time-point tests for resectable PDAC patients.","output":"Longitudinal Study of Circulating Biomarkers in Patients with Resectable Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has endangered global health, the world economy, and societal values. Despite intensive measures taken around the world, morbidity and mortality remain high as many countries face new waves of infection and the spread of new variants. Worryingly, more and more variants are now being identified, such as 501Y.V1 (B.1.1.7) in the UK, 501Y.V2 (B.1.351) in South Africa, 501Y.V3 in Manaus, Brazil, and B.1.617/B.1.618 in India, which could lead to a severe epidemic rebound. Moreover, some variants have a stronger immune escape ability. To control the new SARS-CoV-2 variant, we may need to develop and redesign new vaccines repeatedly. So it is important to investigate how our immune system combats and responds to SARS-CoV-2 infection to develop safe and effective medical interventions. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we performed a longitudinal and proteome-wide analysis of antibodies in the COVID-19 patients to revealed some immune processes of COVID-19 patients against SARS-CoV-2 and found some dominant epitopes of a potential vaccine. METHODS: Microarray assay, Antibody depletion assays, Neutralization assay RESULTS: We profiled a B-cell linear epitope landscape of SARS-CoV-2 and identified the epitopes specifically recognized by either IgM, IgG, or IgA. We found that epitopes more frequently recognized by IgM are enriched in non-structural proteins. We further identified epitopes with different immune responses in severe and mild patients. Moreover, we identified 12 dominant epitopes eliciting antibodies in most COVID-19 patients and identified five key amino acids of epitopes. Furthermore, we found epitope S-82 and S-15 are perfect immunogenic peptides and should be considered in vaccine design. CONCLUSION: This data provide useful information and rich resources for improving our understanding of viral infection and developing a novel vaccine/neutralizing antibodies for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Longitudinal and Proteome-wide Analyses of Antibodies in COVID-19 Patients Reveal Features of the Humoral Immune Response to SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the healthcare burden associated with migraines, prompt and effective treatment is vital to improve patient outcomes and ED workflow.

Therefore, we designed this study to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and the effectiveness and attitudes towards online education among Chinese children aged 7C15 years. METHODS: A detailed questionnaire, comprising of 62 questions was designed and parents or caretakers of 7 to 15 years old children were invited to participate via WeChat, a multi-purpose messaging, social media and mobile payment app, which is widely used by the Chinese population. A total of 668 parents across different regions of China were included. RESULTS: During COVID-19 pandemic, 20.7 and 7.2% children report experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive symptoms due to the COVID-19 pandemic. PTSD and SMFQ-P scores are significantly higher in middle school and boarding school students compared to primary and day school students. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that school system and province of origin are factors significantly associated with developing PSTD symptoms. 44.3% respondents feel online education is effective in gaining knowledge and improving practical and communications skills. 78.0% believe the online education system is efficient. Overall 79.8% respondents are satisfied and children can adapt to this new education system. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we found 1 in five children have PTSD and 1 in 14 children have depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION: In summary, COVID-19 epidemic has caused PTSD and depression symptoms among Chinese children aged 7 to 15 years. In general, a large proportion of respondents are satisfied with online education, but still a substantial proportion of students are not comfortable with this new form of learning. Authorities should optimize online education systems and implement effective interventions to cope with the psychological effects of COVID-19 on children, as it is affecting the global population and remains uncertain when it will end.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic outbreak on education and mental health of Chinese children aged 7C15 years: an online survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common inherited disease characterized by progressive enlargement of fluid-filled cysts derived from renal tubular epithelial cells, which has become the fourth leading cause of end-stage renal diseases.

With virtual screening, Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cyst model, embryonic kidney cyst model and kidney-specific Pkd1 knockout mouse (PKD) model, we identified obacunone as a candidate compound for ADPKD drug discovery from a natural antioxidant compound library. In vitro experiments showed that obacunone significantly inhibited cyst formation and expansion of MDCK cysts and embryonic kidney cysts in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo, obacunone treatment significantly reduced the renal cyst development in PKD mice. Western blot and morphological analysis revealed that obacunone served as a NRF2 activator in ADPKD, which suppressed lipid peroxidation by up-regulating GPX4 and finally restrained excessive cell proliferation by down-regulating mTOR and MAPK signaling pathways. Experimental data demonstrated obacunone as an effective renal cyst inhibitor for ADPKD, indicating that obacunone might be developed into a therapeutic drug for ADPKD treatment.","output":"Obacunone Retards Renal Cyst Development in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease by Activating NRF2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID\\\\19 has swept across the globe and disrupted all vectors of social life.

The mechanism of contagion is well understood. As people move around, over time, they regularly engage in social interactions. The spatiotemporal network representing these interactions constitutes the backbone on which an epidemic spreads, causing outbreaks. At the same time, advanced technological responses have claimed some success in controlling the epidemic based on digital contact tracing technologies. Motivated by these observations, we design, develop and evaluate a stochastic agent-based SEIR model of epidemic spreading in spatiotemporal networks informed by mobility data of individuals (trajectories). The model focuses on individual variation in mobility patterns that affects the degree of exposure to the disease. Understanding the role that individual nodes play in the process of disease spreading through network effects is fundamental as it allows to (i) assess the risk of infection of individuals, (ii) assess the size of a disease outbreak due to specific individuals, and (iii) assess targeted intervention strategies that aim to control the epidemic spreading. We perform a comprehensive analysis of the model employing COVID-19 as a use case. The results indicate that simple individual-based intervention strategies that exhibit significant network effects can effectively control the spread of an epidemic. We have also demonstrated that targeted interventions can outperform generic intervention strategies.

There are few studies characterizing SARS-CoV-2 in pediatric immunocompromised patients, such as liver transplanted patients. The aim of this study was to analyze the outcomes of the largest cohort of pediatric liver transplant recipients (PLTR) from a single center in Brazil who were infected with COVID-19 during the pandemic. Methods: Cross-sectional study. Primary outcomes: COVID-19 severity. The Cox regression method was used to determine independent predictors associated with the outcomes. Patients were divided into two groups according to the severity of COVID-19 disease: moderateCsevere COVID and asymptomaticCmild COVID. Results: Patients categorized as having moderateCsevere COVID-19 were younger (12.6 months vs. 82.1 months, p = 0.03), had a higher prevalence of transplantation from a deceased donor (50% vs. 4.3%, p = 0.02), and had a higher prevalence of COVID infection within 6 months after liver transplantation (LT) (75% vs. 5.7%, p = 0.002). The independent predictor of COVID-19 severity identified in the multivariate analysis was COVID-19 infection <6 months after LT (HR = 0.001, 95% CI = 0.001C0.67, p = 0.03).

In this study we investigated how these factors were regulated by PH risk factors (e.g. inflammation and hypoxia) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We showed that treatment with interleukin 1 (IL\\\\1) induced EnMT of HUVECs via activation of NF-B/Snail pathway, which was further exacerbated by knockdown of protein tyrosine phosphatase L1 (PTPL1). We demonstrated that PTPL1 inhibited NF-B/Snail through dephosphorylating and stabilizing IB. IL\\\\1 or hypoxia could downregulate PTPL1 expression in HUVECs. The deregulation of PTPL1/NF-B signaling was validated in a monocrotaline-induced rat PH (MCT-PH) model and clinical PH specimens.

This study examines the disability inclusiveness of government measures to COVID-19 in Brazil and Chile. With more than one billion people with disabilities worldwide, it is important to examine the inclusiveness of official government responses, in order to protect and mitigate the impacts of the pandemic for this population. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM: Government responses have a direct impact on the capacity of people with disabilities to protect themselves against health-related, economic, and social consequences of the pandemic. In order to examine official measures, we conducted documentary research, using framework analysis, and studied official documents published from February 1st, 2020 until June 30th, 2021. The aim was to explore the inclusiveness of government responses in areas such as access to healthcare, and social welfare. RESULTS: We analysed 41 documents in total. The findings highlight that while both countries took steps to ensure access to healthcare, and relevant information, as well as financial support, they also implemented policies - or did not undertake any at all - that often resulted in an amplification of existing inequalities. Neither country included people with disabilities and their organisations in decision-making processes. LESSONS: This study illustrates how oficial government responses taken by Brazil and Chile - while positive, in several aspects - do not fully address the needs of people with disabilities. In order to ensure response to COVID-19 is disability-inclusive, it is necessary to translate recommendations into practice, consider people with disabilities both in mainstream policy and in disability-specific measures, and focus on the long-term reconstruction phase. KEY MESSAGES: People with disabilities are particularly exposed to the risks of and responses to COVID-19. Inclusive measures have been adopted but the needs of this population have not been fully addressed.","output":"Disability inclusiveness of government responses to COVID-19 in Brazil and Chile"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are one of the most common causes of the \\"common cold\\". Some HCoV strains, however, can cause fatal respiratory disease. Some examples of these diseases are severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19). This article will review the etiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of HCoVs. Methods: A systematic literature review was performed using the terms \\"human coronaviruses\\", \\"MERS-CoV\\", \\"SARSCoV\\", \\"SARS-CoV2\\", \\"COVID-19\\", and \\"common cold\\" in OVID MEDLINE, PubMed, and Cochrane Library. Findings: Most HCoVs cause mild upper respiratory infections which resolve with supportive care and no sequelae. In recent decades, however, there have been outbreaks of novel HCoVs that cause more severe disease. This is largely due to HCoVs having large genomes which undergo frequent recombination events, leading to the emergence of novel and more virulent strains of the virus. These severe respiratory illnesses can lead to acute respiratory distress requiring invasive intervention, such as mechanical ventilation. These severe infections can lead to long-lasting sequelae in patients. Scientists continue to investigate potential treatments for these viruses, though supportive care remains the gold standard. Scientists have succeeded in developing numerous vaccines for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and ongoing data collection and analysis will shed even more light on the next steps in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: Due to the frequency of recombination events and the subsequent emergence of novel strains, HCoVs are becoming more prevalent, making them a global health concern as they can lead to epidemics and pandemics. Understanding the epidemiology, etiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of HCoVs is important, especially during this worldwide pandemic.","output":"Corona viruses: reaching far beyond the common cold"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of cholestatic liver injury, but it is unclear whether the inflammasome is involved and is the objective of this study. METHODS: Gene expression was analyzed in the livers of patients with primary biliary cholangitis (n = 15) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (n = 15). Bile duct ligation (BDL) or sham operation was performed in wild-type (WT) and Caspase-1(C/C) (Casp1(C/C)) mice for 7 days. Mouse hepatocytes and macrophages were treated with bile acids. RESULTS: Caspase-1, NLRP1, NLRP3 and IL-1 were significantly increased in the livers of cholestatic patients when compared to healthy control subjects (n = 9). Significantly higher levels of plasma IL-1 (826 vs 345 pg/ml), ALT (674 vs 482 U/L) and ALP (900 vs 622 U/L) were seen in WT BDL mice compared to Casp1(C/C) BDL mice. Caspase-1 cleavage was found only in WT BDL livers. Assessment of liver histology indicated more fibrosis in Casp1(C/C) BDL mice than in WT BDL mice, confirmed by analyses of liver hydroxyproline content and the expression of fibrotic genes. Profiling of immune cells revealed that there were more macrophages in Casp1(C/C) BDL livers than in WT BDL livers. Further macrophage phenotype characterization indicated that Casp1(C/C) BDL livers had more M2 anti-inflammatory macrophages evidenced by more CD206 positive cells and higher expression of IL-4, CD163, Fizz1 and IL-33. When mouse hepatocytes and peritoneal macrophages were exposed to cholestatic levels of major endogenous bile acids (300M TCA), neither IL-1 induction nor procaspase-1 cleavage were detected.

The present study aimed to elucidate cancer patients' and their caregivers' experiences during this outbreak. DESIGN: Face-to-face semistructured interviews were conducted. SETTING: A tertiary cancer care facility. PARTICIPANTS: 16 patients with cancer and 14 caregivers. Inclusions criteria were: (A) diagnosed with cancer, (B) receiving active treatment or follow-ups, (C) aged 21 years and above and (D) fluent in English or Mandarin. RESULTS: Thematic analysis was conducted. Five themes were identified: heightened sense of threat, impact on healthcare experience, responsibility falls on oneself, striving for normalcy and sense of safety and trust. Heightened threat of COVID-19 was more pronounced in patients and linked to vulnerability and fear, uncertainty and actions of socially irresponsible others. Dominant in their healthcare experience was prioritising cancer and treatment amidst heightened threat and anticipatory worry about treatment disruptions. Both noted on the importance of taking responsibility for one's health, with caregivers reporting a reinforced sense of duty towards patients. They strived to maintain normalcy by viewing COVID-19 as beyond personal control, downplaying and living life as usual. Their resolve was supported by a sense of safety from the actions of authorities, hospitals and trust towards healthcare providers.

Here, we demonstrate that TMPRSS2 is able to cleave H2-HA in cell culture and that Tmprss2(?/?) mice are resistant to infection with a re-assorted PR8_HA(H2) virus. Infection of KO mice did not cause major body weight loss or death. Furthermore, no significant increase in lung weights and no virus replication were observed in Tmprss2(?/?) mice. Finally, only minor tissue damage and infiltration of immune cells were detected and no virus-positive cells were found in histological sections of Tmprss2(?/?) mice.

Worldwide concerted effort to identify viral genomic changes across different sub-types has identified several strong changes in the coding region. However, there have not been many studies focusing on the variations in the 5' and 3' untranslated regions and their consequences. Considering the possible importance of these regions in host mediated regulation of viral RNA genome, we wanted to explore the phenomenon. METHODS: To have an idea of the global changes in 5' and 3'-UTR sequences, we downloaded 8595 complete and high-coverage SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence information from human host in FASTA format from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) from 15 different geographical regions. Next, we aligned them using Clustal Omega software and investigated the UTR variants. We also looked at the putative host RNA binding protein (RBP) and microRNA binding sites in these regions by 'RBPmap' and 'RNA22 v2' respectively. Expression status of selected RBPs and microRNAs were checked in lungs tissue. RESULTS: We identified 28 unique variants in SARS-CoV-2 UTR region based on a minimum variant percentage cut-off of 0.5. Along with 241C>T change the important 5'-UTR change identified was 187A>G, while 29734G>C, 29742G>A/T and 29774C>T were the most familiar variants of 3'UTR among most of the continents. Furthermore, we found that despite the variations in the UTR regions, binding of host RBP to them remains mostly unaltered, which further influenced the functioning of specific miRNAs. CONCLUSION: Our results, shows for the first time in SARS-Cov-2 infection, a possible cross-talk between host RBPs-miRNAs and viral UTR variants, which ultimately could explain the mechanism of escaping host RNA decay machinery by the virus. The knowledge might be helpful in developing anti-viral compounds in future.","output":"Global cataloguing of variations in untranslated regions of viral genome and prediction of key host RNA binding protein-microRNA interactions modulating genome stability in SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the recent decades, social work has undergone quite extensive process of digitisation.

However, the relevance of these investigations with respect to understanding MCAs' chemistry appears often vague. Here, we discuss how insights into the electronic structure obtained from negative ion photoelectron spectroscopy (NIPES) combined with theoretical calculations and collision-induced dissociation can provide a fundamental understanding of the intrinsic chemical reactivity of MCAs and their fragments. This is exemplified in our studies on polyhedral closo-borate dianions [BnXn]2- (n = 6, 10, 11, 12; X = H, F-I, CN) and their fragment ions. For example, the rational design of closo-borate dianions with specific electronic properties is described, which leads to generating highly reactive fragments. Depending on the dianionic precursor, these fragments are tuned to either bind noble gases effectively or activate small molecules like CO and N2. The intrinsic electronic properties of closo-borate dianions are further compared to their electrochemistry in solutions, revealing solvent effects on the redox potentials. Neutral host molecules such as cyclodextrins are found to bind strongly to [BnXn]2-, and gas phase NIPES provides insights into the intrinsic host-guest interactions. Finally, outlooks including the direct NIPES of molecular fragment ions that cannot be generated in the condensed phase and their utilization in preparative mass spectrometry are discussed.","output":"Measuring Electronic Structure of Multiply Charged Anions to Understand Their Chemistry: A Case Study on Gaseous Polyhedral closo-Borate Dianions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic resulted in dramatic changes to avoid virus spread. In Canada, following provincial legislation the Workers Compensation Board of Alberta (WCB-Alberta) stopped in-person rehabilitation services on March 23, 2020. On April 1, training began on remote service delivery using videoconferencing or telerehabilitation, which started April 3. We studied WCB-Albertas transition to remote rehabilitation service delivery. Methods A population-based descriptive study was conducted, with data extracted from the WCB-Alberta database. This included clinical data from rehabilitation providers. We included workers completing services between January 1 and May 31, 2020. We statistically examined differences before and after the transition to remote services. Results The dataset included 4,516 individuals with work-related injuries. The mean number of work assessments per week pre-COVID was 244.6 (SD 83.5), which reduced to 135.9 (SD 74.5). Workers undergoing remote assessments were significantly more likely to work in health care or trades, did not require an interpreter, and were less likely to be working or judged as ready to return to work. Number of completed rehabilitation programs also reduced from 125.6 to 40.8 per week, with most (67.1%) remote programs being functional restoration. Few adverse effects were observed. Conclusions We describe the transition to completely remote delivery of occupational rehabilitation due to COVID-19 physical distancing restrictions in one Canadian compensation jurisdiction. It appears the use of remote services was successful but proceeded cautiously, with fewer complex cases being referred for assessment or rehabilitation.

In this study, we collected 36 paired sera samples from 36 healthy volunteers before and after immunization with inactivated whole-virion SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for COVID-19, and analyzed the distribution and intensity of pre-existing antibody responses at the epitope level pre-vaccination as well as the relationship between pre-existing sCoV immunity and vaccine-induced neutralization. We observed large amounts of pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies in the conserved regions among sCoVs, especially the S2 subunit. Excep t for a few peptides, the IgG and IgM fluorescence intensities against S, M and N peptides did not differ significantly between pre-vaccination and post-vaccination sera of vaccinees who developed a neutralization inhibition rate (%inhibition) <40 and %inhibition 40 after two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. Participants with strong and weak pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies (strong pre-CRA; weak pre-CRA) had similar %inhibition pre-vaccination (10.9%  2.9% vs. 12.0%  2.2%, P=0.990) and post-vaccination (43.8%  25.1% vs. 44.6%  21.5%, P=0.997). Overall, the strong pre-CRA group did not show a significantly greater increase in antibody responses to the S protein linear peptides post-vaccination compared with the weak pre-CRA group. Therefore, we found no evidence for a significant impact of pre-existing antibody responses on inactivated vaccine-induced neutralization and antibody responses. Our research provides an important basis for inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine use in the context of high sCoV seroprevalence.","output":"Pre-Existing Cross-Reactive Antibody Responses Do Not Significantly Impact Inactivated COVID-19 Vaccine-Induced Neutralization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, medical providers have expanded telehealth into daily practice, with many medical and behavioral health care visits provided remotely over video or through phone.

The present study collected data in June-July 2020 to describe childrens mental health during the initial phase of the pandemic, including the magnitude and nature of psychiatric and psychological distress in children, and to evaluate social support as a putative psychosocial moderator of childrens increased distress. Method: Children and parents from 190 families of children aged 8 to 13 from the Windsor-Essex region of Southwestern Ontario reported (i) retrospectively on childrens well-being (e.g., worry, happiness) immediately prior to the pandemic and (ii) on childrens current well-being;irritability;social support;and anxiety, depressive, and posttraumatic stress symptoms at the baseline assessment of an ongoing longitudinal study of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Children and parents reported worsened well-being and psychological distress during the pandemic compared to retrospective report of pre-pandemic well-being. Child-perceived social support from family and friends was associated with lower symptom severity and attenuated increase in psychological distress. Conclusions: Study findings suggest possible broad psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and are consistent with prior research that indicates a protective role of social support to mitigate the negative psychological impact of the pandemic.

MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross-sectional seroepidemiological survey was developed after the peak of the first epidemic wave on a sample of 2301 Portuguese residents, aged 1 year or older. Survey sample was selected using a two-stage stratified non-probability sampling design (quota sampling). SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G antibodies were measured in serum samples by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Seroprevalence estimates of immunoglobulin M and/or immunoglobulin G and 95% confidence intervals were stratified by sex, age group, health region and education. RESULTS Overall, seroprevalence was 2.9% (95% confidence interval: 2.0% - 4.2%). Higher prevalence rates were observed in male (4.1%, 95% confidence interval: 2.6% - 6.6%) and those with secondary education (6.4%, 95% confidence interval: 3.2% - 12.5%). Differences in seroprevalence by age group and region were not statistically significant. DISCUSSION The estimated seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was higher than the cumulative incidence reported by the National Surveillance System but far from necessary to reach herd immunity. CONCLUSION Our results support limited extent of infection by SARS-CoV-2 in the study population possibly due to early lockdown measures implemented in Portugal and support the need to continue monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in order to increase our knowledge about the evolution of the epidemic and to estimate the proportion of the susceptible population over time.","output":"Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Portugal in May-July 2020: Results of the First National Serological Survey (ISNCOVID-19)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The current coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on all physicians and has resulted in dramatic changes to clinical and research operations. No study has yet looked at the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on the surgical research community. In this study, we sought to understand the impact of the pandemic and its associated restrictions on academic surgeons. METHODS: We surveyed members of the Association for Academic Surgery and the Society of University Surgeons. Survey questions included demographics, current challenges to basic and clinical research activities, attitudes toward remote work and productivity maintenance, and the solutions implemented to maintain productivity. RESULTS: Of 301 respondents, 70% cited a negative impact on research productivity due to mandatory building shutdowns, minimized personnel as a result of social distancing, and suspensions of animal work and clinical trials, with senior faculty and division chiefs and chairs more likely to report a negative impact (P = .001). Only 11% of respondents are documenting their financial losses, and only 19% indicated they received appropriate guidance regarding why and how to monitor the financial impact of the pandemic. Researchers have attempted to maintain research productivity through a focus on remote work, including manuscript writing, grant writing, and data analysis. Some participants have found silver linings, including more time to dedicate to research and family as a result of fewer clinical duties. CONCLUSION: Productivity strategies developed during the pandemic, including writing, remote work and meetings, and structured scheduling, are lessons that will allow the surgical research community to be resilient in the face of future disruptions.","output":"Impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on surgical research and lessons for the future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral fusogenic envelope proteins are important targets for the development of inhibitors of viral entry.

Despite the number of the studies reported to date, the causative agents of pneumonia are not completely known. Herein, we found by molecular technique that vegetable and tobacco DNA may be detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage from patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the present study, we studied bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from patients admitted to ICUs with ventilator-associated pneumonia. BAL fluids were assessed with molecular tests, culture and blood culture. We successfully identified plant DNA in six patients out of 106 (6%) with ventilator-associated pneumonia. Inhalation was confirmed in four cases and suspected in the other two cases. Inhalation was significantly frequent in patients with plant DNA (four out of six patients) than those without plant DNA (three out of 100 patients) (P<0.001). Nicotiana tabacum chloroplast DNA was identified in three patients who were smokers (cases 2, 3 and 6). Cucurbita pepo, Morus bombycis and Triticum aestivum DNA were identified in cases 1, 4 and 5 respectively. Twenty-three different bacterial species, two viruses and five fungal species were identified from among these six patients by using molecular and culture techniques. Several of the pathogenic microorganisms identified are reported to be food-borne or tobacco plant-associated pathogens. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study shows that plants DNA may be identified in the BAL fluid of pneumonia patients, especially when exploring aspiration pneumonia, but the significance of the presence of plant DNA and its role in the pathogenesis of pneumonia is unknown and remains to be investigated.

Here, we analyze molecular-dynamics motions of three FSE conformations, discovered by graph-theory analysis, and associated mutants designed by graph-based inverse folding: two distinct 3-stem H-type pseudoknots and a 3-way junction. We find that the prevalent H-type pseudoknot in literature adopts ring-like conformations, which in combination with 5 end threading could promote ribosomal pausing. An inherent shape switch from L to linear that may help trigger the frameshifting is suppressed in our designed mutant. The alternative conformation trajectories suggest a stable intermediate structure with mixed stem interactions of all three conformations, pointing to a possible transition pathway during ribosomal translation.

CASE REPORT: This is a case report of a previously healthy patient who underwent septorhinoplasty in 2018. She had frequent follow-up including intranasal examinations without evidence of the septal perforation for the 2 years following her operation. In March 2020, the patient was noted to have symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, but testing was not recommended by the pediatrician. Soon after her symptoms resolved, she experienced a sudden onset of whistling and physical examination revealed a perforation in the septum which rapidly enlarged over the ensuing weeks.

There was no difference of the hBoV load in NPA between children with or without known coinfection, but the load was significantly higher in children with bronchitis than in children with the diagnosis of febrile seizures. hBoV DNA was found in 1 of 10 serum samples and in 14 of 31 stool samples. hBoV sequence identity was >99% in the VP2 region. In conclusion, hBoV DNA can be found in NPA samples at very high titers. In addition to being found in the respiratory tract, hBoV was found in stool samples. The clinical relevance of these findings remains to be determined.","output":"Real-time PCR for diagnosis of human bocavirus infections and phylogenetic analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Latex, a sticky emulsion produced by specialized cells called laticifers, is a crucial part of a plants defense system against herbivory and pathogens.

The pandemic impacts on human behavior, emotions, and cognition, leading to diverse reactions in relation to awareness of the disease. However, there is little understanding around the psychological impacts of the pandemic and strategies to overcome this impact. This study aimed to examine individuals reactions toward the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to their psychological hardiness, their degree of awareness toward the pandemic, and precautionary measures taken. Individuals living in Saudi Arabia were invited to complete an online questionnaire which included demographic items, psychological responses to the pandemic, awareness of COVID-19, and measures of psychological hardiness. A total of 1272 individuals were recruited into the study, with the majority being female (85%). Results indicated that the average psychological responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in the study sample were 75.85%.

This review summarizes the latest mechanistic insights on RBC clearance in different contexts; during homeostatic removal, immune-mediated destruction, and systemic inflammation. RECENT FINDINGS Besides the recognition of a variety of potential 'eat me' signals on RBCs, recent evidence suggests that normal RBC degradation is driven by the increase of the adhesive properties of RBCs, mediating the retention in the spleen and leading to RBC hemolysis. Furthermore, immune-mediated degradation of RBCs seems to be fine-tuned by the balance between the density of the antigens expressed on RBCs and the presence of 'don't eat me' signals. Moreover, besides RBC clearance by macrophages, neutrophils seem to play a much more prominent role in immune-mediated RBC removal than anticipated. Lastly, RBC clearance during systemic inflammation appears to be driven by a combination of extreme macrophage activity in response to proinflammatory cytokines as well as direct damage of RBC by the inflammation or inflammatory agent.

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms and HPV infection and associated risk factors in a group of women assisted in the public health system of southwestern Paran, Brazil. METHODS AND RESULTS: A caseCcontrol study was designed with 21 women with HPV matched by age in the case group and 84 women without the virus in the control group. Viral detection was conducted via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotyping by Multiplex PCR. The results showed that the GSTT1 null allele was a protective factor against infection (OR(adj) 0.219; 95% CI 0.078C0.618; p = 0.004). No relationship was observed for the GSTM1 gene. Smoking was defined as a risk factor (OR(adj) 3.678; 95% CI 1.111C12.171; p = 0.033), increasing the chances of HPV by up to 3.6 times.

While intact TBK1 signaling is required for successful anti-viral signaling, dysregulated TBK1 signaling has been linked to a variety of pathophysiologic conditions, including cancer. Several lines of evidence support a role for TBK1 in cancer pathogenesis, but the specific roles and regulation of TBK1 remain incompletely understood. A key challenge is the diversity of cellular processes that are regulated by TBK1, including inflammation, cell cycle, autophagy, energy homeostasis, and cell death. Nevertheless, evidence from pre-clinical cancer models suggest that targeting TBK1 may be an effective strategy for anti-cancer therapy in specific settings. AREAS COVERED This review provides an overview of the roles and regulation of TBK1 with a focus on cancer pathogenesis and drug targeting of TBK1 as an anti-cancer strategy. Relevant literature was derived from a PubMed search encompassing studies from 1999 to 2020. EXPERT OPINION TBK1 is emerging as a potential target for anti-cancer therapy. Inhibition of TBK1 alone may be insufficient to restrain the growth of most cancers, hence combination strategies will likely be necessary. Improved understanding of tumor-intrinsic and tumor-extrinsic TBK1 signaling will inform novel therapeutic strategies.","output":"Targeting TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) in cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Many people who experience a disaster will do so as part of an occupational group, either by chance or due to the nature of their role.

Vaccines are ideal solutions to prevent infection, but treatments are also needed for those who have contracted the virus to limit negative outcomes, when vaccines are not applicable. Viruses must cross host cell membranes during their lifecycle, creating a dependency on processes involving membrane dynamics. Thus, in this study we examined whether the synthetic machinery for glycosphingolipids, biologically active components of cell membranes, can serve as a therapeutic target to combat SARS-CoV-2. We examined the antiviral effect of two specific inhibitors of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS); (i) Genz-123346, an analogue of the FDA-approved drug Cerdelga?, and (ii) GENZ-667161, an analogue of venglustat which is currently under phase III clinical trials. We found that both GCS inhibitors inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, these inhibitors also disrupt replication of influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (H1N1).

METHODS Longitudinal cohort study. We included 245 adult patients monitored with an ICM indicated for the investigation of syncope. The records from days 1 to 12 March 2020 (prior to the institution of lockdown by the state government) with days 16 to 28 March 2020 were compared. RESULTS Daily physical exercise reduced markedly after the imposition of lockdown (132 [55-233] minutes vs. 78 [21-154] minutes). The mean daytime HR prior to lockdown was 77 [69-85] bpm, whereas during lockdown it was 74 [66-81] bpm. During the lockdown period, a drop in the variability in heart rate (114 [94-136] ms vs. 111 [92-133] ms) was observed. Although the incidence of AF was similar over both periods, the daily AF burden was significantly higher post-lockdown (405 [391-425] minutes vs. 423 [423-537] minutes). No differences in the number of other arrhythmias were found. CONCLUSIONS The establishment of mandatory lockdown has led to a marked drop in daily physical activity in this population which probably explains changes observed in other cardiac biometric variables. Although, in the short term, we have not documented an increased risk of arrhythmia, we cannot rule out an effect in the medium to long term or in other populations of at-risk patients.","output":"Cardiac biometric variables and arrhythmic events during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in patients with an implantable cardiac monitor for syncope work-up."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Brazil has the second highest number of deaths due to COVID-19 Obesity has been associated with an important role in disease development and a worse prognosis We aimed to explore epidemiological data from Brazil, discussing the potential relationships between obesity and COVID-19 severity in this country We used a public database made available by the Ministry of Health of Brazil (182700 patients diagnosed with COVID-19) Descriptive statistics were used to characterize our database Continuous data were expressed as median and analyzed by the nonparametric tests MannCWhitney or one-sample Wilcoxon The frequencies of categorical variables have been analyzed by chi-square tests of independence or goodness-of-fit Among the number of deaths, 74% of patients were 60 years of age or older Patients with obesity who died of COVID-19 were younger (59 years (IQR = 23)) than those without obesity (71 years (IQR = 20), P &lt; 0 001 , and 2 = 0 0424) Women with obesity who died of COVID-19 were older than men (55 years (IQR = 25) vs 50 (IQR = 22), P &lt; 0 001 , and 2 = 0 0263) Furthermore, obesity increases the chances of needing intensive care unit (OR: 1 783, CI: 95%, and P &lt; 0 001), needing ventilatory support (OR: 1 537, CI: 95%, and P &lt; 0 001 and OR: 2 302, CI: 95%, and P &lt; 0 001 , for noninvasive and invasive, respectively), and death (OR: 1 411, CI: 95%, and P &lt; 0 001) of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 Our analysis supports obesity as a significant risk factor for the development of more severe forms of COVID-19 The present study can direct a more effective prevention campaign and appropriate management of subjects with obesity [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of International Journal of Endocrinology is the property of Hindawi Limited and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"COVID-19 and Obesity: An Epidemiologic Analysis of the Brazilian Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: West Nile (WNV) and Usutu (USUV) are emerging vector-borne zoonotic flaviviruses. They are antigenically very similar, sharing the same life cycle with birds as amplification host, Culicidae as vector, and man/horse as dead-end host. They can co-circulate in an overlapping geographic range. In Europe, surveillance plans annually detect several outbreaks. METHODS: In Italy, a WNV/USUV surveillance plan is in place through passive and active surveillance. After a 2018 WNV outbreak, a reinforced integrated risk-based surveillance was performed in four municipalities through clinical and serological surveillance in horses, Culicidae catches, and testing on human blood-based products for transfusion. RESULTS: Eight WNV cases in eight equine holdings were detected. Twenty-three mosquitoe catches were performed and 2367 specimens of Culex pipiens caught; 17 pools were USUV positive. A total of 8889 human blood donations were tested, and two asymptomatic donors were USUV positive. CONCLUSIONS: Different surveillance components simultaneously detected WNV only in horses and USUV only in humans and mosquitoes. While in endemic areas (i.e. northern Italy) entomological surveillance is successfully used as an early detection warning, this method in central Italy seems ineffective. To achieve a high level of sensitivity, the entomological trapping effort should probably exceed a reasonable balance between cost and performance. Besides, WNV/USUV early detection can be addressed by horses and birds. Further research is needed to adapt the surveillance components in different epidemiological contexts.

We sought to investigate pulmonary hemodynamics and ventilation properties in patients with CARDS compared to patients with ARDS of pulmonary origin. Methods: : Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of consecutive adults with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 patients treated on our ICU in 04/2020 and comparison of the data to matched controls with ARDS due to respiratory infections treated on our ICU from 01/2014 to 08/2019 and for whom pulmonary artery catheter data were available. Results: : CARDS patients (n = 10) had similar ventilation characteristics as compared to ARDS (n = 10) patients. Still, mechanical power applied by ventilation was significantly higher in CARDS patients (23.4  8.9 J/min) than in ARDS (15.9  4.3 J/min;p<0.05). COVID-19 patients had similar pulmonary artery pressure but significantly lower pulmonary vascular resistance, as cardiac output was higher in CARDS vs. ARDS patients (p<0.05). Shunt fraction and dead space were similar in CARDS compared to ARDS (p>0.05) and was in both groups correlated with hypoxemia.

Here, we used TPP on whole zebrafish embryo lysate to identify protein targets of napabucasin, a compound that may affect signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) signaling through an ill-understood mechanism. In zebrafish embryos, napabucasin induced developmental defects consistent with inhibition of Stat3 signaling. TPP profiling showed no distinct shift in Stat3 upon napabucasin treatment, but effects were detected on the oxidoreductase, Pora, which might explain effects on Stat3 signaling. Interestingly, thermal stability of several aldehyde dehydrogenases was affected. Moreover, napabucasin activated aldehyde dehydrogenase enzymatic activity in vitro. Aldehyde dehydrogenases have crucial roles in retinoic acid metabolism, and functionally, we validated napabucasin-mediated activation of the retinoic acid pathway in zebrafish in vivo.

Although it will differ from country to country, the return to sport for professional football players will follow a forced lockdown never experienced and longer than the normal annual season break.

In fact, preseason is always a period with a specific football injury epidemiology, with an increase in the incidence and prevalence of overuse injuries. Therefore, it seems appropriate to recommend that specific training and injury prevention programmes be developed, with careful load monitoring. Training sessions should include specific aerobic, resistance, speed and flexibility training programmes.

Studies have shown that COVID-19 patients are predisposed to develop secondary infections. This study was conducted to ascertain the prevalence and profiles of co- & secondary infections in patients at the COVID-19 facility in North India. METHODS: We studied the profile of pathogens isolated from 290 clinical samples. Bacterial and fungal pathogens were identified, and antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the Vitek2? system. Additionally, respiratory samples were tested for any viral/atypical bacterial co-infections and the presence of AMR genes by FilmArray test. The clinical and outcome data of these patients were also recorded for demographic and outcome measures analyses. RESULTS: A total of 151 (13%) patients had secondary infections, and most got infected within the first 14 days of hospital admission. Patients aged >50 years developed severe symptoms (pa?=a?0.0004) and/or had a fatal outcome (pa?=a?0.0005). In-hospital mortality was 33%.K.pneumoniae (33.3%) was the predominant pathogen, followed by A. baumannii (27.1%). The overall resistance was up to 84%.Majority of the organisms were multidrug-resistant (MDR) harbouring MDR genes. CONCLUSION: A high rate of secondary infections with resistant pathogens in COVID-19 patients highlights the importance of antimicrobial stewardship programs focussing on supporting the optimal selection of empiric treatment and rapid-de-escalation, based on culture reports.","output":"Profile of co-infections & secondary infections in COVID-19 patients at a dedicated COVID-19 facility of a tertiary care Indian hospital: Implication on antimicrobial resistance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As COVID-19 makes its way around the globe, each nation must decide when and how to respond. Yet many knowledge gaps persist, and many countries lack the capacity to develop complex models to assess risk and response. This paper aimed to meet this need by developing a model that uses case reporting data as input and provides a four-tiered risk assessment output. METHODS: We used publicly available, country/territory level case reporting data to determine median seeding number, mean seeding time (ST), and several measures of mean doubling time (DT) for COVID-19. We then structured our model as a coordinate plane with ST on the x-axis, DT on the y-axis, and mean ST and mean DT dividing the plane into four quadrants, each assigned a risk level. Sensitivity analysis was performed and countries/territories early in their outbreaks were assessed for risk. RESULTS: Our main finding was that among 45 countries/territories evaluated, 87% were at high risk for their outbreaks entering a rapid growth phase epidemic. We furthermore found that the model was sensitive to changes in DT, and that these changes were consistent with what is officially known of cases reported and control strategies implemented in those countries. CONCLUSIONS: Our main finding is that the ST/DT Model can be used to produce meaningful assessments of the risk of escalation in country/territory-level COVID-19 epidemics using only case reporting data. Our model can help support timely, decisive action at the national level as leaders and other decision makers face of the serious public health threat that is COVID-19.","output":"COVID-19 seeding time and doubling time model: an early epidemic risk assessment tool"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background COVID-19 triggered an unprecedented crisis affecting our society at every level.

Aims To determine the impact of COVID-19 in paediatric and congenital cardiology clinical research and to analyse decision-making and adaptation processes, from a panel of on-going academic and industry-sponsored research at the time of the pandemic. Methods This observational study was carried out in April 2020, from a CHD clinical research network involving five tertiary care paediatric and congenital cardiology centres. Investigators and clinical research assistants from each participating research centre filled in an online survey questionnaire, and each principal investigator underwent a one-hour web-based videoconference interview. Results From a total of 34 study questionnaires and 288 enrolled patients at the time of the pandemic, 18 studies were declared as totally suspended. Upon investigator's decision, after discussion on ethical issues and with facilitating support from health authorities, 16 studies were resumed. The rate of study suspension in interventional research (53%) was similar to non-interventional research (56%). Logistical problems were predominantly reported in both continued and suspended trials. Research protocols were adapted, largely thanks to telemedicine, which in some cases even improved the course of the study.

Since it is a novel virus, research continues to update the possible therapeutic targets when new evidence regarding COVID-19 are gathered. This article presents an evidence-based hypothesis that activating the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway is a potential target for COVID-19. Interferons (IFNs) have broad-spectrum antiviral activity including against SARS-CoV-2. Induction of HO-1 and increase in the heme catabolism end-product confer antiviral activity. IFN activation-results in inhibition of viral replication in various viral infections. COVID-19 induces inflammation as well as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and coagulopathies are now known major causes of mortality. A protective role of HO-1 induction in inflammation, inflammation-induced coagulation, and ARDS has been reported. Based on an association of HO-1 promoter polymorphisms and disease severity, we propose an evaluation of the status of these polymorphisms in COVID-19 patients who become severely ill. If an association is established, it might be helpful in identifying patients at high risk. Hence, we hypothesize that HO-1 pathway activation could be a therapeutic strategy against COVID-19 and associated complications.","output":"Heme oxygenase-1 modulation: a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19 and associated complications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, the whole world is fighting a very dangerous and infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus, called COVID-19.

However, the current solution for detecting COVID-19 cases including the PCR test, CT images, epidemiologically history, and clinical symptoms suffer from high false positive. To overcome this problem, we have developed a novel transfer deep learning approach for detecting COVID-19 based on x-ray images.

An alternative algorithm adapted to the intensive care unit (ICU) population has been proposed (AspICU), but this algorithm did not include microbial biomarkers such as the galactomannan antigen and the Aspergillus quantitative PCR. The objective of the present pilot study was to evaluate a new algorithm that includes fungal biomarkers (BM-AspICU) for the diagnosis of probable IPA in an ICU population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from 35 patients with pathology-proven IPA according to European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycosis Study Group (EORTC/MSGERC)-2008 criteria were extracted from the French multicenter database of the Invasive Fungal Infections Surveillance Network (RESSIF). The patients were investigated according to the AspICU algorithm, and the BM-AspICU algorithm in analyzing the clinical, imaging, and biomarker data available in the records, without taking into account the pathology findings. RESULTS: Eight patients had to be excluded because no imaging data were recorded in the database. Among the 27 proven IPAs with complete data, 16 would have been considered as putative IPA with the AspICU algorithm and 24 would have been considered as probable IPA using the new algorithm BM-AspICU. Seven out of the 8 patients with probable BM-AspICU IPA (and not classified with the AspICU algorithm) had no host factors and no Aspergillus-positive broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) culture. Three patients were non-classifiable with any of the two algorithms, because they did not have any microbial criteria during the course of the infection, and diagnosis of proven aspergillosis was done using autopsy samples. CONCLUSION: Inclusion of biomarkers could be effective to identify probable IPA in the ICU population.

METHODS Impact on AMS: The analysis of the impact on AMS was based on a comparison of the impact of the project on management and coordination of Emergency Medical Teams (EMTs), and application of the project outcome in actual emergency operations compared to the previous status in each AMS.Impact on Japan: The history of the development of disaster medicine in Japan was reviewed, with an aim to analyze the impact of supporting AMS through the ARCH Project on Japan, and the possibility of bi-directional cooperation in the future. RESULTS Impact on AMS: Since the initiation of the ARCH Project, AMS has made significant progress in WHO EMT accreditation, strengthening EMTCC capacity for receiving international assistance, as well as the development of legislation or strategic plans related to DHM, and application of the Project products such as standard operating procedures or regional tools in actual disasters/emergencies.Impact on Japan: Disaster medicine in Japan originated from the Cambodian refugees' relief mission in 1979. Since then, the management system has been strengthened including the foundation of the Japan Disaster Relief (JDR) Team, a structure with a legal foundation. The experience gained through international operations has contributed to the development of Japan's domestic disaster response system. Japan learned the operational effectiveness of the post-disaster health surveillance system through the disaster response operation in 2013 Typhoon Yolanda Disaster in Philippines and introduced a modified system in Japan for domestic disaster response, which was later refined and proposed for an international standard. CONCLUSION ARCH Project is highly appreciated by AMS as the opportunity to share knowledge and experience among countries and thereby contributing to achieving the \\"One ASEAN, One Response\\" concept, as well as the driving force for each AMS to develop its capacity in DHM. While the ARCH Project started to support AMS to strengthen its regional capacity in disaster health management, it is important to build a bi-directional relationship between ASEAN and Japan in terms of mutual learning and support to tackle future disasters.","output":"Impact of the ARCH Project on National Capacity Development on Disaster Health Management among the ASEAN Member States and Japan."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Charlotte Scanlan talks about giving birth during COVID-19, \\"Staff were incredible at making me feel as supported as possible despite the circumstances\\" As a midwife, I knew that when I finally conceived my first child through IVF I could face some challenges during pregnancy Attending a hospital where there were confirmed cases of the virus at a time when I was not supposed to even visit a supermarket was often a frightening prospect - particularly when having to do so alone When home, I had some difficulties breastfeeding and accessed Home-Start support","output":"Not alone"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a recently emerged infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus, which has been designated the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV).

However, RT-PCR assays currently available have low sensitivity during the early stage of the disease in which the viral load in specimens is very low. A method for concentrating and purifying SARS-CoV RNA by a magnetic bead capture system was developed and followed by an RT-PCR assay in this study with the goal of improving the sensitivity of the RT-PCR method. This approach takes advantage of the cooperative interaction between adjacently hybridized oligonucleotides. A capture probe was covalently coupled to magnetic beads and a second probe, which anneals adjacent to the capture probe site, was prehybridized in solution to the target. It was shown that, when applied to SARS RNA samples, the sensitivity of nucleic acid capture RTPCR was about 10-fold greater than routine RT-PCR. This nucleic acid capture system was effective in improving the sensitivity of the RT-PCR, due to enriching and purifying SARS-CoV RNA.

Using the lockdown in spring 2020 as a naturalistic context to study consumer responses to restrictions of choice freedom, results of an online study in Austria support these predictions. These findings advance a view of maximizers as \\"lay existentialists,\\" who view choice as a meaning-making device that is tightly linked to their sense of identity.

METHODS: To conduct this systematic review and meta-analysis, Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and CINAHL databases were searched using pre-specified search strategies. Further searches were conducted using the reference list of the selected studies, renowned preprint servers (eg, medRxiv, bioRxiv, SSRN), and relevant journals websites. Studies written in the English language included if those were conducted among COVID-19 patients with and without comorbidities and presented survivor vs non-survivor counts or hazard/odds of deaths or survivors with types of pre-existing comorbidities. Comorbidities reported in the selected studies were grouped into eight categories. The pooled likelihoods of deaths in each category were estimated using a fixed or random-effect model, based on the heterogeneity assessment. Publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of the funnel plot asymmetry and Eggers regression test. Trim and Fill method was used if there any publication bias was found. RESULTS: A total of 41 studies included in this study comprised of 27 670 samples. The most common pre-existing comorbidities in COVID-19 patients were hypertension (39.5%), cardiovascular disease (12.4%), and diabetes (25.2%). The higher likelihood of deaths was found among COVID-19 patients who had pre-existing cardiovascular diseases (odds ratio (OR) = 3.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.86-4.09), immune and metabolic disorders (OR = 2.46, 95% CI = 2.03-2.85), respiratory diseases (OR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.72-2.19), cerebrovascular diseases (OR = 4.12, 95% CI = 3.04-5.58), any types of cancers (OR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.63-3.03), renal (OR = 3.02, 95% CI = 2.60-3.51), and liver diseases (OR = 2.35, 95% CI = 1.50-3.69).

To qualitatively evaluate participants experience with and perceptions of a genetic education program as an adjunct to genetic counseling, we conducted direct observations of the intervention, semi-structured in person interviews with 11 women who viewed CREdIT, and post-counseling questionnaires with the two participating genetic counselors. Five themes emerged from the analysis of interviews: (1) genetic counseling and testing for breast/ovarian cancer was a new concept; (2) CREdITs story format was particularly appealing; (3) changes in participants perceived risk for breast cancer varied; (4) some misunderstandings about individual risk and heredity persisted after CREdIT and counseling; (5) the context for viewing CREdIT shaped responses to the presentation. Observations demonstrated ways to make the information provided in CREdIT and by genetic counselors more consistent. In a post-session counselor questionnaire, counselors rating of the patients preparedness before the session was significantly higher for patients who viewed CREdIT prior to their appointments than for other patients. This novel educational tool fills a gap in HBOC education by tailoring information to women of lower literacy and diverse ethnic/racial backgrounds.

METHODS: Spatial analysis was applied for detecting TB clusters on county-based TB notification data in the national notifiable infectious disease case reporting surveillance system from 2005 to 2011. Two indicators of TB epidemic were used including new sputum smear-positive (SS+) notification rate and total TB notification rate. Global Morans I by ArcGIS was used to assess whether TB clustering and its trend were significant. SaTScan software that used the retrospective space-time analysis and Possion probability model was utilized to identify geographic areas and time period of potential clusters with notification rates on county-level from 2005 to 2011. RESULTS: Two indicators of TB notification had presented significant spatial autocorrelation globally each year (p<0.01). Global Morans I of total TB notification rate had positive trend as time went by (t=6.87, p<0.01). The most likely clusters of two indicators had similar spatial distribution and size in the south-central regions of China from 2006 to 2008, and the secondary clusters in two regions: northeastern China and western China.

I argue that the inherent deficiencies of the educational system, starting with the structural constraints and ending with the psycho-social context in which Roma (or minoritized, marginalized, vulnerable) children learn, can be and are challenged by initiatives, strategies or processes that fall out of the immediate range of the strict framework of the educational system. Bourdieu used the Maxwells demon as a metaphor to illustrate the reproduction of socio-economic inequalities in the framework of school system. But this demon might be challenged with more or less success if we step out and look for possible tools to counteract this demon. Two such cases are presented in this chapter. One is a project implemented with and by the local Roma community using external financing and the other one is the participation of the members of the communities in international migration and use of remittances. I will emphasize that independently of the type and amount of the mobilized resources the individuals and/or communities are able to create and proactively make good use of path-departing opportunities through mechanisms of redefining and changing contextual constraints thus improvements can be observed in the school participation of the Roma children (PS.

To accommodate a large infected population, copious wards are to be built within the prevalent constraints of land, power and material availability. This study designs a two-bed modular healthcare ward which is shrunk in size to minimize the requirement of space and other construction commodities such as materials, labour and power. Additionally, HVAC energy usage is accounted for conservation. The health safety and thermal comfort of occupants are regulated by monitoring indoor environment attributes while pushing towards a resource-efficient structure. Two popular envelope thermal retrofits viz. phase change material and thermal insulation are tested to conceive gains in terms of improved energy performance of the ward. Various ward designs contest with their energy performance and occupant's health safety and comfort characteristics in a multicriteria decision making process for delivering the most favourable solution. Subsequently, the most suitable solution is offered by a design involving thermal insulation retrofit with 8 ACH fresh air supply rate and 26 C inlet air temperature.

This raises questions about what matters most to patients living with this disease. This study aimed to understand which characteristics MM patients find most important, and hence should be included as attributes and levels in a subsequent quantitative preference survey among MM patients. Methods: This qualitative study involved: (i) a scoping literature review, (ii) discussions with MM patients (n = 24) in Belgium, Finland, Romania, and Spain using Nominal Group Technique, (iii) a qualitative thematic analysis including multi-stakeholder discussions. Results: MM patients voiced significant expectations and hopes that treatments would extend their lives and reduce their cancer signs and symptoms. Participants however raised concerns about life-threatening side-effects that could cause permanent organ damage. Bone fractures and debilitating neuropathic effects (such as chronic tingling sensations) were highlighted as major issues reducing patients' independence and mobility. Patients discussed the negative impact of the following symptoms and side-effects on their daily activities: thinking problems, increased susceptibility to infections, reduced energy, pain, emotional problems, and vision problems. MM patients were concerned with uncertainties regarding the durability of positive treatment outcomes, and the cause, severity, and duration of their symptoms and side-effects. Patients feared short-term positive treatment responses complicated by permanent, severe side-effects and symptoms. Conclusions: This study gained an in-depth understanding of the treatment and disease-related characteristics and types of attribute levels (severity, duration) that are most important to MM patients. Results from this study argue in favor of MM drug development and individual treatment decision-making that focuses not only on extending patients' lives but also on addressing those symptoms and side-effects that significantly impact MM patients' quality of life. This study underscores a need for transparent communication toward MM patients about MM treatment outcomes and uncertainties regarding their long-term efficacy and safety. Finally, this study may help drug developers and decision-makers understand which treatment outcomes and uncertainties are most important to MM patients and therefore should be incorporated in MM drug development, evaluation, and clinical practice.","output":"Patient Preferences for Multiple Myeloma Treatments: A Multinational Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are emerging as one of the foremost challenges in healthcare owing to its chronicity and the viruss quasispecies nature.

We rely on an online survey we administered 1 week after the beginning of the lockdown, with responses collected within 2 weeks after the beginning of the lockdown (N = 1,087). We focus on potential addictions to non-creative activities as food consumption and smartphone usage (female-related), and videogame play (male-related). We find that women were about 1.6 times more likely than men to losing control of their usual diet and about 2.3 times more likely than men to increase smartphone usage, while no significant gender effect is detected as for increased videogame play. This is since the negative emotions driving the increase of female-related non-creative activities (sadness, discouragement, and nervousness) were themselves female-related, while the negative emotions driving the increase of male-related non-creative activities (boredom, emptiness, and stress) were shared by women too. Our study supports the intuition that the same negative emotion induced by COVID-19 side-effects could lead to different potentially addictive behaviors; this difference is explained by the interplay between different genders sensitivities to such emotion and different genders preferences for specific non-creative activities.","output":"Gender Differences in the Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown on Potentially Addictive Behaviors: An Emotion-Mediated Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study was aimed to determine the association of the platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) with the disease activity of ankylosing spondylitis (AS).

AIMS: To compare two urgent dental centres with different triage and referral systems with regard to quality and appropriateness of referrals, and patient management outcomes. METHODS: 110 consecutive referrals received by a primary care urgent dental centre and a secondary care urgent dental centre were assessed. It was considered whether the patients referred had access to remote primary care dental services, fulfilled the criteria required to be deemed a dental emergency as mandated by NHS guidance, and what the outcomes of referrals were. RESULTS: At the primary care centre, 100% of patients were referred by general dental practitioners and had access to remote primary care dental services. 95.5% of referrals were deemed appropriate and were seen for treatment. At the secondary care site, 94.5% of referrals were direct from the patient by contacting NHS 111. 40% had received triaging to include 'advice, analgesia and antimicrobial' from a general dental practitioner, and 25.5% were deemed appropriate and resulted in treatment.

METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of data obtained from the DemTab study was conducted. Descriptive analyses of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics for GPs (N = 28) and PwD (N = 91) were conducted. Adherence to the German Dementia Guideline of GPs was measured at the level of PwD. Linear Mixed Models were used to analyze the associations between adherence to the German Dementia Guideline and GP factors at individual (age, years of experience as a GP, frequency of utilization of guideline, perceived usefulness of guideline) and structural (type of practice, total number of patients seen by a participating GP, and total number of PwD seen by a participating GP) levels as well as between adherence to the German Dementia Guideline and PwDs quality of life. RESULTS: Self-reported overall adherence of GPs was on average 71% (SD = 19.4, range: 25C100). Adherence to specific recommendations varied widely (from 19.2 to 95.3%) and the majority of GPs (79.1%) reported the guideline as only partially or somewhat helpful. Further, we found lower adherence to be significantly associated with higher numbers of patients (10 = ? 5.58, CI = ? 10.97, ? 0.19, p = .04). No association between adherence to the guideline and PwDs quality of life was found (10 = ?.86, CI = ? 4.18, 2.47, p = .61). CONCLUSION: The present study examined the role of adherence to the German Dementia Guideline recommendations in primary care. Overall, GPs reported high levels of adherence.

The algorithms used for species delimitation had different results on the number of potentially species-level clusters allocated. The ABGD method was less \\"sensitive\\". The tree-based approaches GMYC and PTP showed a more feasible taxonomy of the genus Micractinium, being an effective additional tool for distinguishing species.

Historically, the inability to seal vessels in the 5-7 mm range has been perceived as an inherent limitation of ultrasonic technology. The purpose of this study was to evaluate sealing of vessels up to 7 mm in diameter with an ultrasonic device that modulates energy delivery during the sealing period. METHODS In ex vivo benchtop and in vivo acute and survival preclinical models, a new ultrasonic device, Harmonic ACE(?)+7 Shears (Harmonic 7), was compared with advanced bipolar devices in sealing vessels 1-7 mm in diameter with respect of burst pressure, seal reliability, and seal durability. Lateral thermal damage and transection time were also evaluated. RESULTS Ex vivo tests of Harmonic 7 demonstrated significantly greater median burst pressures than an advanced bipolar device both for vessels <5 mm in diameter (1,078 mmHg and 836 mmHg, respectively, P=0.046) and for those in the range of 5-7 mm (1,419 mmHg and 591 mmHg, P<0.001). In vivo tests in porcine and caprine models demonstrated similar rates of hemostasis between Harmonic 7 and advanced bipolar devices, with high success rates at initial transection and seal durability of 100% after a 30-day survival period. CONCLUSION Sealing 5-7 mm vessels is not a limitation of the type of energy used but of how energy is delivered to tissue. These studies document the ability of ultrasonic energy alone to reliably seal large vessels 5-7 mm in diameter, with significantly greater burst pressure observed in in vitro studies than those observed with an advanced bipolar technology when energy delivery is modulated during the sealing cycle.

Here using mice that are deficient in type I (IFNAR1-/-), type III (IFNLR1-/-) or both (IFNAR1/LR1-/-) interferon signaling pathways and murine adapted coronavirus (MHV-A59) administered through intranasal route, we define the role of interferons in coronavirus infection. We show that type I interferons play a major role in host survival in this model while a minimal role of type III interferons was manifested only in the absence of type I interferons or during a lethal dose of coronavirus. IFNAR1-/- and IFNAR1/LR1-/- mice had an uncontrolled viral burden in the airways and lung and increased viral dissemination to other organs. The absence of only type III interferon signaling had no measurable difference in the viral load. The increased viral load in IFNAR1-/- and IFNAR1/LR1-/- mice was associated with increased tissue injury, especially evident in the lung and liver. Type I but not type III interferon treatment was able to promote survival if treated during early disease. Further, we show that type I interferon signaling in macrophages contributes to the beneficial effects during coronavirus infection in mice. Importance: The antiviral and pathological potential of type I and type III interferons during coronavirus infection remains poorly defined and opposite findings have been reported. We report that both type I and type III interferons have anti-coronaviral activities, but their potency and organ specificity differ. Type I interferons deficiency rendered the mice susceptible to even a sublethal murine coronavirus infection, while the type III interferon deficiency impaired survival only during a lethal infection or during a sublethal infection in absence of type I interferon signaling. While treatment with both type I and III interferons promoted viral clearance in the airways and lung, only type I interferons promoted the viral clearance in the liver and improved host survival upon early treatment (12 hours post infection). This study demonstrates distinct roles and potency of type I and type III interferons and their therapeutic potential during coronavirus lung infection.","output":"Distinct Roles of Type I and Type III Interferons During a Native Murine  Coronavirus Lung Infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The formulation of accurate clinical case definitions is an integral part of an effective process of public health surveillance. Although such definitions should, ideally, be based on a standardized and fixed collection of defining criteria, they often require revision to reflect new knowledge of the condition involved and improvements in diagnostic testing. Optimal case definitions also need to have a balance of sensitivity and specificity that reflects their intended use. After the 2009C2010 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) initiated a technical consultation on global influenza surveillance. This prompted improvements in the sensitivity and specificity of the case definition for influenza C i.e. a respiratory disease that lacks uniquely defining symptomology. The revision process not only modified the definition of influenza-like illness, to include a simplified list of the criteria shown to be most predictive of influenza infection, but also clarified the language used for the definition, to enhance interpretability. To capture severe cases of influenza that required hospitalization, a new case definition was also developed for severe acute respiratory infection in all age groups. The new definitions have been found to capture more cases without compromising specificity. Despite the challenge still posed in the clinical separation of influenza from other respiratory infections, the global use of the new WHO case definitions should help determine global trends in the characteristics and transmission of influenza viruses and the associated disease burden.","output":"Revision of clinical case definitions: influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Examine the association between news media use frequency during the COVID-19 pandemic and the scale of psychological distress in pregnant women, considering this distress known harmful effects on the fetus development METHOD: Pregnant women living in Quebec province (N = 1014) have been recruited in April 2020 through social media, while a state of health emergency was declared Participants were divided in 4 groups, according to self-reported frequency of news media consulting (little or none;one time a day;several times a day;constant) They filled measures of depressive symptoms, negative affects, post-traumatic stress symptoms and anxiety specific to COVID-19 Instrument scores were grouped under a unique factor of psychological distress RESULTS: An ANCOVA controlling for age, gestational age, education level, household annual revenue and a diagnosed mental disorder present at the time of participation in study shows that news media exposure frequency is significantly associated with psychological distress severity in pregnant women, during COVID-19 pandemic, F(3,998) = 27 02, p &lt; 0 001, eta2 partial = 0 08 Given the mean comparisons a posteriori, higher psychological distress rates are found as soon as news media exposure exceeds once a day (effect sizes between 0 38 and 0 81) CONCLUSIONS: The more pregnant women report consulting the news media during the COVID-19 pandemic, the more likely they are to exhibit psychological distress Results provide one of the first empirical supports to recommendations of World Health Organization, Canada government and psychiatric associations that encourage population to limit their news media consulting during the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"Association entre la frequence de consultation des medias d'information et la detresse psychologique chez les femmes enceintes durant la pandemie de COVID-19: Association between news media consulting frequency and psychological distress in pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This SHEA white paper identifies knowledge gaps and challenges in healthcare epidemiology research related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with a focus on core principles of healthcare epidemiology.

Higher transmissibility and immunologic resistance of VOCs bring unprecedented challenges to epidemic extinguishment. Here we describe a monoclonal antibody, 2G1, that neutralizes all current VOCs and has surprising tolerance to mutations adjacent to or within its interaction epitope. Cryo-electron microscopy structure showed that 2G1 bound to the tip of receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein with small contact interface but strong hydrophobic effect, which resulted in nanomolar to sub-nanomolar affinities to spike proteins. The epitope of 2G1 on RBD partially overlaps with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) interface, which enables 2G1 to block interaction between RBD and ACE2. The narrow binding epitope but high affinity bestow outstanding therapeutic efficacy upon 2G1 that neutralized VOCs with sub-nanomolar half maximal inhibitory concentration in vitro. In SARS-CoV-2, Beta or Delta variant-challenged transgenic mice and rhesus macaque models, 2G1 protected animals from clinical illness and eliminated viral burden, without serious impact to animal safety. Mutagenesis experiments suggest that 2G1 is potentially capable of dealing with emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants in the future.

RESULTS: Given the emergency health situation from Covid-19, our initial concern was to find a large number of students with difficulties in mentally processing this situation even with problems such as depression, as their future profession is heavily involved in the management of this pandemic. Fortunately our results have denied our initial hypothesis since both the impact management levels of the event, assessed with the IES-R scale, and the depression levels, assessed with the PHQ-9 recorded values aathat were almost normal. CONCLUSIONS: Nursing students are better able to face the situation since they find themselves in the role of spectators and not in the role of actors in the care of patients with Covid-19.

The formation of intravascular neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) is crucial to the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19. Periodontitis is characterised by an increased level of circulating NETs, a propensity for increased NET formation, delayed NET clearance and low-grade endotoxemia (LGE). The latter has an enormous impact on innate immunity and susceptibility to infection with SARS-CoV-2. LPS binds the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and this complex, which is more active than unbound LPS, precipitates massive NET formation. Thus, circulating NET formation is the common denominator in both COVID-19 and periodontitis and other diseases with low-grade endotoxemia like diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) also increase the risk to develop severe COVID-19. Here we discuss the role of propensity for increased NET formation, DNase I deficiency and low-grade endotoxaemia in periodontitis as aggravating factors for the severe course of COVID-19 and possible strategies for the diminution of increased levels of circulating periodontitis-derived NETs in COVID-19 with periodontitis comorbidity.","output":"Periodontitis-Derived Dark-NETs in Severe Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the many consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic was the cancelation of the 2020 American Academy of Dermatology Annual Meeting.

RAE1 was ubiquitously amplified and overexpressed in tumor cells. High expression of RAE1 in tumor tissues was positively associated with distant metastasis and was an independent poor prognostic factor in CRC. In vitro and in vivo analysis showed that RAE1 promoted tumor growth, inhibited apoptosis, and promoted cell cycle progression, possibly with a decreased proportion of multipolar spindle cells in CRC. Furthermore, RAE1 induced chemoresistance through its antiCapoptotic effect. In addition, overexpression of RAE1 and significant effects on survival were observed in various types of cancer, including CRC. In conclusion, we identified RAE1 as a novel gene that facilitates tumor growth in part by inhibiting apoptosis and promoting cell cycle progression through stabilizing spindle bipolarity and facilitating tumor growth.

In addition to its role in eliminating dysfunctional cells, mitochondrial apoptotic signaling is implicated as a key component of myogenic differentiation and skeletal muscle atrophy.

Precise regulation of these signals is needed to prevent excessive cell disassemble and subsequent cell death. During skeletal muscle atrophy, the activation of CASP's and mitochondrial derived nucleases participate in myonuclear fragmentation, a potential loss of myonuclei, and cleavage of contractile structures within skeletal muscle. The B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) family of proteins play a significant role in regulating myogenesis and skeletal muscle atrophy by governing the initiating steps of mitochondrial apoptotic signaling.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the perceived mental health burden of the COVID-19 pandemic on correctional workers and to explore the relationship between workers' mental health, social demographics, and environmental/work factors. In particular, the study sought to examine if occupational role (correctional officers vs. health care workers) or sex were associated with mental health status. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey was conducted in 78 correctional sites in Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia and New York from November 1 to December 1, 2020. There were 589 participants, including 103 correctional officers and 486 health care workers employed at the correctional facilities. Measurements included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Adult PROMIS Short Form v.1.0Sleep Disturbance, Impact of Event Scale-Revised, Maslach Burnout Inventory 2-item, and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale 2-item. RESULTS: Approximately 48% of healthcare workers and 32% of correctional officers reported mild to severe depressive symptoms, 37% reported mild to severe anxiety symptoms, 47% of healthcare workers and 57% of correctional officers reported symptoms of burnout, and 50% of healthcare workers and 45% of correctional officers reported post-traumatic stress symptoms. Approximately 18% of healthcare workers and 11% of correctional officers reports mild to moderate sleep disturbance. Health care workers had significantly higher depression and sleep disturbance scores than did correctional officers, while correctional officers had significantly higher burnout scores. Female correctional workers scored significantly higher on anxiety than their male counterparts. Increased workload, workplace conflict, younger age of employees, trust in institutional isolation practices, and lower work position were associated with increased burnout. Despite experiencing high mental health burden, correctional workers showed high resilience (60%).

The chance for the higher risk groups personnel to present with moderate and severe depressive symptoms, anxiety, and burnout are 5.28 (CI: 2.01C13.89;p < 0.05), 1.36 (CI: 0.09C1.96;p > 0.05), and 3.92 (CI: 2.08C7.40;p < 0.05) times higher, respectively. The probability for patient-induced burnout is 2.13 (CI: 1.51C3.007;p < 0.05) times higher and highest among the other burn out dimensions. The depressive symptoms complained were similar between groups: loneliness, sleep disturbances, difficulty concentrating, and inability to initiate activities. Loneliness demonstrates the highest logit value among the symptoms. Conclusions: : Health professionals with direct contact and responsibility to treat COVID-19 patients exhibit a higher risk to experience depressive symptoms and burnout. Communication with peers and staying in contact with family needs to be encouraged. Physiological well-being should be considered for high-risk health personnel. Incentive or insurance guaranteed by the government or institution is essential as a reward and compensation during this period.","output":"Depressive, anxiety, and burnout symptoms on health care personnel at a month after COVID-19 outbreak in Indonesia: a documentary research using Rasch model analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Maternal diabetes mellitus and the resulting adverse fetal outcomes including stillbirth in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are high. Thus, setting specific evidence is pivotal to plan, evaluate, and improve national preventive measures and to achieve international sustainable development goals. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis was the first of its kind to estimate the pooled prevalence of stillbirth and its determinants among diabetic mothers in Ethiopia. Methods: Primary studies were exhaustively searched using PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar databases, and gray literature found in Addis Ababa and Haramaya University online repositories was accessed. Eligible studies were selected and critically appraised for quality using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) quality appraisal checklist. The overall prevalence of stillbirth among diabetic mothers was estimated using a weighted inverse random-effect model. I(2) statistic was used for evidence of heterogeneity. Egger's test and funnel plot were used to check the presence of publication bias. Results: The pooled prevalence of stillbirth among diabetic mothers was 2.39 [95% confidence interval (CI): ?0.20, 4.97].

However, the specific effects of uremia on tooth formation are not known. In this study, we used rat mandibular incisors, which continuously erupt and contain all stages of tooth formation, to characterize the effects of uremia on tooth formation. We also tested the hypothesis that uremia aggravates the fluoride (F)-induced changes in developing teeth. Rats were subjected to a two-stage 5/6 nephrectomy or sham operation and then exposed to 0 (control) or 50 ppm NaF in drinking water for 14 days. The effects of these treatments on food intake, body growth rate, and biochemical serum parameters for renal function and calcium metabolism were monitored. Nephrectomy reduced food intake and weight gain. Intake of F by nephrectomized rats increased plasma F levels twofold and further decreased food intake and body weight gain. Uremia affected formation of dentin and enamel and was more extensive than the effect of F alone. Uremia also significantly increased predentin width and induced deposition of large amounts of osteodentin-like matrix-containing cells in the pulp chamber. In enamel formation, the cells most sensitive to uremia were the transitional-stage ameloblasts. These data demonstrate that intake of F by rats with reduced renal function impairs F clearance from the plasma and aggravates the already negative effects of uremia on incisor tooth development.","output":"The effect of fluoride on enamel and dentin formation in the uremic rat incisor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public health crises are challenging for governments and health systems.

We here show that this allows such methods to be combined very directly, with conceptual and numerical ease, with latent force models in the ODE itself. It then becomes possible to perform approximate Bayesian inference on the latent force as well as the ODE solution in a single, linear complexity pass of an extended Kalman filter / smoother - that is, at the cost of computing a single ODE solution.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study on patients hospitalized with laboratory confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection, comparing standard of care along with Convalescent Plasma with or without Tocilizumab (CP vs. CPT). Results: A total of 110 patients were enrolled with an overall mean age of 50  16 years. Patients on CPT were more likely to have had acute respiratory distress syndrome (77% vs. 42%; p < 0.001), sepsis (9.7% vs. 0; p = 0.036), chest X-ray abnormalities (71% vs. 44%; p = 0.004), intensive care unit admission (84% vs. 56%; p = 0.001) as well as being on mechanical ventilation (79% vs. 48%; p = 0.001). After CPT treatment, all measured inflammatory markers, except interleukine-6, showed an overall steady decline over time (all p-values <0.05) and the ventilatory parameters showed significant improvement of PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio from 127 to 188 within 7 days (p < 0.001). Additionally, 52% (32/62) of the patients had favorable outcome, either as improvement of ventilatory parameters or extubation within 14 days of hospitalization.

OBJECTIVE To assess the clinical impact of the SARS-CoV-2 infection among patients scheduled for treatment for active vulvar cancer. METHODS Data on patients with vulvar tumors referred to Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS between February 2020 and July 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with a positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in nasopharyngeal swab were considered as positive for SARS-Cov-2. RESULTS One hundred and ninety-one patients with vulvar cancer were evaluated and scheduled for treatment. The median age was 72 years (range 35-94). Seven (3.7%) patients were diagnosed with SARS-Cov-2 infection: three (42.9%) had their treatment delayed, with no apparent consequences, two (28.6%) had their treatment delayed and later abandoned because of clinical worsening due to oncologic disease progression, and two (28.6%) contracted the infection in the post-operative period and died due to respiratory complications.

When the effects of an event are long-lasting and difficult to detect in the short term, the accumulated effects can be devastating. Mortality is one of the most reliably measured health outcomes, partly due to its unambiguous definition. As a result, excess mortality estimates are an increasingly effective approach for quantifying the effect of an event. However, the fact that indirect effects are often characterized by small, but enduring, increases in mortality rates present a statistical challenge. This is compounded by sources of variability introduced by demographic changes, secular trends, seasonal and day of the week effects, and natural variation. Here, we present a model that accounts for these sources of variability and characterizes concerning increases in mortality rates with smooth functions of time that provide statistical power. The model permits discontinuities in the smooth functions to model sudden increases due to direct effects. We implement a flexible estimation approach that permits both surveillance of concerning increases in mortality rates and careful characterization of the effect of a past event. We demonstrate our tools' utility by estimating excess mortality after hurricanes in the United States and Puerto Rico.

This methodological study aimed to compare results using two different types of software to identify trajectories and to discuss methodological aspects related to them and the interpretation of the results. METHODS Group-based trajectory models (GBTM) and latent class growth models (LCGM) were fitted, using SAS and Mplus, respectively. The data for the examples were derived from a representative sample of Spanish workers in Catalonia, covered by the social security system (n = 166,192). Repeatedly measured sickness absence spells per trimester (n = 96,453) were from the Catalan Institute of Medical Evaluations.

Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with professional fulfillment, burnout, anxiety, and depression. Results: Among the 254 SGO member respondents (approximately 12%), 58% (147) were 45 years, 73% (183) identified as female, and 76% (192) were gynecologic, medical, or radiation oncologists. COVID-19 institutional burden was reported as high/very high (23%, 59), moderate (44%, 110), or low (31%79). Most respondents provided direct patient care (96%, 242), including 22% (52) reported caring for COVID-19 patients. Personal history of COVID-19 infection was reported in 16% (41) of repondents. Among 232 PFI respondents, 58% (134) and 41% (95), respectively, met cutoff values for decreased professional fulfillment and burnout. Of those who completed the GAD (246) and PHQ (251) ultrascreeners, 25% (62) and 17% (42) screened positive for anxiety and depression, respectively. Among these, 41% (21/51) and 27% (10/37) reported potentially clinically significant anxiety and depression, while 18% (9/51) and 32% (12/37) of participant scores correlated with potentially severe depression. A total of 37% (97) reported significant trauma-related stress based on IES-6 scores predictive for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). After multivariate adjustment, decreased professional fulfillment and burnout were significantly associated with screening positive for depression (p=0.005, p=<0.001) and anxiety (p=<0.0001, p=<0.001). Positive depression screening was significantly associated with male gender (p=.027), while positive anxiety screening was associated with female gender (p=0.007). Nurses, physician assistants and other non-physician health care professionals were more likely to screen positive for depression in comparison to physician oncologists (p=.022). When adjusted by demographic variables such as age, race, gender, burden of COVID infection, caring for COVID-19 patients, profession, history of anxiety or depression), no association was found with respect to levels of professional fulfillment or burnout. Conclusions: Our preliminary findings suggest that the majority of SGO members are not professionally fulfilled during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, which represents data that differs from pre-COVID era findings, and indicates a significant impact on professional well-being. Though we observed no association between burden of COVID-19 infection or caring for COVID-19 patients with anxiety, depression, professional fulfillment, or burnout, respondents scores indicated moderate to severe anxiety and depression, and over one-third met IES-6 criteria shown to be correlative to the diagnosis of PTSD.

Methods: Two pre-registered online studies were conducted (N = 2,315 participants from the UK) in which knowledge about and beliefs in herd immunity through vaccination, as well as empathy for those most vulnerable to the virus, were either measured (Study 1) or manipulated (Study 2). As a dependent variable, individuals self-reported vaccination intention once a vaccine against COVID-19 became available was assessed. Results: In Study 1 (N = 310), the intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19 was correlated with knowledge about and belief in herd immunity (r = .58, p <.001), as well as with empathy for those most vulnerable to the virus (r = .26, p <.001). In Study 2 (N = 2,005), information about herd immunity (Cohens d = 0.13, p = .003) and empathy (Cohens d = 0.22, p <.001) independently promoted vaccination intention. Conclusions: The motivation to get vaccinated against COVID-19 was related to and could be causally promoted by both mere information about herd immunity and by empathy. As such, the present research provides a better understanding of the intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19.","output":"Information about herd immunity through vaccination and empathy promote COVID-19 vaccination intentions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human beings prefer a predictable and certain environment over an unpredictable and uncertain environment. No one predicted the coronavirus pandemic and it is not certain when the pandemic will come to an end. Pandemics not only affect the physical health but also the mental health of the public. An increase in anxiety and suicide rates has been reported during the previous pandemics and the same trend is also being observed in this current pandemic as well. Pandemics inevitably result in unpredictable and uncertain environments. Many studies have proven that unpredictability and uncertainty increase the levels of stress and anxiety in animals and humans. Coronavirus pandemic has caused many unpredictable and uncertain events resulting in increased confusion, frustration, stress and anxiety among the public. For instance, the institution of lockdowns was unpredictable and it was uncertain when the lockdowns will be unlocked. Similarly, events that unfolded around the initial touting of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as a possible therapeutic agent and later lack of evidence in support of these drugs resulted in extreme confusion and frustration. The uncertainty around if a vaccine for coronavirus will be developed and when it will become available for public use has also caused stress and anxiety. Current studies indicate that coronavirus is not just a respiratory virus but it also affects the kidneys, brain, heart and blood vessels. This unpredictable nature of the virus has caused further confusion and frustration. These unpredictable and uncertain events around the current pandemic might have increased the levels of stress and anxiety among the public.","output":"Temporal Unpredictability and Probabilistic Uncertainty Induced Anxiety in the Times of COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although females are traditionally thought of as the choosy sex, there is increasing evidence in many species that males will preferentially court or mate with certain females over others when given a choice. In the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, males discriminate between potential mating partners based on a number of female traits, including species, mating history, age, and condition. Interestingly, many of these male preferences are affected by the male's previous sexual experiences, such that males increase courtship toward types of females that they have previously mated with and decrease courtship toward types of females that have previously rejected them. D. melanogaster males also show courtship and mating preferences for larger females over smaller females, likely because larger females have higher fecundity. It is unknown, however, whether this preference shows behavioral plasticity based on the male's sexual history as we see for other male preferences. Here, we manipulate the sexual experience of D. melanogaster males and test whether this manipulation has any effect on the strength of male mate choice for large females. We find that sexually inexperienced males have a robust courtship preference for large females that is unaffected by previous experience mating with, or being rejected by, females of differing sizes. Given that female body size is one of the most common targets of male mate choice across insect species, our experiments with D. melanogaster may provide insight into how these preferences develop and evolve.","output":"Does sexual experience affect the strength of male mate choice for high\\\\quality females in Drosophila melanogaster?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A common overlapping site on the N-terminal IgV-like domain of human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) is targeted by several important human respiratory pathogens. These include Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) and Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) that can cause disseminated or persistent localized infections. To define the precise structural features that determine the binding of distinct pathogens with CEACAMs, we have undertaken molecular modelling and mutation of the receptor molecules at previously implicated key target residues required for bacterial binding. These include Ser-32, Tyr-34, Val-39, Gln-44 and Gln-89, in addition to Ile-91, the primary docking site for the pathogens. Most, but not all, of these residues located adjacent to each other in a previous N-domain model of human CEACAM1, which was based on REI, CD2 and CD4. In the current studies, we have refined this model based on the mouse CEACAM1 crystal structure, and observe that all of the above residues form an exposed continuous binding region on the N-domain. Examination of the model also suggested that substitution of two of these residues 34 and 89 could affect the accessibility of Ile-91 for ligand binding. By introducing selected mutations at the positions 91, 34 and 89, we confirmed the primary importance of Ile-91 in all bacterial binding to CEACAM1 despite the inter- and intraspecies structural differences between the bacterial CEACAM-binding ligands. The studies further indicated that the efficiency of binding was significantly enhanced for specific strains by mutations such as Y34F and Q89N, which also altered the hierarchy of Nm versus Hi strain binding. These studies imply that distinct polymorphisms in human epithelial CEACAMs have the potential to decrease or increase the risk of infection by the receptor-targeting pathogens.","output":"Mutational analysis of human CEACAM1: the potential of receptor polymorphism in increasing host susceptibility to bacterial infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The \\"Ending Cholera: A Global Roadmap to 2030\\" (Roadmap) was launched in October 2017. Following its launch, it became clear that additional evidence is needed to assist countries in controlling cholera and that a prioritized list of research questions is required to focus the limited resources to address the issues most relevant to the implementation of the Roadmap. METHODS A comprehensive list of research questions was developed based on inputs from the Working Groups of the Global Taskforce for Cholera Control and other experts. The Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative methodology was adapted to identify the relevant assessment criteria and assign weights to each criterion. The assessment criteria were applied to each research question by cholera experts to derive a score based on which they were prioritized. FINDINGS The consultation process involved 177 experts and stakeholders representing different constituencies and geographies with research priority scores ranging from 888 to 657% and resulted in the prioritization of the top 20 research questions across all Roadmap pillars, the top five research questions for each Roadmap pillar, and three discovery research questions. This resulted in 32 non-duplicative research questions that considers both immediate and long-term Roadmap goals.

Many oncologists are having challenging conversations with their patients about how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting cancer care and may desire evidence-based communication guidance. Objectives To identify the clinical scenarios that pose communication challenges, understand patient reactions to these scenarios, and develop a communication guide with sample responses. Design, Setting, and Participants This qualitative study that was conducted at a single Midwestern academic medical center invited physicians to respond to a brief semistructured interview by email or telephone and then disseminated an anonymous online survey among patients with cancer. Oncology-specific, COVID-19-related clinical scenarios were identified by the physicians, and potential reactions to these scenarios were gleaned from the patient responses to the survey. Health communication experts were invited to participate in the iterative development of a communication guide, comprising 3 essential communication principles and strategies and informed by insights from physicians and patients. This study was conducted from March 25, 2020, to April 2, 2020. Interventions Expert review, interviews, and surveys assessing challenging situations specific to cancer management during the COVID-19 pandemic. Main Outcomes and Measures Oncology-specific, COVID-19-related clinical scenarios from physician interviews; responses to each scenario from patient surveys; and applicable communication principles from health communication expert literature review. Results Of the 8 physicians who participated in interviews, 4 were men (50%) and 4 were women (50%). These physicians represented the following disciplines: internal medicine (n = 1), hematology/oncology (n = 2), radiation oncology (n = 3), and surgical oncology (n = 2). Their disease site specialization included cancers of the breast, head and neck, melanoma, and gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. A total of 48 patients with cancer completed the online survey; no demographic information was collected from the patients. The physicians identified 8 oncology-specific, COVID-19-related scenarios in which communication might be challenging: (1) worse outcomes from COVID-19, (2) delay in cancer screening, (3) delay in diagnostic workup, (4) delay in initiation of treatment, (5) offer of nonstandard treatment, (6) treatment breaks, (7) delay in follow-up imaging or care, and (8) inability to be admitted into the hospital for management. Potential patient reactions to each of these scenarios were compiled from survey responses. For most scenarios, patient reactions involved anger, fear, and anxiety (eg, \\"I'm scared\\"; \\"This isn't fair. I am upset.\\"). These emotional patient responses informed the selection of the 3 general communication principles, which suggested language and strategies that physicians can use to respond to patients. Conclusions and Relevance In this qualitative study, physicians and patients identified communication needs used by health communication experts to inform the development of a practical, evidence-based communication guide for oncology care during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Perspectives on Oncology-Specific Language During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic: A Qualitative Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Interleukin 6 assays are useful in early detection of infections and risk stratification of critically ill patients, so an assay with a short turnaround\\\\time and near\\\\patient use is preferred.

The hypoglossal nerve stimulator (HNS) is a promising treatment for patients with comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea (COMISA), many of whom have positive airway pressure (PAP) intolerance. Our aim was to determine adherence to and efficacy of HNS in veterans with COMISA refractory to PAP therapy compared to those with obstructive sleep apnea alone (OSA only). STUDY DESIGN Retrospective case series. SETTING A single, academic Veterans Affairs medical center. METHODS Review of clinical records, pre- and postoperative polysomnography, and clinical measures of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), sleepiness, and insomnia was conducted in 53 consecutive cases of veterans with OSA undergoing HNS implantation. HNS adherence was obtained at postoperative visits. HNS adherence and efficacy were compared between individuals with COMISA and OSA only. RESULTS COMISA was noted in 30 of 53 (56.6%) veterans studied. There was no significant difference between HNS adherence in patients with COMISA and OSA only (5.6 vs 6.4 h/night, P = .17).

Atopy was defined as an elevated total serum IgE or a positive RAST test. Both atopic and nonatopic children with persistent cough had an increase in total cells/ml in BAL (atopic: median 39  10(4), range: 20C123; nonatopic: median 22  10(4), range: 17C132) compared to nonatopic controls (median 11  10(4), range 9C30).

Raw data included true/false positive and negative tests, and the total number of tests. Sensitivity and specificity data were calculated for every study, and then pooled in a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 measure. Reporting bias was assessed by means of funnel plots and regression analysis. RESULTS: The systematic review eventually retrieved 14 studies including a total of 15 estimates, the were included in quantitative synthesis.

METHODS: All patients, with two or more risk factors for COVID-19 and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) of >2, who were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) between March and December 2020 were included. Their characteristics, ICU course, and outcomes as well as differences between nonsurvivors and survivors were evaluated. The primary outcome was all-cause 28-day mortality. RESULTS: Out of 1152 COVID-19 patients, 101 met the inclusion criteria. The patients had an average of 4 or more comorbidities with a very high CCI of 5. The 28-day all-cause mortality was 23% and inhospital mortality was 32%. Among all risk factors, only age > 70 years, male gender, and chronic kidney disease were significant determinants of mortality (P < 0.03). Admission PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio and elevated inflammatory markers were same among survivors and nonsurvivors (P > 0.66). The mean time from presentation to ICU admission (59 vs. 38 h), APACHE II score (20.5 vs. 17), ICU length of stay (25 vs. 12 days), and hospital length of stay (28 vs. 20 days) were all higher in nonsurvivors as compared to survivors, respectively (P < 0.03). Fifty-four percent of the patients were intubated and had higher 28-day (40%) and inhospital (55%) mortality. CONCLUSION: Tertiary care patients with multiple comorbidities have higher mortality than what is reported for mixed populations.

This study assesses individual, disease-specific and contextual factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among a nationally representative sample of older Brazilian adults. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of data from household interviews and a supplementary telephone survey. SETTING: Brazil and its five geographic regions. PARTICIPANTS: Data are derived from 6584 individuals aged 50 years and over who participated in the second wave of the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Survey-weighted multinomial logistic regression assesses factors associated with intending, not intending or being uncertain about ones intention to vaccinate against COVID-19. FINDINGS: Seventy-one per cent of study participants intend to receive a COVID-19 vaccine once available, while 17% (representative of nearly 9 million people) have no intention to vaccinate, and 12% are still undecided. Besides age, demographic and health-related factors related to COVID-19 severity and complications were not associated with intention to vaccinate. Those who most trusted social media or friends and family for COVID-19 information and those who did not trust any information source were 68% and 78% more likely to refuse vaccination, respectively, as compared with those who trusted official information sources. People who inconsistently used face masks when outside were 3.4 times more likely than consistent face mask users to intend to refuse vaccination. Higher municipal COVID-19 fatality rates were negatively associated with vaccine refusal. CONCLUSIONS: Most national COVID-19 immunisation strategies identify older individuals as among those prioritised for early vaccination, given their increased risk of more severe symptoms and complications of the disease. Because individual, disease-specific, and contextual factors were associated with vaccine acceptance, there is a clear need for multilevel and multichannel information and outreach campaigns to increase COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among vulnerable older populations.","output":"Which older Brazilians will accept a COVID-19 vaccine?

However, subsequent lead optimizations often rely on other types of computational methods, such as de novo design methods. We have developed an automatic method, namely automatic tailoring and transplanting (AutoT&T), which can effectively utilize the outcomes of virtual screening in lead optimization. This method detects suitable fragments on virtual screening hits and then transplants them onto a lead compound to generate new ligand molecules. Binding affinities, synthetic feasibilities, and drug-likeness properties are considered in the selection of final designs. In this study, our AutoT&T program was tested on three different target proteins, including p38 MAP kinase, PPAR-, and Mcl-1. In the first two cases, AutoT&T was able to produce molecules identical or similar to known inhibitors with better potency than the given lead compound. In the third case, we demonstrated how to apply AutoT&T to design novel ligand molecules from scratch. Compared to the solutions generated by other two de novo design methods, i.e., LUDI and EA-Inventor, the solutions generated by AutoT&T were structurally more diverse and more promising in terms of binding scores in all three cases. AutoT&T also completed the assigned jobs more efficiently than LUDI and EA-Inventor by several folds. Our AutoT&T method has certain technical advantages over de novo design methods. Importantly, it expands the application of virtual screening from lead discovery to lead optimization and thus may serve as a valuable tool for many researchers.","output":"Automatic tailoring and transplanting: a practical method that makes virtual screening more useful."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation has increased in recent years due to ozone layer depletion and in Ecuador in particular, due to its geographical position and the height of its cities.

Video consultation is one form that enables early detection of deteriorating patients and promotion of self-efficacy in patients who are well but anxious. Abdominal pain is a common symptom presented by patients in emergency departments. These patients could benefit from video consultation, as it enables remote follow-up of patients who do not require admission and facilitates early discharge of patients from overcrowded hospitals. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the use of digital telereview in patients presenting with undifferentiated acute abdominal pain. METHODS: The SAVED study was a prospective randomized controlled trial in which follow-up using existing telephone-based telereview (control) was compared with digital telereview (intervention). Patients with undifferentiated acute abdominal pain discharged from the emergency department observation ward were studied based on intention-to-treat. The control arm received routine, provider-scheduled telereview with missed reviews actively coordinated and rescheduled by emergency department staff. The intervention arm received access to a platform for digital telereview (asynchronous and synchronous format) that enabled patient-led appointment rescheduling. Patients were followed-up for 2 weeks for outcomes of service utilization, efficacy (compliance with their disposition plan), and safety (re-presentation for the same condition). RESULTS: A total of 70 patients participated, with patients randomly assigned to each arm (1:1 ratio). Patients were a mean age of 40.0 (SD 13.8; range 22-71) years, predominantly female (47/70, 67%), and predominantly of Chinese ethnicity (39/70, 56%). The telereview service was used by 32 patients in the control arm (32/35, 91%) and 18 patients in the intervention arm (18/35, 51%). Most patients in control (33/35, 94%; 95% CI 79.5%-99.0%) and intervention (34/35, 97%; 95% CI 83.4%-99.9%) arms were compliant with their final disposition. There was a low rate of re-presentation at 72 hours and 2 weeks for both control (72 hours: 2/35, 6%; 95% CI 1.0%-20.5%; 2 weeks: 2/35, 6%, 95% CI 1.0%-20.5%) and intervention (72 hours: 2/35, 6%; 95% CI 1.0%-20.5%; 2 weeks: 3/35, 9%, 95% CI 2.2%-24.2%) arms.

The quality of childrens natural humoral immune response following SARS-CoV-2 infection is yet incompletely understood but crucial to guide pediatric SARS-CoV-2 vaccination programs. MethodsIn this prospective observational multi-center cohort study, we followed 328 households, consisting of 548 children and 717 adults, with at least one member with a previous laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The serological response was assessed at 3-4 months and 11-12 months after infection using a bead-based multiplex immunoassay for 23 human coronavirus antigens including SARS-CoV-2 and its Variants of Concern (VOC) and endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs), and additionally by three commercial SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays. ResultsOverall, 33.76% of SARS-CoV-2 exposed children and 57.88% adults were seropositive. Children were five times more likely to have seroconverted without symptoms compared to adults. Despite the frequently asymptomatic course of infection, children had higher specific antibody levels, and their antibodies persisted longer than in adults (96.22% versus 82.89% still seropositive 11-12 months post infection). Of note, symptomatic and asymptomatic infections induced similar humoral responses in all age groups. In symptomatic children, only dysgeusia was found as diagnostic indicator of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred independent of HCoV serostatus. Antibody binding responses to VOCs were similar in children and adults, with reduced binding for the Beta variant in both groups.

Cav-1 regulates critical cell functions including proliferation, apoptosis, cell differentiation, and transcytosis via diverse signaling pathways. Abundant in almost every cell type in the lung, including type I epithelial cells, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, macrophages, and neutrophils, cav-1 plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI). ALI and its severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in intensive care units, despite improvement in ventilation strategies. The pathogenesis of ARDS is still poorly understood, and therapeutic options remain limited. In this article, we summarize recent data regarding the regulation and function of cav-1 in lung biology and pathology, in particular as it relates to ALI. We further discuss the potential molecular and cellular mechanisms by which cav-1 expression contributes to ALI.

Objective: We characterized and compared 11 different lateral flow assays for their performance in diagnostic or epidemiological settings. Design, Setting, Participants: We used two cohorts to determine the speci- ficity: (i) up to 350 blood donor samples from past influenza seasons and (ii) up to 110 samples which tested PCR negative for SARS-CoV-2 during the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Switzerland. The sensitivity was determined using up to 370 samples which tested PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the same time and is representative for age distribution and severity. Main Outcome: We found a single test usable for epidemiological studies in the current low-prevalence setting, all other tests showed lacking sensitivity or specificity for a usage in either epidemiological or diagnostic setting. However, orthogonal testing by combining two tests without common cross-reactivities makes testing in a low-prevalence setting feasible. Results: Nine out of the eleven tests showed specificities below 99%, only five of eleven tests showed sensitivities comparable to established ELISAs, and only one ful- filled both criteria. Contrary to previous results from lab assays, five tests measured an IgM response in >80% of the samples. We found no common cross-reactivities, which allows orthogonal testing schemes for five tests of sufficient sensitivities. Conclusions and Relevance: This study emphasizes the need for large and diverse negative cohorts when determining specificities, and for diverse and repre- sentative positive samples when determining sensitivities of lateral flow assays for SARS-CoV-2 infections. Failure to adhere to statistically relevant sample sizes or cohorts exclusively made up of hospitalised patients fails to accurately capture the performance of these assays in epidemiological settings. Our results allow a rational choice between tests for different use cases.","output":"Clinical Characterisation of Lateral Flow Assays for Detection of COVID-19 Antibodies in a population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Remdesivir is one of the most encouraging treatments against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

DESIGN: descriptive study of vaccine adherence; predictive study of the factors associated with vaccine adherence, efficacy of vaccination in terms of hospitalization and mortality, and factors that increase the risk of hospital admission following full vaccination. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: population-based study with subjects aged >18 years eligible for vaccination (N. 2,981,997). An information system obtained by integrating various administrative healthcare sources made it possible to analyse socioeconomic characteristics, COVID-19 related hospitalizations, and general mortality in subjects eligible for vaccination. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: full vaccination (2 doses); COVID-19-related hospitalizations, COVID-19-related hospitalizations occurring more than 15 days after the second dose, general mortality. RESULTS: in the first nine months of the vaccination campaign, 74.7% of the subjects (N. 2,228,915) was fully vaccinated, whereas 15.6% (N. 465,829) did not even receive one dose. Women have a lower probability of getting vaccinated than men; the 50-59 years and 70+ years age groups emerge as the most problematic to reach, while the younger one (<40) is the most adherent. A social gradient emerged, with residents of more disadvantaged areas progressively less incline to get vaccinated than those living in more affluent areas. Adherence is greater in Italian citizenship and is likely to increase with an increase in the number of chronic conditions. Hospitalizations amounted to 1.22% (N. 5,672) in the unvaccinated population compared to 0.05% (N. 1,013) in the vaccinated population; general mortality was 4.51% (N. 15,198) in the unvaccinated population against 0.32% (N. 8.733) in the vaccinated population. Sociodemographic factors and the presence of previous health conditions are important predictors of hospitalization outcomes even within the fully vaccinated population. Specifically, the highest hazard ratios are found in subjects with heart failure (HR 2.15; 95%CI 1.83-2.53), in immunocompromised patients (HR 2.02; 95%CI 1.52-2.69), and in transplant recipients (HR 1.92; 95%CI 1.10-3.33). CONCLUSIONS: vaccination campaign adherence is affected by the sociodemographic characteristics of the population and is a determining factor in preventing hospitalizations for COVID-19 and death. The persistent higher risk of hospitalization in chronic subjects following the second dose emphasizes the need to direct booster doses to the more vulnerable.

Yet, there is evidence that such achievements have gone along with substantial animal health and welfare problems for many years, exemplified by reduced life expectancy and high herd replacement rates. Also, these animals are very susceptible to diverse environmental stressors, among which hot summer climate plays a central role in the occurrence of diverse disease cases underlying early cull from the herd. Milk production is also affected by heat stress, both directly and indirectly, as shown by low milk yield in the following autumn period. This article highlights the low milk yield syndrome and sets it into a conceptual framework, based on the crucial role of the innate immune system in the response to non-infectious stressors and in adaptation physiology at large. ABSTRACT: The analysis of milk yield data shows that high genetic merit dairy cows do not express their full production potential in autumn. Therefore, we focused on metabolic stress and inflammatory response in the dry and peripartum periods as possible causes thereof. It was our understanding that some cows could not cope with the stress imposed by their physiological and productive status by means of adequate adaptation strategies. Accordingly, this study highlights the noxious factors with a potential to affect cows in the above transition period: hot summer climate, adverse genetic traits, poor coping with unfavorable environmental conditions, outright production diseases and consequences thereof. In particular, the detrimental effects in the dry period of overcrowding, photoperiod change and heat stress on mammary gland development and milk production are highlighted in the context of the autumn low milk yield syndrome. The latter could be largely accounted for by a memory effect on the innate immune system induced in summer by diverse stressors after dry-off, according to strong circumstantial and indirect experimental evidence. The memory effect is based on distinct epigenetic changes of innate immunity genes, as already shown in cases of bovine mastitis. Following a primary stimulation, the innate immune system would be able to achieve a state known as trained immunity, a sort of education which modifies the response to the same or similar stressors upon a subsequent exposure. In our scenario, the education of the innate immune system would induce a major shift in the metabolism of inflammatory cells following their reprogramming. This would entail a higher basal consumption of glucose, in competition with the need for the synthesis of milk. Also, there is strong evidence that the inflammatory response generated in the dry period leads to a notable reduction of dry matter intake after calving, and to a reduced efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. On the whole, an effective control of the stressors in the dry period is badly needed for better disease control and optimal production levels in dairy cattle.","output":"The Autumn Low Milk Yield Syndrome in High Genetic Merit Dairy Cattle: The Possible Role of a Dysregulated Innate Immune Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: It was urgent and necessary to synthesize the evidence for vaccine effectiveness (VE) against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide a comprehensive overview of the effectiveness profile of COVID-19 vaccines against VOC. METHODS: Published randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, and case-control studies that evaluated the VE against VOC (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, or Omicron) were searched until 4 March 2022. Pooled estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects meta-analysis. VE was defined as (1-estimate). RESULTS: Eleven RCTs (161,388 participants), 20 cohort studies (52,782,321 participants), and 26 case-control studies (2,584,732 cases) were included. Eleven COVID-19 vaccines (mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, ChAdOx1, Ad26.COV2.S, NVX-CoV2373, BBV152, CoronaVac, BBIBP-CorV, SCB-2019, CVnCoV, and HB02) were included in this analysis. Full vaccination was effective against Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron variants, with VE of 88.0% (95% CI, 83.0C91.5), 73.0% (95% CI, 64.3C79.5), 63.0% (95% CI, 47.9C73.7), 77.8% (95% CI, 72.7C82.0), and 55.9% (95% CI, 40.9C67.0), respectively. Booster vaccination was more effective against Delta and Omicron variants, with VE of 95.5% (95% CI, 94.2C96.5) and 80.8% (95% CI, 58.6C91.1), respectively. mRNA vaccines (mRNA-1273/BNT162b2) seemed to have higher VE against VOC over others; significant interactions (p(interaction) < 0.10) were observed between VE and vaccine type (mRNA vaccines vs. not mRNA vaccines). CONCLUSIONS: Full vaccination of COVID-19 vaccines is highly effective against Alpha variant, and moderate effective against Beta, Gamma, and Delta variants. Booster vaccination is more effective against Delta and Omicron variants. mRNA vaccines seem to have higher VE against Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta variants over others.

Military healthcare workers in China have experienced many pressures when combating COVID-19. This study aimed to investigate the current psychological status and associated risk factors among military healthcare workers. METHODS: We collected data from 194 military healthcare workers from three inpatient wards in two specialized COVID-19 hospitals using a web-based cross-sectional survey. The survey covered demographic information, the patient health questionnaire-9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and the patient health questionnaire-15. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to explore potential risk factors for mental health problems. RESULTS: The overall prevalence rates of depressive, generalized anxiety, and somatic symptoms were 37.6%, 32.5%, and 50%, respectively. Rates of severe depression, generalized anxiety, and somatic symptoms were 5.2%, 3.6%, and 15.5%, respectively. In 22.7% of cases, comorbidities existed between depression, generalized anxiety, and somatization. A junior-grade professional title was associated with depression, older age was associated with generalized anxiety and somatization, and short sleep duration and poor sleep quality were associated with all three symptoms.

BACKGROUND: To stop Coronavirus-19 pandemic, Spanish government ordained home confinement in Basque Country from 13th March to 11th May, although some people had previously confined themselves. In this period, a decrease in cardiovascular admissions, except pulmonary embolism has been reported, speculating about viral activation of coagulation. As patients could not receive the standard care, augmented mortality of non-Covid pathologies could happen. METHODS: We, selected patients admitted with intermediate-high and high risk from 1st March to 30th June. Other risks or those occurred during a hospitalization were excluded. Several characteristics were reported. RESULTS: Among 21 cases (13 women), there were 3 Covid-positive (2 women). All presented an intermediate-high risk, except 2. 16 cases happened in March and April. Mean age was 72,5 years (range 30-94). Mean total stay length was 7,24 days (range 3-12). 14 patients presented original Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) class  III and mean simplified PESI (sPESI) was 1.43 points (range 0-4). On average, patients presented 1,95 risk factors for pulmonary embolism (range 0-6), mainly weak ones. Average Troponin T was 130.15 ng/L (range 15-1099, one case unknown). Average NT-proBNP was 6690.42 pg/ml (range 267-35000, 2 cases unknown). Fibrinolytic therapy and vasopressors were only used in intensive care unit (ICU), in 2 and 1 patients respectively. 2 patients were on Unfractionated Heparin, the rest received low-molecular-weight heparin. All patients admitted in ICU were transferred later to ward, except 1 that was transfer to Intermediate respiratory care unit (IRCU). There were no mortality during hospitalization. There were 3 complications that not required intensive therapy. 8 were admitted in ICU (50% women, mean age 61,2 years (range 30-78), average sPESI 1,4 (range 0-4), 6 patients PESI class  III, average troponin 109,25 ng/L (19-259) and NT-proBNP 7219.86 pg/ml (446-15787), 1,88 risk factors on average, stay length 8,25 days (6-11)). The rest were admitted in ward (4 in IRCU) (62% women, mean age 79.46 years (66-94), average sPESI 1,46 (0-4), 8 patients PESI class  III, average troponin 144,08 ng/L (15-1099) and NT-proBNP 6351.58 pg/ml (439-35000), 2 risk factors on average, stay length 6,62 days (3-12)). CONCLUSIONS: Probably coronavirus-19 is not a risk factor for admission due to severe pulmonary embolism. Home confinement may be a risk factor, and if it happened again, advice against sedentary lifestyle should be given to population. Despite a possible delay in diagnosis or treatment, there were no mortality or severe complications, irrespectively of age or site of admission, although patients in intensive care tend to be younger, presented more frequently PESI class > III and stay more time in hospital. Studies are needed to determine which patients would benefit from admission in intensive care units, especially if resources are limited again.","output":"Intermediate-high and high risk acute pulmonary embolism during home confinement due to coronavirus-19 pandemic: description in a second level hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Native American children have higher rates of morbidity associated with acute respiratory infection than children in the general US population, yet detailed information is lacking regarding their principal clinical presentations and infectious etiologies. METHODS We pursued a comprehensive molecular survey of bacteria and viruses in nasal wash specimens from children with acute respiratory disease collected prospectively over 1 year (January 1 through December 31, 2009) from 915 Navajo and White Mountain Apache children in their second or third year of life who had been enrolled in an efficacy study of a respiratory syncytial virus monoclonal antibody in the first year of life. RESULTS During the surveillance period, 1476 episodes of disease were detected in 669 children. Rates of outpatient and inpatient lower respiratory tract illness were 391 and 79 per 1000 child-years, respectively, and were most commonly diagnosed as pneumonia. Potential pathogens were detected in 88% of specimens. Viruses most commonly detected were respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinovirus; the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) illnesses primarily occurred in the fall. Streptococcus pneumoniae was detected in 60% of subjects; only human rhinovirus was significantly associated with S. pneumoniae carriage. The presence of influenza virus, human rhinovirus or S. pneumoniae was not associated with increased risk for lower respiratory tract involvement or hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS Acute lower respiratory illnesses occur at disproportionately high rates among young American Indian children and are associated with a range of common pathogens.

Thus, the objective of this study was to explore how caregivers of infants under 6 months of age perceived changes to infant feeding and other food and health-related matters during the COVID-19 State of Emergency in Nova Scotia, Canada. Four weeks after the State of Emergency began, between 17 April and 15 May 2020, caregivers completed this online survey, including the Perceived Stress Scale. Participants (n = 335) were 99% female and mostly White (87%). Over half (60%) were breastfeeding, and 71% had a household income over CAD$60,000. Most participants (77%) received governmental parental benefits before the emergency, and 59% experienced no COVID-19-related economic changes. Over three quarters of participants (77%) scored moderate levels of perceived stress. Common themes of concern included social isolation, COVID-19 infection (both caregiver and infant), and a lack of access to goods, namely, human milk substitutes ('infant formula'), and services, including health care, lactation support, and social supports. Most COVID-19-related information was sought from the internet and social media, so for broad reach, future evidence-based information should be shared via online platforms. Although participants were experiencing moderate self-perceived stress and shared numerous concerns, very few COVID-19-related changes to infant feeding were reported, and there were few differences by socio-economic status, likely due to a strong economic safety net in this Canadian setting.","output":"Infant feeding experiences and concerns among caregivers early in the COVID-19 State of Emergency in Nova Scotia, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 is one of the biggest health challenges that the world has ever faced.

However, the amount of overhead costs for each project is different and is influenced by external factors such as environmental, socio-cultural, political, and the nature of the project location. Therefore, this study aims to identify the dominant external factors that affect construction project overhead costs and determine the percentage of overhead costs set aside by contractors from the direct costs of construction projects to anticipate the risks posed by overhead costs. In this study, a total of 30 questionnaires were collected from the contractors and a Likert scale of 1C5 was used to measure the level of influence of external factors on construction project overhead costs. Then, the collected data is processed using factor analysis techniques and produces three dominant external factors on construction project overhead costs, including (1) Economics, (2) Law, (3) Social-cultural and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

First, we set out to establish a small molecule library using traditional structure\\\\based drug design strategies and various computational tools. Small molecule design began by utilizing FTMap to identify hotspots on the S protein binding domain (Chain B), which has been shown to interact with the hACE2 receptor (PDB file 6LZG). A hotspot was identified in the S protein\\\\hACE2 binding domain. Within the probe cluster for this hotspot, the phenol probe was found to have strong interactions with the surrounding amino acids and thus selected as the initial scaffold. Based on the residues surrounding the hotspot, additional substituents were added to the scaffold to improve binding affinity to the S protein. AutoDock was used to sequentially evaluate the binding affinity of each small molecule to assess the effects of various substituents and geometries, thereby refining the small molecule library. Over 200 unique small molecules were rationally designed, which revealed two preferred substructures: fluorene and naphthalene\\\\based molecules. The lead molecule from the fluorene substructure had a binding affinity of \\\\9.1 kcal/mol (jmol156), and the lead molecule from the naphthalene substructure had a binding affinity of \\\\8.5 kcal/mol (tmol35) (Figure 1).

This study aimed to characterize the diffusion process of influenza A (H1N1) by identifying the starting point of the epidemic as well as climatic and sociodemographic factors associated with the occurrence and intensity of transmission of the disease. The study was carried out in the Brazilian state of Paran, where H1N1 caused the largest impact. The units of spatial and temporal analysis were the municipality of residence of the cases and the epidemiological weeks of the year 2009, respectively. Under the Bayesian paradigm, parametric inference was performed through a two-part spatiotemporal model and the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) algorithm. We identified the most likely starting points through the effective distance measure based on mobility networks. The proposed estimation methodology allowed for rapid and efficient implementation of the spatiotemporal model, and provided evidence of different patterns for chance of occurrence and risk of influenza throughout the epidemiological weeks. The results indicate the capital city of Curitiba as the probable starting point, and showed that the interventions that focus on municipalities with greater migration and density of people, especially those with higher Human Development Indexes (HDIs) and the presence of municipal air and road transport, could play an important role in mitigation of effects of future influenza pandemics on public health. These results provide important information on the process of introduction and spread of influenza, and could contribute to the identification of priority areas for surveillance as well as establishment of strategic measures for disease prevention and control.

Public acceptance is therefore an important indicator to inform the communication activities that accompany the introduction of a new policy. The goal was to assess acceptance and relevant target groups for communication activities. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional online survey embedded in the regular German COVID-19 monitoring. METHODS: Besides sociodemographic information, trust in institutions, knowledge about COVID-19 and protective behaviors, as well as risk perceptions, we assessed public acceptance of school-related mask policies of parents and non-parents (total N ?= ?957). RESULTS: In the absence of mandatory mask policies in schools in Germany in August 2020, the general agreement with mask wearing in school was low. Those living in bigger cities or communities C where class sizes are usually larger C agreed more with mask wearing in class; those who felt a greater risk, had greater trust in institutions, or felt higher self-efficacy in fighting the outbreak also wanted children to wear a mask in class. Women were more likely than men to disagree with mask wearing in class. Agreement was highest that policies should uniformly apply for all institutions within a state/province and should not be regulated at the school level or federal/country level. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing mask policies in school will require intense communication. Acceptance of these policies from teachers and pupils should be considered as well. Women seem to be an important target group as they supported mask wearing in class less than men.

Preclinical studies suggest that mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) administration may be a safe and promising option in treating PF. The objective of our meta-analysis is to assess the efficacy of MSC therapy in preclinical models of PF. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive literature search in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases from inception to March 17, 2021. Studies that assessed the efficacy of MSC therapy to animals with PF were included. The SYRCLE bias risk tool was employed to evaluate the bias of included studies. The primary outcomes included survival rate and pulmonary fibrosis scores. Meta-analysis was conducted via Cochrane Collaboration Review Manager (version 5.4) and Stata 14.0 statistical software. RESULTS: A total of 1120 articles were reviewed, of which 24 articles met inclusion criteria. Of these, 12 studies evaluated the survival rate and 20 studies evaluated pulmonary fibrosis scores. Compared to the control group, MSC therapy was associated with an improvement in survival rate (odds ratios (OR) 3.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.06 to 4.67, P < 0.001, I2 = 0%) and a significant reduction in pulmonary fibrosis scores (weighted mean difference (WMD) 2.05, 95% CI -2.58 to -1.51, P < 0.001, I2 = 90%).

This mutual interplay of both BAs and gut microbiota regulates many physiological processes, including the lipid, carbohydrate and energy metabolism of the host. Emerging evidence also implies an important role of this enterohepatic BA circuit in shaping mucosal colonization resistance as well as local and distant immune responses, tissue physiology and carcinogenesis.

CONCLUSIONS: An increase in the pursuit of new therapeutic targets, changes to the regulatory environment, and business pressures to expand clinical trials to more countries have significantly increased the complexity of confirmatory clinical studies that incorporate PROMs. Decisions to participate in collaborative efforts for endpoint development or proceed independently are made in the context of competing priorities of drug development timelines, drug differentiation strategies, the need for patient-related value messages, and the depth of a sponsor pipeline within specific disease areas. Study logistics are critically important; factors such as concept cultural relevancy, respondent literacy level, and quality of cross-cultural adaptation of PROMs must be evaluated when integrating into confirmatory clinical trials. Awareness of the issues relating to PROs in multiregional studies will enable companies to better plan studies and interpret results.","output":"Integration of patient-reported outcomes in multiregional confirmatory clinical trials()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Latent toxoplasmosis, i.e. a lifelong infection with the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii , affects about a third of human population worldwide. In the past ten years, numerous studies had shown that infected subjects have a significantly higher incidence of mental and physical health problems and are more prone to exhibiting the adverse effects of various diseases. Methods A cross-sectional internet study was performed on a population of 4,499 (786 Toxoplasma -infected) subjects and looked for factors which positively or negatively affect the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and likelihood of a severe course of Covid-19. Results Logistic regression and partial Kendall correlation controlled for sex, age, and size of the place of residence showed that latent toxoplasmosis had the strongest effect on the risk of infection (OR = 150) before sport (OR = 130), and borreliosis (127). It also had the strongest effect on the risk of severe course of infection (Tau = 0146), before autoimmunity, immunodeficiency, male sex, keeping a cat, being overweight, borreliosis, higher age, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Toxoplasmosis augmented the adverse effects of other risk factors but was not the proximal cause of the effect of cat keeping on higher likelihood of Covid infection and higher severity of the course of infection because the effect of cat keeping was observed also (and especially) in a subset of Toxoplasma -infected subjects (Tau = 0153). Effects of keeping a cat were detected only in subjects from multi-member families, suggesting that a cat could a vector for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within a family. Conclusions Toxoplasmosis is currently not considered a risk factor for Covid-19 and Toxoplasma -infected subjects are neither informed about their higher risks nor prioritised in vaccination programs. Because toxoplasmosis affects a large segment of the human population, its impact on Covid-19-associated effects on public health could be considerable.","output":"Toxoplasmosis is a Risk Factor for Acquiring SARS-CoV-2 Infection and a Severe Course of Covid-19 Disease in The Czech and Slovak Population: A Preregistered Exploratory Internet Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The emergence and spread of a new coronavirus (SARSCoV-2) from Wuhan, China, has become a public health emergency of international concern, designated by the World Health Organization [1].

Specifically, the stringent lockdown restrictions have heightened anxiety and depression. Therefore, monitoring and supporting the mental health of the population during these unprecedented times is an immediate priority. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta\\\\analyses, articles that explored the prevalence of anxiety and depression during the first COVID\\\\19 lockdown in the United Kingdom were included. We searched the databases Embase, Medline (PubMed), Web of Science, and PsycINFO for cross\\\\sectional studies. We conducted meta\\\\analyses of prevalence rates using a random\\\\effects model, and the heterogeneity of studies was examined using the I (2) index. RESULTS: Fourteen studies involving 46,158 participants were included in the review. The studies use clinical cut\\\\off scores on anxiety and depression measures to define cases. While the prevalence of anxiety was 31.00% (95% CI = 26.00 to 35.00), the prevalence of depression was 32.00% (95% CI = 29.00 to 35.00). The prevalence of anxiety pre\\\\pandemic was 4.65%, indicating a 26.35% increase. Whereas the prevalence of depression pre\\\\pandemic was 4.12%, indicating a 27.88% increase. Moreover, participants experienced a slightly greater prevalence of depression than anxiety by 1.00%. CONCLUSIONS: To conclude, the first COVID\\\\19 lockdown in the United Kingdom increased the prevalence of anxiety and depression among the general population, compared to pre\\\\pandemic data. Hence, it is vital that policymakers and mental health services maximize their efforts to monitor mental health and provide interventions to support those in need. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Clinical implications: Awareness of the high prevalence of anxiety and depression during the first lockdown in the United Kingdom can inform policy development that substantial effort, time, and funding of mental health services are required to support those in need. Similarly, awareness of the prevalence of anxiety and depression in the United Kingdom can contribute to the development of nation\\\\specific interventions and initiatives. Limitations: The current review focuses on the UK general population which does not allow the findings to be generalized to the global population. The indirect comparison of the current prevalence rates with the corresponding pre\\\\pandemic prevalence rates obtained from a different study sample increases individual differences, weakening the reliability of the findings.","output":"Investigating the prevalence of anxiety and depression during the first COVID\\\\19 lockdown in the United Kingdom: Systematic review and meta\\\\analyses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Viet Nam currently relies on a manual paper-based system to track and monitor 28 major infectious diseases. This inefficient system takes 2 or more months to complete. Method: We designed and pilot tested the use of text messaging to report certain infectious disease symptoms in rural areas of northern Viet Nam. The project was divided into three 6-month phases carried out in two provinces. The current analysis focuses on the implementation of a two-way feedback system between Phases II and III, which aims at (1) evaluating whether this system improves efficiency by determining the number of correctly (vs. incorrectly) formatted text messages; (2) assessing this system's influence on accuracy by comparing text messages with their respective official paper-based documented forms; and (3) determining whether the amount of information required to report through text messages influences the efficiency and accuracy of the text messages. Results: Between Phases II and III, results revealed a significant improvement in correctly formatted texts in comparison to incorrectly formatted texts. As the number of fields required to report increased, the number of correctly formatted texts (efficiency) as well as the number of matched text messages (accuracy) decreased. Conclusion: Our research demonstrates that an automated error bidirectional feedback system can significantly improve both the efficiency and accuracy of a Short Message Service-based method for disease surveillance. Also, our data may suggest that two-way communication has better engaged health care staff to follow reporting protocols as well as to maintain accuracy from their clinic's own data.","output":"Effectiveness of an Automated Error Checking and Feedback System to Improve Text Message Reporting for Disease Surveillance in Viet Nam"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We assessed variations in chest CT usage, radiation dose and image quality in COVID-19 pneumonia.

CASE SUMMARY: We report another case of uneventful COVID-19 pneumonia in a 58-year old male who was 18 mo post liver transplantation. He received tacrolimus monotherapy since July 2019. The clinical manifestations included only epigastric pain radiating to the right hypochondrium, nausea and vomiting. He had no fevers, cough, shortness of breath, anosmia or dysgeusia even if the chest computed tomography scan revealed an extension of the multiple patchy ground-glass density shadows to the upper lobe of the left lung too. He was hospitalised and received a course of oral chloroquine (200 mg  3 per day) for a period of 10 d. Interestingly, the COVID 19 infection was uneventful though there were no modifications to his tacrolimus dosing. He was successfully discharged. We performed subsequent follow-up via telemedicine.

As in other chronic diseases, ME/CFS evolves through different stages, from asymptomatic predisposition, progressing to a prodromal stage, and then to symptomatic disease. Disease incidence depends on genetic makeup and environment factors, the exposure to singular or repeated insults, and the nature of the host response. In people who develop ME/CFS, normal homeostatic processes in response to adverse insults may be replaced by aberrant responses leading to dysfunctional states. Thus, the predominantly neuro-immune manifestations, underlined by a hyper-metabolic state, that characterize early disease, may be followed by various processes leading to multi-systemic abnormalities and related symptoms. This abnormal state and the effects of a range of mediators such as products of oxidative and nitrosamine stress, may lead to progressive cell and metabolic dysfunction culminating in a hypometabolic state with low energy production. These processes do not seem to happen uniformly; although a spiraling of progressive inter-related and self-sustaining abnormalities may ensue, reversion to states of milder abnormalities is possible if the host is able to restate responses to improve homeostatic equilibrium. With time variation in disease presentation, no single ME/CFS case description, set of diagnostic criteria, or molecular feature is currently representative of all patients at different disease stages. While acknowledging its limitations due to the incomplete research evidence, we suggest the proposed framework may support future research design and health care interventions for people with ME/CFS.","output":"How Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) Progresses: The Natural History of ME/CFS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1186/s40560-020-00445-4.].","output":"Correction to: Nationwide system to centralize decisions around ECMO use for severe COVID-19 pneumonia in Japan (Special Correspondence)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has required the development of multiple testing systems to monitor and control the viral infection.

Over the summer of 2020, the nation erupted with Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests following the highly publicized murders of George Floyd and other unarmed Black individuals at the hands of police. Although these protests could have served as a cathartic outlet for those outraged by police brutality and racial injustice, the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic forced many people to stay home. Because participating in online forms of activism is becoming increasingly common, and turning to media is a common response when faced with trauma and threats to belonging, the current research examined streaming behavior as activism. Participants (n = 128) completed an online survey assessing their desire and ability to protest, streaming habits, belonging, and depressive symptoms. It was found that viewing BLM media was negatively associated with belonging and positively associated with desire to protest and depressive symptoms. It was also found that participants higher in desire to protest consumed more BLM titles, and people higher in ability to protest consumed fewer BLM titles. These findings could have implications for media's role in social justice and collective action.

A more complete understanding of the complex cellular events required for successful nerve regeneration may reveal new therapeutic targets. The role of fibroblasts in regeneration, and the process by which the nerve reforms its three-dimensional structure after a transection injury, are not fully understood. The Hedgehog signaling pathway has been shown to mediate nerve sheath formation during development. We therefore sought to characterize the role of Hedgehog-responsive cells following transection of the facial nerve. METHODS Two transgenic mouse lines with reporters for the downstream effector of Hedgehog signaling, Gli1, were used. The animals underwent a unilateral facial nerve transection injury, and the contralateral side served as a control. Facial nerves were analyzed via immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence at predetermined time points as the facial nerve regenerated after the transection injury. RESULTS There was a statistically significant increase in Gli1+ cells both at the site of injury and within the distal nerve segment over time. Gli1+ cells are fibroblasts within the nerve and appear to contribute to the reformation of the nerve sheath after injury. CONCLUSION These findings describe a key signaling pathway by which fibroblasts participate in motor nerve regeneration. Fibroblasts that reside within the nerve respond to injury and may represent a novel therapeutic target in the context of facial nerve regeneration after transection injury.","output":"The role of Hedgehog-responsive fibroblasts in facial nerve regeneration."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the current Covid-19 pandemic, learning was carried out using an online system, so many training activities, seminars, and lectures were carried out online.

Objective: To determine whether the combination of ascorbic acid, corticosteroids, and thiamine attenuates organ injury in patients with septic shock. Design, Setting, and Participants: Randomized, blinded, multicenter clinical trial of ascorbic acid, corticosteroids, and thiamine vs placebo for adult patients with septic shock. Two hundred five patients were enrolled between February 9, 2018, and October 27, 2019, at 14 centers in the United States. Follow-up continued until November 26, 2019. Interventions: Patients were randomly assigned to receive parenteral ascorbic acid (1500 mg), hydrocortisone (50 mg), and thiamine (100 mg) every 6 hours for 4 days (n = 103) or placebo in matching volumes at the same time points (n = 102). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was change in the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (range, 0-24; 0 = best) between enrollment and 72 hours. Key secondary outcomes included kidney failure and 30-day mortality. Patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug were included in analyses. Results: Among 205 randomized patients (mean age, 68 [SD, 15] years; 90 [44%] women), 200 (98%) received at least 1 dose of study drug, completed the trial, and were included in the analyses (101 with intervention and 99 with placebo group). Overall, there was no statistically significant interaction between time and treatment group with regard to SOFA score over the 72 hours after enrollment (mean SOFA score change from 9.1 to 4.4 [-4.7] points with intervention vs 9.2 to 5.1 [-4.1] points with placebo; adjusted mean difference, -0.8; 95% CI, -1.7 to 0.2; P = .12 for interaction). There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of kidney failure (31.7% with intervention vs 27.3% with placebo; adjusted risk difference, 0.03; 95% CI, -0.1 to 0.2; P = .58) or in 30-day mortality (34.7% vs 29.3%, respectively; hazard ratio, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.8-2.2; P = .26). The most common serious adverse events were hyperglycemia (12 patients with intervention and 7 patients with placebo), hypernatremia (11 and 7 patients, respectively), and new hospital-acquired infection (13 and 12 patients, respectively). Conclusions and Relevance: In patients with septic shock, the combination of ascorbic acid, corticosteroids, and thiamine, compared with placebo, did not result in a statistically significant reduction in SOFA score during the first 72 hours after enrollment.

The good news is that interventions to be tested are not in short supply. Unfortunately, the human and material resources needed to conduct these trials are finite. It is essential that trials be robust and meet enrollment targets and that lower-quality studies not be permitted to displace higher-quality studies, delaying answers to critical questions. Yet, with few exceptions, existing research review bodies and processes are not designed to ensure these conditions are satisfied. To meet this challenge, we offer guidance for research institutions about how to ethically consolidate and prioritize COVID-19 clinical trials, while recognizing that consolidation and prioritization should also take place upstream (among manufacturers and funders) and at a higher level (e.g. nationally). In our proposed three-stage process, trials must first meet threshold criteria. Those that do are evaluated in a second stage to determine whether the institution has sufficient capacity to support all proposed trials. If it does not, the third stage entails evaluating studies against two additional sets of comparative prioritization criteria: those specific to the study and those that aim to advance diversification of an institution's research portfolio. To implement these criteria fairly, we propose that research institutions form COVID-19 research prioritization committees. We briefly discuss some important attributes of these committees, drawing on the authors' experiences at our respective institutions.

When a human coronary artery segment is interposed into the infra-renal aortae of immunodeficient mice, the intimas could be expand in response to adoptively transferred human T cells allogeneic to the artery donor or exogenous human IFN- in the absence of human T cells. Interposition of a mouse aorta from one strain into another mouse strain recipient is limited as a model for chronic rejection in humans because the acute cell-mediated rejection response in this mouse model completely eliminates all donor-derived vascular cells from the graft within two-three weeks. We have recently developed two new mouse models to circumvent these problems. The first model involves interposition of a vessel segment from a male mouse into a female recipient of the same inbred strain (C57BL/6J). Graft rejection in this case is directed only against minor histocompatibility antigens encoded by the Y chromosome (present in the male but not the female) and the rejection response that ensues is sufficiently indolent to preserve donor-derived smooth muscle cells for several weeks. The second model involves interposing an artery segment from a wild type C57BL/6J mouse donor into a host mouse of the same strain and gender that lacks the receptor for IFN- followed by administration of mouse IFN- (delivered via infection of the mouse liver with an adenoviral vector. There is no rejection in this case as both donor and recipient mice are of the same strain and gender but donor smooth muscle cells proliferate in response to the cytokine while host-derived cells, lacking receptor for this cytokine, are unresponsive.

Chi square, Pearson product-moment correlation, point biserial correlation, and logistic regression were estimated. Our analysis revealed that respondents who identified as Latinx, Latin@, or Hispanic were 10 times more likely to meet the threshold score for depression. Similarly, individuals with prior mental health conditions and those who expressed feelings of social isolation due to COVID-19 were 3 times more likely to meet the threshold score for depression. These results confirm our hypothesis that communities of color will likely experience disproportionate mental health impacts of COVID-19-specifically, the mental health sequela that emerge from exposure, cumulative burden, and social isolation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study between September 2019 and March 2020. Cohort of adults presenting to the ED requiring rapid sequence induction (RSI) were recruited to determine the prevalence and risk factors for the development of aspiration pneumonia(AP) in patients intubated in the ED. RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 154 patients with a mean age of 44.5 years required RSI in the ED. Male (61%) predominance was noted among the study cohorts. We did not find any association between RSI performed in the ED and the risk of developing AP. The first attempt success rate of RSI was 76.7%, and 33(21.4%) patients had immediate adverse events following RSI. Rescue intubation was required for 11(7.1%) patients. The prevalence of AP following RSI in the ED was 13.4%. Endotracheal tube (ET) aspirate pepsin was positive in 45(29.2%) samples collected. The ET aspirate pepsin assay had low sensitivity (44.44%), specificity (73.53%), positive predictive value (18%), and negative predictive value (91%) in predicting the occurrence of AP. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, male gender (AOR: 7.29, 95%CI: 1.51?35.03, p = 0.013) and diabetes mellitus (AOR: 3.75, 95%CI: 1.23-11.51, p = 0.02) were found to be independent risk factors for developing AP. CONCLUSION: We identified male gender and diabetes mellitus to be independent predictors of risk of developing AP after RSI in the ED.

Suppression has shown in simulation models the potential for decreasing ICU occupation below its surge limit, effectively decreasing mortality.

While some question a substantial correlation according to their results, a number of studies raise questions about the significance of a correlation of aPL antibodies in COVID-19 patients.

METHODS We conducted a selective literature review to identify the indicators used and to derive appropriate definitions. We calculated crude and age-adjusted indicators for selected countries. RESULTS The proportion of deaths (case fatality proportion [CFP]; number of deaths/ total number of cases) is commonly used to estimate the severity of a disease. If the CFP is used for purposes of comparison, the existence of heterogeneity in the detection and registration of cases and deaths has to be taken into account. In the early phase of an epidemic, when case numbers rise rapidly, the CFP suffers from bias. For these reasons, variants have been proposed: the \\"confirmed CFP\\" (number of deaths/total number of confirmed cases), and the \\"delay-adjusted CFP,\\" which considers the delay between infection with the disease and death from the disease. The indicator mortality (number of deaths/total population) has at first sight the advantage of being based on a defined denominator, the total population. During the outbreak of a disease, however, the cumulative deaths rise while the total population remains stable. The phase of the epidemic therefore has to be considered when using this indicator. In this context, R0 and R(t) are important indicators. R0 estimates the maximum rate of spread of a disease in a population, while R(t) describes the dynamics of the epidemic at a given time. Age-adjusted analysis of the CFP shows that the differences between countries decrease but do not dis - appear completely. If the test strategies depend on age or symptom severity, however, the bias cannot be entirely eliminated. CONCLUSION Various indicators of the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic at population level are used in daily communication.

Activation of MAPKs was evident by 6 h postinfection. However, UV-irradiated MHV failed to activate MAPKs, which demonstrated that MHV replication was necessary for their activation. Several other MHV-permissive cell lines also showed activation of both p38 MAPK and JNK, which indicated that the MHV-induced stress-kinase activation was not restricted to any particular cell type. The upstream kinase responsible for activating MHV-induced p38 MAPK was the MAPK kinase 3. Experiments with a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, SB 203580, demonstrated that MHV-induced p38 MAPK activation resulted in the accumulation of interleukin-6 (IL-6) mRNAs and an increase in the production of IL-6, regardless of MHV-induced general host protein synthesis inhibition. Furthermore, MHV production was suppressed in SB 203580-treated cells, demonstrating that activated p38 MAPK played a role in MHV replication. The reduced MHV production in SB 203580-treated cells was, at least in part, due to a decrease in virus-specific protein synthesis and virus-specific mRNA accumulation. Interestingly, there was a transient increase in the amount of phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) in infected cells, and this eIF4E phosphorylation was p38 MAPK dependent; it is known that phosphorylated eIF4E enhances translation rates of cap-containing mRNAs. Furthermore, the upstream kinase responsible for eIF4E phosphorylation, MAPK-interacting kinase 1, was also phosphorylated and activated in response to MHV infection. Our data suggested that host cells, in response to MHV replication, activated p38 MAPK, which subsequently phosphorylated eIF4E to efficiently translate certain host proteins, including IL-6, during virus-induced severe host protein synthesis inhibition. MHV utilized this p38 MAPK-dependent increase in eIF4E phosphorylation to promote virus-specific protein synthesis and subsequent progeny virus production. Enhancement of virus-specific protein synthesis through virus-induced eIF4E activation has not been reported in any other viruses.","output":"Murine coronavirus replication-induced p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation promotes interleukin-6 production and virus replication in cultured cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As of April 15, 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration has granted emergency use authorization to a first saliva test for diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, the device developed by RUCDR Infinite Biologics laboratory, Rutgers University.

However, comammox (CMX), with the maximum energy harvest per mole of ammonia, and some AOB, have higher a0 NH3 and lower max than some AOA.

Moreover, the presumed dominance of AOB over NOB in O2 -limiting environments is discussed. Additionally, lower statistical variance of a0 O2 values than for ammonia and nitrite affinities was observed, suggesting nitrogen limitation as a stronger selective pressure.

We sought to evaluate a series of COVID-19 positive KTX recipients hospitalized at our institution during both the first and second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We retrospectively examined our KTX recipients hospitalized from March 2020 to June 2020 for the first wave, and November 2020 to February 2021 for the second wave of COVID-19. Data for demographics, clinical course, laboratory tests, outcomes, and management were collected. Descriptive statistics were performed for all data. RESULTS: We identified 25 KTX from the first and 17 from the second COVID-19 wave. All study subjects had their KTX performed at our institution, tested positive, and were hospitalized. Since August 2003, all KTX recipients received a single dose of alemtuzumab induction therapy. During the first wave, the average length of stay (LOS) was 9.4 days. Four patients (16%) required ICU level of care, 3 patients were intubated, and there were no mortalities. 6 (24%) and 7 (28%) patients had their mycophenolate (MMF) and tacrolimus (TAC) immunosuppression held. 19 (76%) received hydroxychloroquine, 3 (12%) received steroids, 1 (4%) received Remdesivir. During the second wave, average LOS was 7.6 days. One patient (6%) required ICU level of care with intubation, and 2 (12%) patients suffered mortality.

Well characterized examples of cofactors fine tuning serpin activity in the extracellular milieu are known, but such modulation has not been studied for protease-serpin interactions within the cell. Accordingly, we present an investigation into the effect of a DNA-rich environment on the interaction between model serpins (MENT and SCCA-1), cysteine proteases (human cathepsin V and human cathepsin L), and cystatin A. DNA was indeed found to accelerate the rate at which MENT inhibited cathepsin V, a human orthologue of mammalian cathepsin L, up to 50-fold, but unexpectedly this effect was primarily effected via the protease and secondarily by the recruitment of the DNA as a \\"template\\" onto which cathepsin V and MENT are bound. Notably, the protease-mediated effect was found to correspond both with an altered substrate turnover and a conformational change within the protease.

For instance, trainees can reach a specific RPE value by modifying the number of repetitions, lifted loads, or other training variables. Given the multiple approaches of prescribing intensity using RPE and its growing popularity, we compared the effects of two RPE prescription approaches on adherence rates, body composition, performance and psychological outcomes, in an online RT intervention. Methods: We randomly assigned 57 healthy participants without RT experience (60% females, age range: 18C45) to one of two groups that received two weekly RT sessions using a resistance-band for 8 weeks. In the fixed-repetition group, participants adjusted the band resistance with the goal of completing 10 repetitions and reaching a 7-RPE on a 0C10 scale by the 10th repetition. In the open-repetition group, participants selected their preferred band resistance and completed repetitions until reaching a 7-RPE by the final repetition. We measured body composition, performance, and program satisfaction rates. Results: We assessed 46 participants at post-test, 24 from the fixed-repetition group and 22 from the open-repetition group. We observed non-significant and trivial differences between groups in all outcomes (p > 0.05). We then combined the pre-post change scores of the two groups. We found that adherence rates began at 89% and gradually decreased to 42%. On average, participants increased their fat-free mass [0.3 kg (95% CI: 0.1C0.6)], isometric mid-thigh pull [5.5 kg (95% CI: 0.8C10.4)], isometric knee-extension [2.2 kg (95% CI: 0.8C3.7)], and push-ups [6.3 repetitions (95% CI: 4.5C8.2)]. We observed non-significant and trivial changes in bodyweight, grip-force, and countermovement jump. Participants reported high satisfaction rates with all components of the program. Conclusion: Participants in both groups improved their body composition and physical capacity to a similar extent, and reported comparable satisfaction rates with the programs they followed. Accordingly, either prescription approach can be used to deliver online RT sessions based on personal preferences and logistical constraints. However, since adherences rates declined over the course of the study, future research should test additional strategies aiming to maintain adherence rates.","output":"Prescribing Intensity in Resistance Training Using Rating of Perceived Effort: A Randomized Controlled Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antibiotic resistance is a global human health threat, causing routine treatments of bacterial infections to become increasingly difficult.

The physico-mechanical interactions between these nanostructured surfaces and bacteria lead to bacterial killing or prevention of bacterial attachment and subsequent biofilm formation, and thus are promising in circumventing bacterial infections.

The objective of this study was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on body weight and body mass index (BMI) in Saudi Arabia. We used electronic health records obtained from a healthcare system representing five hospitals in three different regions in the Kingdom to examine the change in weight utilizing a longitudinal design. The study included all adults who had visited outpatient clinics in two different time points, pre-2020 (years 2018 and 2019 prior to COVID-19) and post-2020 (the year 2021). Weight and BMI changes in percentages were described. Also, bivariate chi-square test, paired t-test, and multivariable multinomial logistic regression model were used for the analyses. A total of 165,279 individuals were included in the study. On average, a significant weight gain of 0.33 kg (95% CI: 0.29C0.36) was observed in our study. Approximately 10% of the population had shifted to either overweight or obese BMI classes during the study period, as 4.8% of those with normal BMI pre-2020 had shifted to overweight or obese classes at post-2020, and 5.1% of those who were overweight had shifted to obese class. Also, 23.1% of the population had gained 5% or more of their pre-2020 weight, while 17% had lost 5% or more. Young individuals were over three times more likely to gain 5% or more than older individuals (OR: 3.34;95% CI: 3.12C3.56). Females had 24% higher odds to gain 5% or more of their pre-2020 weight than males (OR: 1.24;95% CI: 1.21C1.27). Diabetics were 27% more likely to lose 5% or more than non-diabetics (OR: 1.27;95% CI: 1.23C1.31). Our findings provide insights into the impact of COVID-19 on weight and population health.

The aim of this study is to classify postoperative complications and mortality and to assess the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic may have had on the results. METHODS: this is a non-inferiority retrospective observational study. Two different groups of surgical patients were created: Pre-pandemic COVID and Pandemic COVID. Severity of illness was rated according to the Diagnosis-related Groups (DRG) score. Comparisons were made between groups and between DRG severity score-matched samples. Non-inferiority was set at up to 10 % difference for grade III to V complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification, and up to 2 % difference in mortality. RESULTS: A total of 1649 patients in the PreCOVID group and 763 patients in the COVID group were analysed; 371 patients were matched for DRG severity score 3-4 (236 preCOVID and 135 COVID). No differences were found in relation to re-operation (22.5 % vs. 21.5 %) or late admission to critical care unit (5.1 % vs. 4.5 %). Clavien grade III to V complications occurred in 107 patients (45.3 %) in the PreCOVID group and in 56 patients (41.5 %) in the COVID group, and mortality was 12.7 % and 12.6 %, respectively. During the pandemic, 3 % of patients tested positive for Covid-19 on PCR: 12 patients undergoing elective surgery and 11 emergency surgery; there were 5 deaths, 3 of which were due to respiratory failure following Covid-19-induced pneumonia.

We hypothesized that patient preparedness would be equivalent after preoperative counseling phone calls versus preoperative counseling office visits before prolapse surgery. METHODS: This was an equivalence randomized controlled trial of women undergoing pelvic organ prolapse surgery. Participants were randomized to receive standardized counseling via a preoperative phone call or office visit. The primary outcome was patient preparedness measured on a 5-point Likert scale by the Patient Preparedness Questionnaire at the postoperative visit. A predetermined equivalence margin of 20% was used. Two 1-sided tests for equivalence were used for the primary outcome. RESULTS: We randomized 120 women. The study was concluded early because of COVID-19 and subsequent surgery cancellations. There were 85 participants with primary outcome data (43 offices, 42 phones). Mean age was 62.0 years (1.0) and 64 (75.3%) had stage III or stage IV prolapse. The primary outcome, patient preparedness measured at the postoperative visit, was equivalent between groups (office, n = 43 [97.7%]; phone, n = 42 [97.6%], P < 0.001). Most women reported they would have preferred a phone call (n = 66, 65.5%) with more women in the phone group expressing this preference than the office group (office 40.5% vs phone 90.5%, P < 0.001). Ultimately, nearly all women (96.5%) were satisfied with their method of counseling.

Although it is common to ascertain frailty status utilizing claims-based surrogates (e.g. diagnosis and health service codes) selected according to clinical knowledge, the accuracy of this approach has not yet been examined. We evaluated the accuracy of claims-based surrogates against two clinical definitions of frailty. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in a Health and Retirement Study subsample of 3097 participants, aged 65 years or older and with at least 12-months of continuous fee-for-service Medicare enrollment. We defined 18 previously utilized claims-based surrogates of frailty from Medicare data and evaluated each against clinical reference standards, ascertained from a direct examination: a deficit accumulation frailty index (FI) (range: 0-1) and frailty phenotype. We also compared the accuracy of the total count of 18 claims-based surrogates with that of a validated claims-based FI model, comprised of 93 claims-based variables. RESULTS: 19% of participants met clinical criteria for the clinical frailty phenotype. The mean clinical FI for our sample was 0.20 (standard deviation 0.13). Hospital Beds and associated supplies was the claims-based surrogate associated with the highest clinical FI (mean FI 0.49). Claims-based surrogates had low sensitivity ranging from 0.01 (cachexia, adult failure to thrive, anorexia) to 0.38 (malaise and fatigue) and high specificity ranging from 0.79 (malaise and fatigue) to 0.99 (cachexia, adult failure to thrive, anorexia) in discriminating the clinical frailty phenotype. Compared with a validated claims-based FI, the total count of claims-based surrogates demonstrated lower Spearman correlation with the clinical FI (0.41 [95% CI 0.38-0.44] versus 0.59 [95% CI, 0.56-0.61]) and poorer discrimination of the frailty phenotype (C-statistics 0.68 [95% CI, 0.66-0.70] versus 0.75 [95% CI, 0.73-0.77]).

Pre-pandemic (i.e., within 12 months prior to pandemic onset) and peri-pandemic global cognitive function scores were assessed with the modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS-m). Anxiety, stress, and depressive symptom severity during the pandemic were assessed using validated questionnaires. We examined adherence to protective behaviors that included safe hygiene, social distancing, mask wearing, and staying home. Multivariable models were adjusted for age, race, ethnicity, education, region of residence, alcohol intake, and comorbidities. RESULTS: Every five-point lower pre-pandemic TICS-m score was associated with 0.33-point mean higher (95% CI, 0.20,0.45) perceived stress, and 0.20-point mean higher (95% CI, 0.07,0.32) depressive symptom severity during the pandemic.

Moreover, both Western blot (WB) analysis and fluorescent tracer tests showed that GCRV infection induced the enhancement of autophagy activation in Ctenopharyngodon idella kidney (CIK) cells. Autophagy inducer rapamycin and autophagy inhibitor 3-MA pretreatment can inhibit and promote the proliferation of GCRV, respectively. In addition, grass carp autophagy-related gene 5 (CiATG5)-induced autophagy, as well as rapamycin, showed effects on GCRV replication in CIK cells. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the total number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in CiATG5 overexpression groups was less than that of the control during GCRV infection. Enrichment analysis showed that CiATG5 overexpression induced the enhancement of autophagy, lysosome, phagosome, and apoptosis in the early stage of GCRV infection, which led to the clearance of viruses. In the late stage, steroid biosynthesis, DNA replication, terpenoid backbone biosynthesis, and carbon metabolism were upregulated, which contributed to cell survival. Moreover, signaling pathways involved in the immune response and cell death were downregulated in CiATG5 overexpression groups.

Objectives This research aimed to capture the authentic sounds of this unusual learning experience from the field while it was still fresh and to explore congruence with existing models of online learning success factors. We also aimed to examine the differences between freshman students and more advanced students (second?year onwards) with regard to the emerging data and its respective model. Methods During the second semester of 2020, 170 Tel Aviv university students majoring in various fields responded to an online questionnaire consisting of open-ended questions. Results and conclusions The researchers classified the themes retrieved from 1559 statements into a framework of critical success factors for distance learning. The framework included five dimensions: course, student, instructor, learning environment and institution. Well-known benefits of distance learning emerged, among them flexibility and personalized learning pace. Nevertheless, the findings revealed that the rapid transition to distance learning posed challenges and difficulties, mainly concerning the readiness of students and instructors for this form of teaching and learning. The number of statements in instructor dimension indicated the importance of providing support and training to instructors and staff. Significant differences were found in students' perceptions according to the year standing.

It was also considered the only horned species occurring in European waters. Our sequence data of five gene fragments suggest the presence of two horned sibling Spiophanes species in northern Europe: S. cf. bombyx in the North and the Norwegian seas, and S. cf. convexus in Brittany, northern France, and Bay of Biscay, northern Spain. Spiophanes cf. bombyx worms are genetically close to a single examined specimen of S. bombyx from Venice Lagoon, Italy but their conspecificity should be verified by further study. Our sequence data show that horned Spiophanes from the North Pacific are genetically distant from horned European species, and that S. uschakowi Zachs, 1933, originally described from the Sea of Japan (East Sea) is a valid species. The data also suggest the presence of two horned sibling Spiophanes species in the North East Pacific: S. hakaiensis Radashevsky & Pankova, n. sp. distributed from Alaska south to about Point Conception, and S. norrisi Mei?ner & Blank, 2009, distributed from San Francisco Bay south to Baja California Sur, Mexico. Spiophanes from South America, morphologically similar to S. norrisi, are suggested to belong to a new species. Molecular data also suggest the presence of two sibling species among the worms from northern Europe identified by morphology as S. kroyeri Grube, 1860. Worms from the Barents Sea and northern part of the North Sea are tentatively referred to as S. cf. kroyeri; worms from the northern and central parts of the North Sea and from the Bay of Biscay, northern Spain, are tentatively referred to as S. cf. cirrata M. Sars in G.O. Sars, 1872. Sequence data also show that S. duplex from California is genetically different from morphologically similar worms from South America. The South American worms are referred to resurrected S. soederstroemi Hartman, 1953 which was originally described from off Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, and then considered as a junior synonym of S. duplex. Analysis of divergence times of Spiophanes lineages suggested that the origin of the most recent common ancestor of horned Spiophanes with metameric nuchal organs was around 11.1 mya (95% HPD: 5.1-19.0 mya) and that the divergence of the North Atlantic and North Pacific lineages was around 7.9 mya (95% HPD: 4.1-13.3 mya). The North Atlantic lineage was estimated to have diverged 4.8 mya (95% HPD: 2.2-8.6 mya), resulting in the origin of S. cf. bombyx and S. cf. convexus. The North Pacific lineage was estimated to have diverged first by the isolation and speciation of S. norrisi 1.7 mya (95% HPD: 2.3-1.0 mya), and then by the isolation and speciation of S. uschakowi and S. hakaiensis n. sp. 1.3 mya (95% HPD: 2.0-0.7 mya).

Collective interhospital transport of critically ill COVID-19 patients as a way to mitigate the localised pressure from overloaded intensive care units at a national or international level has not been reported yet. The aim of this study was to provide descriptive data about the first six collective aeromedical evacuation (MEDEVAC) of COVID-19 patients performed within Europe. METHODS: This retrospective study included all adult patients transported by the first six collective MEDEVAC missions for COVID-19 patients performed within Europe on the 18th, 21st, 24th, 27th, 31st of March and the 3rd of April 2020. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were transported aboard six MEDEVAC missions. The median duration of mechanical ventilation in ICU before transportation was 4 days (3-5.25). The median PaO2/FiO2 ratio obtained before, during the flight and at day 1 after the transport was 180 mmHg (156-202,5), 143 mmHg (118,75-184,75) and 174 mmHg (129,5-205,5), respectively, with no significant difference. The median norepinephrine infusion rate observed before, during the flight and at day 1 after the transport was 0,08 g/kg-1. min-1 (0,00-0,20), 0,08 (0,00-0,25), and 0,07 (0,03-0,18), respectively, with no significant difference.

However, the benefits of this approach have never been scientifically validated. We thus compared the early and late administration of rocuronium before and after checking mask ventilation to investigate the efficiency of mask ventilation and the time to tracheal intubation in patients with normal airways. METHODS Patients (n = 114) were randomized to receive IV rocuronium either before (early rocuronium group, n = 58) or after (late rocuronium group, n = 56) checking mask ventilation. Expiratory tidal volumes (VTs) were measured at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 seconds after apnea during mask ventilation. We graded the ease of mask ventilation and measured the time from apnea to tracheal intubation. The primary outcome was the average of mask VTs measured at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 seconds after apnea. The main secondary outcome was the time from apnea to tracheal intubation. STATA was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS The average of mask VTs measured at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 seconds after apnea was larger in the early rocuronium group than in the late rocuronium group (552 mL breath [165 mL breath] vs 393 mL breath [165 mL breath], mean difference, 160 mL breath; 95% CI, 98-221 mL breath; P < .001, unpaired t test). Because the interaction between time and group was significant in mask VTs measured at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 seconds after apnea (P < .001, linear mixed effects model), pairwise comparisons were performed at the 6 time points. The differences in VTs between the groups were significant at 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 seconds after apnea (P < .001 each, contrast statements in STATA). The time from apnea to tracheal intubation was shorter in the early rocuronium group than in the late rocuronium group (116 seconds [42 seconds] vs 195 seconds [41 seconds]; mean difference, -79 seconds; 95% CI, -96 to -64 seconds, P < .001).

We aimed to assess the feasibility of a single-incision approach, using a flexible endoscopic preperitoneal tunneling for catheter implantation and fixation. MATERIALS AND METHODS Eight pigs were involved in this experimental study. A 2/0 Vicryl loop was sutured at the tip of a PD catheter. In 4 pigs, a 1.5 cm incision was made on the left paramedian line and the parietal peritoneal layer was identified by splitting rectal muscles. A gastroscope was inserted in the incision and advanced in the extraperitoneal space. An exit hole was made in the peritoneum over the low pelvic cavity. A guidewire was left in the abdominal cavity, and the PD catheter was inserted over the guidewire. The endoscope was inserted in the tunnel again, and endoscopic clips were deployed over the Vicryl loop to fix the catheter. In 4 pigs, the PD catheter was inserted laparoscopically using a two-port approach. The catheter's tip was fixed with laparoscopic clips on the Vicryl loop. A strain test to assess the force required to detach clips was performed using a digital dynamometer. RESULTS Operative time for flexible endoscopic tunneling was longer when compared to the laparoscopic implant (29.5  4.43 vs. 22.7  2.51 min). Mean force to displace the catheter was similar after flexible endoscopic fixation when compared to laparoscopic clip fixation (5.57 N  2.76 vs. 4.15 N  1.76).

An overview of PubMed literature depicting the state of the art of urology residency in the COVID-19 era was performed as well, to contextualize the issue. METHODS: An online learning event for residents was set up at the beginning of the pandemic; the faculty consisted of experts in urology who provided on-line lectures and videos on surgical anatomy, procedures, updates in guidelines, technology, training. The audience was composed of 30-500 attendees from Italy, USA, India and Belgium. A questionnaire to analyze relevance, satisfaction and popularity of the lessons was mailed to 30 local residents. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Almost all residents defined the web environment suitable to achieve the learning outcomes; the method, the number and the competence of the faculty were appropriate/excellent. Most of the younger residents (81.8%) stated their surgical knowledge would improve after the course; 72.7% declared they would take advantage into routine inpatients clinical activity. Nineteen more expert residents agreed that the course would improve their surgical knowledge and enhance their practical skills; almost all stated that the initiative would change their outpatients and inpatients practice. Overall, 44 articles available in PubMed have addressed the concern of urological learning and training during the pandemic from different standpoints; four of them considered residents' general perception towards web-based learning programs. CONCLUSIONS: The paper confirms residents' satisfaction with e-learning methods and, to our knowledge, is the first one focusing on a specific event promptly settled up at the beginning of the outbreak.

A systemic review and meta-analysis of COVID-19 positive hip fracture patients (CPHFPs) undergoing surgery was conducted to explore the association of COVID-19 with short-term mortality. METHODS: Review of the literature identified reports of short-term 30-day postoperative mortality in CPHFPs. For studies including a contemporary control group of COVID-19 negative patients, odds ratios of the association between COVID-19 infection and short-term mortality were calculated. Short-term mortality and the association between COVID-19 infection and short-term mortality were meta-analyzed and stratified by hospital screening type using random effects models. RESULTS: Seventeen reports were identified. The short-term mortality in CPHFPs was 34% (95% C.I., 30C39%). Short-term mortality differed slightly across studies that screened all patients, 30% (95% C.I., 22C39%), compared to studies that conditionally screened patients, 36% (95% C.I., 31C42%), (P = 0.22). The association between COVID-19 infection and short-term mortality produced an odds ratio of 7.16 (95% C.I., 4.99C10.27), and this was lower for studies that screened all patients, 4.08 (95% C.I., 2.31C7.22), compared to studies that conditionally screened patients, 8.32 (95% C.I., 5.68C12.18), (P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: CPHFPs have a short-term mortality rate of 34%. The odds ratio of short-term mortality was significantly higher in studies that screened patients conditionally than in studies that screened all hip fracture patients.

DESIGN: Qualitative research using semistructured interviews, via video or telephone conferencing. SETTING: Services providing postdiagnostic support across health, social care and the third sector. PARTICIPANTS: 21 professionals previously recruited to an ongoing research programme on postdiagnostic dementia care (or colleagues, if unavailable). RESULTS: Key themes identified from the data were: challenges caused by COVID-19; responses to those challenges, including a widespread shift to remote working; and effects of COVID-19 on future postdiagnostic support. Challenges included changing and sometimes conflicting guidelines; a lack of access to support; identifying and responding to emerging needs; emotional and physical impact of COVID-19; and balancing COVID-19 risk with other risks such as deterioration. Some dementia services closed, while others adapted and continued to provide support thus potentially widening existing inequalities. There were also some unintended positive outcomes, including improved cross-sector and multidisciplinary working between professionals. CONCLUSION: Delivering postdiagnostic dementia support during COVID-19 required essential adaptations.

Although some patients qualify for Medicaid (a public program that can help cover health care costs), laws in some states restrict the use of Medicaid for abortion care. In 2017, Illinois passed House Bill 40 (HB-40), which allowed patients with Medicaid to receive coverage for their abortion. This study aimed to understand how HB-40 affected abortion affordability from the perspectives of individuals that work directly or indirectly with abortion patients or facilities providing abortion care. METHODS: We conducted interviews with clinicians and administrators from facilities that provided abortion services; staff from organizations that provided resources to abortion providers or patients; and individuals at organizations involved in the passage and/or implementation of HB-40. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. We created codes based on the interview guides, coded each transcript using the web application Dedoose, and summarized findings by code. RESULTS: Interviews were conducted with 38 participants. Participants reflected that HB-40 seemed to remove a significant financial barrier for Medicaid recipients and improve the experience for patients seeking abortion care. Participants also described how the law led to a shift in resource allocation, allowing financial support to be directed towards uninsured patients. Some participants thought HB-40 might contribute to a reduction in abortion stigma. Despite the perceived positive impacts of the law, participants noted a lack of public knowledge about HB-40, as well as confusing or cumbersome insurance-related processes, could diminish the laws impact. Participants also highlighted persisting barriers to abortion utilization for minors, recent and undocumented immigrants, and people residing in rural areas, even after the passage of HB-40. CONCLUSIONS: HB-40 was perceived to improve the affordability of abortion. However, participants identified additional obstacles to abortion care in Illinois that weakened the impact of HB-40 for patients and required further action, Findings suggest that policymakers must also consider how insurance coverage can be disrupted by other legal barriers for historically excluded populations and ensure clear information on Medicaid enrollment and abortion coverage is widely disseminated.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is most commonly believed to cause severe disease manifestations secondary to a cytokine storm. Low testosterone is associated with a proinflammatory environment and it is thought that a eugonadal testosterone level may be protective of increased cytokine activity. Objective: In this study, we explore the association between baseline testosterone level and COVID-19 clinical outcomes. METHODS: Through a retrospective chart review, we identified 188 males from an academic health system in a metropolitan area diagnosed with COVID-19 with measured baseline testosterone levels who were not on testosterone replacement therapy. The 188 males were divided into eugonadal (n=90, >300 ng/dL) and hypogonadal (n=98, 300 ng/dL) testosterone groups. Data regarding comorbidities and endpoints such as hospital admission, intensive care unit admission, ventilator utilization, and thromboembolic events were extracted. Chi-square and Fisher's Exact tests examined differences in categorical variables. Logistic regression analysis tested the relationship between testosterone level and endpoints. RESULTS: There were 188 men identified who met our inclusion criteria. There were 90 men in the eugonadal group and 98 men in the hypogonadal group. Median age (IQR) was 55 (43-67) for the eugonadal group and 55 (40-63) for the hypogonadal group, median BMI was 30.6 (27.7-35.4) and 31.3 (26.4-35.6), and median testosterone level was 396 (357-476.3 ng/dL) and 217 (141.3 - 255 ng/dL) for the two groups respectively. Hypogonadism was significantly related to hospital admission (p=0.027). While not statistically significant, there were more ICU admissions (p=0.75), ventilator use (p=0.75), and DVTs seen in the hypogonadal group. On logistic regression analysis, hypogonadism was predictive of hospital admission (p=0.021). CONCLUSIONS: Eugonadal testosterone level may be protective of more severe clinical outcomes in COVID-19.

This testing helped in understanding the immunogenicity, community prevalence, geographical spread, conditions post-infection. However, with the contagious nature of the virus, biological specimen sampling involved the risk of transmission and spread of infection. Clinic or pathology visit was the most concerning part.

Existing schemes in ICUs today require laborious manual input of many complex parameters. In this work, we present a scheme that uses variations in vital signs over a 24-h period to make mortality risk assessments for 3-day, 7-day, and 14-day windows. We develop a hybrid neural network model that combines convolutional (CNN) layers with bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) to predict mortality from statistics describing the variation of heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, blood oxygen levels, and temperature. Our scheme performs strongly compared to state-of-the-art schemes in the literature for mortality prediction, with our highest-performing model achieving an area under the receiver-operator curve of 0.884. We conclude that the use of a hybrid CNN-BiLSTM network is highly effective in determining mortality risk for the 3, 7, and 14 day windows from vital signs. As vital signs are routinely recorded, in many cases automatically, our scheme could be implemented such that highly accurate mortality risk could be predicted continuously and automatically, reducing the burden on healthcare providers and improving patient outcomes.","output":"Continuous and automatic mortality risk prediction using vital signs in the intensive care unit: a hybrid neural network approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Myeloperoxidase-specific ANCA (MPO-ANCA) are implicated in the pathogenesis of vasculitis and GN. Kinins play a major role during acute inflammation by regulating vasodilatation and vascular permeability and by modulating adhesion and migration of leukocytes. Kinin system activation occurs in patients with ANCA vasculitis. Previous studies in animal models of GN and sclerosing kidney diseases have demonstrated protective effects of bradykinin receptor 1 (B1R) blockade via interference with myeloid cell trafficking. METHODS: To investigate the role of B1R in a murine model of MPO-ANCA GN, we evaluated effects of B1R genetic ablation and pharmacologic blockade. We used bone marrow chimeric mice to determine the role of B1R in bone marrow-derived cells (leukocytes) versus nonbone marrow-derived cells. We elucidated mechanisms of B1R effects using in vitro assays for MPO-ANCA-induced neutrophil activation, endothelial adherence, endothelial transmigration, and neutrophil adhesion molecule surface display. RESULTS: B1R deficiency or blockade prevented or markedly reduced ANCA-induced glomerular crescents, necrosis, and leukocyte influx in mice. B1R was not required for in vitro MPO-ANCA-induced neutrophil activation. Leukocyte B1R deficiency, but not endothelial B1R deficiency, decreased glomerular neutrophil infiltration induced by MPO-ANCA in vivo. B1R enhanced ANCA-induced neutrophil endothelial adhesion and transmigration in vitro. ANCA-activated neutrophils exhibited changes in Mac-1 and LFA-1, important regulators of neutrophil endothelial adhesion and transmigration: ANCA-activated neutrophils increased surface expression of Mac-1 and increased shedding of LFA-1, whereas B1R blockade reduced these effects. CONCLUSIONS: The leukocyte B1R plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of MPO-ANCA-induced GN in a mouse model by modulating neutrophil-endothelial interaction. B1R blockade may have potential as a therapy for ANCA GN and vasculitis.","output":"Kinin B1 Receptor Is Important in the Pathogenesis of Myeloperoxidase-Specific ANCA GN"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: The French population is facing the COVID-19 pandemic and the health systems have been reoriented in emergency for the care of patients with coronavirus The management of cancers of the urinary and male genital tracts must be adapted to this context MATERIAL AND METHOD: An expert opinion documented by a literature review was formulated by the Cancerology Committee of the French Association of Urology (CCAFU) RESULTS: The medical and surgical management of patients with any cancers of the urinary and male genital tracts must be adapted by modifying the consultation methods, by prioritizing interventions according to the intrinsic prognosis of cancers, taking into account the patient's comorbidities The protection of urologists from COVID-19 must be considered CONCLUSION: The CCAFU issues an expert opinion on the measure to be taken to adapt the management of cancers of the male urinary and genital tract to the context of pandemic by COVID-19 [[[fr]]]Resume Objectif: La population francaise est confrontee a la pandemie de COVID-19 et le systemes de sante a ete reoriente en urgence pour la prise en charge des patients atteint du coronavirus La prise en charge des cancers de l'appareil urinaire et genital masculin doit etre adaptee a ce contexte Materiel et methode: Un avis d'experts documente par une revue de la litterature a ete formule par le Comite de Cancerologie de l'Association Francaise d'Urologie (CCAFU) Resultats: La prise en charge medicale et chirurgicale des patients atteint de cancers de l'appareil urinaire et genital masculin doit etre adaptee en modifiant les modalites de consultation, en priorisant les interventions en fonction du pronostic intrinseque des cancers en tenant compte des comorbidites du patient La protection des urologues vis-a-vis du COVID-19 doit etre prise en consideration CONCLUSION: Le CCAFU emet un avis d'experts quant aux mesures a prendre pour adapter la prise en charge des cancers de l'appareil urinaire et genital masculin au contexte de pandemie par COVID-19","output":"[Recommendations CCAFU on the management of cancers of the urogenital system during an epidemic with Coronavirus COVID-19.]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Improvements in genetic and genomic technology have enabled field-deployable molecular laboratories and these have been deployed in a variety of epidemics that capture headlines.

During 2 visits to each farm in March and September, 2010, observations were made on the environment, feed, and health management, followed by bulk milk testing, clinical evaluation, and breed assessment of each individual cow, and an evaluation of diseases and treatments reported within the period. Additional data were collected directly from the farmers through direct interviews. The number of lactating cows was, on average, 11 (range 5 to 19) in the ORG and 16 (range 7 to 42) in the CONV herds. The ORG herds presented a lower percentage of the Holstein breed; whereas CONV herds were predominantly Holstein, in the ORG herds, only 2 herds were 100% Holstein and the remaining herds were crosses of Holstein, Jersey, and Gir (Bos indicus) cattle. Milk production per cow was lower (10.2 vs. 15.1  1.22 L/cow, respectively) in ORG than in the CONV farms. The ORG farms offered less concentrate feed than CONV farms and had better pasture management. Organic farmers reported using phytotherapic and homeopathic products, and pasture management as a strategy to keep infection levels of endo- and ectoparasites low, whereas CONV farmers regularly used anthelmintics and acaricides.

As the crisis caused by the pandemic shifts from acute to protracted, attention should be paid to the devastating impacts on HCWs' mental health and social well-being. Digital technologies are being harnessed to support the responses to the pandemic, which provide opportunities to advance mental health and psychological support for HCWs. OBJECTIVE: To develop a framework to describe and organize the mental health and psychological issues that HCWs are facing during the pandemic. Based on the framework, this study also proposed interventions from digital health perspectives, which HCWs could leverage during and after the pandemic. METHODS: The psychological problems and mental health issues that HCWs have been encountered during the COVID-19 pandemic were reviewed and analyzed based on the proposed MEET (Mental health, Environment, Event, and Technology) framework, which also demonstrated the interactions of the mental health, digital interventions, and social support. RESULTS: HCWs are facing increased risks of mental health issues from the COVID-19 pandemic, including burnout, fear, worry, distress, pressure, anxiety, and depression. These negative emotional stressors may cause psychological problems for HCWs and affect their physical and mental health. Digital technologies and platforms are playing pivotal roles in mitigating psychological issues and providing effective support. The proposed MEET framework could provide structured guidelines for further studies on how technology interacts with mental and psychological health for different populations. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic presents unprecedented challenges due to prolonged uncertainty, immediate threat to patient safety, and evolving professional demands. It is urgent to protect the mental health and strengthen the psychological resilience of HCWs. Given the pandemic will exist for a long time, caring for mental health has been a new normal, which needs a strengthened multi-sector collaboration to facilitate the support and reduce health disparities. The proposed framework could enable a better understanding of how to mitigate the psychological effects during the pandemic, recover from associated experiences, and provide comprehensive institutional and societal infrastructures for HCWs' well-being.","output":"Advancing Mental Health and Psychological Support for Health Care Workers Using Digital Technologies and Platforms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) were identified as restriction factors of influenza A virus (IAV).

The frequency of CD11c(+) B cells was positively correlated with serum TRAb levels. The flow cytometry data showed that CD11c expression was higher in a variety of B-cell subsets and that CD11c(+) B cells presented a distinct immunophenotype compared to paired CD11c(-) B cells. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining indicated the presence of CD11c(+)CD19(+) B cells in lymphocyte infiltration areas of the GD thyroid. Flow cytometric analysis of PB and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) samples showed that compared to PB CD11c(+) B cells, CD11c(+) B cells in the thyroid accumulated and further differentiated. We found that CD11c(+) B cells from the PB of GD patients were induced to differentiate into autoreactive antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) capable of secreting TRAbs in vitro. Luminex liquid suspension chip detection data showed that CD11c(+) B cells also secreted a variety of cytokines, including proinflammatory cytokines, anti-inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines, which might play roles in regulating the local inflammatory response and infiltration of lymphocytes in the thyroid. In addition, we performed a chemotaxis assay in a Transwell chamber to verify that CD11c(+) B cells were recruited by thyroid follicular cells (TFCs) via the CXCR3-CXCL10 axis.

This study compares US counties with and without mask mandates and determines if the mandates are associated with reduced daily COVID-19 infection. US counties have debated whether masks effectively decrease COVID-19 cases, and political pressures have prevented some counties from passing mask mandates. This article investigates the utility of mask mandates in small US counties. OBJECTIVES This study aims to analyze the effectiveness of mask mandates in small US counties and places where the population density may not be as high as in larger urban counties and to determine the efficacy of countywide mask mandates in reducing daily COVID-19 infection. METHODS The counties studied were those with populations between 40,000 and 105,000 in states that did not have statewide mask mandates. A total of 38 counties were utilized in the study, half with and half without mask mandates. Test counties were followed for 30 days after implementing their mask mandate, and daily new SARS-CoV-2 infection was recorded during this timeframe. The counties were in four randomly selected states that did not have statewide mask mandates. The controls utilized were from counties with similar populations to the test counties and were within the same state as the test county. Controls were followed for the same 30 days as their respective test county. Data were analyzed utilizing t-test and difference-in-difference analyses comparing counties with mask mandates and those without. RESULTS These data showed statistically significant lower averages of SARS-CoV-2 daily infection in counties that passed mask mandates when compared with counties that did not.

MHPs reported good overall mental health. Most MHPs reported no post-traumatic stress, and their scores were significantly lower compared to HPs working closely with COVID-19 patients. MHPs hyperarousal scores were also significantly lower compared to HPs working closely with COVID-19 patients, while their intrusion scores were statistically significantly lower than those of all other professionals. Multivariable logistic regressions showed that MHPs had lower odds of exhibiting state anxiety and low personal accomplishment compared to HPs not working closely with COVID-19 patients. In sum, MHPs seem to show almost preserved mental health. Thus, given the high mental healthcare demand during a pandemic, it would be useful to rely on these professionals, especially for structuring interventions to improve and support the mental health of the general population and other healthcare workers.","output":"Anxiety, Post-Traumatic Stress, and Burnout in Health Professionals during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Comparing Mental Health Professionals and Other Healthcare Workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"International studies about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the quality of general education have yielded contradictory results: educational outcomes have fallen markedly in some countries while remaining more or less constant in others. At the same time, over half of published studies attest to the growth of educational inequality during the pandemic. The present article assesses the impact of the pandemic using the data of a regional monitoring study of all schoolchildren in grades 4, 6 and 8 in the Krasnoyarsk Region in 2019 and 2021. Tests of reading literacy in grades 4 and 6 as well as of science literacy in grade 8 have shown the satisfactory psychometric quality. Multilevel regression analysis was used to show that the level of functional literacy of the pandemic cohort of schoolchildren, controlled for contextual characteristics, was significantly lower for students in all grades except grade 4. The biggest loss was found for scienti- fic literacy. No correlation was found between the pandemic effect size and the socioeconomic composition of the class (the gap between children with different SES remains at the same level as it was before the pandemic).

However, there is a lack of research on the potential buffering effect of resilience on the psychological impact of COVID-19 as related to mental health. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to examine protective effects of resilience on mental health during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in Austria. Analysis was based on data collected from 4,113 Austrian residents, who participated in an anonymous online survey. The survey addressed sociodemographic data, the subjective response to COVID-19 (Impact of Event Scale; IES-R), mental health status (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale; DASS-21), and resilience (Resilience-Scale; RS-11). Structural equation modelling showed significant positive associations between the IES-R score and depressive symptoms, stress and anxiety, respectively. Resilience was significantly negatively associated with depression, stress, and anxiety. Furthermore, resilience moderated the relation between the impact of COVID-19 and anxiety symptoms. However, there was no moderating effect of resilience on the relationship between IES-R and both depression and stress. The psychological impact of COVID-19 on anxiety symptoms seems to vary with the level of resilience. Moderating effects of resilience on the relation between impact of COVID-19 and stress and depression symptoms could not be confirmed.

METHODS: Using data from a nationally representative cross\\\\sectional survey conducted in October 2020 among 855 adults (18 years) in Greece, we estimated support rates for mandatory vaccination and respondents' intention to get vaccinated for COVID\\\\19 as well as associations thereof with individual sociodemographic, clinical and contextual characteristics. RESULTS: About 74% of respondents supported mandatory vaccination and 62% intended to get vaccinated for COVID\\\\19. The most prevalent reasons against COVID\\\\19 vaccination were safety concerns related to the duration of clinical trials and potential side effects. Individuals who reported increased trust in healthcare authorities' recommendations, who revealed that their trust in the State increased due to the way the COVID\\\\19 pandemic was handled, who used preventive services more often, and those with higher income were more likely to both support mandatory vaccination and to indicate intention to get vaccinated for COVID\\\\19. Participants with worse or better self\\\\reported health status (compared to average), younger adults, and females were less likely to intend to get vaccinated for COVID\\\\19. CONCLUSION: The survey revealed that the majority of the Greek citizens favour mandatory vaccination overall and intend to get vaccinated for COVID\\\\19, driven mostly by utilization of preventive services and trust in healthcare authorities. However, intention to get vaccinated for COVID\\\\19 was lower relative to mandatory vaccination support.

This study aimed to identify correlated factors for depression/anxiety among children and adolescents after COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. METHODS: An online survey by cluster sampling was conducted after lockdown in 5175 Chinese children and adolescents with informed consents from their parents. The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scales with 10-point cutoff were used to measure depression and anxiety, separately. Stepwise logistic regression was conducted. Stata 15.1 Version was used. RESULTS: 12.33% and 6.26% of all participants reported depression and anxiety after lockdown, separately. Suicidal ideation, quarreling with parents, insomnia, difficulty in concentrating during online learning, and anxious and depressed mood during lockdown were positively associated with depression and anxiety after lockdown. Missing teachers was negatively associated with both depression and anxiety. Living in urban and not living with parents were positively associated with depression. LIMITATIONS: The past history and familial history of mental disorders have not been collected. The recall biases for collecting self-reporting information might exist, and the causal inferences cannot be drawn. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of depression and anxiety in children and adolescents might decline a bit after lockdown but is still at a high level after lockdown.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Image data of nine cadaveric human lungs were acquired using U-HRCT. Three different matrix images of U-HRCT images were obtained with two acquisition modes: normal mode (512-matrix image) and super-high-resolution mode (1024- and 2048-matrix image). SR-DL used 512- and 1024-matrix images as training data for deep learning. The virtual 2048-matrix images were acquired by applying SR-DL to the 1024-matrix images. Three independent observers scored normal anatomical structures and abnormal computed tomography (CT) findings of both types of 2048-matrix images on a 3-point scale compared to 1024-matrix images. The image noise values were quantitatively calculated. Moreover, the edge rise distance (ERD) and edge rise slope (ERS) were also calculated using the CT attenuation profile to evaluate margin sharpness. RESULTS: The virtual 2048-matrix images significantly improved visualization of normal anatomical structures and abnormal CT findings, except for consolidation and nodules, compared with the conventional 2048-matrix images (p < 0.01). Quantitative noise values were significantly lower in the virtual 2048-matrix images than in the conventional 2048-matrix images (p < 0.001). ERD was significantly shorter in the virtual 2048-matrix images than in the conventional 2048-matrix images (p < 0.01). ERS was significantly higher in the virtual 2048-matrix images than in the conventional 2048-matrix images (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: SR-DL using original U-HRCT images as a training dataset might be a promising tool for image enhancement in terms of margin sharpness and image noise reduction. By applying trained SR-DL to U-HRCT SHR mode images, virtual ultra-high-resolution images were obtained which surpassed the image quality of unmodified SHR mode images.","output":"A novel strategy to develop deep learning for image super-resolution using original ultra-high-resolution computed tomography images of lung as training dataset"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On February 21, 2020 Lebanon reported its first case of COVID-19 1 The World Health Organization2 declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11 2 As the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic evolved, Healthcare Workers (HCW) started facing challenges they had never encountered before, in their professional and personal lives 3 ? 2020, American University of Beirut All rights reserved","output":"Wellbeing and stress management during the covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Ukrainians numbering approximately 1.2 million are the largest migrant group in Poland. Data on vaccination coverage among migrants are not collected in EU, including Poland. Therefore, this qualitative study aimed to identify vaccination practices in this migrant group, to explore facilitators and barriers to vaccination and related access to Polish healthcare services. METHODS: In September 2019, a qualitative study of Ukrainian migrants (UMs) living in Szczecin, Poland, and recruited through a snowball sampling method, was conducted. Using a semi-structured topic guide, four focus groups were held with 22 UMs aged 18C45. Participants were asked about their attitudes towards vaccination in general with comparison between services in Poland and Ukraine. Following transcription and translation, a thematic analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Respondents were distrustful of Ukrainian vaccination policy, medical personnel and individual vaccines, however, they often returned to Ukraine for dental and gynaecological appoint-ments. While critical with regards to registering with Polish GPs practices, UMs were confident in health professionals, as well as vaccine delivery. Vaccines were perceived as safer and of better quality than in Ukraine. Difficulties in translating vaccination records were rarely reported, verbal communi-cation was not problematic due to language similarities. All UM parents reported vaccinating their children according to the Polish schedule. However, a significant number of adult UMs have not completed mandatory vaccinations, although they may have obtained false immunization certificates; according to UMs those can be obtained by bribing. Participants reported lower acceptance of the influenza vaccine, mainly due to perceptions around its importance; none had been vaccinated against influenza. None of UMs had heard of the HPV vaccine. UMs experienced challenges in accessing credible online vaccination information in Ukrainian, no official local health authority vaccination material existed either, except for information about measles. CONCLUSIONS: This study pinpointed positive UM attitudes and practices regarding child vaccination in the Polish healthcare system and identified issues for improvement, such as adult vaccination. Health communication should be more tailored within UMs information delivery systems to enable migrants to make informed choices about vaccination. Further research is needed to better assess factors affecting vaccine uptake identified in this study.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of adults with COVID-19 admitted to one intensive care unit, in those who underwent APP and controls. Patients in both groups had type 1 respiratory failure requiring oxygen (but not initially intubated), confirmed SARS-CoV-2 PCR by nasopharyngeal swab and findings of multifocal ground-glass opacities on imaging. For the APP group, serial SpO(2)/FiO(2) measurements were recorded after each proning episode. RESULTS: Of 77 patients admitted, 50 (65%) were excluded because they had already been intubated. Another 7 (9%) had undergone APP prior to admission. Of the remaining 20, 10 underwent APP and 10 were controls. Patients in both groups had similar demographics, subsequent intubation and survival. Of those who underwent APP, SpO(2)/FiO(2) was most likely to increase after the first episode (before median: 152, IQR 135C185; after: median 192, IQR 156C234, p=0.04). Half of participants (5) in the APP group were unable to tolerate more than two APP episodes. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care are not suitable for APP. Of those who are, many cannot tolerate more than two episodes. Improvements in SpO(2)/FiO(2) secondary to APP are transient and most likely in the first episode.

While world health organization recommends HIV exposed infants to be tested between 4 to 6 weeks of age, in developing countries like Ethiopia, access to timely infant testing is still very limited. The study is intended to assess timely infant testing, testing for HIV at the 18th month, test results and factors influencing HIV positivity among infants born to HIV positive mothers in public hospitals of Mekelle, Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was employed on 558 HIV exposed infants, using consecutive sampling technique. A checklist was used to extract 4 years (January 2014CDecember 2017) secondary data, collected from JanuaryCApril 2018. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20, and binary logistic regression model was used to examine the association of independent variables with the outcome variables. RESULTS: Timely infant testing for HIV accounted for 346(62.0%). Mothers who attended antenatal care (AOR: 2.77; 95% CI: 1.17, 6.55) and who were counselled on feeding options (AOR: 2.01; 95% CI: 1.11, 3.65) were strongly associated with timely infant testing.

Our data track seven types of violations of democratic standards for emergency measures during the Covid-19 pandemic: discriminatory measures, derogation of non-derogable rights, abusive enforcement, no time limit on emergency measures, disproportionate limitations on the role of the legislature, official disinformation campaigns, and restrictions on media freedoms. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of the extent to which governments have violated democratic standards in their response to Covid-19. Using a regression analysis, we find no relationship between violations of democratic standards for emergency measures and Covid-19 death rates.

During this time, prioritisation of clinical services in the National Health Services underwent rapid change in response to the pandemic. Lung cancer diagnosis and treatment is coordinated by a specialist local lung cancer multidisciplinary team. Buckinghamshire NHS Trust serves a population of 500 000 people, with 200 new lung cancer diagnoses each year. Early detection and treatment of cancer improves prognosis and 5-year survival rates, so any effects on the lung cancer treatment pathway may have significant long-term implications. In this study, we investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on lung cancer diagnosis in Buckinghamshire UK between March and September 2020. Method: We retrospectively reviewed patients diagnosed with lung cancer in Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust between March to September 2020 and compared this patient cohort with a matched time period for previous years. We examined gross case numbers, histological diagnosis and staging at start of treatment. Results: The number of patients diagnosed with lung cancer is lower in the March to September 2020 (118 patients) period when compared to the years 2019, 2018 and 2017 (127, 124 and 139 patients respectively) (Fig 1). For non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a greater proportion of patients presented at a later stage;at the start of treatment lung cancer stage I, II, III and IV constituted 18.4%, 5.2%, 15.7% and 60.5% respectively in 2020 and 22.5%, 6.4%, 22.5% and 48.3% in 2019. There was no difference in the number of cases of small cell lung cancer diagnosed in 2020 compared to previous years. Conclusion: Lung cancer diagnosis rates have decreased between March to September 2020 by 9.2% compared to 2017-2019. Patients with lung cancer also presented in later disease stages which may negatively impact their prognosis. Although our results may be within normal variation limits, it is possible some of the changes could be attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic and with the ongoing spread of COVID-19, this is an area which we must continue to monitor closely. By identifying where the delay is in the diagnosis and treatment pathway, we can learn from this in the future and strengthen our healthcare systems accordingly.

We here report the Pavia Emergency Medicine network response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The out-of-hospital response was analysed in terms of calls, rescues and missions, whereas the hospital response was detailed as number of admitted patients and subsequent hospitalisation or discharge. The data in the first 5 weeks of the Covid-19 outbreak (February 21CMarch 26, 2020) were compared with a reference time window referring to the previous 5 weeks (January 17CFebruary 20, 2020) and with the corresponding historical average data from the previous 5 years (February 21CMarch 26). Since February 21, 2020, a sudden and sustained increase in the calls to the AREU 112 system was noted (+ 440%). After 5 weeks, the number of calls and missions was still higher as compared to both the reference pre-Covid-19 period (+ 48% and + 10%, respectively) and the historical control (+ 53% and + 22%, respectively). Owing to the overflow from the neighbouring hospitals, which rapidly became overwhelmed and had to temporarily close patient access, the population served by the Pavia system more than doubled (from 547.251 to 1.135.977 inhabitants, + 108%). To minimize the possibility of intra-hospital spreading of the infection, a separate Emergency DepartmentInfective Disease was created, which evaluated 1241 patients with suspected infection (38% of total ED admissions). Out of these 1241 patients, 58.0% (n = 720) were admitted in general wards (n = 629) or intensive care unit (n = 91). To allow this massive number of admissions, the hospital reshaped many general ward Units, which became Covid-19 Units (up to 270 beds) and increased the intensive care unit beds from 32 to 60. In the setting of a long-standing continuing emergency like the present Covid-19 outbreak, the integration, interaction and team work of the out-of-hospital and in-hospital systems have a pivotal role. The present study reports how the rapid and coordinated reorganization of both might help in facing such a disaster. AREU-112 and the Emergency Department should be ready to finely tune their usual cooperation to respond to a sudden and overwhelming increase in the healthcare needs brought about by a pandemia like the current one. This lesson should shape and reinforce the future.","output":"Emergency Department and Out-of-Hospital Emergency System (112AREU 118) integrated response to Coronavirus Disease 2019 in a Northern Italy centre"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 can lead to increased psychological symptoms such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety among patients with COVID-19. Based on the previous mindfulness-based interventions proved to be effective, this protocol reports a design of a randomized controlled trial aiming to explore the efficacy and possible mechanism of a mindful living with challenge (MLWC) intervention developed for COVID-19 survivors in alleviating their psychological problems caused by both the disease and the pandemic. METHODS: In April 2021, more than 1600 eligible participants from Hubei Province of China will be assigned 1:1 to an online MLWC intervention group or a waitlist control group. All participants will be asked to complete online questionnaires at baseline, post-program, and 3-month follow-up. The differences of mental health status (e.g. PTSD) and physical symptoms including fatigue and sleeplessness between the COVID-19 survivors who receiving the online MLWC intervention and the control group will be assessed. In addition, the possible mediators and moderators of the link between the MLWC intervention and target outcomes will be evaluated by related verified scales, such as the Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire. Data will be analyzed based on an intention-to-treat approach, and SPSS software will be used to perform statistical analysis. DISCUSSION: The efficacy and potential mechanism of MLWC intervention in improving the quality of life and psychological status of COVID-19 survivors in China are expected to be reported.

The use of biological methods for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles has increased considerably due to their feasibility and high biocompatibility. In general, microorganisms have been widely explored for the production of silver nanoparticles for several applications. The objective of this work was to evaluate the use of entomopathogenic fungi for the biological synthesis of silver nanoparticles, in comparison to the use of other filamentous fungi, and the possibility of using these nanoparticles as antimicrobial agents and for the control of insect pests. In addition, the in vitro methods commonly used to assess the toxicity of these materials are discussed. Several species of filamentous fungi are known to have the ability to form silver nanoparticles, but few studies have been conducted on the potential of entomopathogenic fungi to produce these materials. The investigation of the toxicity of silver nanoparticles is usually carried out in vitro through cytotoxicity/genotoxicity analyses, using well-established methodologies, such as MTT and comet assays, respectively. The use of silver nanoparticles obtained through entomopathogenic fungi against insects is mainly focused on mosquitoes that transmit diseases to humans, with satisfactory results regarding mortality estimates. Entomopathogenic fungi can be employed in the synthesis of silver nanoparticles for potential use in insect control, but there is a need to expand studies on toxicity so to enable their use also in insect control in agriculture.","output":"Biosynthesis of Silver Nanoparticles Mediated by Entomopathogenic Fungi: Antimicrobial Resistance, Nanopesticides, and Toxicity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Here we present a pediatric case of human papilloma virus associated with dermatopathic lymphadenitis (DL).

On 2nd February, 2020, Wuhan began to build a modular hospital to treat patients caught with mild illness. The mobile modular hospital is mainly composed of medical modules, technical support modules, ward units, living support units and transportation capacity under field conditions, and there are complete equipment and specialized personnel to treat patients. Due to the severity and particularity of SARS-CoV-2, taking granted from lessons learnt from mobile modular hospitals, we use the existing large venues to construct a new fixed modular hospital. As patients need to be treated and tested, it is important to develop a clinical laboratory in the modular hospital and ensure biosafety. The construction of a clinical laboratory in the modular hospital is faced with problems such as time pressure, limited site selection, high level of biosafety, lack of experience and so forth.

The reliability of biochemical data derived from these measurements is dependent on the quality of the sample collection and exact preparation and analysis protocols. Here, we describe systematically, the impact of variations in sample collection and preparation on information recovery from quantitative proton (1H) NMR spectroscopy of human blood plasma and serum. The effects of variation of blood collection tube sizes and preservatives, successive freeze-thaw cycles, sample storage at -80 C, and short-term storage at 4 and 20 C on the quantitative lipoprotein and metabolite patterns were investigated. Storage of plasma samples at 4 C for up to 48 h, freezing at -80 C and blood sample collection tube choice have few and minor effects on quantitative lipoprotein profiles, and even storage at 4 C for up to 168 h caused little information loss. In contrast, the impact of heat-treatment (56 C for 30 min), which has been used for inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses, that may be required prior to analytical measurements in low level biosecurity facilities induced marked changes in both lipoprotein and low molecular weight metabolite profiles. It was conclusively demonstrated that this heat inactivation procedure degrades lipoproteins and changes metabolic information in complex ways. Plasma from control individuals and SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are differentially altered resulting in the creation of artifactual pseudo-biomarkers and destruction of real biomarkers to the extent that data from heat-treated samples are largely uninterpretable. We also present several simple blood sample handling recommendations for optimal NMR-based biomarker discovery investigations in SARS CoV-2 studies and general clinical biomarker research.","output":"Quantitative In-Vitro Diagnostic NMR Spectroscopy for Lipoprotein and Metabolite Measurements in Plasma and Serum: Recommendations for Analytical Artifact Minimization with Special Reference to COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 Samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Disrespectful and abusive treatment of women by health care providers during the process of childbirth at health facility is an international problem.

Since no proper treatment is available till date and the vaccination is restricted to certain age groups, also vaccine efficacy is still under progress, the emphasis has been given to the method of isolation and quarantine. This control is induced by tracing the contacts of the infectious individuals, putting them to the quarantine class and based on their symptoms, classifying them either as the susceptible or sick individuals and moving the sick individuals to the isolated class. To track the current pandemic situation of COVID-19 in India, we consider an extended Susceptible-Exposed-Quarantine-Infected-Isolated-Recovered (SEQ(1)IQ(2)R) compartmental model along with calculating its control reproductive number R-c . The disease can be kept in control if the value of R-c remains below one. This \\"threshold\\" value of R-c is used to optimize the period of quarantine, and isolation and have been calculated in order to eradicate the disease. The sensitivity analysis of R-c with respect to the quarantine and isolation period has also been done. Partial rank correlation coefficient method is applied to identify the most significant parameters involved in R-c. Based on the observed data, 7-days moving average curves are plotted for prelockdown, lockdown and unlock 1 phases. Following the trend of the curves for the infection, a generalized exponential function is used to estimate the data, and corresponding 95% confidence intervals are simulated to estimate the parameters.

Taking Texas Tobacco Free (TTTF) is a comprehensive tobacco-free workplace (TFW) program that builds treatment centers capacity to address tobacco use with evidence-based tobacco cessation policies and practices. Here, we examine the process and outcomes of TTTFs implementation within 7 opioid addiction centers. Program goals were structured according to the RE-AIM framework. Pre- and post-implementation data were collected from client facing and non-client facing employees to assess changes in education, training receipt, knowledge, and intervention behaviors, relative to program goals. Centers reported tobacco screenings conducted and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) delivered through 6 months post-implementation. Overall, 64.56% of employees participated in TTTF-delivered tobacco education, with a 54.9% gain in tobacco control and treatment knowledge (p < 0.0001), and significant increases in exposure to education about tobacco use and harms among individuals with opioid use disorder (p = 0.0401).

We piloted a trial comparing &#8804; 10-day with 28-day antibiotic treatment for cIAI. METHODS: A randomised controlled unblinded feasibility trial was conducted. Eligible participants were adult patients with a cIAI that were diagnosed &#8804; 6 days prior to screening. Randomisation was to long-course (28 days) or short-course (&#8804;10 days) antibiotic therapy. Choice of antibiotics was determined by the clinical team. Participants were followed up for 90 days. Primary outcomes were willingness of participants to be randomised and feasibility of trial procedures. RESULTS: In total, 172 patients were screened, 84/172 (48.8%) were eligible, and 31/84 (36.9%) were randomised. Patients were assigned to either the short-course arm (18/31, 58.0%) or the long-course arm (13/31, 41.9%). One patient in the short-course arm withdrew after randomisation.

Here we propose a neurophysiological account attributing these perceptual capacity limits directly to limits on cerebral cellular metabolism. We hypothesized that overall cerebral energy supply remains constant, irrespective of mental task demand, and therefore an attention mechanism is required to regulate cellular metabolism levels in line with task demands. Increased perceptual load in a task (imposing a greater demand on neural computations) should thus result in increased metabolism underlying attended processing, and reduced metabolism mediating unattended processing. We tested this prediction measuring oxidation states of cytochrome c oxidase (oxCCO), an intracellular marker of cellular metabolism. Broadband near-infrared spectroscopy was used to record oxCCO levels from human visual cortex while participants (both sexes) performed a rapid sequential visual search task under either high perceptual load (complex feature-conjunction search) or low load (feature pop-out search). A task-irrelevant, peripheral checkerboard was presented on a random half of trials. Our findings showed that oxCCO levels in visual cortex regions responsive to the attended-task stimuli were increased in high versus low perceptual load, while oxCCO levels related to unattended processing were significantly reduced. A negative temporal correlation of these load effects further supported our metabolism trade-off account. These results demonstrate an attentional compensation mechanism that regulates cellular metabolism levels according to processing demands. Moreover, they provide novel evidence for the widely-held stipulation that overall cerebral metabolism levels remain constant irrespective of mental task demand and establish a neurophysiological account for capacity limits in perception.Significance StatementWe investigated whether capacity limits in perception can be explained by the effects of attention on the allocation of limited cellular metabolic energy for perceptual processing. We measured the oxidation state of cytochrome c oxidase, an intracellular measure of metabolism, in human visual cortex during task performance. The results showed increased levels of cellular metabolism associated with attended processing and reduced levels of metabolism underlying unattended processing when the task was more demanding. A temporal correlation between these effects supported an attention-directed metabolism trade-off. These findings support an account for inattentional blindness grounded in cellular biochemistry. They also provide novel evidence for the claim that cerebral processing is limited by a constant energy supply, which thus requires attentional regulation.","output":"Attention and capacity limits in perception: A cellular metabolism account."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter provides a summary of this book and discusses the organizations and individuals who have endorsed reparative justice for Rwandan genocide survivors and quotes directly from genocide survivors who have benefitted from development programs that advance their welfare and from leaders of community-based survivor organizations calling for greater respect and fulfillment of the right to reparative justice of Rwandan genocide survivors.

Young adults have proven to be a critical factor for COVID-19 transmission and are an important target of the efforts to contain the pandemic. Scalable digital public health technologies could be deployed to reduce COVID-19 transmission, but their use depends on the willingness of young adults to participate in surveillance. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine the attitudes of young adults regarding COVID-19 digital surveillance, including which aspects they would accept and which they would not, as well as to determine factors that may be associated with their willingness to participate in digital surveillance. METHODS: We conducted an anonymous online survey of young adults aged 18-24 years throughout the United States in June 2020. The questionnaire contained predominantly closed-ended response options with one open-ended question. Descriptive statistics were applied to the data. RESULTS: Of 513 young adult respondents, 383 (74.7%) agreed that COVID-19 represents a public health crisis. However, only 231 (45.1%) agreed to actively share their COVID-19 status or symptoms for monitoring and only 171 (33.4%) reported a willingness to allow access to their cell phone for passive location tracking or contact tracing. CONCLUSIONS: Despite largely agreeing that COVID-19 represents a serious public health risk, the majority of young adults sampled were reluctant to participate in digital monitoring to manage the pandemic. This was true for both commonly used methods of public health surveillance (such as contact tracing) and novel methods designed to facilitate a return to normal (such as frequent symptom checking through digital apps). This is a potential obstacle to ongoing containment measures (many of which rely on widespread surveillance) and may reflect a need for greater education on the benefits of public health digital surveillance for young adults.","output":"Attitudes and Perceptions Toward COVID-19 Digital Surveillance: Survey of Young Adults in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose : To identify the impact the COVID-19 lockdown had on the presentation and management of sight-threatening ocular trauma.

Results : During the COVID-19 lockdown period, we saw 10 cases of serious ocular trauma (4 globe ruptures, 4 full-thickness lid lacerations, and 2 intra-ocular foreign bodies). This is 3.33 times the average number of cases over the previous 5 years. The delay between injury and presentation rose to 1.1 days compared to 0.33 days pre-COVID; however, the time taken between presentation to surgery was only slightly affected (12 hours in 2020 compared to 11.38 hours pre-COVID). Conclusion : During the COVID-19 lockdown, the number of serious ocular trauma cases was more than three times the average of the previous 5 years. This increase is partially due to more DIY injuries as people stayed at home, but also surprisingly an increase in falls. There did appear to be a longer delay between injury and presentation, suggesting that patients were reluctant to come into hospital during the pandemic. Surgery was performed within 12 hours on average for both groups, reassuringly indicating that sight-saving surgery was not delayed despite extraordinary circumstances.","output":"Ocular Trauma During the COVID-19 Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We explore whether COVID\\\\19 disproportionately affected women in the labor market using Current Population Survey data through the end of 2020.

These are scenarios that imply a greater concentration of power but still require respect for certain basic legal premises in order to prevent authoritarian behaviours. Since non-regulated or insufficiently regulated emergencies are the most extreme example of this, in the first part of the paper we will see that, even in these cases of true exception, there are sufficient legal criteria to confront danger with guarantees. We will then look at the way in which Spanish public authorities have applied such parameters with clearly positive outcomes and others that have been rather controversial. Crucial in the latter respect is the recent decision of the Spanish Constitutional Court, which has rightly established the partial unconstitutionality of Royal Decree 463/2020, of 14 March, declaring a state of alarm against COVID-19. Because a fundamental rights suspension cannot be accepted under this figure, a state of emergency should have been activated, as it requires parliamentary permission prior to the adoption of such measures.Alternate :Junto con las habituales controversias jurdicas, abordadas desde el derecho de la normalidad, surgen a veces ciertas situaciones que, amenazando la propia subsistencia del orden constitucional, requieren la aplicacin de medidas extraordinarias.

We asked whether mobility restrictions were associated with changes in the occurrence of COVID-19 in 34 OECD countries plus Singapore and Taiwan. Our data sources were the Google Global Mobility Data Source, which reports different types of mobility, and COVID-19 cases retrieved from the dataset curated by Our World in Data. Beginning at each countrys 100th case, and incorporating a 14-day lag to account for the delay between exposure and illness, we examined the association between changes in mobility (with January 3 to February 6, 2020 as baseline) and the ratio of the number of newly confirmed cases on a given day to the total number of cases over the past 14 days from the index day (the potentially infective pool in that population), per million population, using LOESS regression and logit regression. In two-thirds of examined countries, reductions of up to 40% in commuting mobility (to workplaces, transit stations, retailers, and recreation) were associated with decreased cases, especially early in the pandemic. Once both mobility and incidence had been brought down, further restrictions provided little additional benefit. These findings point to the importance of acting early and decisively in a pandemic.","output":"Mobility restrictions were associated with reductions in COVID-19 incidence early in the pandemic: evidence from a real-time evaluation in 34 countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Coronavirus disease 2019 is an acute respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic upended the traditional paradigm of face-to-face provision of healthcare in the Australian context; as such, a telehealth model of active case management was implemented in our public health system, even though there was little supporting data for the safety of delivering patient care remotely to home-isolation patients in the setting of a highly infectious and potentially fatal illness. METHODS A retrospective, single-centre, observational cohort study was performed over 6 weeks commencing 12 March 2020, including patients with coronavirus disease 2019 undergoing home isolation and being actively monitored by a coronavirus disease 2019 telephone assessment clinic. Outcomes assessed comprised: duration of active case follow-up, average number of telephone calls per patient, average number of hours managing each patient, treatment required including presentation to the emergency department or admission to hospital, patient characteristics and utilisation of other health services. RESULTS Of 5223 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 tests performed, 170 individuals (3.25%) tested positive. A total of 158 were included: 76 (47.5%) male and median age 31 years (range 18-94). Median symptom duration was 13 days (interquartile range 6, range 2-34). Median length of coronavirus disease 2019 telephone assessment clinic admission was 10 days (interquartile range 7, range 3-32). A total of 1151 telephone patient encounters were undertaken, with a median of six phone calls made to each patient (interquartile range 5, range 1-20). Ten patients required repeat clinic review; all but one returned home. Six presented to emergency department, with three of these being admitted. In total, there were six admissions: one from the clinic, three from the emergency department and two direct from home (bypassing emergency department). Only four of the six admissions (or 2.5% of all patients) required low-flow oxygen therapy; none required high-flow oxygen or assisted ventilation. The remaining 140 patients (88.6%) were safely managed at home without complications. DISCUSSION A telehealth model of care is safe, efficient and cost-effective for the management of mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease-19 and facilitates home isolation, especially of a low-risk population, thus providing reassurance that this model is sound and suitable for ongoing use.","output":"Telehealth outpatient coronavirus disease 2019 case management at a tertiary hospital in Sydney."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cellular cholesterol plays an important role in the life cycles of enveloped viruses. Previous studies by our group and other groups have demonstrated that the depletion of cellular cholesterol by methyl--cyclodextrin (MCD) reduces the proliferation of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), a porcine Arterivirus that has been devastating the swine industry worldwide for over two decades. However, how PRRSV infection regulates cholesterol synthesis is not fully understood. In this study, we showed that PRRSV infection upregulated the activity of protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A), which subsequently activated 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), the rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol synthesis pathway, to increase the levels of cellular cholesterol. By screening the PRRSV-encoded proteins, we showed that nsp4 dominated the upregulation of cellular cholesterol, independently of the 3C-like protease activity of nsp4. A mutation analysis showed that domain I (amino acids 1C80) of PRRSV nsp4 interacted with PR65 alpha (PR65), the structural subunit, and PP2Ac, the catalytic subunit, of PP2A. Importantly, domain I of nsp4 inhibited Sendai virus-induced interferon  production, and this inhibitory effect was eliminated by Lovastatin, an HMGCR inhibitor, indicating that the upregulation of cellular cholesterol by nsp4 is a strategy used by PRRSV to suppress the antiviral innate immunity of its host. Collectively, we here demonstrated the mechanism by which PRRSV regulates cellular cholesterol synthesis and reported a novel strategy by which PRRSV evades its host's antiviral innate immune response.","output":"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus nsp4 positively regulates cellular cholesterol to inhibit type I interferon production"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently the world's largest public health concern.

A total of 4550 individuals with a history of recent contact with patients at different places (dormitory/home/outside the residences) and levels (close/lower-risk) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA using a nasopharyngeal swab test between July 2020 and May 2021. The test-positive rate was highest in individuals who had contact in dormitories (27.5%), but the rates were largely different between dormitories with different infrastructural or lifestyle features and infection control measures among residents. With appropriate infection control measures, the secondary transmission risk in dormitories was adequately suppressed. The household transmission rate (12.6%) was as high as that of close contact outside the residences (11.3%) and accounted for > 60% of the current rate of COVID-19 transmission among non-adults.

Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is an evidence-based, trauma-focused psychotherapy that desensitizes painful memories, so that reminders in the present no longer provoke overwhelming emotional responses. Preliminary evidence suggests that EMDR can be used as an acute intervention in suicidal patients, including those with major depressive disorder. In addition, because of social distancing restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians have been using EMDR on the web and, in the absence of formal evaluations of web-based EMDR, informal reports indicate good results. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this randomized controlled trial is to investigate whether remotely delivered EMDR (targeting experiences associated with suicidal thinking) reduces suicidal thoughts. Secondary aims include examining the impact of remotely delivered EMDR on symptoms of depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, emotional dysregulation, and dissociation. We will also report on adverse events in the EMDR group to explore whether targeting suicidal ideation with EMDR is safe. Finally, we will compare dropout rates between the treatment groups. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, 80 adults who express suicidal ideation and meet the study criteria will receive either 12 sessions of twice weekly EMDR plus treatment as usual or treatment as usual alone. EMDR sessions will focus on the most distressing and intrusive memories associated with suicidal ideation. Data for primary and secondary objectives will be collected at baseline, 2 months, and 4 months after enrollment. A subsequent longer-term analysis, beyond the scope of this protocol, will examine differences between the groups with respect to the number of posttreatment emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and overall health care use in the year before and after therapy. RESULTS: The protocol was approved by the University of Alberta Research Health Ethics Board (protocol ID Pro00090989). Funding for this study was provided by the Mental Health Foundation (grant RES0048906). Recruitment started in May 2021, with a projected completion date of March 2023. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this trial will contribute to knowledge on whether web-based delivery of EMDR is a safe and effective treatment for reducing suicidal ideation and potentially reducing the incidence of suicide attempts in this patient population.

Herein, we report the case of a patient with Parkinson disease who developed severe and prolonged oropharyngeal dysphagia after a coronavirus disease 2019 infection. A 73-yr-old male patient with Parkinson disease was diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 and admitted to a tertiary care hospital. Before hospitalization, he was assessed at Hoehn and Yahr stage 4 and showed no symptoms of dysphagia. After admission, the patient gradually recovered; however, he was fed through a nasogastric tube. A videofluoroscopic swallowing study revealed a severe oropharyngeal dysphagia with a severely delayed oral phase. Therefore, he underwent percutaneous gastrostomy tube insertion. After discharge, although he received swallowing therapy for 4 mos, he still had severe dysphagia, which made him dependent on enteral feeding. We speculate that the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on dopaminergic and nondopaminergic mechanisms could lead to the development of dysphagia in this patient.

METHODS: This is a partial economic evaluation performed from the hospitals perspective and is a prospective, observational cohort study to assess hospitalization costs of suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted between March 30 and June 30, 2020, to Hospital das Clnicas of the University of S?o Paulo Medical School (HCFMUSP) and followed until discharge, death, or external transfer. Micro- and macro-costing methodologies were used to describe and analyze the total cost associated with each patient's underlying medical conditions, itinerary and outcomes as well as the cost components of different hospital sectors. RESULTS: The average cost of the 3,254 admissions (51.7% of which involved intensive care unit stays) was US$12,637.42. The overhead cost was its main component. Sex, age and underlying hypertension (US$14,746.77), diabetes (US$15,002.12), obesity (US$18,941.55), chronic renal failure (US$15,377.84), and rheumatic (US$17,764.61), hematologic (US$15,908.25) and neurologic (US$15,257.95) diseases were associated with higher costs.

Therefore, this study chose Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, one of the poorest areas in China, as a pilot, to reveal the quantitative relationships among different dimensions under the COVID-19 health education framework, clarify the key points for health promotion, and provide specific suggestions for COVID-19 health education strategy in impoverished regions. METHODS: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted in five regions of Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture in 2020. There were 2,100 individuals sampled by multi-stage method. This survey mainly measured the four dimensions: CRHL, COVID-19 related tense psychological reactions (CRTPR), COVID-19 related information report acquisition (CRIRA), and general health literacy (GHL). The multivariate logistic regression was used to explore the influence of demographic characteristics on each dimension. Furthermore, to quantify the relationships among different dimensions, this study employed the structural equation model (SEM), and analyzed the mediating effects of CRHL and CRIRA as well as the moderating effects of regional characteristic variables. RESULTS: The CRHL played an important role in promoting COVID-19 health education, reaching 52.5% in Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture. The GHL ( = 0.336) and age ( = 0.136) had statistically positive impacts on CRHL. The CRHL affected CRTPR negatively ( = ? 0.198) and CRIRA positively ( = 0.052). The CRHL played significant mediating roles among the four dimensions (P < 0.05). Effectiveness of government prevention and control as well as the ethnicity moderated not only the relationships between CRHL and other dimensions, but also the mediating effect of CRHL (P < 0.05). People with lower income and education levels had lower GHL ( = 0.286, 1.292). The youth were more likely to show CRTPR ( = ? 0.080). CONCLUSIONS: By proposing and verifying the theoretical framework, this study put forward specific suggestions on how to improve COVID-19 health education strategies in impoverished regions via implementation methods, key groups and effect evaluation, which also provided references about future public health emergencies for other impoverished regions of the world.

As the demand for SARS-CoV-2 testing continues to increase amid supply shortages, many laboratories have investigated the use of sources other than nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs. Saliva and mid-turbinate nasal swabs are attractive alternatives as they allow for self-collection and are well-accepted by patients. Saliva also requires limited consumables. We compared the performance of health care provider-collected NP swabs, patient-collected mid-turbinate (MT) swabs, and patient-collected saliva specimens for SARS-CoV-2 detection using a laboratory developed PCR assay that had received Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA. Of 281 total evaluable samples, 33 (11.7%) NP swabs, 33 (11.7%) MT swabs, and 32 (11.4%) saliva specimens were positive for SARS-CoV-2 following resolution of discordant results. When compared to NP swabs, saliva exhibited a sensitivity of 90.9% (30/33) and specificity of 99.2% (246/248), while patient-collected MT swabs exhibited a sensitivity of 93.9% (31/33) and specificity of 99.2% (246/248). When comparing to the consensus standard, the sensitivity was 100% (31/31) for both NP and MT swabs and 96.8% (30/31) for saliva specimens, while specificity was the same in both NP swabs and saliva specimens (98.8% [247/250]) and 99.2% (248/250) for MT swabs. Pre-treatment of saliva with proteinase K and heating for 15 minutes prior to extraction reduced the invalid rate from 26.7% (52/195) to 0% (0/195).

METHODS PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and Lilacs databases were used to identify articles published before June 2019 that met specific inclusion criteria. The search strategy was developed using both controlled and uncontrolled vocabulary related to the following domains: \\"drug interactions,\\" \\"clinically relevant,\\" and \\"hospital.\\" In this review, we discuss original observational studies that detected DDIs in the hospital setting, studies that provided enough data to allow us to calculate the prevalence of clinically manifested DDIs, and studies that described the drugs prescribed or provided DDI adverse reaction reports, published in either English, Portuguese, or Spanish. RESULTS From the initial 5,999 articles identified, 10 met the inclusion criteria. The pooled prevalence of clinically manifested DDIs was 9.2% (CI 95% 4.0-19.7). The mean number of medications per patient reported in six studies ranged from 4.0 to 9.0, with an overall average of 5.47  1.77 drugs per patient. The quality of the included studies was moderate. The main methods used to identify clinically manifested DDIs were evaluating medical records and ward visits (n = 7). Micromedex? (27.7%) and Lexi-Comp? (27.7%) online reference databases were commonly used to detect DDIs and none of the studies evaluated used more than one database for this purpose. CONCLUSIONS This systematic review showed that, despite the significant prevalence of potential DDIs reported in the literature, less than one in ten patients were exposed to a clinically manifested drug interaction. The use of causality tools to identify clinically manifested DDIs as well as clinical adoption of DDI lists based on actual adverse outcomes that can be identified through the implementation of real DDI notification systems is recommended to reduce the incidence of alert fatigue, enhance decision-making for DDI prevention or resolution, and, consequently, contribute to patient safety.","output":"Prevalence of clinically manifested drug interactions in hospitalized patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: After kidney transplantation non-adherence and inadequate self-management undermine clinical outcomes and quality of life. Both have been demonstrated to be substantial in all age groups. However, interventions promoting adherence and self-management among kidney transplant recipients that have proven to be effective are scarce. In this study we aim to develop and test an intervention to optimize adherence and self-management. In this article we describe the background and design of the trial entitled promoting Medication AdheRence and Self-management among kidney transplant recipients (MARS-trial). METHODS/DESIGN: This is a single-center, parallel arm randomized controlled trial. Nonadherent kidney transplant recipients aged 12 years or older are eligible for inclusion. Patients will be randomly assigned to either the experimental or a control group. The control group will receive care-as-usual. The experimental group will receive care-as-usual plus the MARS-intervention. The MARS-intervention is an outreaching intervention, based on the principles of (multi) systemic therapy which means involving the social network. A standardized intervention protocol is used for consistency but we will tailor the behavior change techniques used to the specific needs and determinants of each patient. The primary outcome of medication adherence will be measured using electronic monitoring. Secondary outcome measures regarding medication adherence and self-management are also assessed. Data is collected at baseline (T0), after a run-in period (T1), at six months post-baseline/end of treatment (T2) and after a six month follow-up period (T3). DISCUSSION: We combined elements of (multi) systemic therapy and evidence-based behavior change techniques to create an outreaching and highly individualized intervention. In this trial we will investigate the impact on medication adherence and self-management after kidney transplantation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Netherlands Trial Register,trial number NTR7462.

We aimed to describe the changes in liver care before and after COVID-19 restricted access to health care. We obtained data on the number of liver clinic visits, abdominal ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging using electronic query or clinic registry at three medical centers in the United States, Japan, and Singapore for the following periods: February 1 to March 14, 2018, 2019, and 2020; and March 15 to May 1, 2018, 2019, and 2020. We performed trend analysis using logistic regression. In total, 14,403 visits were made to the liver clinics at the three centers: 5,900 in 2018, 5,270 in 2019, and 3,233 in 2020. Overall, there were no significant changes in the distribution of males and females between February 1 and May 1 from 2018 to 2020, but there was a lower proportion of seniors ages 65 years and older (P < 0.001). There were significant decreasing trends in the total number of liver clinic visits overall (p-trend = 0.038) and in the subanalysis for chronic hepatitis B, C, and other liver diseases. HCC/cirrhosis visits also dropped from 883 to 538 (39.07% decrease) overall and 665 to 355 (46.62% decrease) for the US site. In addition, there was a significant decreasing trend in the number of abdominal ultrasounds (P-trend = 0.004) and computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (P-trend = 0.007) performed overall. Conclusion: Liver clinic visits, hepatoma surveillance, and diagnostic abdominal imaging fell dramatically as social distancing measures were instituted.

We conducted a cross-sectional survey of patients from a single private infertility and reproductive clinic in an urban area in the Midwest, United States. Women, age 18 or older, primarily White and educated, who presented for an appointment to the clinic were invited to participate in an email-based survey. Respondents (N = 304) reported their perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on fertility treatment, emotions associated with this impact, and perceived stress and depressive symptoms. They also completed measures of dispositional optimism and expectations for a future pregnancy. Findings indicated that women perceived an overall negative impact of the pandemic on their treatment plans, which was associated with more negative emotions, lower expectations of future pregnancy, and greater stress and depressive symptoms during the pandemic. However, further correlational analyses revealed that being higher in trait optimism was associated with perceiving a less negative impact of the pandemic, experiencing fewer negative emotions, and less overall stress and depressive symptoms. Although women with fertility problems have perceived the pandemic as negative and disruptive, those who are higher in optimism may be less affected.","output":"Perceptions of the COVID-19 Pandemic among Women with Infertility: Correlations with Dispositional Optimism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose Tracheostomy patients face many adversities including loss of phonation and essential airway functions including air filtering, warming, and humidification. Heat and moisture exchangers (HMEs) facilitate humidification and filtering of inspired air. The Shikani HME (S-HME) is a novel turbulent airflow HME that may be used in-line with the Shikani Speaking Valve (SSV), allowing for uniquely preserved phonation during humidification. The aims of this study were to (a) compare the airflow resistance (R airflow) and humidification efficiency of the S-HME and the Mallinckrodt Tracheolife II tracheostomy HME (M-HME) when dry (time zero) and wet (after 24 hr) and (b) determine if in-line application of the S-HME with a tracheostomy speaking valve significantly increases R airflow over a tracheostomy speaking valve alone (whether SSV or Passy Muir Valve [PMV]). Method A prospective observational ex vivo study was conducted using a pneumotachometer lung simulation unit to measure airflow (Q) amplitude and R airflow, as indicated by a pressure drop (P Drop) across the device (S-HME, M-HME, SSV + S-HME, and PMV). Additionally, P Drop was studied for the S-HME and M-HME when dry at time zero (T0) and after 24 hr of moisture testing (T24) at Q of 0.5, 1, and 1.5 L/s. Results R airflow was significantly less for the S-HME than M-HME (T0 and T24). R airflow of the SSV + S-HME in series did not significant increase R airflow over the SSV or PMV alone. Moisture loss efficiency trended toward greater efficiency for the S-HME; however, the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusions The turbulent flow S-HME provides heat and moisture exchange with similar or greater efficacy than the widely used laminar airflow M-HME, but with significantly lower resistance. The S-HME also allows the innovative advantage of in-line use with the SSV, hence allowing concurrent humidification and phonation during application, without having to manipulate either device.","output":"The Shikani HME: A New Tracheostomy Heat and Moisture Exchanger."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Policies on risk constitute a core topic of risk analysis and risk science, and it is common at risk conferences to present real-life cases of such policies, for example related to the handling of climate change and pandemics.

It is argued that, in order to learn from the cases, they need in general to be more thoroughly followed up with discussions of concepts, principles, approaches, and methods for assessing, characterizing, communicating and handling risk. Describing a governmental policy on, for example, the handling of COVID-19 is a point of departure for interesting discussions concerning its justification and performance, in particular in relation to risk and the most updated knowledge from the risk analysis field.

The aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis are to summarize the current literature and report clinical outcomes on the use of famotidine for treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Five databases were searched through February 12, 2021 to identify observational studies that reported on associations of famotidine use with outcomes in COVID-19. Meta-analysis was conducted for composite primary clinical outcome (e.g. rate of death, intubation, or intensive care unit admissions) and death separately, where either aggregate odds ratio (OR) or hazard ratio (HR) was calculated. RESULTS: Four studies, reporting on 46,435 total patients and 3,110 patients treated with famotidine, were included in this meta-analysis. There was no significant association between famotidine use and composite outcomes in patients with COVID-19: HR 0.63 (95% CI: 0.35, 1.16). Across the three studies that reported mortality separated from other endpoints, there was no association between famotidine use during hospitalization and risk of deathHR 0.67 (95% CI: 0.26, 1.73) and OR 0.79 (95% CI: 0.19, 3.34). Heterogeneity ranged from 83.69% to 88.07%. CONCLUSION: Based on the existing observational studies, famotidine use is not associated with a reduced risk of mortality or combined outcome of mortality, intubation, and/or intensive care services in hospitalized individuals with COVID-19, though heterogeneity was high, and point estimates suggested a possible protective effect for the composite outcome that may not have been observed due to lack of power.

A greater understanding of citizens' perceptions of these measures can help government agencies adapt their strategies to boost compliance. We examined citizens' perceptions of government's measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic and its implications on compliance using data from Onitsha city, Anambra State Nigeria. Methods: data was obtained through in-person interviews of 140 consenting adults in March 2020. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to summarize the data. Results: most participants (84.7%) doubted government's ability to manage the COVID-19 outbreak, raising concerns about ineffective governance (25.7%) and inadequate health facilities (20.7%). However, participants expressed a favorable perception of school closures (92.3%) and a ban on large gatherings (83.9%), driven mostly by the need to contain the COVID-19 and avoid its spread. But, they were generally indifferent about the closure of the markets and workplaces due to concerns for food insecurity and lack of government's relief programs. Participants who had a positive perception of the ban on large gatherings were more likely to have high knowledge and to adopt good COVID-19 preventive practices. Conclusion: the study showed a lack of public's confidence in the government's ability to manage the pandemic.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of flow-diverter devices (FDDs) over a long-term follow-up period. METHODS The authors retrospectively reviewed all cerebral aneurysm cases that had been admitted to the Division of Neurosurgery of the Universit degli Studi di Napoli between November 2008 and November 2015 and treated with an FDD. The records of 60 patients (48 females and 12 males) harboring 69 cerebral aneurysms were analyzed. The study end points were angiographic evidence of complete aneurysm occlusion, recanalization rate, occlusion of the parent artery, and clinical and radiological evidence of brain ischemia. The occlusion rate was evaluated according to the O'Kelly-Marotta (OKM) Scale for flow diversion, based on the degree of filling (A, total filling; B, subtotal filling; C, entry remnant; D, no filling). Postprocedural, midterm, and long-term results were strictly analyzed. RESULTS Complete occlusion (OKM D) was achieved in 63 (91%) of 69 aneurysms, partial occlusion (OKM C) in 4 (6%), occlusion of the parent artery in 2 (3%). Intraprocedural technical complications occurred in 3 patients (5%). Postprocedural complications occurred in 6 patients (10%), without neurological deficits. At the 12-month follow-up, 3 patients (5%) experienced asymptomatic cerebral infarction. No further complications were observed at later follow-up evaluations (> 24 months). There were no reports of any delayed aneurysm rupture, subarachnoid or intraparenchymal hemorrhage, ischemic complications, or procedure- or device-related deaths. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment with an FDD is a safe treatment for unruptured cerebral aneurysms, resulting in a high rate of occlusion. In the present study, the authors observed effective and stable aneurysm occlusion, even at the long-term follow-up. Data in this study also suggest that ischemic complications can occur at a later stage, particularly at 12-18 months. On the other hand, no other ischemic or hemorrhagic complications occurred beyond 24 months.","output":"Postprocedural, midterm, and long-term results of cerebral aneurysms treated with flow-diverter devices: 7-year experience at a single center."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemics, earthquakes, fire, war, and other disasters place universities at risk.

A major aim of the study is to determine whether baseline antibody titers against the seasonal human coronaviruses are associated with altered levels of vaccine-induced antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Serial serum samples obtained pre-vaccination and 1 month after the second dose were tested for IgG antibodies against the full pre-fusion spike protein and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the full pre-fusion spike proteins of OC43, HKU1, 229E, and NL63. Antibodies were measured using highly sensitive and specific multiplex assays based on Luminex-xMAP technology. RESULTS: Preliminary analyses of the first 103 subjects in whom we have 1 month post-vaccination serum demonstrate development of high IgG geometric mean titers (GMT) to both the full spike protein (GMT: 13,685, 12,014-15,589, 95% CI) and the RBD (GMT: 19,448, 17,264-21,908, 95% CI) of SARS-CoV-2 after the 2(nd) vaccine dose. Preliminary analysis demonstrates no association between baseline antibody titers against spike protein of OC43 and antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Pearsons r-value= 0.13, P-value= 0.21) or RBD (Pearsons r-value= 0.09, P-value= 0.36) one month after vaccination. Future analyses will evaluate whether there is an association with baseline seasonal coronavirus antibody titers and either SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers or anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein titers at 6 months after vaccination. CONCLUSION: These preliminary results suggest that baseline antibody responses to seasonal coronaviruses neither boost nor impede SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-induced antibody responses. Longitudinal sampling will enable assessment of vaccine durability and determination of whether baseline seasonal coronavirus antibody levels are associated with altered duration of detectable COVID-19 vaccine-induced antibody responses.

Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are increasingly considered as an important measure of surgical outcomes from a patients perspective. However, a major limitation preventing wider use of PROMs data in national data collection has been the inability to systematically collect and share electronic information with relevant stakeholders in a comprehensive and financially sustainable manner. OBJECTIVE: This study reports on the development of an electronic data capture and reporting system by a national registry for the collection of PROMs and the processes used to identify and overcome barriers to implementation and uptake. The study also aims to provide a cost breakdown of establishing and maintaining a nationwide electronic PROMs program. METHODS: Between 2018 and 2020, 3 governance and advisory committees were established to develop and implement a PROMs pilot program nested within a nationwide joint replacement registry. The program involved electronic collection of preoperative and 6-month postoperative data for hip, knee, or shoulder replacement surgery from 44 Australian hospitals. Resource requirements for the program included a project manager, software developers, data manager, and statistician. An online platform was tested, refined, and implemented for electronic PROMs collection with scalability considered for future expansion to all Australian hospitals and additional data fields. Technical capabilities included different access for multiple user types, patient registration, automatic reminders via SMS text messages and email, online consent, and patient outcome real-time dashboards accessible for different user groups (surgeons, patients, hospitals, and project stakeholders). RESULTS: During the PROMs pilot period there were 19,699 primary procedures undertaken with 10,204 registered procedures in the electronic system. This equated to 51.80% of people who had a joint replacement at participating hospitals during this period. Patient registration and data collection were efficient (20-30 seconds and 10-12 minutes, respectively). Engagement with the reporting dashboards (as a proportion of those who viewed their dashboard) varied by user group: 197/277 (71.1%) hospital administrators, 68/129 (52.7%) project stakeholders, 177/391 (45.3%) surgeons, and 1138/8840 patients (12.9%). Cost analysis determined an overall cost per patient of Aus $7-15 (approximately US $5-12) for 2 PROMs collections per joint replacement procedure once the program was established. CONCLUSIONS: Successful implementation of an orthopedic PROMs program with planned scalability for a broader national rollout requires significant funding and staffing resources. However, this expenditure can be considered worthwhile, given that collection and reporting of PROMs can drive health care improvement processes. Further consideration of strategies to improve stakeholder engagement with electronic reporting dashboards (particularly for patients and surgeons) will be critical to the ongoing success of a national PROMs program.","output":"National Implementation of an Electronic Patient-Reported Outcome Measures Program for Joint Replacement Surgery: Pilot Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Big data has gained academic relevance over the last decade and is also of interest to other role-players such as governments, businesses and the general public.

People in this region gather wild plants and plant parts using them directly or in traditional cuisine, or sell them in local markets. However, there is a huge lack of documentation of the food system, particularly that related to wild food plants (WFP). In the current study, we focus on the uses and contributions of WFPs in the traditional tribal food system of the Hindu Kush valleys along the PakistanCAfghanistan border. Ethnobotanical data were gathered through questionnaire surveys of 84 informants, including 69 men and 15 women, belonging to 21 different villages of the chosen area. In tribal societies men and women rarely mix and thus very few women took part in the surveys. We documented 63 WFP species belonging to 34 botanical families, of which 27 were used as vegetables, 24 as fruits, six in different kinds of chutneys (starters), and six as fresh food species. Fruits were the most used part (41%), followed by leaves (24%), aerial parts (24%), seeds (7%), stems (3%), and young inflorescences (1%). The reported uses of Carthamus oxyacantha, Pinus roxburghii seeds, and Marsilea quadrifolia leaves are novel for the gastronomy of Pakistan. The results reveal that WFPs provide a significant contribution to local food systems and play a role in addressing human nutritional needs, which are usually not met through farming practices. The tribal peoples of the Hindu Kush use WFPs for their nutritional value, but also as a cultural practicean inseparable component of the tribal communitys lifestyle. This important traditional knowledge about the gathering and consumption of WFPs, however, is eroding at an alarming rate among younger generations due to the introduction of fast-food, modernization, and globalization. Therefore, appropriate strategies are imperative not only to safeguard traditional plants and food knowledge and practices, as well as the cultural heritage attached to them, but also to foster food security and thus public healthcare via local wild foods in the region.","output":"A Comprehensive Appraisal of the Wild Food Plants and Food System of Tribal Cultures in the Hindu Kush Mountain Range;a Way Forward for Balancing Human Nutrition and Food Security"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 3' terminus of the bamboo mosaic potexvirus (BaMV) contains a poly(A) tail, the 5' portion of which participates in the formation of an RNA pseudoknot required for BaMV RNA replication. Recombinant RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of BaMV binds to the pseudoknot poly(A) tail in gel mobility shift assays (C.-Y. Huang, Y.-L. Huang, M. Meng, Y.-H. Hsu, and C.-H. Tsai, J. Virol. 75:2818-2824, 2001). Approximately 20 nucleotides of the poly(A) tail adjacent to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) are protected from diethylpyrocarbonate modification, suggesting that this region may be used to initiate minus-strand RNA synthesis. The 5' terminus of the minus-strand RNA synthesized by the RdRp in vitro was examined using 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and DNA sequencing. Minus-strand RNA synthesis was found to initiate from several positions within the poly(A) tail, with the highest frequency of initiation being from the 7th to the 10th adenylates counted from the 5'-most adenylate of the poly(A) tail. Sequence analyses of BaMV progeny RNAs recovered from Nicotiana benthamiana protoplasts which were inoculated with mutants containing a mutation at the 1st, 4th, 7th, or 16th position of the poly(A) tail suggested the existence of variable initiation sites, similar to those found in 5' RACE experiments. We deduce that the initiation site for minus-strand RNA synthesis is not fixed at one position but resides opposite one of the 15 adenylates of the poly(A) tail immediately downstream of the 3' UTR of BaMV genomic RNA.","output":"The synthesis of minus-strand RNA of bamboo mosaic potexvirus initiates from multiple sites within the poly(A) tail."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters host cells by interacting with membrane-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a vital element in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which regulates blood pressure, fluid balance, and cardiovascular functions.

During the COVID-19 crisis, Twitter alone has seen a sharp 45% increase in the usage of its curated events page, and a 30% increase in its direct messaging usage, since March 6th 2020. In this study, we analyze the psychometric impact and coupling of the COVID-19 infodemic with the official bulletins related to COVID-19 at the national and state level in India. We look at these two sources with a psycho-linguistic lens of emotions and quantified the extent and coupling between the two.

We were then able to capture the time-evolution of health-related emotions in social media and official bulletins. An analysis of lead-lag relationships between the time series of extracted emotions from official bulletins and social media using Granger's causality showed that state bulletins were leading the social media for some emotions such as Medical Emergency.

No objective data exist in literature about the effect of mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) on working space in laparoscopic surgery. We objectively measured this effect with computed tomography in a porcine laparoscopy model. METHODS Using standardized anesthesia, twelve 20-kg pigs without MBP and eight 20-kg pigs with MBP were studied with computed tomography at intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) levels of 0, 5, 10, and 15 mmHg. Volumes and dimensions of the pneumoperitoneum were measured on reconstructed CT images and compared between the pigs with and those without MBP. RESULTS A reproducible and statistically significant increase of approximately 500 ml in pneumoperitoneum volume was found in the MBP group at all levels of IAP. This represents a 43 % relative increase at a pneumoperitoneum pressure of 5 mmHg, 21 % at IAP 10 mmHg, and 18 % at IAP 15 mmHg. Peak inspiratory pressure was lower at IAP 0 and 5 mmHg in the MBP group. Anteroposterior diameter in the group with MBP was lower at 0 mmHg, but abdominal dimensions were similar in both groups at all other IAPs. This shows that the gain in working space is due to a diminished volume of the intra-abdominal content and not to compression or displacement of the bowel. CONCLUSIONS MBP increases working space by reducing bowel content. Especially at low intra-abdominal working pressures, the increase in working space associated with MBP could represent an important benefit in challenging laparoscopic surgery.","output":"Optimizing working-space in laparoscopy: measuring the effect of mechanical bowel preparation in a porcine model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics of neonates born to SARS-CoV-2 infected mothers and increase the current knowledge on the perinatal consequences of COVID-19.

Latent profile analysis was performed on serial physiological and blood biomarkers. Patient characteristics, comorbidities and rates of death and admission to intensive care, were compared between the latent classes. A five class solution provided the best fit. Class 1 Typical response exhibited a moderately elevated and rising C-reactive protein (CRP), stable lymphopaenia, and the lowest rates of 14-day adverse outcomes. Class 2 Rapid hyperinflammatory response comprised older patients, with higher admission white cell and neutrophil counts, which declined over time, accompanied by a very high and rising CRP and platelet count, and exibited the highest mortality risk. Class 3 Progressive inflammatory response was similar to the typical response except for a higher and rising CRP, though similar mortality rate.

What is inescapable is that COVID-19 has an age-related risk component and the latest data shows that risks start to rise for people from midlife onwards. As governance agencies, professional practice, and academia work towards assessing, communicating, and addressing this risk, we ask: are existing gerontological conceptualisations of ageism appropriate for this exceptional situation and what is being (re)produced in terms of an aged subjectivity? Following van Dyk's (2016) critique of gerontology's 'othering' through both 'glorification' (third age) and 'abjection' (fourth age), a content analysis of statements and policy documents issued in response to COVID-19 provides evidence of well-meaning and inadvertent ageism through homogenizing language, the abjection/glorification binary within 'old age', and the power binary constructed between age and an age-neutral midlife.

We aim to quantify the differences in symptom prevalence, risk of hospital admission, and symptom duration among the vaccinated population. METHODS: In this prospective longitudinal observational study, we collected data from participants who were self-reporting test results and symptoms in the ZOE COVID app (previously known as the COVID Symptoms Study App). Eligible participants were aged 16C99 years, based in the UK, with a body-mass index between 15 and 55 kg/m(2), had received at least two doses of any SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, were symptomatic, and logged a positive symptomatic PCR or lateral flow result for SARS-CoV-2 during the study period. The primary outcome was the likelihood of developing a given symptom (of the 32 monitored in the app) or hospital admission within 7 days before or after the positive test in participants infected during omicron prevalence compared with those infected during delta prevalence. FINDINGS: Between June 1, 2021, and Jan 17, 2022, we identified 63 002 participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and reported symptoms in the ZOE app. These patients were matched 1:1 for age, sex, and vaccination dose, across two periods (June 1 to Nov 27, 2021, delta prevalent at >70%; n=4990, and Dec 20, 2021, to Jan 17, 2022, omicron prevalent at >70%; n=4990). Loss of smell was less common in participants infected during omicron prevalence than during delta prevalence (167% vs 527%, odds ratio [OR] 017; 95% CI 016C019, p<0001). Sore throat was more common during omicron prevalence than during delta prevalence (705% vs 608%, 155; 143C169, p<0001). There was a lower rate of hospital admission during omicron prevalence than during delta prevalence (19% vs 26%, OR 075; 95% CI 057C098, p=003). INTERPRETATION: The prevalence of symptoms that characterise an omicron infection differs from those of the delta SARS-CoV-2 variant, apparently with less involvement of the lower respiratory tract and reduced probability of hospital admission.

In this study, a newly developed live attenuated IB-VAR2 vaccine representing the GI-23 Middle East IBV lineage was evaluated in day-old commercial broilers in an IBV-endemic area. A commercial broiler flock was vaccinated with the IB-VAR2 vaccine at day-old age followed by IB-H120 at day 16. The vaccinated flock was monitored on a weekly basis till the slaughter age. The health status and growth performance were monitored, and selected viral pathogen real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) detection was conducted on a weekly basis. Finally, the flock was compared to a nearby farm with only the classical IB-H120 vaccination program. Results showed that the IB-VAR2 vaccine was tolerable in day-old broiler chicks. The IBV virus rRT-PCR detection was limited to the trachea as compared to its nephropathogenic parent virus. Respiratory disease problems and high mortalities were reported in the IB-H120-only vaccinated flock. An exposure to a wild-type Egy/VarII strain was confirmed in both flocks as indicated by partial IBV S1 gene sequence.

It is expected that this proposed framework will serve as a guide to identifying the dominant factors caused by the outbreak and supporting interested parties in formulating policies. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"A Framework for Dominant Factors Revelation of the Outbreak's Cause"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hantaviruses belong to the group of emerging viruses. Pathogenic European hantaviruses can cause a human disease designated hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome of varying severity. In general, diagnostics of hantavirus infections are based on immunofluorescence assays using virus-infected cells or enzyme immunoassays and Western blot tests using recombinant nucleocapsid proteins. For highly sensitive detection of hantavirus-specific antibodies in the enzyme immunoassay, a homologous hantavirus nucleocapsid protein is needed as a diagnostic antigen. Serological typing of hantavirus infections can be obtained by neutralization assays, which in certain cases require the use of late convalescent sera. The seroprevalence in the normal German population is about 1%. In professionally exposed risk groups, e. g., forest workers, a seroprevalence higher than that in the normal population was observed. Endemic regions for hantavirus infections are located mainly in Baden-Wrttemberg. In the years 2001C2003 an annual number of about 200 clinically apparent hantavirus infections were registered in Germany. Neutralization assays detected almost exclusively human infections caused by Puumala and Dobrava viruses, only very rarely by Tula virus. Until this day in Germany mainly mild to moderate courses of human hantavirus infections have been documented. Besides infections caused by German hantaviruses, up to 10% of the clinically apparent hantavirus infections registered annually in Germany are caused by infections imported from other countries, mainly from Europe. So far only very limited molecular genetic data about the circulating hantaviruses in Germany are available. Additional investigations are needed to get a more precise picture about the distribution of hantaviruses in Germany and to calculate the resulting risk for the human population.","output":"Verbreitung von Hantavirusinfektionen in Deutschland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The inferior electrical contact to two-dimensional (2D) materials is a critical challenge for their application in post-silicon very large-scale integrated circuits.

Here, we present the implementation of a practical MCMC method in the open-source software package PyBioNetFit (PyBNF), which is designed to support parameterization of mathematical models for biological systems. The new MCMC method, am, incorporates an adaptive move proposal distribution. For warm starts, sampling can be initiated at a specified location in parameter space and with a multivariate Gaussian proposal distribution defined initially by a specified covariance matrix. Multiple chains can be generated in parallel using a computer cluster. We demonstrate that am can be used to successfully solve real-world Bayesian inference problems, including forecasting of new Coronavirus Disease 2019 case detection with Bayesian quantification of forecast uncertainty. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: PyBNF version 1.1.9, the first stable release with am, is available at PyPI and can be installed using the pip package-management system on platforms that have a working installation of Python 3.

DESIGN: descriptive analyses of daily time series of compensation claims applications, geographical distributions, and occupations involved. Multivariate analyses have been performed for identifying significant epidemiological pattern. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: compensation claims for COVID-19 injuries received by Inail from March 2020 to February 2021 have been analysed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: daily time series of compensation claims applications in the first year of pandemic and comparatively with population data, patterns of occupations majorly involved in time, territorial clusters. RESULTS: in the observed period, Inail has received 155,684 workers' compensation claims with a first peak (more than 1,000 daily compensation claims) in March 2020 and a second peak (more than 1,500) in November 2020. A time dependent geographical pattern was identified, with the Northern regions formerly affected in the first phase, followed by a diffusion in the Central and Southern regions during the summer period. Health technicians (32% and 42% in male and female, respectively) and physicians (15%and 6%) were the most involved workers. The timing of infection was found to depend by job, with physicians, nurses, and health technicians firstly involved with a spread of about 2 weeks with respect to other jobs. Trend in health workers' vaccination has been found in a clear inverse relationship with the decreasing number of compensation claims, remaining, since February 2021, under one hundred daily cases of occupational COVID-19 compensation claims. CONCLUSIONS: different intensities, timing, and characteristics were found among application claims, which address for different pandemic diffusion paths. Health workers are the firstly and most involved impacted by the pandemic. The use of application claims could be useful and effective in monitoring the occupational component of COVID-19 and his trend in time and space.

We recorded daily litter arrival rates for 50 days in two South African cities from the time of strictest lockdown through two successive easings in regulations. The strict lockdown had no marked impact on litter composition, which was dominated by convenience foods and beverages (29% by number, 34% by mass) and tobacco products (33% by number, 3% by mass). The ban on the sale of tobacco products during the lockdown did not greatly reduce the number of cigarette butts and associated packaging. Vehicle parts accounted for <1% of litter items (2% by mass) whereas household waste spilled from bins prior to or during collection accounted for 3% of litter items (14% by mass). Street litter loads decreased roughly by a factor of three during the strict lockdown. The increase in litter was gradual, suggesting a reduction in compliance with regulations as the lockdown continued. Our results show a clear link between human activity levels and littering.

Main cause of death is cardiorespiratory arrest with hypoxia and hypercapnia. Respiratory depression is mediated by opioid  receptors expressed on respiratory neurons in the CNS. Studies on the major sites in the brainstem mediating respiratory rate suppression, the pre-Btzinger complex and parabrachial complex (including the Klliker Fuse nucleus), have yielded conflicting findings and interpretations but recent investigations involving deletion of  receptors from neurons have led to greater consensus. Some opioid analgesic drugs are histamine releasers. The range of clinical effects of released histamine include increased cardiac output due to an increase in heart rate, increased force of myocardial contraction, and a dilatatory effect on small blood vessels leading to flushing, decreased vascular resistance and hypotension. Resultant hemodynamic changes do not necessarily relate directly to the concentration of histamine in plasma due to a range of variables including functional differences between mast cells and histamine-induced anaphylactoid reactions may occur less often than commonly believed. Opioid-induced histamine release rarely if ever provokes bronchospasm and histamine released by opioids in normal doses does not lead to anaphylactoid reactions or result in IgE-mediated reactions in normal patients. Hypersensitivities to opioids, mainly some skin reactions and occasional type I hypersensitivities, chiefly anaphylaxis and urticaria, are uncommon. Hypersensitivities to morphine, codeine, heroin, methadone, meperidine, fentanyl, remifentanil, buprenorphine, tramadol, and dextromethorphan are summarized. In 2016, the FDA issued a Drug Safety Communication concerning the association of opioids with serotonin syndrome, a toxicity associated with raised intra-synaptic concentrations of serotonin in the CNS, inhibition of serotonin reuptake, and activation of 5-HT receptors.

This study investigated whether adherence to the World Health Organizations (WHO) handwashing guidelines (the outcome variable) was associated with the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic, as measured by the following 6 indicators: (i) the number of new cases of COVID-19 morbidity/mortality (a country-level mean calculated for the 14 days prior to data collection), (ii) total cases of COVID-19 morbidity/mortality accumulated since the onset of the pandemic, and (iii) changes in recent cases of COVID-19 morbidity/mortality (a difference between country-level COVID-19 morbidity/mortality in the previous 14 days compared to cases recorded 14C28 days earlier). METHODS: The observational study (#NCT04367337) enrolled 6064 adults residing in Australia, Canada, China, France, Gambia, Germany, Israel, Italy, Malaysia, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, and Switzerland. Data on handwashing adherence across 8 situations (indicated in the WHO guidelines) were collected via an online survey (MarchCJuly 2020). Individual-level handwashing data were matched with the date- and country-specific values of the 6 indices of the trajectory of COVID-19 pandemic, obtained from the WHO daily reports. RESULTS: Multilevel regression models indicated a negative association between both accumulation of the total cases of COVID-19 morbidity (B = ?.041, SE = .013, p = .013) and mortality (B = ?.036, SE = .014 p = .002) and handwashing. Higher levels of total COVID-related morbidity and mortality were related to lower handwashing adherence. However, increases in recent cases of COVID-19 morbidity (B = .014, SE = .007, p = .035) and mortality (B = .022, SE = .009, p = .015) were associated with higher levels of handwashing adherence. Analyses controlled for participants COVID-19-related situation (their exposure to information about handwashing, being a healthcare professional), sociodemographic characteristics (gender, age, marital status), and country-level variables (strictness of containment and health policies, human development index). The models explained 14C20% of the variance in handwashing adherence.

Aims and Objectives: To assess the rate of compliance with infection control practices while taking dental radiographs in the dental clinic center of a teaching institution in Saudi Arabia. Materials and Methods: An observational study was undertaken for the infection control practices in the dental radiology wing of a university teaching center in Saudi Arabia. Data were collected from dental faculty, dental assistants, and dental students working in dental clinics. Both pretested questionnaire and by direct observation of infection control practices was used for data collection. Chi-Square test for categorical variables and Independent samples t-test for compare mean self-reported infection control practice scores were used. Binary logistics regression was used to identify the factors influencing participant's compliance with infection control practices. P  0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: 129 participants were included in this study, among those 26 were faculty, 19 were dental auxiliaries and 84 were dental students. On direct observation, the overall compliance rate was 79.5%; Dental auxiliaries have the highest compliance rate (94.5%) followed by dental faculty (88.5%) and students (68.6%). Binomial logistic regression predicted that females had 2.94 times more compliance than male counterparts, which is statistically significant.

This is especially important for multi-host pathogens such as the rabies virus, a major and almost invariably fatal zoonosis that has mobilized unanimous engagement at an international level towards the final goal of zero human deaths due to canine rabies. Currently, diagnostic laboratories implement a standardized identification using taxonomic keys. However, this method is challenged by high and undiscovered biodiversity, decomposition of carcasses and subjective misevaluation, as has been attested to by findings from a cohort of 242 archived specimens collected across Sub-Saharan Africa and submitted for rabies diagnosis. We applied two simple and cheap methods targeting the Cytochrome b and Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I to confirm the initial classification. We therefore suggest prioritizing a standardized protocol that includes, as a first step, the implementation of taxonomic keys at a family or subfamily level, followed by the molecular characterization of the host species.","output":"The Importance of Accurate Host Species Identification in the Framework of Rabies Surveillance, Control and Elimination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The psychological antecedents of the intention to open the windows at home were explored through the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), supplemented with Habits regarding the behavior and contextual factors.

Attitude and Habits were the main predictors of window openings, Perceived Behavioral control as a secondary predictor. Perceived Behavioral Control contributed significatively with a negative interaction with Attitudes. Odor awareness decreased Intention to manually ventilate. No effect of recommendation was observed. DISCUSSION: The results filled a gap in the literature about the willingness to manually ventilate at home and efficacy of a recommendation.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective, single-centre study of prone positioning in awake non-ventilated patients with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 pneumonia. The primary outcome was change in peripheral oxygenation in prone versus supine position. Secondary outcomes assessed effects on end-tidal CO(2), respiratory rate, heart rate, and subjective symptoms. We also recruited healthy volunteers to undergo proning during hypoxic challenge. RESULTS: 238 hospitalised patients with pneumonia were screened; 55 were eligible with 25 COVID-19 patients and 3 non-COVID-19 patients agreeing to undergo proning C the latter insufficient for further analysis. 10 healthy control volunteers underwent hypoxic challenge. Patients with COVID-19 had a median age of 64 years (interquartile range [IQR] 53C75). Proning led to an increase in SpO(2) compared to supine position (difference +1.62%; p=0.003) and occurred within 10 min of proning. There were no effects on end-tidal CO(2), respiratory rate, or heart rate. There was an increase in subjective discomfort (p=0.003), with no difference in breathlessness. Among healthy controls undergoing hypoxic challenge, proning did not lead to a change in SpO(2) or subjective symptom scores. CONCLUSION: Identification of suitable patients with COVID-19 requiring oxygen supplementation from general ward environments for awake proning is challenging.

Few researchers consider addressing the COVID-19 pandemic as a crisis that needs effective crisis management measures. In particular, there is a gap in research that maps a way forward that managers can use as a guide to recover and revive the hospitality industry after the pandemic. This paper aims to fill this gap. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected through interviews with 26 hoteliers managing 4- and 5-star hotels in the city of Beirut. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings: Findings show that the level of preparedness toward dealing with such a pandemic had been low. Hotels have been focused on ensuring transparency with the employees, providing adequate information and decentralizing power to the departmental levels to deal with the impacts of COVID-19. Operationally, hotel managers are shifting focus toward more safety-conscious operations across all departments;emphasizing the importance of local tourists rather than complete dependence on foreigners as a source of revenue;increasing flexibility in bookings and cancellations to incentivize customers. Shifts are expected to be made, making operations in hotels more technologically-aligned and focused. Research limitations/implications: The aim of this study is to address the managerial reactions of the hotel industry during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis and the potential strategic approaches that hotels might adopt in the future. A focus on the Lebanese context can provide scholars with a new model and inform managers on how to approach a crisis of such nature and magnitude, especially in a country that is facing its worst political and economic crisis. The main challenge of this paper is that it examines the hotel industry only in the Lebanese context. The development of the hospitality sector cannot be studied outside the institutional context in which it operates.

We propose a causal reduction method that, given a causal model, replaces an arbitrary number of possibly high-dimensional latent confounders with a single latent confounder that takes values in the same space as the treatment variable, without changing the observational and interventional distributions the causal model entails. This allows us to estimate the causal effect in a principled way from combined data without relying on the common but often unrealistic assumption that all confounders have been observed. We apply our causal reduction in three different settings. In the first setting, we assume the treatment and outcome to be discrete. The causal reduction then implies bounds between the observational and interventional distributions that can be exploited for estimation purposes. In certain cases with highly unbalanced observational samples, the accuracy of the causal effect estimate can be improved by incorporating observational data. Second, for continuous variables and assuming a linear-Gaussian model, we derive equality constraints for the parameters of the observational and interventional distributions. Third, for the general continuous setting (possibly nonlinear or non-Gaussian), we parameterize the reduced causal model using normalizing flows, a flexible class of easily invertible nonlinear transformations.

Cortisol and aldosterone were measured by conventional assay from blood samples taken immediately prior to the administration of synacthen (T0) and then 30 (T30) and 60 (T60) min later. At 3 600 m resting basal cortisol and aldosterone levels were both significantly lower than they were at sea-level (p=0.004, p=0.003, respectively). Cortisol values at T30 and T60 were not different between sea-level and 3 600 m but the increment after synacthen was significantly greater (p=0.041) at 3 600 m due to a lower basal value. Aldosterone at T30 and T60 was significantly lower (p=0.003 for both) at 3 600 m than at sea-level and the increment following synacthen was also significantly less (p=0.003) at 3 600 m. At 3 600 m there appears to be a divergent adrenal response to synthetic adrenocorticotrophic hormone with an intact cortisol response but a reduced aldosterone response, relative to sea-level.

However, their associations with COVID-19 outcomes are inconsistent, and of unknown prognostic value. OBJECTIVES: To systematically clarify the associations and prognostic accuracy of electrolyte imbalances (sodium, calcium, potassium, magnesium, chloride and phosphate) in predicting poor COVID-19 clinical outcome. METHODS: PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library were searched. Odds of poor clinical outcome (a composite of mortality, intensive-care unit (ICU) admission, need for respiratory support and acute respiratory distress syndrome) were pooled using mixed-effects models. The associated prognostic sensitivity, positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+, LR-) and predictive values (PPV, NPV; assuming 25% pre-test probability), and area under the curve (AUC) were computed. RESULTS: We included 28 observational studies from 953 records with low to moderate risk-of-bias. Hyponatremia (OR=2.08, 95%CI=1.48-2.94, I2=93%, N=8), hypernatremia (OR=4.32, 95%CI=3.17-5.88, I2=45%, N=7) and hypocalcemia (OR=3.31, 95%CI=2.24-4.88, I2=25%, N=6) were associated with poor COVID-19 outcome. These associations remained significant on adjustment for covariates such as demographics and comorbidities. Hypernatremia was 97% specific in predicting poor outcome (LR+ 4.0, PPV=55%, AUC=0.80) despite no differences in CRP and IL-6 levels between hypernatremic and normonatremic patients. Hypocalcemia was 76% sensitive in predicting poor outcome (LR- 0.44, NPV=87%, AUC=0.71). Overall quality of evidence ranged from very low to moderate. CONCLUSION: Hyponatremia, hypernatremia and hypocalcemia are associated with poor COVID-19 clinical outcome. Hypernatremia is 97% specific for a poor outcome and the association is independent of inflammatory marker levels. Further studies should evaluate if correcting these imbalances help improve clinical outcome.","output":"Associations and prognostic accuracy of electrolyte imbalances in predicting poor COVID-19 outcome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 28 observational studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Endotoxins and other harmful substances may cause an increase in permeability in endothelial cells (ECs) monolayers, as well as ECs shrinkage and death to induce lung damage. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can impair endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) functions, including proliferation, migration, and tube formation. EPCs can migrate to the damaged area, differentiate into ECs, and participate in vascular repair, which improves pulmonary capillary endothelial dysfunction and maintains the integrity of the endothelial barrier. Hydrogen (H(2)) contributes to the repairment of lung injury and the damage of ECs. We therefore speculate that H(2) protects the EPCs against LPS-induced damage, and its mechanism will be explored. The bone marrow-derived EPCs from ICR Mice were treated with LPS to establish a damaged model. Then EPCs were incubated with H(2), and treated with PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) inhibitor L-NAME. MTT assay, transwell assay and tube formation assay were used to detect the proliferation, migration and angiogenesis of EPCs. The expression levels of target proteins were detected by Western blot. Results found that H(2) repaired EPCs proliferation, migration and tube formation functions damaged by LPS. LY294002 and L-NAME significantly inhibited the repaired effect of H(2) on LPS-induced dysfunctions of EPCs.

All consecutive patients with COVID-19 who visited or were admitted to our hospital before May 12, 2020, were enrolled. Their demographics, symptoms, laboratory findings, comorbidities, concomitant drugs, treatment, and clinical course were reviewed. We defined liver injury as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels over the upper limit of normal. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients with COVID-19 (median age, 47 years old; men/women, 13/9) were enrolled. Two patients had underlying liver diseases, and two were diagnosed as having COVID-19 without any symptoms. Elevated ALT and GGT levels were found in 12 and 12 patients, respectively, and liver injury was observed in 15 patients (68.2%). Compared with the patients without liver injury, those with liver injury had a significantly higher fever during the clinical course (median, 37.5 vs. 38.8, p=0.006).

Few previous studies focused on the healthcare providers and involved multi-facets factors at individual, technical, organizational, and environmental levels. Purpose: To examine the influencing mechanism of technology use among Chinese physicians by integrating multilevel factors, Des-gamma-Carboxy Prothrombin (DCP) was taken as an example. Methods: Through multistage random sampling, a cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted among physicians in charge of direct use of DCP of sampled secondary and tertiary hospitals. Since the sample data comprised two hierarchical levels (physicians and hospitals), multilevel structural equation modeling was used to link five aspects of factors with physicians' technology use and estimate the effects. Results: Totally, 229 physicians completed the investigation. The use of DCP appears to be at a relatively low level. Intra-class coefficients of the null model (unadjusted baseline model) suggested that physicians' DCP use has a significant variation between hospitals. The final model identified that value cognition (B = 0.447, P < 0.01), experienced organizational practice (B = 0.203, P < 0.05), and perceived organizational atmosphere (B = -0.237, P < 0.01) contributed directly to physicians' DCP use. Additionally, technical assessment, perceived organizational atmosphere, and perceived environmental pressure had indirect impacts on physicians' DCP use that were mediated by value cognition and experienced organizational practice (P < 0.05). Conclusion: This study incorporated and determined the significant direct or indirect role of value cognition, technical assessment, experienced organizational practice, perceived organizational atmosphere, and perceived environmental pressure. This influencing mechanism with integrated multilevel factors could serve as a theoretical basis for tailoring interventions to promote technology use among Chinese physicians.","output":"Using Multilevel Structural Equation Modeling (MSEM) to Identify the Predictors and Influencing Mechanism of Technology Use Among Chinese Physicians: An Example from Des-Gamma-Carboxy Prothrombin (DCP)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The immune system is extraordinarily complex and efficient, capable of distinguishing pathogenic microorganisms from those that reside normally in our intestines, better known as gut microbiota. Unlike pathogenic microbes, the microbiota microorganisms are not attacked by our immune system due to the complex, dynamic interaction between these special microorganisms and the human organism itself. It is now recognized that the human immune system is closely dependent on the instructions it continuously receives from its microbiota, which plays a key role in the development, training and functioning of our defenses. Furthermore, it has also been repeatedly reported that regular physical activity combined with a balanced diet rich in fruit and vegetables, dairy products, nuts and fish can keep our immune system functioning properly. In addition, the aging process is somehow linked to a reduction in the ability to have an adequate immune response when needed. Many studies have shown that a disruption in the balance of the gut microbiota (called dysbiosis) can lead to major alterations in the immune system, thus promoting autoimmune diseases, allergies and diminished pathogen defenses. This is why it is important to maintain a healthy microbiota through three possible strategies: use of prebiotics, probiotics and postbiotics. Postbiotics consist of substances that act indirectly on the tissues of the host organism and/or on other bacterial strains, thus helping to convey the positive effects of the probiotics. It is important to emphasize that postbiotics do not contain live microorganisms and therefore have beneficial effects similar to those of probiotics without the risk of adverse reactions as may occur when taking live microorganisms. Among the most widely used and investigated substances in the literature is a natural yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which goes through a process of fermentation and drying. In several in-vitro studies, this dried fermentate has been shown to activate natural killer cells and provide immune support against colds, flu and allergies. This can be partly explained by the documented rapid effects on immune status, which generally occur within 1-2 hours after consumption. Human studies show that these substances may play a part in reducing the severity of viral infections of the respiratory tract and shortening the duration of the infection. Strengthening the microbiota, therefore, results in improved immune system capabilities. Taking postbiotics, therefore, could help improve the body's response to viral respiratory tract infections and probably also play a role in defending against SARS-CoV-2. This review shows that Saccharomyces cerevisiae is not only effective and simple, but also virtually free of side-effects, which is why it is recommended both for people with impaired immunity and for the healthy, as it helps to strengthen the entire immune system and maintain perfect health.

Portal vein rerouting with ligation of one branch of the portal vein bifurcation (PVL) or embolization (PVE) leads to a moderate liver volume increase over several weeks with a clinical dropout rate of 20-40%, mostly due to tumor progression during the waiting period. Accelerated liver regeneration by the Associating Liver Partition and Portal vein Ligation for Staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) was poised to overcome this limitation by reduction of the waiting time, but failed due increased perioperative complications. Simultaneous portal and hepatic vein embolization (PVE/HVE) is a novel minimal invasive way to induce rapid liver growth without the need of two surgeries. PURPOSE This article summarizes published results of PVE/HVE and analyzes what is known about its efficacy to achieve resection, safety, and the volume changes induced. CONCLUSIONS PVE/HVE holds promise to induce accelerated liver regeneration in a similar safety profile to PVE. The demonstrated accelerated hypertrophy may increase resectability.

This provided the opportunity to investigate the role of school-age children and school settings for transmission. METHODS: We compared the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in school-age children, teachers and the general working population in Luxembourg during two epidemic waves: a spring wave from March-April 2020 corresponding to general lockdown with schools being closed and May-July 2020 corresponding to schools being open. We assessed the number of secondary transmissions occurring in schools between May and July 2020 using routine contact tracing data. RESULTS: During the first wave in March-April 2020 when schools were closed, the incidence in pupils peaked at 28 per 100,000, while during the second wave in May-July 2020 when schools were open, incidence peaked 100 per 100,000. While incidence of SARS-CoV-2 was higher in adults than in children during the first spring wave, no significant difference was observed during the second wave in early summer. Between May and July 2020, we identified a total of 390 and 34 confirmed COVID-19 cases among 90,150 school-age children and 11,667 teachers, respectively. We further estimate that 179 primary cases caused 49 secondary cases in schools. While some small clusters of mainly student-to-student transmission within the same class were identified, we did not observe any large outbreaks with multiple generations of infection. CONCLUSIONS: Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within Luxembourg schools was limited during an early summer epidemic wave in 2020.

Full single cell transcriptomes coupled with quantification of 188 cell surface proteins, and T and B lymphocyte antigen receptor repertoires have provided several insights into COVID-19: 1. a new non-classical monocyte state that sequesters platelets and replenishes the alveolar macrophage pool; 2. platelet activation accompanied by early priming towards megakaryopoiesis in immature haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and expansion of megakaryocyte-primed progenitors; 3. increased clonally expanded CD8+ effector:effector memory T cells, and proliferating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in patients with more severe disease; and 4. relative increase of IgA plasmablasts in asymptomatic stages that switches to expansion of IgG plasmablasts and plasma cells, accompanied with higher incidence of BCR sharing, as disease severity increases.

Methods. In this research, a three-phase method was developed to evaluate the performance of 88 countries in the face of Covid-19. In the first phase, the countries were clustered, using the k-means algorithm. In the second phase, the data envelopment analysis model was implemented once on the clusters and then on all the countries without considering the clusters. In the third phase, after presentation of the concept of resilience in the Covid-19 era, an Analytic Hierarchy Process was implemented with three criteria, including the results of data envelopment analysis model without considering the clusters, the results of data envelopment analysis model considering the clusters and resilience, and then the ranking of the countries' performance in the face of Covid-19 was provided.

An unpaired Student's t-test was used for continuous variables, and the Pearson Chi-square (2) test for categorical. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were developed to assess the independent relationship between NLR, LMR and PLR and unfavorable outcomes. Non-parametric correlations were calculated using Spearman's Rho correlation coefficient. The mean age of the patients was 64.7; mean BMI was 29.10; 73 (39.67%) were female and 111 male (60.33%). No statistical difference between groups was identified with regard to NLR (mean 8.29, standard deviation [SD] 7.86).

This has necessitated the need for alternative protein sources that can partially substitute the SBM protein and reduce the cost of feeding. Sunflower meal (SFM), a by-product from the oil processing industry, is available in significantly high quantities throughout the year at lower cost. SFM can be produced in drought-stricken places with good harvest and is less prone to fungal infestation. Although SFM has protein levels ranging between 32 and 37 percent, its inclusion levels in broiler diets have been limited to 5% due to high concentration of non-starch polysaccharides, low metabolizable energy and lysine levels. This presents challenges in feed manufacturing, since composition depends on the amount of oil extracted and retained hulls, with effects on the digestive efficiency of broiler chicks, especially in the first 21 d of growth. The use of multi-enzymes that target specific substrates in SFM can potentially allow an increase in its inclusion levels, thereby reducing the deleterious anti-nutritional effects from non-starch polysaccharides (NSPs). Additionally, multienzyme supplementation can result in flock uniformity and environmental pollution reduction due to less nutrient loss in manure. ABSTRACT: The study examined the effect of de-hulled sunflower meal (SFM) inclusion rate and exogenous enzymes (EE) on broilers production performance. A four-feeding phase of pre-starter (1C9 d), grower (10C20 d), finisher (21C28 d) and post-finisher (29C35 d) was used with SFM included as low (BSL) and high (BSH) in all phases. BLS inclusion was 3% throughout phases and BSH inclusion was 7.5%, 10%, 13% and 13.5% for the 4-phases. Each SFM had a negative control (NC) (BSL? and BSH?) and positive (PC) (BSL+ and BSH+) control with additional 80 kcal Apparent Metabolizable Energy. Enzymes: xylanase (X), xylanase + beta-glucanase (XB), xylanase + beta-glucanase + protease (XBP) and xylanase + amylase + protease (XAP) were added to the NC and PC to give 6 treatments. Pen body weight gain (BWG) and feed intake (FI) were determined at 9, 20, 28 and 35 d and feed conversion ratio (FCR) was calculated accordingly. Diets were fed ad libitum to 1920 male Ross 308 broilers. Diet type, enzyme and diet by enzyme interactions were not significantly different amongst treatment diets. During the pre-starter and the grower phase, all studied parameters did not significantly differ from each other. All studied parameters were significantly influenced by enzyme addition and diet-type and enzyme interaction at 35 d except for diet type on FCR. Broilers fed BSH supplemented with XAP recorded the highest BWG (2.69 kg), whereas broiler chickens on BSL and supplemented with XBP recorded the lowest BWG (2.60 kg). SFM can be increased to 13% and 13.5% finisher and post-finisher diets without negatively affecting performance, and X and XAP enzymes can improve BWG of broilers grown to 35 d.","output":"Sunflower Meal Inclusion Rate and the Effect of Exogenous Enzymes on Growth Performance of Broiler Chickens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) are at increased risk of infection.

Genetic and subunit vaccines are two major categories of these emerging vaccines. Owing to their nature, they rely heavily on delivery systems with various functions, such as effective cargo protection, immunogenicity enhancement, targeted delivery, sustained release of antigens, selective activation of humoral and/or cellular immune responses against specific antigens, and reduced adverse effects. Therefore, vaccine delivery systems may significantly affect the final outcome of genetic and other novel vaccines and are vital for their development. This review introduces these studies based on their research emphasis on functional design or administration route optimization, presents recent progress, and discusses features of new vaccine delivery systems, providing an overview of this field.","output":"Recent Advances in Delivery Systems for Genetic and Other Novel Vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The current COVID-19 pandemic has become a serious issue for the health-care professionals including dental practitioners Materials and Methods: A total of 100 subjects were selected for the study An online questionnaire using Google Forms was used to collect the data regarding the dentist's knowledge, perceptions and infection control in dental clinics and if they were affected by COVID-19 Data were analysed using software Results: Out of 100 participants, 61% of them were male with a mean age of 35 21 years More than 50% of practitioners took 10-20 min for completion of their procedure 66% used all the personal protective equipment (PPE) with 64% of them using an N95 mask and around 90% used the PPE kit Amongst the study group, it was found that 3% were affected by COVID-19, who were between 27 and 33 years All of them used PPE kit with 67% using N95 mask and 33% used half respirator 67% amongst them used high-speed handpiece and performed aerosol-producing procedures in a well-ventilated atmosphere with air conditioners Conclusion: The findings of the study showed that the maximum number of practitioners did follow the clinical protection protocol and when all protocol was followed, the number of dental practitioners affected by COVID-19 was not statistically significant","output":"Assessing the Practice Protocol of Dental Practitioners during COVID-19 Pandemic: A Questionnaire Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The formulation of Non-Traditional Security (NTS) made three principle contributions to security sector discourse in the face of peculiar security challenges of the post-Cold War era. First, it opened space for non-military threats to be considered, allowing issues ranging from infectious disease, illegal drug trafficking, irregular migration, environmental degradation, financial turmoil, and natural disasters to be framed as legitimate security concerns. The resonance of this for the Asia-Pacific is plain, having experienced a financial crisis in 1997/1998;regular issues of pollution, haze, and the early impacts of climate change;Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Avian Flu pandemics and now COVID-19;massive migration;and regular and periodically massive natural disasters. Second, it stressed that many, if not most, of these newly-recognised security threats are transnational, rather than inter-state. Therefore, the scope for resolving security threats was expanded beyond simply engaging the appropriate state diplomatically or militarily to include private and non-governmental actors, and in so doing, shifting from a default of bilateral resolutions to one of multilateral ones including various state and non-state parties, producing a greater emphasis on broader societal coordination. ? 2021 by Editors.","output":"Non-traditional security: An evolving solution to new challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Exercise and cardiovascular fitness are important for physical health and well-being. Recent studies show that exercise is associated with cognitive performance across multiple domains including memory, a common complaint for older adults. Data included a ten-word list of delayed recall, a clock drawing activity, and a three-meter walking course derived from the National Health & Aging Trends Study Database (NHATS Round 9). A total of 4977 participants were included in the analysis which was predominantly white (69.7%), non-Hispanic (94.5%), female (59.2%), and between the ages of 70-84 (62.7%). A hierarchical linear regression revealed that performance on the three-meter walking course positively predicted performance on delayed recall, F(4,3999)=300.257, p<.001, and on the clock drawing activity, which is a common screening task for cognitive decline, F(4,3978)=156.433, p<.001; accounting for 23.1% and 13.6% of the variability, respectively, over and above known demographic variables. Findings suggest that fitness may be one of many factors that is associated with memory and overall cognitive decline. These findings are timely as many individuals slowed down as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in decreases in exercise and physical activity. Not being physically active or exercising may be related to poorer physical and cognitive health, with specific concerns regarding memory. Taking into consideration the fear and anxiety associated with declining memory in late life, it is crucial to explore this area further along with other factors that may contribute to the association and develop new ways for older adults to exercise safely during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Get Moving!

Whilst several parameters influencing infection transmission are expected to be consistent across populations, the serial interval can vary across and within populations over time. Therefore, local estimates are preferable for use in epidemiological models developed at a regional level. We used data collected as part of the national contact tracing process in Ireland to estimate the serial interval of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Irish population, and to estimate the proportion of transmission events that occurred prior to the onset of symptoms. RESULTS: After data cleaning, the final dataset consisted of 471 infected close contacts from 471 primary cases. The median serial interval was 4 days, mean serial interval was 4.0 (95% confidence intervals 3.7, 4.3) days, whilst the 25th and 75th percentiles were 2 and 6 days respectively. We found that intervals were lower when the primary or secondary case were in the older age cohort (greater than 64 years). Simulating from an incubation period distribution from international literature, we estimated that 67% of transmission events had greater than 50% probability of occurring prior to the onset of symptoms in the infector. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst our analysis was based on a large sample size, data were collected for the primary purpose of interrupting transmission chains. Similar to other studies estimating the serial interval, our analysis is restricted to transmission pairs where the infector is known with some degree of certainty. Such pairs may represent more intense contacts with infected individuals than might occur in the overall population. It is therefore possible that our analysis is biased towards shorter serial intervals than the overall population.

High coverage of HPV vaccination is a World Health Organization priority to eliminate cervical cancer globally, but vaccine supply and logistics limit widespread implementation of the current two or three dose HPV vaccine schedule. METHODS: We are conducting an individual randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether a single dose of the bivalent (HPV 16/18) or nonavalent (HPV 16/18/31/33/45/52/58/6/11) HPV vaccine prevents persistent HPV infection, a surrogate marker for precancerous lesions and cervical cancer. The primary objective is to compare the efficacy of immediate, single-dose bivalent or nonavalent vaccination with delayed HPV vaccination. Kenyan women age 15C20 years old are randomized to immediate bivalent HPV and delayed meningococcal vaccine (group 1), immediate nonavalent HPV vaccine and delayed meningococcal vaccine (group 2), or immediate meningococcal vaccine and delayed HPV vaccine (group 3) with 36 months of follow-up. The primary outcome is persistent vaccine-type HPV infection by month 18 and by month 36 for the final durability outcome. The secondary objectives include to (1) evaluate non-inferiority of antibody titers among girls and adolescents (age 9 to 14 years) from another Tanzanian study, the DoRIS Study (NCT02834637), compared to KEN SHE Study participants; (2) assess the memory B cell immune response at months 36 and 37; and (3) estimate cost-effectiveness using the trial results and health economic models.

The lethal concentrations of three disinfectants (sodium hypochlorite, benzalkonium chloride, and peracetic acid) and eight antibiotics (ampicillin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, tetracycline, vancomycin, and fosfomycin) for eight different strains of L. monocytogenes were determined in this research work. It was demonstrated that the lethal concentrations for the disinfectants tested were much lower than the concentrations customarily used of these compounds. The characteristics of the cell surface play an important role in the tolerance of L. monocytogenes to these biocides. A considerable prevalence of resistance to most of the antibiotics tested was noted, making it clear that the necessary measures to control resistance in L. monocytogenes must be adopted. ABSTRACT: When selecting effective doses of antimicrobials, be they biocides or antibiotics, it is essential to know the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of these substances. The present research determined the MICs and MBCs for three biocides, sodium hypochlorite (SH), benzalkonium chloride (BC), and peracetic acid (PAA), and nine antibiotics in eight strains of Listeria monocytogenes of varying serotypes. Marked intra-species differences were observed in the resistance of L. monocytogenes to the biocides and antibiotics. The MICs (ppm) for the biocides ranged between 1750 and 4500 for SH, 0.25 and 20.00 for BC, and 1050 and 1700 for PAA. Their MBCs (ppm) ranged from 2250 to 4500 for SH, 0.50 to 20.00 for BC, and 1150 to 1800 for PAA. The MICs (ppm) for antibiotics lay between 1 and 15 for ampicillin, 8 and 150 for cephalothin, 20 and 170 for cefoxitin, 0.05 and 0.20 for erythromycin, 4 and 50 for chloramphenicol, 3 and 100 for gentamicin, 2 and 15 for tetracycline, 2 and 80 for vancomycin, and 160 and 430 for fosfomycin. The corresponding MBCs (ppm) were from 5 to 20 for ampicillin, 9 to 160 for cephalothin, 70 to 200 for cefoxitin, 4 to 5 for erythromycin, 9 to 70 for chloramphenicol, 5 to 100 for gentamicin, 3 to 30 for tetracycline, 3 to 90 for vancomycin, and 160 to 450 for fosfomycin. Notably, erythromycin showed considerable efficacy, demonstrated by the low values for both MIC and MBC. Based on EUCAST and the CLSI criteria, all strains were susceptible to erythromycin. All strains were resistant to cephalothin, cefoxitin, gentamicin, and fosfomycin. Further values for resistance were 87.50% for ampicillin and vancomycin, 75.00% for tetracycline, and 62.50% for chloramphenicol. The high prevalence of antibiotic resistance is a matter for concern. A positive correlation was found between MIC and MBC values for most of the biocides and antibiotics. The higher the hydrophobicity of the cell surface, the higher the susceptibility to biocides, suggesting that surface characteristics of bacterial cells influence resistance to these compounds.","output":"Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) for Twelve Antimicrobials (Biocides and Antibiotics) in Eight Strains of Listeria monocytogenes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome - temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) is a new disease, the first cases of which were observed in the spring of 2020. It affects children who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and children who have been in direct contact with patients suffering from COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). The disease is characterized by a wide spectrum of symptoms and the development of generalized inflammation of different organs and systems. One of the numerous symptoms may be severe abdominal pain. Aim: The aim of this study was to review the available literature and analyze the results of patients treated at the Department of Pediatric Surgery, Traumatology and Urology in Poznan in whom PIMS-TS imitated acute surgical abdominal disease. Materials and methods: material for the study was collected on the basis of medical records of patients treated at the Department of Pediatric Surgery, Traumatology and Urology of the Poznan University of Medical Sciences in the period between March 2020 and February 2021. Results: TDuring this period, seven patients met the PIMS-TS criteria and three children were qualified for surgical treatment. Only one patient had an acute surgical cause of abdominal pain. Discussions: The guidelines of the expert group at the Polish Pediatric Society and the National Consultant in the field of Pediatrics indicate the need to exclude acute surgical abdominal disease as a criterion for the diagnosis of PIMS-TS syndrome. In patients with acute abdominal pain, imaging and laboratory tests are sometimes diagnostically inconclusive, therefore exploratory laparoscopy is worth considering in order to differentiate PIMS-TS from acute surgical abdominal disease.","output":"Diagnostics and treatment of complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the pediatric surgery department.

During the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when states turned inward to protect their own citizens, refugees and de facto stateless persons found themselves excluded from humanitarian services and health care and were denied the ability to claim rights. Stateless women faced the additional burden of gender-based violence, a hostile labor market, and the threat of trafficking. This paper analyzes gender and statelessness as vectors of exclusion in South Asia, where asylum seekers are neither recognized by law nor protected by social institutions. We argue that citizenship constitutes an unearned form of social capital that is claimed and experienced in distinctively gendered ways. The pandemic has shone a bright light on the perils of statelessness, particularly for women, who face exacerbated economic inequities, the forced commodification of their sexuality, and exclusion from mechanisms of justice.","output":"Fault Lines of Refugee Exclusion: Statelessness, Gender, and COVID-19 in South Asia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aerosol transmission is now well-established as a route in the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Factors influencing the transport of virus-laden particles in an elevator cabin are investigated computationally and include human respiratory events, locations of the infected person(s), and the ventilation system (ventilation mode, ventilation capacity, and vent schemes). Breath, cough, and sneeze are defined quantitatively by the fluid jet velocities and particle sizes. For natural ventilation, most particles exhaled by sneezing and coughing tend to deposit on surfaces quickly, but aerosol generated by breathing will remain suspended in the air longer. For forced ventilation, motions of particles under different ventilation capacities are compared. Larger particles otherwise deposited readily on solid surfaces may be slowed down by airflow. Air currents also accelerate the motions of smaller particles, facilitating the subsequent deposition of micrometer or sub-micrometer particles. Locations of the infected person(s) lead to different spreading scenarios due to the distinctive motions of the particles generated by the various respiratory events. Sneeze particles will likely contaminate the person in front of the infected passenger only. Cough particles will increase the risk of all the people around the injector. Breath particles tend to spread throughout the confined environment. An optimized vent scheme is introduced and can reduce particles suspended in the air by up to 80% as compared with commonly used schemes.

A limited amount of data are available evaluating operative outcomes in comparison to standard laparoscopic surgery. We completed a retrospective review comparing robotic and laparoscopic ventral hernia repair to provide safety and outcomes data to help design a future prospective trial design. METHODS A retrospective review of 215 patients undergoing ventral hernia repair (142 robotic and 73 laparoscopic) was completed at two large academic centers. Primary outcome measure evaluated was recurrence. Secondary outcomes included incidence of primary fascial closure, and surgical site occurrences. RESULTS Propensity for treatment match comparison demonstrated that robotic repair was associated with a decreased incidence of recurrence (2.1 versus 4.2%, p < 0.001) and surgical site occurrence (4.2 versus 18.8%, p < 0.001). This may be because robotic repair was associated with increased incidence of primary fascial closure (77.1 versus 66.7%, p < 0.01). Analysis of baseline patient populations showed that robotic repairs were completed on patients with lower body mass index (28.1  3.6 versus 34.2  6.4, p < 0.001) and fewer comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS Our retrospective data show that robotic repair was associated with decreased recurrence and surgical site occurrence.

The study was conducted from March 5 to April 23 2020, therefore including the lockdown period in France (since March 17 2020). We confirmed that the increase of genome units in raw wastewaters accurately followed the increase of human COVID-19 cases observed at the regional level. Of note, the viral genomes could be detected before the beginning of the exponential growth of the epidemic. As importantly, a marked decrease in the quantities of genomes units was observed concomitantly with the reduction in the number of new COVID-19 cases which was an expected consequence of the lockdown. As a conclusion, this work suggests that a quantitative monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in wastewaters should bring important and additional information for an improved survey of SARS-CoV-2 circulation at the local or regional scale.","output":"Time course quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Parisian wastewaters correlates with COVID-19 confirmed cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: The School of Dentistry at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UTHSA-SoD) implemented an SoD Emerging Leaders Program (SoDELP) in 2020-2021. This case report describes the leadership training needs of junior faculty that stimulated SoDELP development, the inter-institutional collaboration that facilitated program implementation, SoDELP curriculum content, and outcomes of formative assessment for two pilot cohorts of the SoDELP. METHODS: The 32-h curriculum was comprised of readings, reflection exercises, seminars by the Center for Professional Excellence at the University of Texas at San Antonio, case discussion, analysis of leadership dilemmas, and self-assessments. For a capstone project, participants created a case depicting a challenging leadership situation they experienced as a team leader or member. The SoDELP commenced in a face-to-face format but was completed online due to COVID 19. Formative evaluation included participants' pre- and post-training perceptions elicited by the Leadership Attitudes, Confidence and Concerns Inventory (LACCI) and qualitative appraisal of program components obtained by surveys and focus groups. RESULTS: All 18 participants completed SoDELP and provided positive evaluations of program content, organization, teaching quality, and value. Analysis of pre- and post-assessments indicated that participants' confidence in performing an array of leadership tasks was significantly enhanced, and participants' concerns about assuming leadership roles, such as not being ready for the job, impact on friendships, or concerns about ethical challenges, were significantly reduced. The LACCI displayed promising reliability in assessing participants' confidence, attitudes and concerns, demonstrating the potential to serve as a measurement tool to appraise outcomes of leadership training in the health professions. CONCLUSION: Outcomes suggest that SoDELP enhances faculty members' sense of readiness for leadership roles, and the LACCI may be a useful assessment tool for leadership training.","output":"Pilot test of an emerging leaders program for dental school faculty"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND In March 2020, COVID-19 forced institutions of higher education, faculty, staff, and students to transition to emergency remote learning. This unprecedented time provided the opportunity to reenvision the delivery of nursing education and operation of the college of nursing, using the principles of the four Cs of interorganizational partnering as a guide supported by positive organizational scholarship. METHOD The Villanova University Fitzpatrick College of Nursing designed and implemented strategies to provide seamless learning opportunities for students in undergraduate and graduate nursing programs, while providing necessary support and future planning for the upcoming academic year.

METHODS We conducted a systematic review of qualitative studies exploring adult patients' experiences with RCT participation. We searched MEDLINE (PubMed), CINAHL, PSYCHINFO, and Embase (search date March 2018) for eligible reports. Qualitative data coding and indexing were assisted by NVivo. The quality of reports was assessed by using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) tool. RESULTS We included 45 qualitative studies that involved 1732 RCT participants. Important psychological burdens were identified at every stage of the trial process. Participants reported feeling anxiety and being afraid of \\"being a 'guinea pig'\\" and described undergoing randomization and allocation to a placebo as particularly difficult resulting in disappointment, anger, and depression. Patients' follow-up and trial closure were also responsible for a wide range of psychological, physical, and financial burdens. Furthermore, factors related to burdensome impacts and consequences were discerned. These factors involved trial information, poorly organized and too-demanding follow-up, and lack of appropriate management when the patient's participation ended. Trial participation was also associated with beneficial effects such as the satisfaction of feeling \\"useful,\\" gaining \\"a sense of control,\\" and receiving special attention.

Objectives: We provide additional evidence on the possible influence of air quality, particularly in terms of chronicity of exposure on the spread viral infection in Italian regions. Methods: Actual data on to COVID-19 outbreak in Italian provinces and corresponding long-term air quality evaluations, were obtained from Italian and European agencies, elaborated and tested for possible interactions. Discussion: Our elaborations reveal that, beside concentrations, the chronicity of exposure may influence the anomalous variability of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy. Data on distribution of atmospheric pollutants (NO2, O3, PM2.5 and PM10) in Italian regions during the last 4 years, days exceeding regulatory limits, and years of the last decade (2010-2019) in which the limits have been exceeded for at least 35 days, confirmed that Northern Italy has been constantly exposed to chronic air pollution. Long-term air-quality data significantly correlated with cases of Covid-19 in up to 71 Italian provinces (updated 6 April) providing further evidence that chronic exposure to atmospheric contamination may represent a favourable context for the spread of the virus.

This study aimed to determine impact of LOS on short-term outcomes and associated factors of LOS in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). METHODS: A total of 3615 patients with STEMI after PPCI in the China Acute Myocardial Infarction registry were included in the analysis. Predictors of prolonged LOS were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression model with generalized estimating equation. The impact of LOS on 30-day clinical outcomes was assessed. RESULTS: The median LOS was 9 (7, 12) days. Patients with a longer LOS (>7 days) were older, more often in lower-level hospitals, had more periprocedural complications and hospitalization expense. Fourteen variables, such as weekend admission and lower-level hospitals, were identified as independent associated factors of prolonged LOS. There were no significant difference in 30-day major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), readmission, and functional status between patients with LOS7d and LOS>7d after multivariate adjustment and propensity score matching. However, patients who discharged over one week had better medication adherence (adjusted odds ratio: 0.817, 95% confidence interval: 0.687C0.971, P=0.022). Significant interaction was observed in medication use between gender and LOS (P(interaction)=0.038). CONCLUSION: Patients with STEMI undergoing PPCI experienced a relatively long LOS in China, which resulted in more medical expenses but no improvement on 30-day MACCE, readmission, and functional recovery. Poor 30-day medication adherence with short LOS reflects unsatisfying transition of management from hospital to community.

The membrane has outstanding efficacy against a broad range of viruses, which include enveloped, non-enveloped, airborne and waterborne viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, H1N1 (the influenza A virus strain responsible for the swine flu pandemic in 2009) and enterovirus 71 (a non-enveloped virus resistant to harsh conditions, such as highly acidic pH), which highlights a possible role in fighting the current and future viral outbreaks and pandemics.","output":"An antiviral trap made of protein nanofibrils and iron oxyhydroxide nanoparticles."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper deals with the problem of reconstructing the topological structure of a network of dynamical systems.

Sequence analyses revealed a strong selection for the S gene of 83P-5 in Vero cells, and virtually all mutations occurring at the 34th and 61st passages had been carried over to the 100th-passaged virus. In contrast, the viral M and N genes showed a strong conservation during the serial passage. Pigs experimentally infected with the 34th- or 61st-passaged virus, but not the 100th-passaged virus, exhibited diarrhea, indicating an attenuation of the 83P-5 at the 100th passage. Interestingly, S protein of the attenuated 100th-passaged 83P-5 showed a remarkable sequence similarity to that of previously reported DR-13 strain of attenuated PEDV that also had been established by serial passage in Vero cells. Further studies will be required to define whether the mutations in the S gene of 83P-5 that had been selected and accumulated during the serial passages are indeed the causalities of the growth adaptation in vitro and the attenuation of virulence in vivo.","output":"Mutations in the spike gene of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus associated with growth adaptation in vitro and attenuation of virulence in vivo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted medical education worldwide.

The purpose of this scoping review was to assess the impact of COVID-19 on medical education and investigate how this effect varies in different income countries. The methodology adhered to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) extension for scoping reviews. Key terms were searched in six electronic databases. Inclusion criteria included studies describing the effect of COVID-19 on undergraduate medical education in university and clinical settings, studies published post 1 December 2019 and studies published in English. A modified Johanna Briggs Institute data charting tool was used to extract data concerning study characteristics and outcomes. The initial search returned 298 articles. Following duplicate removal and article screening, 33 studies were included. The literature indicated that the pandemic had a negative effect on medical student education worldwide, in both high-income countries (HICs) and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). A range of factors impacted students and educators, including new curriculum and assessment design, reduced patient contact, use of new technology and lack of infrastructure. However, LMICs encountered more arduous barriers such as lack of access to information technology infrastructure and support from national governments. COVID-19 has impeded medical education worldwide. Future research is needed to address barriers to providing medical education during a pandemic.

Design/methodology/approach: This study used an online survey for data collection by distributing online questionnaires to students at a private university in Indonesia. Convenience sampling was applied as the sample method. A total of 253 valid questionnaires were acquired, and all items were recorded on the seven-point comparative scale. Exploratory factor analysis was adopted to identify the dimensions of perceived quality. Then, multiple regression analysis was used to examine the impacts of these dimensions on student satisfaction. Findings: Four dimensions of perceived quality differences were identified, namely, the perceived quality of the campus facilities, learning process, teaching staff and administrative staff. Regression analysis results proved that the perceived differences in the quality dimensions between the traditional classroom and online distance learning had positive and significant effects on student satisfaction. Research limitations/implications: As a result of using a convenient sample, this study exhibited a limited sample and context. Therefore, the generalizability of these findings is limited. Future research can use a stratified sample with more diverse categories of respondents. Practical implications: The findings of this study will help universities that plan to change the mode of learning from traditional classroom to online distance learning. Higher education institutions can gain a deep understanding of these perceived quality attributes that have significant impacts on student satisfaction.

To ensure the quality of such devices and their relevance to slow down the virus spreading, a quick reaction of the certification organisms was necessary to fix the minimal acceptable performances requirements. Moreover, many laboratories involved in the aerosol research field have been asked to perform tests in a quick time according to (CEN, 2020) proposed by the European committee for standardization. This specification imposes a minimal air permeability of 96 L mC2 sC1 for a 100 Pa pressure drop and a minimal filtration efficiency of 70% for 3 m diameter particles. In the present article, an intercomparison of efficiencies and permeabilities measured by 3 laboratories has been performed. Results are in good agreement considering the heterogeneity of the material samples (within 27% in terms of filtration efficiency and less than 20% in terms of permeability). On this basis, an analysis of 233 materials made of woven, non-woven and mixed fibrous material has been done in terms of filtration efficiency and air permeability. For some of them, measurements have been performed for 0.2 m, 1 m and 3 m particle diameters. As expected, no deterministic correlation could be determined to link these efficiencies to the permeability of the considered samples. However, a trend could be identified for woven and mixed materials with an increase of filtration efficiency when the air permeability decreases. The same exercise has been conducted to link the filtration efficiency measured at 3 m to the one for lower diameters. Finally, a discussion on the kind of material that is the most relevant to manufacture CoFC supported by spectral filtration efficiency values (from 0.02 m to 3 m) is proposed.

Here we report the first identified infections of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; aetiology of COVID-19) among recent international arrivals to Sudan and their contacts. METHODS: Suspected cases were identified clinically and/or epidemiologically. Samples from suspected cases and their contacts were tested in the National Influenza Centre following World Health Organization protocols. Two real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays were used to detect and confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Seven cases of COVID-19, including two deaths, were confirmed in Sudan between 27 February and 30 March 2020. Suspected cases were identified and tested. As of 30 March, no local transmission was yet reported in the country. Fifty-nine percent of the suspected cases were international travellers coming from areas with current COVID-19 epidemics. Cough and fever were the major symptoms, presented by 65% and 60% of the suspected cases, respectively. By early April, an additional seven cases were confirmed through limited contact tracing that identified the first locally acquired infections in recent contact with imported cases. CONCLUSIONS: The high mortality rate of COVID-19 cases in Sudan might be due to limitations in test and trace and case management services. Unfortunately, infections have spread further into other states and the country has no capacity for mass community screening to better estimate disease prevalence. Therefore external support is urgently needed to improve the healthcare and surveillance systems.","output":"The first laboratory-confirmed imported infections of SARS-CoV-2 in Sudan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Changes in human behaviour are a major determinant of epidemic dynamics. Collective activity can be modified through imposed control measures, but spontaneous changes can also arise as a result of uncoordinated individual responses to the perceived risk of contagion. Here, we introduce a stochastic epidemic model implementing population responses driven by individual time-varying risk aversion. The model reveals an emergent mechanism for the generation of multiple infection waves of decreasing amplitude that progressively tune the effective reproduction number to its critical value R = 1. In successive waves, individuals with gradually lower risk propensity are infected. The overall mechanism shapes well-defined risk-aversion profiles over the whole population as the epidemic progresses. We conclude that uncoordinated changes in human behaviour can by themselves explain major qualitative and quantitative features of the epidemic process, like the emergence of multiple waves and the tendency to remain around R = 1 observed worldwide after the first few waves of COVID-19.","output":"Individual risk-aversion responses tune epidemics to critical transmissibility (R = 1)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To evaluate differences in morbidity and mortality among mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 treated with therapeutic versus prophylactic anticoagulation.

METHODS AND RESULTS: 3101 responses were received from 141 countries across 6 continents. 88.3% responded that their country was in \\"total lockdown\\" and 7.1% in partial lockdown. 78.8% responded that the number of patients presenting with STEMI was reduced since the coronavirus outbreak and 65.2% indicated that the reduction in STEMI presentations was >40%. Approximately 60% of all respondents reported that STEMI patients presented later than usual and 58.5% that >40% of STEMI patients admitted to hospital presented beyond the optimal window for primary percutaneous intervention (PCI) or thrombolysis. Independent predictors of the reported higher rate of delayed STEMI presentation were a country in total lockdown, >100 COVID-19 cases admitted locally, and the complete restructuring of the local cardiology service.

Understanding the early innate immune mechanisms that participate in the development of chronic postviral lung disease may reveal new targets for therapeutic intervention. The intracellular viral sensor protein melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) sustains the acute immune response to Sendai virus, a mouse pathogen that causes chronic lung inflammation, but its role in the development of postviral chronic lung disease is unknown. OBJECTIVES To establish the role of MDA5 in the development of chronic lung disease. METHODS MDA5-deficient or control mice were infected with Sendai virus. The acute inflammatory response was evaluated by profiling chemokine and cytokine expression and by characterizing the composition of the cellular infiltrate. The impact of MDA5 on chronic lung pathology and function was evaluated through histological studies, degree of oxygen saturation, and responsiveness to carbachol. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS MDA5 deficiency resulted in normal virus replication and in a distinct profile of chemokines and cytokines that associated with acute lung neutropenia and enhanced accumulation of alternatively activated macrophages. Diminished expression of neutrophil-recruiting chemokines was also observed in cells infected with influenza virus, suggesting a key role of MDA5 in driving the early accumulation of neutrophils at the infection site. The biased acute inflammatory response of MDA5-deficient mice led to an enhanced chronic lung inflammation, epithelial cell hyperplasia, airway hyperreactivity, and diminished blood oxygen saturation.

METHODS AND RESULTS Patients were randomized (1:1:1:1) to transendocardial injection of MSCs combined with CPCs, MSCs alone, CPCs alone, or placebo, and followed for 12 months. Seven centers enrolled 125 participants with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 28.6  6.1% and scar size 19.4  5.8%, in NYHA class II or III. The proportion of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) was significantly decreased by CPCs alone (-22% vs. placebo, P = 0.043). Quality of life (MLHFQ score) was significantly improved by MSCs alone (P = 0.050) and MSCs+CPCs (P = 0.023) vs. placebo.

The electrodes were characterized and their charge storage stability and mechanical properties were investigated for up to 1000 cycles by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements and nanoindentation. The results show that cC offers a higher initial charge capacity than rC as well as improved carbon nanotube dispersion due to its conjugated structure. Although the improved dispersion results in a higher elastic modulus for cC (compared to rC), the stiffer nature of cP made it more vulnerable to degrade upon repetitive volumetric change, while with rP, the decoupled acrylate monomer remained more protected when its redox active units of TPA underwent charge-discharge cycling.","output":"Polytriphenylamine composites for energy storage electrodes: effect of pendant vs. backbone polymer architecture of the electroactive group"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: We studied time trends in seasonal influenza vaccination and associations with socioeconomic and health-related determinants in Switzerland, overall and in people aged 65 years. DESIGN: Three cross-sectional surveys. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals who participated in the Swiss Health Surveys 2007, 2012 and 2017. We calculated the proportion reporting influenza vaccination in the last 12 months, and performed multivariable logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: We included 51 582 individuals in this analysis. The median age was 49 years (IQR 25C64), and 27 518 were women (53.3%). The proportion of reporting a history of influenza vaccination overall was 31.9% (95% CI 31.4 to 32.4); and dropped from 34.5% in 2007 to 28.8% in 2017. The uptake of vaccination within the past 12 months was 16% in 2007 and similar in 2012 and 2017 (around 14%). In people with chronic disease, uptake dropped from 43.8% in 2007 to 37.1% in 2012 and to 31.6% in 2017 (p<0.001). In people aged 65 years, uptake dropped from 47.8% in 2007 to 38.5% in 2012 to 36.2% in 2017 (p<0.001). In logistic regression, self-reported vaccination coverage decreased in the 65C75 years old (adjusted OR (aOR) 0.56, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.66 between 2007 and 2012; aOR 0.89, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.03 between 2012 and 2017). Uptake was positively associated with the 65 age group, living in French-speaking and urban areas, history of smoking, bad self-reported health status, private/semiprivate health insurance, having a medical profession and having any underlying chronic disease. CONCLUSION: Influenza vaccination coverage was low in older and chronically ill persons.

In the Indian context, there is a dearth of consensus recommendations to guide clinicians regarding optimal sequencing of therapy in APC management. A Delphi-based consensus regarding optimal therapy sequencing in APC management was developed by an expert panel of medical oncologists from across India. METHODS: An expert scientific committee of 11 medical oncologists and an expert panel of 53 medical oncologists from India constituted the panel for the Delphi consensus. In the first phase, a questionnaire with 41 clinical statements was developed in several critical controversial areas in APC treatment. In the second phase, 29 clinical statements were reworked and sent to eight experts to obtain their opinions on best practices. The consensus ratings were based on a 9-point Likert scale. Based on the overall response, statements with a mean score of  7 with 1 outlier were considered as consensus. RESULTS: Degarelix was the preferred androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). While ADT plus docetaxel was the preferred option for metastatic castrate-sensitive/na?ve prostate cancer patients with high-volume disease, ADT with abiraterone was the preferred choice for low-volume disease. Docetaxel was the preferred first-line treatment option in men who received ADT alone in the castrate-sensitive/na?ve setting. For patients progressing on or after docetaxel for metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (without prior abiraterone or enzalutamide), the experts reached a consensus on the use of enzalutamide as the preferred second-line treatment option. No consensus was reached for the third-line treatment options. CONCLUSION: This article is intended to serve as a guide to help clinicians discuss with their patients as part of the shared and multidisciplinary decision-making for improved APC management in India.

OBJECTIVES: We examine outcomes in critically ill individuals with COVID-19 who develop atrial tachyarrhythmias. METHODS: We collected data from electrocardiograms and the electronic medical record of COVID-19 positive (COVID+ ) and negative (COVID- ) individuals admitted to our medical intensive care unit between February 29 and June 28, 2020. We compared clinical and demographic characteristics, new onset atrial tachyarrhythmia, hemodynamic compromise following atrial tachyarrhythmia, and in-hospital mortality in COVID+ versus COVID- . Hemodynamic compromise was defined as having a new or increased vasopressor requirement or the need for direct current cardioversion for hemodynamic instability within 1 hour of atrial tachyarrhythmia onset. RESULTS: Of 300 individuals included, 200 were COVID+ and 100 were COVID- . Mean age was 60  16 years, 180 (60%) were males, and 170 (57%) were African American. New onset atrial tachyarrhythmia occurred in 16% of COVID+ and 19% of COVID- individuals (P = .51). When compared to COVID- participants without atrial tachyarrhythmia, COVID+ individuals with new onset atrial tachyarrhythmia had higher mortality after multivariable adjustment (OR 5.0, 95% CI 1.9-13.5). New onset atrial tachyarrhythmia was followed by hemodynamic compromise in 18 COVID+ but no COVID- participants (P = .0001). COVID+ individuals with hemodynamic compromise after atrial tachyarrhythmia required increased ventilatory support at the time of atrial tachyarrhythmia onset.

We study whether early identified risk factors for COVID-19 persist one year later and through varying disease progression trajectories. MethodsThis was a retrospective study of 6,731 COVID-19 patients presenting to Michigan Medicine between March 10, 2020 and March 10, 2021. We describe disease progression trajectories from diagnosis to potential hospital admission, discharge, readmission, or death. Outcomes pertained to all patients: rate of medical encounters, hospitalization-free survival, and overall survival, and hospitalized patients: discharge versus in-hospital death and readmission. Risk factors included patient age, sex, race, body mass index, and 29 comorbidity conditions. ResultsYounger, non-Black patients utilized healthcare resources at higher rates, while older, male, and Black patients had higher rates of hospitalization and mortality. Diabetes with complications, coagulopathy, fluid and electrolyte disorders, and blood loss anemia were risk factors for these outcomes. Diabetes with complications, coagulopathy, fluid and electrolyte disorders, and blood loss were associated with lower discharge and higher inpatient mortality rates. ConclusionsThis study found differences in healthcare utilization and adverse COVID-19 outcomes, as well as differing risk factors for short- and long-term outcomes throughout disease progression. These findings may inform providers in emergency departments or critical care settings of treatment priorities, empower healthcare stakeholders with effective disease management strategies, and aid health policy makers in optimizing allocations of medical resources.","output":"Comprehensive Evaluation of COVID-19 Patient Short- and Long-term Outcomes: Disparities in Healthcare Utilization and Post-Hospitalization Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Actively thinking of one's future as an older individual could increase perceived risk and risk aversion. This could be particularly relevant for COVID-19, if we consider the common representation of the risk of being infected by COVID-19 as associated with being older. Increased perceived risk could bear consequences on the adoption of preventive behaviours. Thus, we investigated whether increasing the salience of individuals' future as an older adult would impact on their perceived risk for COVID-19 and medical conditions varying for age-relatedness. One hundred and forty-four Italian adults (Mage = 27.72, range: 18-56) were randomly assigned to either a future as older adult thinking or control condition. Perceived risk for COVID-19 and other strongly, and weakly age-related medical conditions during the lifetime was measured. Results showed that thinking about the future as an older adult increased perceived risk for strongly and weakly age-related diseases, but not for COVID-19. The salience of the COVID-19 outbreak may have raised the perceived risks in both experimental conditions, making the manipulation ineffective. In conclusion, manipulating future-oriented thinking might be a successful communication strategy to increase people's perceived risk of common diseases, but it might not work for highly salient pathologies such as COVID-19.","output":"Thinking of future as an older individual increases perceived risks for age-related diseases but not for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To review the psychological Effect of COVID-19 on medical health-care workers.

This has wreaked havoc on the global economy, put additional burden on local and global public health resources, and, most importantly, jeopardised human health. CRISPR stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, and the CRISPR associated (Cas) protein (CRISPR/Cas) was identified to have structures in E. coli. The most modern of these systems is CRISPR/Cas. Editing the genomes of plants and animals took several years and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars until the CRISPR approach was discovered in 2012. As a result, CRISPR/Cas has piqued the scientific community's attention, particularly for disease diagnosis and treatment, because it is faster, less expensive, and more precise than previous genome editing technologies. Data from gene mutations in specific patients gathered using CRISPR/Cas can aid in the identification of the best treatment strategy for each patient, as well as other research domains such as coronavirus replication in cell culture, such as SARS-CoV2. The implications of the most prevalent driver mutations, on the other hand, are often unknown, making treatment interpretation difficult. For detecting a wide range of target genes, the CRISPR/Cas categories provide highly sensitive and selective tools. Genome-wide association studies are a relatively new strategy to discovering genes involved in human disease when it comes to the next steps in genomic research. Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas provides a method for modifying non-coding portions of the genome, which will help advance whole genome libraries by speeding up the analysis of these poorly defined parts of the genome.","output":"A review of COVID-19: Treatment Strategies and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology approaches to the coronavirus disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to identify the effects of daily life changes due to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on the depressive symptoms among community\\\\dwelling older adults.

METHODS: The COVID-19 Imaging Registry Study Aachen (COVID-19-Bildgebungs-Register Aachen, COBRA) collects data on imaging in patients with COVID-19. Two of the COBRA partner hospitals (RWTH Aachen University Hospital and Dueren Hospital) systematically perform reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal swabs as well as LDCT in all patients presenting with manifestations that are compatible with COVID-19. In accordance with the COV-RADS protocol, the LDCT scans were prospectively evaluated before the RT-PCR findings were available in order to categorize the likelihood of COVID-19. RESULTS: From 18 March to 5 May 2020, 191 patients with COVID-19 manifestations (117 male, age 65  16 years) underwent RT-PCR testing and LDCT. The mean time from the submission of the sample to the availability of the RT-PCR findings was 491 minutes (interquartile range [IQR: 276-1066]), while that from the performance of the CT to the availability of its findings was 9 minutes (IQR: 6-11). A diagnosis of COVID-19 was made in 75/191 patients (39%). The LDCT was positive in 71 of these 75 patients and negative in 106 of the 116 patients without COVID-19, corresponding to 94.7% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [86.9; 98.5]), 91.4% specificity [84.7; 95.8], positive and negative predictive values of 87.7% [78.5; 93.9] and 96.4% [91.1; 98.6], respectively, and an AUC (area under the curve) of 0.959 [0.930; 0.988]. The initial RT-PCR test results were falsely negative in six patients, yielding a sensitivity of 92.0% [83.4; 97.0]; these six patients had positive LDCT findings. 47.4% of the LDCTs that were negative for COVID-19 (55/116) exhibited pathological pulmonary changes, including infiltrates, that were correctly distinguished from SARS-CoV-2 related changes. CONCLUSION: In patients with symptoms compatible with COVID-19, LDCT can esablish the diagnosis of COVID-19 with comparable sensitivity to RT-PCR testing. In addition, it offers a high specificity for distinguishing COVID-19 from other diseases associated with the same or similar clinical symptoms. We propose the systematic use of LDCT in addition to RT-PCR testing because it helps correct false-negative RT-PCR results, because its results are available much faster than those of RT-PCRtesting, and because it provides additional diagnostic information useful for treatment planning regardless of the type of the infectious agent.","output":"Low-Dose Chest CT for the Diagnosis of COVID-19-A Systematic, Prospective Comparison With PCR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corona viruses are a group of RNA viruses that cause infection in humans and animals.

Critically ill COVID-19 patients, but not those with mild symptoms, had high levels of afucosylated IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, amplifying pro-inflammatory cytokine release and acute phase responses. Thus, antibody glycosylation plays a critical role in immune responses to enveloped viruses, including COVID-19.","output":"Afucosylated IgG characterizes enveloped viral responses and correlates with COVID-19 severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory diseases place an immense burden on global health and there is a compelling need for the discovery of new compounds for therapeutic development. Here, we identify research priorities by critically reviewing pre-clinical and clinical studies using extracts and compounds derived from molluscs, as well as traditional molluscan medicines, used in the treatment of respiratory diseases. We reviewed 97 biomedical articles demonstrating the anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anticancer, and immunomodulatory properties of >320 molluscan extracts/compounds with direct relevance to respiratory disease, in addition to others with promising bioactivities yet to be tested in the respiratory context. Of pertinent interest are compounds demonstrating biofilm inhibition/disruption and antiviral activity, as well as synergism with approved antimicrobial and chemotherapeutic agents. At least 100 traditional medicines, incorporating over 300 different mollusc species, have been used to treat respiratory-related illness in cultures worldwide for thousands of years. These medicines provide useful clues for the discovery of bioactive components that likely underpin their continued use. There is particular incentive for investigations into anti-inflammatory compounds, given the extensive application of molluscan traditional medicines for symptoms of inflammation, and shells, which are the principal molluscan product used in these preparations. Overall, there is a need to target research toward specific respiratory disease-related hypotheses, purify bioactive compounds and elucidate their chemical structures, and develop an evidence base for the integration of quality-controlled traditional medicines.","output":"Molluscan Compounds Provide Drug Leads for the Treatment and Prevention of Respiratory Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent studies have demonstrated the existence of a discrete pool of cholesterol in the plasma membranes (PM) of mammalian cells--referred to as the accessible cholesterol pool-that can be detected by the binding of modified versions of bacterial cytolysins (e.g, anthrolysin O). When the amount of accessible cholesterol in the PM exceeds a threshold level, the excess cholesterol moves to the ER where it regulates the SREBP2 pathway and undergoes esterification. We reported previously that the Aster/Gramd1 family of sterol transporters mediates nonvesicular movement of cholesterol from the PM to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in multiple mammalian cell types. Here, we investigated the PM pool of accessible cholesterol in cholesterol-loaded fibroblasts with a knockdown of Aster-A and in mouse macrophages from Aster-B and Aster-A/B-deficient mice. Nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) analyses revealed an expansion of the accessible cholesterol pool in cells lacking Aster expression. The increased accessible cholesterol pool in the PM was accompanied by reduced cholesterol to the ER, evident by increased expression of SREBP2-regulated genes. Co-sedimentation experiments with liposomes revealed that the Aster-B GRAM domain binds to membranes in a cholesterol concentration-dependent manner and that the binding is facilitated by the presence of phosphatidylserine. These studies reveal that the Aster-mediated nonvesicular cholesterol transport pathway controls levels of accessible cholesterol in the PM as well as the activity of the SREBP pathway.","output":"Aster proteins regulate the accessible cholesterol pool in the plasma membrane."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to evaluate systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) disease activity and SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses after BNT162b2 vaccination. METHODS: In this prospective study, disease activity and clinical assessments were recorded from the first dose of vaccine until day 15 after the second dose in 126 patients with SLE. SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses were measured against wild-type spike antigen, while serum-neutralising activity was assessed against the SARS-CoV-2 historical strain and variants of concerns (VOCs). Vaccine-specific T cell responses were quantified by interferon- release assay after the second dose. RESULTS: BNT162b2 was well tolerated and no statistically significant variations of BILAG (British Isles Lupus Assessment Group) and SLEDAI (SLE Disease Activity Index) scores were observed throughout the study in patients with SLE with active and inactive disease at baseline. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and methotrexate (MTX) treatments were associated with drastically reduced BNT162b2 antibody response (=?78, p=0.007; =?122, p<0.001, respectively).

However, lighting at night can have adverse effects on insects or ecosystems, which are not yet considered in planning. Here, we introduce a comprehensive approach for the design and implementation of a novel insect-friendly road luminaire. The lighting design provides an optimized radiation geometry that avoids emissions at the trajectory height of insects, reduces the attraction of insects and the fragmentation of their habitats, and at the same time provides adequate night-time illumination in residential areas. The effects of the new design on insect behavior and night sky brightness will be evaluated two years before and two years after the change of the road luminaires and additionally in a direct comparison, as some luminaires of the old design will remain as controls. Citizen scientists are involved in the identification of insects and the measurement of night sky brightness. A broad public engagement program also highlights discussions about the competing interests of different stakeholders in lighting design, explicitly including the effects of illumination on insect fauna and biodiversity. ABSTRACT: (1) The project Tatort Streetlight implements an insect-friendly road light design in a four year beforeCafter, controlCimpact (BACI) approach involving citizen scientists. It will broaden the stakeholder interests from solely anthropogenic perspectives to include the welfare of insects and ecosystems. Motivated by the detrimental impacts of road lighting systems on insects, the project aims to find solutions to reduce the insect attraction and habitat fragmentation resulting from roadway illumination. (2) The citizen science approach invites stakeholders to take part and join forces for the development of a sustainable and environmentally friendly road lighting solution. Here, we describe the project strategy, stakeholder participation and motivation, and how the effects of the alternative road luminaire and lighting design can be evaluated. (3) The study compares the changes in (a) insect behavior, (b) night sky brightness, and (c) stakeholder participation and awareness. For this purpose, different experimental areas and stakeholders in four communities in Germany are identified. (4) The project transfers knowledge of adverse effects of improperly managed road illumination and interacts with various stakeholders to develop a new road lighting system that will consider the well-being of street users, local residents, and insects.","output":"Towards Insect-Friendly Road LightingA Transdisciplinary Multi-Stakeholder Approach Involving Citizen Scientists"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of highly pathogenic strains of influenza virus and coronavirus (CoV) has been responsible for large epidemic and pandemic outbreaks characterised by severe pulmonary illness associated with high morbidity and mortality. One major challenge for critical care is to stratify and minimise the risk of multi-organ failure during the stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). Epigenetic-sensitive mechanisms, including deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs may lead to perturbations of the host immune-related transcriptional programmes by regulating chromatin structure and gene expression patterns. Viruses causing severe pulmonary illness can use epigenetic-regulated mechanisms during host-pathogen interaction to interfere with innate and adaptive immunity, adequacy of inflammatory response, and overall outcome of viral infections. For example, Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV and H5N1 can affect host antigen presentation through DNA methylation and histone modifications. The same mechanisms would presumably occur in patients with coronavirus disease 2019, in which tocilizumab may epigenetically reduce microvascular damage. Targeting epigenetic pathways by immune modulators (e.g. tocilizumab) or repurposed drugs (e.g. statins) may provide novel therapeutic opportunities to control viral-host interaction during critical illness.

RESULTS 1109 dentists replied. To assess concerns and psychological responses the sample was divided into two groups based on the number of cases registered in their work area. In the first group were included all the responders working in the Italian regions that had more than 15,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 as of April 29, 2020. The second group included responders working in the Italian regions that had less than 15,000 confirmed cases.

The structures of the borates are described in terms of cation-centered and oxocentred polyhedra. There are different sequences of double chains and layers consisting of oxocentred [OM4]n+ tetrahedra and [OM5]n+ tetragonal pyramids forming a framework. Elemental composition was determined by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Oxidation states and coordination sites of iron and tin in the oxoborates are determined using M?ssbauer spectroscopy and compared with EDX and X-ray diffraction data (XRD). According to results obtained from high-temperature M?ssbauer spectroscopy, the Fe2+ to Fe3+ oxidation in vonsenite and hulsite occurs at approximately 500 and 600a? K, respectively. According to the high-temperature XRD data, this process is accompanied by an assumed deformation of crystal structures and subsequent solid-phase decomposition to hematite and warwickite. It is seen as a monotonic decrease of volume thermal expansion coefficients with an increase in temperature. A partial magnetic ordering in hulsite is observed for the first time with Tc &#8771; 383a? K. Near this temperature, an unusual change of thermal expansion coefficients is revealed.

Studies have shown that the prevalence of depression and anxiety have grown among youth over the past year, which has been attributed largely to stress and isolation. Less attention has been paid to how concerns related to being infected with COVID-19, along with guidelines for mask wearing, hand washing, and sanitizing objects, may have led to compulsive washing rituals, which are symptoms present in OCD. It is also critical to identify vulnerability factors, including preexisting anxiety and/or depression. The goal of this study was to examine contamination fears among community adolescents over the first year of the pandemic. Methods: Adolescent participants (aged 14-22 years) were recruited through social media in late March/early April 2020. Consenting participants completed self-reports including the contamination subscale of the Dimensional Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (DOCS), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) every 2 months. Multilevel models, controlling for age and gender, assessed the trajectory of contamination-related fears from April 2020 to April 2021. Results: Participants (N = 332) were 16.5 years old on average, and 88% were female. Only 3 reported having a diagnosis of OCD at baseline. Across the sample, contamination-related fears were highest in April 2020 (M = 12.61;SD = 3.6) and reduced at each follow-up. Participants who reported experiencing significant symptoms of GAD or depression at baseline experienced elevated contamination-related fears at every time point ( = 0.14, p = 0.001 for anxiety;and  = 0.07, p = 0.03 for depression).

This was a revolution that appeared with no preparation and that put on the agenda the efficacy of E-Learning from pedagogical aspects and the implications of the lecturers functions and the act of teaching for the quality of students learning as well as for the meaning of the learning expanse (campushome) in teaching and learning processes. The current study examined the opinions of students and lecturers regarding the advantages and disadvantages of E-Learning from various aspects in a systemic, multi-institutional perspective. The study included 2015 students studying at various academic institutions: universities, academic teachers colleges, academic colleges, and private colleges. The study also included 223 lecturers. The research findings show that the respondents did not display a high preference for E-Learning: less than half the students and about one-third of the lecturers expressed a preference for E-Learning. Both groups noted the lack of personal, social, and emotional interaction with both students and lecturers as one of the main shortcomings of E-Learning. Most of the students and lecturers did not grasp E-Learning as providing them with better quality teaching and learning. The study illuminates the role of the lecturer in the digital era as a teacher, and particularlythe role of the professional elements in charge of teaching and learning at academic institutions, particularly in the pedagogical aspects. According to student evaluations, the use of technological platforms and tools does not improve teaching, as they are used by the faculty only technically with no matching pedagogy. In order to succeed, E-Learning requires other pedagogical educational approaches aside from copying frontal teaching patterns using the Zoom platform, as well as others: Weber, MS Teams, etc. In addition, the study indicates the need for perceptual changes, both by the students, who must take responsibility for their learning, and by the lecturers, who must reexamine the teaching and learning processes and adapt their role and areas of responsibility to the new opportunities afforded by the technological tools. The research findings also indicate that effective teaching is teaching that arouses in students inquisitiveness, motivation, and learning experiences, and note that learning products must be adapted to include essential skills in addition to knowledge. Further, the study illuminates the thorough discussion that must be held by leaders of higher education and of the academic institutions concerning the new effective designation of the campus after the COVID-19 crisis, including distinguishing between the virtual and the realistic in academic teaching and challenges and ways of dealing with the new circumstances. ? 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"E-Learning in Times of Crisis: An Incidental or Facilitative Event?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper highlights the low levels of vaccine coverage and high levels of reported vaccination hesitancy in Yerevan, Armenia, that present profound challenges to the control of disease through routine vaccination programmes.

We analyse primary data from the introduction of Gardasil, first used in Armenia in 2017, to investigate how levels of medical knowledge amongst physicians in 20 health facilities in Yerevan, Armenia, regarding vaccine science influence attitudes towards the introduction of a newly developed vaccine. A questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was completed by 348 physicians between December 2017 and September 2018. The responding physicians displayed a respectable level of knowledge and awareness regarding vaccination with respect to some characteristics (e.g., more than 81% knew that HPV infection was commonly asymptomatic, 73% knew that HPV infection was implicated in most cervical cancers, and 87% knew that cervical cancer is the most prevalent cancer amongst women) but low knowledge and poor understanding of other key issues such as the age at which women were most likely to develop cervical cancer (only 15% answered correctly), whether or not the vaccine should be administered to people who had already been infected (27% answered correctly) and whether sexually active young people should be treated for infection before vaccination (26% answered correctly).

Present study enlists the most common and effective natural products that might be of plant or microbial origin, their mode of action, day-by-day development of phytopathogenic resistance against the prevailing fungicides, and also their role in maintenance of sustainability of agricultural practices with special emphasis on their acceptance over the synthetic or chemical one. A large number of bioactive compounds ranging from direct plant (both cryptogams algae and moss and phanerogams)-derived natural extracts, essential oil of aromatic plants, and low-molecular-weight antimicrobial compounds known as phytoalexins to secondary metabolites that are both volatile and nonvolatile organic compounds of microbes (fungal and actinobacterial members) residing inside the host tissue, called endophyte, are widely used as agricultural bioweapons. The rhizospheric partners of plant, mycorrhizae, are also a prime agent of this chemical warfare and protect their green partners from fungal invaders and emphasize the concept of sustainable agriculture.","output":"Natural Products as Fungicide and Their Role in Crop Protection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examines whether a stay-at-home order with penalties would be an effective measure for regulating public behavior during a pandemic lockdown, through an online experiment conducted in Japan. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, authorities around the world have taken measures to limit civil liberties by means of stay-at-home orders, with penalties for infractions. In contrast, Japan has avoided legal sanctions and sought voluntary cooperation from the public. This self-restraint request might work to deter public activity in Japan, whose society is known for conformity and social order. Nevertheless, the study found that penalties do make a difference in the intention to stay home, especially in places with high infection rates, such as Tokyo.

Portal pressure can also provide accurate prognostication for patients with cirrhosis. However, there are no practical means for assessment of portal pressure. Although it is well-established that gastric mucosal blood supply increases in patients with cirrhosis, this has been difficult to reproducibly quantify. Our group developed a novel spectroscopic technology called spatially resolved subdiffuse reflectance spectroscopy (SRSRS) that enables quantification of mucosal microcirculation. We aim to ascertain if quantification of the gastric mucosal microcirculation with SRSRS correlates with clinical evidence of portal hypertension. METHODS: Patients undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy for clinical indications had 10 measurements taken in the endoscopically normal gastric fundus via SRSRS probe to assess microcirculation. Cases were defined as patients with cirrhosis (n=18) and controls were those without evidence liver disease (n=18); this was corroborated with transient elastography. RESULTS: Blood volume fraction (p = 0.06) and subdiffuse reflectance (p = 0.02) from shallow depth in gastric fundus were higher in patients with cirrhosis than those without. These markers were combined to yield an overall optical marker that can differentiate patients with cirrhosis from controls with a sensitivity of 72% and specificity of 94% (area under receiver operating curve =0.82). CONCLUSIONS: Spectroscopic quantification of gastric fundal mucosal microcirculation is a promising surrogate of clinical correlates of portal hypertension. This approach may represent a less-intrusive surrogate biomarker for liver disease prognostication and potentially response to therapy.","output":"Quantification of gastric mucosal microcirculation as a surrogate marker of portal hypertension by spatially resolved subdiffuse reflectance spectroscopy in diagnosis of cirrhosis: a proof of concept study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aging impairs immunity to promote diseases, especially respiratory viral infections. The current COVID-19 pandemic, resulting from SARS-CoV-2, induces acute pneumonia, a phenotype that is alarmingly increased with aging. In this article, we review findings of how aging alters immunity to respiratory viral infections to identify age-impacted pathways common to several viral pathogens, permitting us to speculate about potential mechanisms of age-enhanced mortality to COVID-19. Aging generally leads to exaggerated innate immunity, particularly in the form of elevated neutrophil accumulation across murine and large animal studies of influenza infection. COVID-19 patients who succumb exhibit a 2-fold increase in neutrophilia, suggesting that exaggerated innate immunity contributes to age-enhanced mortality to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further investigation in relevant experimental models will elucidate the mechanisms by which aging impacts respiratory viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2.

Methods: Here, we evaluated anti-S-RBD IgG levels after vaccination in chronic DOC patients compared with demographically matched healthy controls (HC) by indirect chemiluminescence immunoassay. All individuals completed a two-dose-cycle vaccination with Pfizer mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2), and antibody responses were evaluated at 30 and 180 days after the administration of the second dose of vaccination. Results: We compared 32 DOC patients with 34 demographically matched healthy controls. Both DOC and HC groups showed a similar antibody response at 30 days, whereas at follow-up (180 days) DOC patients were characterized by lower S-RBD IgG levels with respect to controls. Additional multiple regression analyses including demographical and clinical comorbidities as predictors revealed that age was the only factor associated with the decrease in S-RBD IgG levels at follow-up (180 days). Elderly individuals of both groups were characterized by a reduction in the antibody responses with respect to younger individuals.

Although, these operations are also possible with standard laparoscopic instruments, curved instruments are being developed. The aims of the study were to identify the effect of training on a box trainer in single-port setting on the quality of acquired skills, and transferred with the straight and curved instruments for the basic laparoscopic tasks, and highlight the importance of a special laparoscopic training curriculum. DESIGN A prospective study on a box trainer in single-port setting was conducted using 2 groups. Each group performed 2 tasks on the box trainer in single-port setting. Group-S used conventional straight laparoscopic instruments, and Group-C used curved laparoscopic instruments. Learning curves were obtained by daily measurements recorded in 7-day sessions. On the last day, the 2 groups changed instruments between each other. SETTING 1st Department of Surgery, Semmelweis University of Medicine from Budapest, Hungary, a university teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS In all, 20 fifth-year medical students were randomized into 2 groups. None of them had any laparoscopic or endoscopic experience. Participation was voluntary. RESULTS Although Group-S performed all tasks significantly faster than Group-C on the first day, the difference proved to be nonsignificant on the last day. All participants achieved significantly shorter task completion time on the last day than on the first day, regardless of the instrument they used. Group-S showed improvement of 63.5%, and Group-C 69.0% improvement by the end of the session. After swapping the instruments, Group-S reached significantly higher task completion time with curved instruments, whereas Group-C showed further progression of 8.9% with straight instruments. CONCLUSIONS Training with curved instruments in a single-port setting allows for a better acquisition of skills in a shorter period. For this reason, there is a need for proficiency-based conventional, but also for a single-port, laparoscopic training curriculum in general surgery residency education.","output":"Training With Curved Laparoscopic Instruments in Single-Port Setting Improves Performance Using Straight Instruments: A Prospective Randomized Simulation Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impact of COVID-19 on air transport is unprecedented and some well-known airline brands may disappear as a result.

We use dynamic social simulations seeded with vaccine survey data, to show how this effect results in a drift towards anti-vaccine opinions. Linking this analysis to data from two other multi-country datasets, we found that countries in which the pro-vaccine people are less associated to the neutrals (and so less able to influence them) exhibit lower vaccination rates and stronger increase in distrust.

METHODS: Between July 1 and August 31, 2020, consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were analyzed. Among these patients, those who underwent chest computed tomography (CT) examination at the time of presentation, patients with follow-up CT due to clinical deterioration were included in the study. The CTs of the patients were evaluated in terms of spleen size and volume. RESULTS: A total of 160 patients (88 females, 55%) were included in the study. The mean time between the initial and follow-up CT was 7.2  2.8 days. The splenic volume (244.3  136.7 vs. 303.5  156.3 cm(3)) and splenic index (421.2  235.5 vs. 523.2  269.4 cm(3)) values were significantly higher in the follow-up CT compared to the initial CT (p < 0.001).

The objective was to compare TEM using a disposable material vs a standard platform through a case-matched study. METHODS Patients who underwent TEM for rectal neoplasms were identified from prospective databases in two tertiary referral centers and matched according to four criteria (sex, tumor location, size, distance from the anal verge): TEM using a disposable material (GelPoint Applied?; group A) and TEM using a standard TEO? platform (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany; group B). RESULTS A total of 74 patients were included and divided into group A (n = 33) and group B (n = 41). Full-thickness resection was less frequent in group A (85%) than B (100%; p = 0.01). Adenocarcinoma was less frequent in group A than B: 27 vs 42% (p = 0.03). No difference was noted regarding median operative time (53 vs 53 min; p = 0.6) and a peritoneal perforation rate (6 vs 20%; p = 0.17). Median length of stay was shorter in group A than B (4 vs 5 days; p < 0.008).

METHODS: We recruited 2,303 participants aged 18 years or above with employment/full\\\\time jobs before the national lockdown in AprilCMay 2020. The measures of economic burden were job loss, income loss, and financial problems related to the outbreak. The outcomes included depressive symptoms, anxiety, and perceived stress.

CR1-related protein/gene Y (Crry) lies 10 kb from Cr2 and encodes a ubiquitously expressed complement regulatory protein that could also play a role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus. Crry derived from B6.Sle1c congenic mice migrated at a higher m.w. by SDS-PAGE compared with B6 Crry, as a result of differential glycosylation. A single-nucleotide polymorphism in the first short consensus repeat of Sle1c Crry introduced a novel N-linked glycosylation site likely responsible for this structural alteration. Five additional single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the signal peptide and short consensus repeat 1 of Sle1c Crry were identified. However, the cellular expression of B6 and B6.Sle1c Crry and their ability to regulate the classical pathway of complement were not significantly different. Although soluble Sle1c Crry regulated the alternative pathway of complement more efficiently than B6 Crry, as a membrane protein, it regulated the alternative pathway equivalently to B6 Crry.

Of these, the locked conformation was not previously observed for SARS-CoV-1 S and its function remains poorly understood. Here we engineered a SARS-CoV-2 S protein construct S-R/x3 to arrest SARS-CoV-2 spikes in the locked conformation by a disulfide bond. Using this construct we determined high-resolution structures revealing two distinct locked states, with or without the D614G substitution that has become fixed in the globally circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains. The D614G mutation induces a structural change in domain D from locked-1 to locked-2 conformation to alter spike dynamics, promoting transition into the closed conformation from which opening of the receptor binding domain is permitted. The transition from locked to closed conformations is additionally promoted by a change from low to neutral pH. We propose that the locked conformations of S are present in the acidic cellular compartments where virus is assembled and egresses. In this model, release of the virion into the neutral pH extracellular space would favour transition to the closed form which itself can stochastically transition into the open form. The S-R/x3 construct provides a tool for the further structural and functional characterization of the locked conformations of S, as well as how sequence changes might alter S assembly and regulation of receptor binding domain dynamics.","output":"Structures and function of locked conformations of SARS-CoV-2 spike"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Persisting evidence suggests significant socioeconomic and sociodemographic inequalities in access to medical treatment in the UK.

METHODS: In this multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 304 hospitalised patients with Covid-19 pneumonia were randomised to receive 1 g of methylprednisolone intravenously for 3 consecutive days or placebo in addition to standard dexamethasone. The primary outcome was the duration of the patient hospitalisation, calculated as the time interval between randomisation and hospital discharge without the need of supplementary oxygen. The key secondary outcomes were survival free from invasive ventilation with orotracheal intubation and overall survival. RESULTS: Overall, 112 of 151 (75.4%) patients in the pulse methylprednisolone arm and 111 of 150 (75.2%) in the placebo arm were discharged from hospital without oxygen within 30 days from randomisation. Median time to discharge was similar in both groups [15 days (95% confidence interval (CI), 13.0 to 17.0) and 16 days (95%CI, 13.8 to 18.2); hazard ratio (HR), 0.92; 95% CI 0.71C1.20; p=0.528].

PspC epitope mapping revealed individuals lacked antibodies against the FH binding region. We propose that FH binding to PspC in vivo masks this binding site, enabling FH to facilitate pneumococcal/epithelial attachment during viral infection despite the presence of anti-PspC antibodies.

The use of technology and electronic tools such as smartphone apps and websites has been suggested as a way of improving the engagement of users in meaningful goal setting and facilitating shared decision-making between patients and health professionals. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe experiences of health professionals and patients in the use of the English language version of the iPad app Aid for Decision-making in Occupational Choice (ADOC) to facilitate collaborative goal setting in rehabilitation. METHODS: We recruited participants from 3 acute and postacute care rehabilitation wards in both public and private organizations in New Zealand. Participants were registered allied health professionals, including physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and speech-language therapists, who engage in goal setting as part of their normal work, and their adult patients. We collected data via semistructured interviews to gather information about the experiences of the participants in the use of ADOC for goal setting. Data were analyzed with thematic analysis. RESULTS: A total of 8 health professionals and 8 patients participated in the study. Six main themes emerged from the data: changing patients perspective on what is possible, changing health professionals perspective on what is important, facilitating shared decision-making, lack of guides for users, logistic and organizational barriers, and app-related and technical issues. CONCLUSIONS: Health professionals and patients found ADOC to be a valuable tool when setting shared rehabilitation goals. The use of ADOC promoted a patient-centered approach that empowered patients to engage in collaborative goal setting. The technological limitations of the app that negatively impacted experiences can be addressed in the future implementation of ADOC in rehabilitation settings.","output":"Use of an iPad App (Aid for Decision-making in Occupational Choice) for Collaborative Goal Setting in Interprofessional Rehabilitation: Qualitative Descriptive Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Design:This briefing is prepared by an independent writer who adds their own impartial comments and places the articles in context.Purpose:This paper aims to review the latest management developments across the globe and pinpoint practical implications from cutting-edge research and case studies.Findings:Crises are rare, but are certain to happen at some point in the lifecycle of most organizations.

Our goal in this preliminary study was to explore if we could detect swine pathogens using a non-invasive, indirect approach through the study of swine slurry. From April to November 2018, 105 swine slurry samples were collected by farm personnel from waste pits at two sites on a swine farm in North Carolina. These samples were tested for DNA and RNA viruses using a real-time PCR and RT-PCR. Statistical analyses were performed to measure association between virus positive outcomes and potential predictors such as date of sample collection, weight of pigs, number of pigs in barn, temperature, and weather conditions. Overall, 86% of the samples had evidence of at least one of the targeted viruses. Ultimately, this study demonstrated the utility of conducting noninvasive surveillance for swine pathogens through the study of swine slurry. Such swine slurry surveillance may supplant the need to handle, restrain, and collect specimens directly from pigs thus providing an approach to emerging pathogen detection that appeals to the swine industry.","output":"A feasibility study of conducting surveillance for swine pathogens in slurry from North Carolina swine farms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Federated learning (FL) has received high interest from researchers and practitioners to train machine learning (ML) models for healthcare. Ensuring the trustworthiness of these models is essential. Especially bias, defined as a disparity in the model's predictive performance across different subgroups, may cause unfairness against specific subgroups, which is an undesired phenomenon for trustworthy ML models. In this research, we address the question to which extent bias occurs in medical FL and how to prevent excessive bias through reward systems. We first evaluate how to measure the contributions of institutions toward predictive performance and bias in cross-silo medical FL with a Shapley value approximation method. In a second step, we design different reward systems incentivizing contributions toward high predictive performance or low bias. We then propose a combined reward system that incentivizes contributions toward both. We evaluate our work using multiple medical chest X-ray datasets focusing on patient subgroups defined by patient sex and age. Our results show that we can successfully measure contributions toward bias, and an integrated reward system successfully incentivizes contributions toward a well-performing model with low bias. While the partitioning of scans only slightly influences the overall bias, institutions with data predominantly from one subgroup introduce a favorable bias for this subgroup. Our results indicate that reward systems, which focus on predictive performance only, can transfer model bias against patients to an institutional level.

Two deficient cell lines, hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase (HGPRT) deficient anti-AFB1 hybridoma cell line and thymidine kinase (TK) deficient anti-OTA hybridoma cell line, were fused to generate a hybrid-hybridoma producing BsMAb against AFB1 and OTA. The subtype of the BsMAb was IgG1 via mouse antibody isotyping kit test. The purity and molecular weight of BsMAb were confirmed by SDS-PAGE method. The cross-reaction rate with AFB2 was 37%, with AFG1 15%, with AFM1 48%, with AFM2 10%, and with OTB 36%. Negligible cross-reaction was observed with other tested compounds. The affinity constant (Ka) was determined by ELISA. The Ka (AFB1) and Ka (OTA) was 2.43  108 L/mol and 1.57  108 L/mol, respectively. Then the anti-AFB1/OTA BsMAb was coupled with CNBr-Sepharose, and an AFB1/OTA IAC was prepared. The coupling time and elution conditions of IAC were optimized.

This new edition is an update of the review. OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of thoracic imaging in people with suspected COVID\\\\19; assess the rate of positive imaging in people who had an initial reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT\\\\PCR) negative result and a positive RT\\\\PCR result on follow\\\\up; and evaluate the accuracy of thoracic imaging for screening COVID\\\\19 in asymptomatic individuals. The secondary objective was to assess threshold effects of index test positivity on accuracy. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the COVID\\\\19 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern, the Cochrane COVID\\\\19 Study Register, The Stephen B. Thacker CDC Library, and repositories of COVID\\\\19 publications through to 17 February 2021. We did not apply any language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included diagnostic accuracy studies of all designs, except for case\\\\control, that recruited participants of any age group suspected to have COVID\\\\19. Studies had to assess chest CT, chest X\\\\ray, or ultrasound of the lungs for the diagnosis of COVID\\\\19, use a reference standard that included RT\\\\PCR, and report estimates of test accuracy or provide data from which we could compute estimates. We excluded studies that used imaging as part of the reference standard and studies that excluded participants with normal index test results. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The review authors independently and in duplicate screened articles, extracted data and assessed risk of bias and applicability concerns using QUADAS\\\\2. We presented sensitivity and specificity per study on paired forest plots, and summarized pooled estimates in tables. We used a bivariate meta\\\\analysis model where appropriate. MAIN RESULTS: We included 98 studies in this review. Of these, 94 were included for evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of thoracic imaging in the evaluation of people with suspected COVID\\\\19. Eight studies were included for assessing the rate of positive imaging in individuals with initial RT\\\\PCR negative results and positive RT\\\\PCR results on follow\\\\up, and 10 studies were included for evaluating the accuracy of thoracic imaging for imagining asymptomatic individuals. For all 98 included studies, risk of bias was high or unclear in 52 (53%) studies with respect to participant selection, in 64 (65%) studies with respect to reference standard, in 46 (47%) studies with respect to index test, and in 48 (49%) studies with respect to flow and timing. Concerns about the applicability of the evidence to: participants were high or unclear in eight (8%) studies; index test were high or unclear in seven (7%) studies; and reference standard were high or unclear in seven (7%) studies. Imaging in people with suspected COVID\\\\19 We included 94 studies. Eighty\\\\seven studies evaluated one imaging modality, and seven studies evaluated two imaging modalities. All studies used RT\\\\PCR alone or in combination with other criteria (for example, clinical signs and symptoms, positive contacts) as the reference standard for the diagnosis of COVID\\\\19. For chest CT (69 studies, 28285 participants, 14,342 (51%) cases), sensitivities ranged from 45% to 100%, and specificities from 10% to 99%. The pooled sensitivity of chest CT was 86.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) 83.6 to 89.6), and pooled specificity was 78.3% (95% CI 73.7 to 82.3). Definition for index test positivity was a source of heterogeneity for sensitivity, but not specificity. Reference standard was not a source of heterogeneity. For chest X\\\\ray (17 studies, 8529 participants, 5303 (62%) cases), the sensitivity ranged from 44% to 94% and specificity from 24 to 93%. The pooled sensitivity of chest X\\\\ray was 73.1% (95% CI 64. to \\\\80.5), and pooled specificity was 73.3% (95% CI 61.9 to 82.2). Definition for index test positivity was not found to be a source of heterogeneity. Definition for index test positivity and reference standard were not found to be sources of heterogeneity. For ultrasound of the lungs (15 studies, 2410 participants, 1158 (48%) cases), the sensitivity ranged from 73% to 94% and the specificity ranged from 21% to 98%. The pooled sensitivity of ultrasound was 88.9% (95% CI 84.9 to 92.0), and the pooled specificity was 72.2% (95% CI 58.8 to 82.5). Definition for index test positivity and reference standard were not found to be sources of heterogeneity. Indirect comparisons of modalities evaluated across all 94 studies indicated that chest CT and ultrasound gave higher sensitivity estimates than X\\\\ray (P = 0.0003 and P = 0.001, respectively). Chest CT and ultrasound gave similar sensitivities (P=0.42). All modalities had similar specificities (CT versus X\\\\ray P = 0.36; CT versus ultrasound P = 0.32; X\\\\ray versus ultrasound P = 0.89). Imaging in PCR\\\\negative people who subsequently became positive For rate of positive imaging in individuals with initial RT\\\\PCR negative results, we included 8 studies (7 CT, 1 ultrasound) with a total of 198 participants suspected of having COVID\\\\19, all of whom had a final diagnosis of COVID\\\\19. Most studies (7/8) evaluated CT. Of 177 participants with initially negative RT\\\\PCR who had positive RT\\\\PCR results on follow\\\\up testing, 75.8% (95% CI 45.3 to 92.2) had positive CT findings. Imaging in asymptomatic PCR\\\\positive people For imaging asymptomatic individuals, we included 10 studies (7 CT, 1 X\\\\ray, 2 ultrasound) with a total of 3548 asymptomatic participants, of whom 364 (10%) had a final diagnosis of COVID\\\\19. For chest CT (7 studies, 3134 participants, 315 (10%) cases), the pooled sensitivity was 55.7% (95% CI 35.4 to 74.3) and the pooled specificity was 91.1% (95% CI 82.6 to 95.7). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Chest CT and ultrasound of the lungs are sensitive and moderately specific in diagnosing COVID\\\\19. Chest X\\\\ray is moderately sensitive and moderately specific in diagnosing COVID\\\\19. Thus, chest CT and ultrasound may have more utility for ruling out COVID\\\\19 than for differentiating SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection from other causes of respiratory illness. The uncertainty resulting from high or unclear risk of bias and the heterogeneity of included studies limit our ability to confidently draw conclusions based on our results.","output":"Thoracic imaging tests for the diagnosis of COVID\\\\19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 3-to-5 exoribonuclease in coronavirus (CoV) nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) mediates RNA proofreading during genome replication. ExoN catalytic residues are arranged in three motifs: I (DE), II (E), and III (D). Alanine replacement of the motif I residues (AA-E-D; four nucleotide substitutions) in murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV yields viable mutants with impaired replication and fitness, increased mutation rates, and attenuated virulence in vivo. Despite these impairments, MHV- and SARS-CoV ExoN motif I AA mutants (ExoN-AA) have not reverted at motif I in diverse in vitro and in vivo environments, suggesting that profound fitness barriers prevent motif I reversion. To test this hypothesis, we engineered MHV-ExoN-AA with 1, 2, or 3 nucleotide mutations along genetic pathways to AA-to-DE reversion. We show that engineered intermediate revertants were viable but had no increased replication or competitive fitness compared to that of MHV-ExoN-AA. In contrast, a low-passage-number (passage 10 [P10]) MHV-ExoN-AA showed increased replication and competitive fitness without reversion of ExoN-AA. Finally, engineered reversion of ExoN-AA to ExoN-DE in the presence of ExoN-AA passage-adaptive mutations resulted in significant fitness loss. These results demonstrate that while reversion is possible, at least one alternative adaptive pathway is more rapidly advantageous than intermediate revertants and may alter the genetic background to render reversion detrimental to fitness. Our results provide an evolutionary rationale for lack of ExoN-AA reversion, illuminate potential multiprotein replicase interactions and coevolution, and support future studies aimed at stabilizing attenuated CoV ExoN-AA mutants. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses encode an exoribonuclease (ExoN) that is important for viral replication, fitness, and virulence, yet coronaviruses with a defective ExoN (ExoN-AA) have not reverted under diverse experimental conditions. In this study, we identify multiple impediments to MHV-ExoN-AA reversion. We show that ExoN-AA reversion is possible but evolutionarily unfavorable. Instead, compensatory mutations outside ExoN-AA motif I are more accessible and beneficial than partial reversion. We also show that coevolution between replicase proteins over long-term passage partially compensates for ExoN-AA motif I but renders the virus inhospitable to a reverted ExoN. Our results reveal the evolutionary basis for the genetic stability of ExoN-inactivating mutations, illuminate complex functional and evolutionary relationships between coronavirus replicase proteins, and identify potential mechanisms for stabilization of ExoN-AA coronavirus mutants.","output":"Fitness Barriers Limit Reversion of a Proofreading-Deficient Coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths in the first six months of 2020 It also exposed and led to increases in the inequalities that exist worldwide This paper draws attention to the prejudices and biases toward three vulnerable social groupswomen, the elderly and Asian ethnic minorities during the crisis It shows that while women held up more than half of the sky both inside and outside the house, they struggled against rising domestic violence and various forms of sexism The elderly, the most at risk of infection, are being abandoned, abused or obliged to sacrifice themselves to the capitalist market economy Ethnic minorities, especially Asian/Chinese immigrants in western countries have been subjected to racial stereotypes in their everyday life Although the coronavirus will disappear, the shadow of the pandemic will undoubtedly remain unless we rebuild solidarity and work together to reflect, reconcile and redress the inequalities entrenched in our societies ? 2021 by the author(s)","output":"Struggle with multiple pandemics: Women, the elderly and asian ethnic minorities during the covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: The bacterium Campylobacter is a significant cause of foodborne illness, causing over one million cases per year in the United States. Campylobacter is naturally found in chickens and can contaminate chicken products; therefore, strategies to lower Campylobacter presence in chickens are important to public health. Commercial chickens are raised in houses with bedding material, or litter, covering the floor. Litter can become contaminated with Campylobacter, which in turn will then colonize the birds. In some countries, after a flock of chickens is harvested, the litter is treated and reused for the next flock, which could spread Campylobacter. The goal of this study was to observe if reusing contaminated litter could indeed spread Campylobacter and to determine if common litter treatments were able to prevent contamination of the next flock. To determine this, previously used litter contaminated with Campylobacter was composted and treated with sodium bisulfate. A flock was raised on this litter and tested for Campylobacter for 42 days. No Campylobacter was detected in any of these samples, indicating that re-used litter is not a probable source for Campylobacter contamination of chickens. ABSTRACT: Campylobacter is an important foodborne pathogen and is naturally found in chickens. During broiler production, litter can become contaminated with Campylobacter when birds defecate, and this litter, in some countries, is typically reused for the next flock, potentially causing cross-contamination. The goal of this experiment was to observe if reusing contaminated litter could spread Campylobacter between flocks and to observe if common litter treatments could prevent this cross-contamination. To determine this, a flock of birds was inoculated with Campylobacter jejuni and allowed to naturally contaminate the litter for 42 days. After grow-out, birds were terminated, and litter was given five treatments: uninoculated fresh litter, untreated re-used litter, composted re-used litter, re-used litter treated with sodium bisulfate (45 kg/305 m(2)), and re-used litter composted and treated with sodium bisulfate (45 kg/305 m(2)). A second flock was placed on the litter, grown for 42 days, and tested for C. jejuni prevalence. Following inoculation of the first flock, high prevalence of C. jejuni was observed; however, after a 19-day down-time between flocks, no C. jejuni was detected in any samples from the second flock. These results indicate that re-used litter was not a significant reservoir for cross-contamination of broilers when provided a significant down-time between flocks.","output":"Effects of Common Litter Management Practices on the Prevalence of Campylobacter jejuni in Broilers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance Aside from supportive management, there remains no specific treatment for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Objective: Determine whether ozonated autohemotherapy is associated with a shorter time to clinical improvement in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Design: Single-center proof-of-concept prospective cohort study. Setting: Internal Medicine ward at Policlinica Ibiza Hospital, Spain. Participants: Eighteen consecutive patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infection and severe pneumonia who were admitted to hospital between 20th March and 19th April 2020. Exposures: Patients in the ozonated autohemotherapy arm received hemotherapy twice daily starting on the day of admission for a median of 4 days. Each treatment involved administration of 200 mL autologous whole blood enriched with 200 mL of oxygen-ozone mixture with a 40 g/mL ozone concentration. Patients in the control arm received supportive care. Assignment to hemotherapy versus usual care was determined based on the admitting physician on the day of admission, with only one of the three possible physicians prescribing ozonated autohemotherapy Main Outcomes: The primary outcome was time from hospital admission to clinical improvement, which was defined as either hospital discharge or a two-point improvement in clinical status measured on a six-point ordinal scale. Secondary outcomes were clinical improvement measured on the 7th, 14th and 28th day after admission, as well as time to a 2-fold reduction in concentrations of C-protein reactive, ferritin, D-dimer and lactate dehydrogenase. Results: The mean age of the cohort was 68 y and 72% (n=13) were male. Nine patients (50%) received ozonated autohemotherapy beginning on the day of admission. In unadjusted comparisons, ozonated autohemotherapy was associated with significantly shorter time to clinical improvement (median [IQR]), 7 days [6-10] vs 28 days [8-31], p=0.04) and significantly higher proportion of patients achieving 14-day clinical improvement (88.8% vs 33.3%, p=0.01). In risk-adjusted analyses, ozonated autohemotherapy was associated with a shorter mean time to clinical improvement (-11.3 days, p=0.04, 95% CI -22.25 to -0.42). Conclusions and Relevance: Ozonated autohemotherapy was associated with a significantly shorter time to clinical improvement in this prospective cohort study.

For surgeries that do get carried through, new difficulties arise in protecting surgical personnel from contracting SARS-CoV-2.

We found that 91.4% of anesthesiologists monitored invasive arterial pressure, 82.9% monitored central venous pressure (CVP), 13.3% monitored cardiac output (CO), 10.5% monitored mixed venous saturation, and less than 2% monitored pulse pressure variation (PPV) or systolic pressure variation (SPV) during high-risk surgery. The majority (88%) of anesthesiologists relied on clinical experience as an indicator for volume expansion and more than 80% relied on blood pressure, CVP and urine output. Anesthesiologists in China do not own enough attention on hemodynamic parameters such as PPV, SPV and CO during fluid management in high-risk surgical patients. The lack of CO monitoring may be attributed largely to the limited access to technologies, the cost of the devices and the lack of education on how to use them. There is a need for improving access to these technologies as well as an opportunity to create guidelines and education for hemodynamic optimization in China.","output":"Hemodynamic monitoring and management of patients undergoing high-risk surgery: a survey among Chinese anesthesiologists."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a new scientific document similarity model based on matching fine-grained aspects of texts. To train our model, we exploit a naturally-occurring source of supervision: sentences in the full-text of papers that cite multiple papers together (co-citations). Such co-citations not only reflect close paper relatedness, but also provide textual descriptions of how the co-cited papers are related. This novel form of textual supervision is used for learning to match aspects across papers. We develop multi-vector representations where vectors correspond to sentence-level aspects of documents, and present two methods for aspect matching: (1) A fast method that only matches single aspects, and (2) a method that makes sparse multiple matches with an Optimal Transport mechanism that computes an Earth Mover's Distance between aspects. Our approach improves performance on document similarity tasks in four datasets. Further, our fast single-match method achieves competitive results, paving the way for applying fine-grained similarity to large scientific corpora.

This study is designed to assess the effect of dexmedetomidine on postoperative delirium (POD) in elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS Sixty geriatric patients with MCI were enrolled and ramdomly divided into two groups by a computer-generated randomisation sequence: dexmedetomidine group (D group) and normal saline group (C group). Patients in D group received a loading dose of 0.5 g/kg dexmedetomidine over 10 minutes before anesthesia induction, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.4 gkg-1h-1 until 30 minutes before the end of surgery; equal volume of normal saline was given in C group. Blood samples were extracted to detect the concentration of cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), interleukin-10 (IL-10), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) before anesthesia induction (T1), before suture (T2), and 30 minutes after surgery (T3). Postoperative recovery times were recorded. Delirium was assessed with the 3-Minute Diagnostic Interview for confusion assessment method during the first 7 days postoperatively. RESULTS POD occurred in 10 (33.3%) of 30 patients in C group, and in 3 (10%) of 30 patients given dexmedetomidine (odds ratio [OR] 0.222, 95% CI 0.054-0.914; P = 0.028). The serum concentrations of TNF-, MMP-9, and GFAP were significantly increased and IL-10 was decreased in the C group than in the D group at T2 and T3. No differences were observed between groups in the level of HO-1. Analysis using random-effect multivariable logistic regression indicated that POD was associated with GFAP (odds ratio [OR] 16.691, 95% CI 2.288-121.746; P = 0.005). The positive predictive ability of the multivariate logistic regression model tested by ROC analysis showed an area under the curve of 0.713 (95% CI, 0.584-0.842).

Several studies since independence have critically analysed the indifferent nature of the education system towards certain groups and sections. Despite a rights-based approach to educational access, the data still shows that some social, religious, economic groups and girls are striving for basic educational access. The silent arrival (without any political dialogue) and approval of NEP have left all to accept the policy as it is, leaving no room for any discourse (New education policy 2020: what is concealed and what is unveiled. The New Leam 20). The most recent data available at the national level (UDISE, 2018-2019) also confirms that irrespective of decades-old commitment to equitable education, the social, gender and economic gaps in the education system still exists. The major objective of this paper is to analyse the shift in policies relating to the educational statuses of disadvantaged sections of society in the Indian post-independent era with a major focus on NEP 2020. Primarily based on analysis of all the major educational policies, this paper tries to develop an argument around the policies and how far it has led to un-democratization of education by reinforcing the exclusion of certain groups from the education system. This has been substantiated by the secondary data, which categorically highlights the gaps which exist in the educational access by different groups. The findings reveal that the policies have played a detrimental role in intensifying the already existing inequalities. Further, the children who access and complete the school education constitute a homogenous group and not all children from diverse group enrol for and complete the education.","output":"Education for social justice: A critique of national education policies of India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is emerging as a global health threat and shows a higher risk for men than women.

For longitudinal analysis, a second sampling was obtained from 22 of the 41 patients after a median time interval of 29 days from first sampling. Compared with controls who had not suffered from COVID-19, the total sperm count, sperm concentration, and percentages of motile and progressively motile spermatozoa in the patients were significantly lower at first sampling, while sperm vitality and morphology were not affected. The total sperm count, sperm concentration, and number of motile spermatozoa per ejaculate were significantly increased and the percentage of morphologically abnormal sperm was reduced at the second sampling compared with those at first in the 22 patients examined. Though there were higher prolactin and lower progesterone levels in patients at first sampling than those in controls, no significant alterations were detected for any sex hormones examined over time following COVID-19 recovery in the 22 patients.

The aim of the study was to determine if trainees value the information they receive through the formats designed to promote their development and, if not, the reasons for this. METHODS The authors searched the ERIC, EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases for articles published up to 16 June 2018 that present original data on trainees' perspectives of the assessment messages they receive in the context of work-based assessments (WBAs) and in-training assessments (ITAs) used within their training programmes. All authors screened 938 abstracts and 139 full-text articles were assessed after this. Descriptions of quantitative data and thematic analysis of qualitative data were used to present the opinions of trainees. RESULTS Thirty-three articles met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-six articles (79%) described trainees' perspectives in the context of WBA and the remaining articles referred to ITA formats. Wide-ranging opinions were reported. The analysis categorised these into three themes: trainees value developmental assessment messages; trainees become disengaged when assessment messages are not developmental, and trainees' views depend on the environment, the assessor and themselves. Some trainees reported that the assessment messages were valuable and provided input on their performance to guide their development, but many disagreed. In particular, the trainee's own level of engagement with the assessments influenced his or her perspectives on the messages received.

We investigate the prevalence of ancestry reporting in current biological research and suggest that increased reporting would be beneficial to the field. METHODS: Articles published over a six-month period in ten different journals were reviewed for their use of human primary cells and immortalized cell lines, and were analyzed based on whether or not the ancestral or ethnic information of cell donors was ascertainable. RESULTS: The vast majority of literature published in the journals and timeframe we investigated did not report on the ancestral or ethnic origins of the human cells used. CONCLUSION: There is currently a substantial lack of reporting on the ancestral background of human cells used for research. We suggest that increased ancestral reporting should be implemented in order to improve the development of precision medicine. LAY SUMMARY: Many diseases affect patients of different ancestral backgrounds in a variety of ways. In this perspective article, we raise the concern that, since many scientists do not consider ancestry when designing their studies, their results may not apply to all patients. We use data to show that very few scientists report on the ancestry of the donors who contribute cells and tissues to their research. We suggest that broader reporting on donor ancestry would improve biomedical research and would help doctors to personalize treatments for their patients. Future work includes further increasing awareness of the importance of including ancestry as a variable in experimental design, as well as promoting increased reporting on ancestry in the research community.

OBJECTIVES To evaluate the presentation and management of patients with acute appendicitis. METHODS A retrospective study was conducted of all patients presenting with acute appendicitis to the emergency department of a large tertiary center during March and April 2020. Clinical features, diagnostic workup, and management were compared. RESULTS Seventy-four patients presented with acute appendicitis during the pandemic compared to 60 patients during the same time the year before. There were no significant differences in patient demographics: age (P = 0.65), gender (P = 0.73), smoking status (P = 0.48). During COVID-19 patients were more likely to complain of right lower quadrant pain (100% vs. 78.3%, P < 0.01). Rates of surgical treatment was similar (83.8% vs. 81.7%, P = 1); mean operative time was longer during COVID-19 (63  23 vs. 52  26 minutes, P = 0.03).

Jintiange capsule is extensively applied to treat OP in China. Although recent studies demonstrate that it generates significant effects on strengthening bone, the exact mechanism of the jintiange capsule for treating OP remains unknown. PURPOSE: To understand the main ingredients of the jintiange capsule, predict the possible targets and the relevant signal transduction pathways, and explore the mechanism of the jintiange capsule for the treatment of OP. METHODS: Main ingredients of the jintiange capsule, drug targets, and potential disease targets for OP were obtained from public databases. Molecular biological processes and signaling pathways were determined via bioinformatic analysis, containing protein-protein interaction (PPI), Gene Ontology (GO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Subsequently, the disease-drug-ingredient-targets-pathways networks were constructed using Cytoscape. According to CytoNCA, core targets were acquired. Finally, the present study conducted molecular docking for better testing the abovementioned results. RESULTS: In the current work, we found that 4 main ingredients of the jintiange capsule, 33 drug targets, 4745 potential disease targets for OP, and 12 overlapping targets were identified. PPI network containing 12 nodes and 25 edges proved that there existed a complex relationship. As revealed by GO functional annotation, the intersected targets were mostly associated with BP, CC, and MF. The targets were enriched to 368 items in BP, 27 items in CC, and 42 items in MF. They mainly included calcium ion homeostasis, calcium channel complex, and calcium channel regulator activity. According to KEGG pathway analysis, the intersected targets were mostly associated with Rap 1, cGMP-PKG, Ras, cAMP, calcium pathways, and so on. Based on the analysis with CytoNCA, we acquired 4 core targets, respectivelyCALR, SPARC, CALM1, and CALM2. Besides, 2 core targets, CALR and CALM1, were selected for molecular docking experiments. Molecular docking revealed that the main ingredient, calcium phosphate, had good binding with the CALR protein and CALM1 protein. CONCLUSION: To conclude, the main ingredient of the jintiange capsule, particularly calcium phosphate, may interact with 2 targets, CALR and CALM1, and regulate multiple signaling pathways to treat OP. Additionally, this also benefits us in further understanding the mechanism of the jintiange capsule for treating OP.","output":"Network Pharmacology-Based Strategy and Molecular Docking to Explore the Potential Mechanism of Jintiange Capsule for Treating Osteoporosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We have constructed a COVID-19 infection hazard model for the return of pupils to the 16,769 state Primary Schools in England that takes into account uncertainties in model input parameters.

Inputs to the infection hazard model are: the inventory of children, teachers and support staff; the prevalence of COVID-19 in the general community including its spatial variation, and the ratio of adult susceptibility to that of children. Three scenarios of inventory are: the counts on 1st June when schools re-opened to Nursery, Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 children, when approximately one-third of eligible children attended; a scenario assuming a full return of eligible children in those cohorts; and a return of all primary age children, scheduled for September. With a national average prevalence, we find that for the first scenario between 178 and 924 schools out of 16,769 in total (i.e. about 1% and 5.5% respectively) may have infected individuals present, expressed as a 90% credible interval. For the second scenario, the range is between 336 (2%) and 1873 (11%) schools with one (or more) infected persons, while for the third scenario the range is 661 (4%) to 3310 (20%) schools, assuming that the prevalence is the same as it was on 5th June. The range decreases to between 381 (2%) and 900 (5%) schools with an infected person if prevalence is one-quarter that of 5th June, and increases to between 2131 (13%) and 9743 (58%) schools for the situation where prevalence increases to 4 times the 5th June level. Net prevalence of COVID-19 in schools is reduced relative to the general community because of the lower susceptibility of primary age children to infection. When regional variations in prevalence and school size distribution are taken into account there is a slight decrease in number of infected schools, but the uncertainty on these projected numbers increases markedly. The probability of having an infected school in a community is proportional to the local prevalence and school size. Analysis of a scenario equivalent to a full return to school with an average national prevalence of 1 in 1700 and spatial prevalence variations, estimated from data for late June, indicates 82% of infected schools would be located in areas where prevalence exceeds the national average. The probability of having multiple infected persons in a school increases markedly in high prevalence areas. Assuming national prevalence characteristic of early June, individual, operational and societal risk will increase if schools re-open fully in September due to both increases in numbers of children and the increased challenges of sustaining mitigation measures. Comparison between incidents in primary schools with positive tests in June and July and our estimates of number of infected schools indicates at least an order of magnitude difference. The much lower number of incidents reflects several factors, including effective reduction in transmission resulting from risk mitigation measure instigated by schools.","output":"Quantifying threat from COVID-19 infection hazard in Primary Schools in England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic, also affecting Pakistan with its first case reported on February 26, 2020. Since then, it has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Our study aimed to evaluate the renal derangements associated with COVID-19 infection in our population. A retrospective, observational study was conducted to include all the admitted patients having COVID-19 positive, and evaluated those for derangements of renal function (n = 362). Out of the 362 patients, 229were admitted in the ward, 133 were in intensive care unit (ICU), 258 of them recovered, while 104 deaths reported. At admission, the renal profile was deranged in almost one-half of ICU admissions and mortalities which increased to two-third during the hospital stay, with around 80% of deaths reported with increased urea and creatinine levels. Among the deceased patients, around one-third of the mortalities developed renal profile derangements during the hospital stay although they were admitted with a normal renal profile. An estimated glomerular filtration rate showed a mean increase of 13.37 mL/min/1.73 m2 during the hospital stay of surviving patients, while a decline of 19.92 in nonsurviving patients. A hazard ratio of 3.293 (P <0.001) for admitting serum urea and 3.795 (P = 0.009) at discharge and for serum creatinine at 5.392 (P <0.001) on discharge was associated significantly with mortality.

The high potential of human-to-human transmission led to subsequent COVID-19 global pandemic. Public health strategies including reduced social contact and lockdown have been adopted in many countries. Nonetheless, social distancing and isolation could also represent risk factors for mental disorders, resulting in loneliness, reduced social support and under-detection of mental health needs. Along with this, social distancing determines a relevant obstacle for direct access to psychiatric care services. The pandemic generates the urgent need for integrating technology into innovative models of mental healthcare. AIMS: In this paper, we discuss the potential role of telepsychiatry (TP) and other cutting-edge technologies in the management of mental health assistance. We narratively review the literature to examine the advantages and risks related to the extensive application of these new therapeutic settings, along with the possible limitations and ethical concerns. RESULTS: Telemental health services may be particularly feasible and appropriate for the support of patients, family members and healthcare providers during this COVID-19 pandemic. The integration of TP with other technological innovations (eg, mobile apps, virtual reality, big data and artificial intelligence (AI)) opens up interesting future perspectives for the improvement of mental health assistance. CONCLUSION: Telepsychiatry is a promising and growing way to deliver mental health services but is still underused. The COVID-19 pandemic may serve as an opportunity to introduce and promote, among numerous mental health professionals, the knowledge of the possibilities offered by the digital era.","output":"Telepsychiatry and other cutting-edge technologies in COVID-19 pandemic: Bridging the distance in mental health assistance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Under the ceaseless global COVID-19 pandemic, lung ultrasound (LUS) is the emerging way for effective diagnosis and severeness evaluation of respiratory diseases. However, close physical contact is unavoidable in conventional clinical ultrasound, increasing the infection risk for health-care workers. Hence, a scanning approach involving minimal physical contact between an operator and a patient is vital to maximize the safety of clinical ultrasound procedures. A robotic ultrasound platform can satisfy this need by remotely manipulating the ultrasound probe with a robotic arm. This paper proposes a robotic LUS system that incorporates the automatic identification and execution of the ultrasound probe placement pose without manual input. An RGB-D camera is utilized to recognize the scanning targets on the patient through a learning-based human pose estimation algorithm and solve for the landing pose to attach the probe vertically to the tissue surface;A position/force controller is designed to handle intraoperative probe pose adjustment for maintaining the contact force. We evaluated the scanning area localization accuracy, motion execution accuracy, and ultrasound image acquisition capability using an upper torso mannequin and a realistic lung ultrasound phantom with healthy and COVID-19-infected lung anatomy. Results demonstrated the overall scanning target localization accuracy of 19.67  4.92 mm and the probe landing pose estimation accuracy of 6.92  2.75 mm in translation, 10.35  2.97 deg in rotation.

Demographic and perioperative physiologic factors have both been associated with developmental outcome. The acute physiologic effect of a surgical procedure, anesthesia, and hospitalization may offset any potential advantage gained from anatomic correction and circulatory palliation. The specific risk/benefit balance on ND outcome of the insult of the operation, offset by the benefit of improved anatomy and physiology, has not been addressed. We therefore sought to identify interval procedural and physiologic factors assessed at outpatient ND evaluation visits that were associated with outcome. METHODS The study included children with congenital heart disease at high risk for impaired ND performance with at least three ND assessments using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-III during the first 3 years of life. The number of cardiac procedures, duration of hospitalization, feeding status, height, weight, and arterial, cerebral, and somatic oxygen saturations by near-infrared spectroscopy were recorded at each visit and used as predictors of language, motor, and cognitive composite scores and slopes (change over time) in general linear models. RESULTS Data on 178 children derived from 632 visits (median, 4 visits/child) were analyzed, with ages at first and last assessment of 7.7 and 30.2 months. Fifty-one had 1 ventricle (1V), 88 had 2 ventricles, and 39 had genetic syndrome conditions. Motor performance increased with age in all diagnostic categories. Cognitive and language performance increased with age in 1V patients but exhibited no significant change in 2-ventricle and genetic syndrome groups. At the first visit, 1V patients performed less well than 2-ventricle patients in the motor domain, but the rate of improvement was higher for 1V patients; by 24 months, there were no differences, and both groups were normal in all domains. Performance in genetic syndrome patients was below normal in all domains at the first visit and did not improve. Higher arterial saturation and narrower arterial-cerebral and arterial-somatic near-infrared spectroscopy saturation differences were associated with better or improving motor performance. Incremental cardiopulmonary bypass time, cumulative hospital length of stay, and tube feedings were risk factors in all domains. Total and incremental times for deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, total open and total surgical procedures, and birth weight were not risk factors. CONCLUSIONS Patient physiologic status assessed by cerebral and somatic near-infrared spectroscopy is associated with ND performance. Incremental surgical procedures are not associated with ND performance when adjusted for cardiopulmonary bypass time and physiologic status. Treatment strategies that target improved physiologic status may also improve ND outcome.","output":"Effect of Intercurrent Operation and Cerebral Oxygenation on Developmental Trajectory in Congenital Heart Disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tauopathies include a variety of neurodegenerative diseases associated with the pathological aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau, resulting in progressive cognitive decline and motor impairment. The underlying mechanism for motor deficits related to tauopathy is not yet fully understood. Here, we use a novel transgenic tau mouse line, Tau 58/4, with enhanced neuron-specific expression of P301S mutant tau to investigate the motor abnormalities in association with the peripheral nervous system. Using stationary beam, gait, and rotarod tests, motor deficits were found in Tau 58/4 mice already 3 months after birth, which deteriorated during aging. Hyperphosphorylated tau was detected in the cell bodies and axons of motor neurons. At the age of 9 and 12 months, significant denervation of the neuromuscular junction in the extensor digitorum longus muscle was observed in Tau 58/4 mice, compared to wild-type mice. Muscle hypotrophy was observed in Tau 58/4 mice at 9 and 12 months. Using electron microscopy, we observed ultrastructural changes in the sciatic nerve of 12-month-old Tau 58/4 mice indicative of the loss of large axonal fibers and hypomyelination (assessed by g-ratio). We conclude that the accumulated hyperphosphorylated tau in the axon terminals may induce dying-back axonal degeneration, myelin abnormalities, neuromuscular junction denervation, and muscular atrophy, which may be the mechanisms responsible for the deterioration of the motor function in Tau 58/4 mice. Tau 58/4 mice represent an interesting neuromuscular degeneration model, and the pathological mechanisms might be responsible for motor signs observed in some human tauopathies.","output":"Progressive Motor Deficit is Mediated by the Denervation of Neuromuscular Junctions and Axonal Degeneration in Transgenic Mice Expressing Mutant (P301S) Tau Protein."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The liver-derived hormone hepcidin, a member of the defensin family of antimicrobial peptides, plays an important role in host defense and innate immunity due to its broad antibacterial and antiviral properties Ferritin, an iron storage protein is often associated with iron deficiency, hypoferritinemia, hypoxia, and immune complications, which are all significant concerns for systemic infection in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Down's syndrome (DS) dementia Serum and post-mortem brain samples were collected from AD, DS and age-matched control subjects Serum samples were analyzed with ELISA for ferritin, hepcidin and IL-6 Additionally, post-mortem brain sections were assessed by immunohistochemistry for iron-related and inflammatory proteins A significant increase in serum hepcidin levels was found in DS, compared to controls and AD subjects (p &lt; 0 0001) Hepcidin protein was visible in the epithelial cells of choroid plexus, meningeal macrophages and in the astrocytes close to the endothelium of blood vessels Hepcidin co-localized with IL-6, indicating its anti-inflammatory properties We found significant correlation between hypoferritinemia and elevated levels of serum hepcidin in AD and DS Hepcidin can be transported via macrophages and the majority of the vesicular hepcidin enters the brain via a compromised blood brain barrier (BBB) Our findings provide further insight into the molecular implications of the altered iron metabolism in acute inflammation, and can aid towards the development of preventive strategies and novel treatments in the fight against neuroinflammation","output":"Hepcidin Increases Cytokines in Alzheimer's Disease and Down's Syndrome Dementia: Implication of Impaired Iron Homeostasis in Neuroinflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This review of the meaningful data from 2021 on cervical, endometrial, and ovarian cancers aims to provide an update of the most clinically relevant studies presented at important oncologic congresses during the year (the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting, the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress and the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) Annual Meeting).

We use text data from discussions on WallStreetBets (WSB), an online investor forum with over eleven million followers as of February 2022, as a case study to demonstrate how retail investors influence each other, and how social behaviours impact financial markets. We document that WSB users adopt price predictions about assets (bullish or bearish) in part due to the sentiments expressed by their peers. Discussions about stocks are also self-perpetuating: narratives about specific assets spread at an increasing rate before peaking, and eventually diminishing in importance -- a pattern reminiscent of an epidemiological setting. To consolidate these findings, we develop a model for the impact of social dynamics among retail investors on asset prices. We find that the interplay between \`trend following' and \`consensus formation' determines the stability of price returns, with socially-driven investing potentially causing oscillations and cycles. Our framework helps identify components of asset demand stemming from social dynamics, which we predict using WSB data. Our predictions explain significant variation in stock market activity.

LUR models were estimated over Calgary (Canada) for summer 2015 and winter 2016. As all samples exhibited significant spatial autocorrelation, spatial autoregressive lag (SARlag) and error (SARerr) models were computed. SARlag models were preferred for all pollutants in both seasons, and yielded goodness of fit aligned with or higher than values reported in the literature. LUR models yielded consistent sets of predictors, representing industrial activities, traffic, and elevation. The obtained model coefficients were then combined with local land use variables to compute fine-scale concentration predictions over the entire city. The predicted concentrations were slightly lower and less dispersed than the observed ones. Consistent with observed pollution records, prediction maps exhibited higher concentration over the road network, industrial areas, and the eastern quadrants of the city. Lastly, results of a corresponding study of PM in summer 2010 and winter 2011 were considered.

While there are potential benefits of a mailed approach, relative patient outcomes are unclear. Specifically, many have concerns that a lack of in-person training may contribute to reduced CPAP adherence. To inform this knowledge gap, we aimed to compare treatment usage after in-person or mailed CPAP initiation. METHODS: Our medical center shifted from in-person to mailed CPAP dispensation in March 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This study aimed to investigate pandemic-related stressors, attitudes, and work outcomes among medical assistants and to identify possible determinants. METHODS: The population under study were medical assistants across entire Germany. A self-devised online questionnaire was published between April 7th, 2020, and April 14th. including questions on pandemic-related stressors, attitudes and work outcomes. Additionally, symptoms of depression and anxiety disorder were measured by PHQ-2 and GAD-2, respectively. Logistic regression was performed to identify possible determinants. RESULTS: 2150 medical assistants provided complete data (98.0% female, mean age 37.6 years). Major stressors were uncertainty about the temporal scope of the pandemic (95.1% agreement), about how to act correctly (77.5%), feelings of not being allowed to let patients down (75.9%), uncertainty about ones financial situation (67.4%) and about contact persons for further information (67.1%).

This review critically surveys the chronological development of biological classification from Aristotle through our postgenomic era with a central focus on cladistics. In 1957, Julian Huxley coined cladogenesis to denote splitting from subspeciation. In 1960, the English translation of Willi Hennigs 1950 work, Systematic Phylogenetics, was published, which received strong opposition from pheneticists, such as numerical taxonomists Peter Sneath and Robert Sokal, and evolutionary taxonomist, Ernst Mayr, and sparked acrimonious debates in 1960C1980. In 1977C1990, Carl Woese pioneered in using small subunit rRNA gene sequences to delimitate the three domains of cellular life and established major prokaryotic phyla. Cladistics has since dominated taxonomy. Despite being compatible with modern microbiological observations, i.e. organisms with unusual phenotypes, restricted expression of characteristics and occasionally being uncultivable, increasing recognition of pervasiveness and abundance of horizontal gene transfer has challenged relevance and validity of cladistics. The mosaic nature of eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes was also gradually discovered. In the mid-2000s, high-throughput and whole-genome sequencing became routine and complex geneologies of organisms have led to the proposal of a reticulated web of life. While genomics only indirectly leads to understanding of functional adaptations to ecological niches, computational modeling of entire organisms is underway and the gap between genomics and phenetics may soon be bridged.

Pyrethroid concentration was in the order of sediment > parasite> water > intestine> liver. The cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL (low density lipids) in the parasite were higher than in the host fish (p<0.05). On the other hand, the fish hepatic protein, high density lipids (HDL) and glucose were higher than the levels in the parasites (p<0.05). There was a high prevalence of gut microbes (30 - 40%), which include Salmonella sp, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas sp and Bacillus sp among individuals infected with gut Cestodes, Wenyonia sp compared with uninfected individual which had higher gut Staphylococcus sp., Klebsiella sp., and Proteus sp. (10- 40%). among the congeners of pyrethroids analyzed, Cyfluthrin > Alpha-Cyermethrin had significant sorption on the sediment, however unlike a benthopelagic fish, no pyrethroid was accumulated in the S. clarias from the sediment. The fish however accumulated Alpha-Cypermethrin from the aqueous phase. The parasite on the other hand accumulated Bathroid significantly from the surface water and bottom sediment which may be linked to the higher stress levels observed in the parasite than the host fish. The parasite in turn inflicted histological alterations on the host intestine, marked by moderate inflammation of mucosa, alteration of the villi microstructure, moderate stunting of the villous structure and moderate fibrosis of villous structure. The study demonstrated the efficiency of histopathological and microbial analysis in biomonitoring studies enteric parasites and early detection of pyrethroid toxicity respectively compared to bioaccumulation analysis.","output":"Bioaccumulation of Pyrethroid in Parasite Wenyonia acuminata (Cestoda: Caryophyllaeidae) and Host fish Synodontis clarias (Linnaeus, 1758) from Lekki Lagoon, Lagos Nigeria."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has impacted all age groups, but older adults may have greater distress given their increased risk for severe illness and mortality. In Nepal, most stories of older adults are untold ? both in pre-COVID-19 and the COVID-19 era. In this study, we aimed to assess the perceived fear of COVID-19, and associated factors, among older adults in eastern Nepal. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between July and September 2020 among 847 older adults (60 years) residing in three districts of eastern Nepal. Perceived fear of COVID-19 was measured using the seven-item Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S). In order to examine the factors associated with the COVID 19 fear, a generalized estimating equation, adjusting the sampling design was used. STATA 15 and JASP 0.13.1 were used for data analyses. Results: The mean score of the FCV-19S was 18.15.2, and a sizeable proportion of participants, ranging between 12%-34%, agreed to the seven items of the fear scale. Increasing age, Dalit ethnicity remoteness to the health facility, and being concerned or overwhelmed with the COVID-19 were associated with greater fear of COVID-19. Surprisingly, pre-existing health conditions were inversely associated with fear of COVID-19. Conclusion: Greater fear of the COVID-19 pandemic among the older population suggests that during unprecedented times such as the current pandemic, the psychological needs of most vulnerable groups should be prioritized. Fear among the most vulnerable groups could be reduced with the flow of adequate genuine information as well as better preparedness and psychosocial interventions.","output":"Perceived Fear of COVID-19 and its Associated Factors Among Nepalese Older Adults in Eastern Nepal: Findings From a Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The Centre for Economic Policy (CEP) located within Australia's Sustainable Tourism Cooperative Research Centre, engaged with government, industry and researchers for over a decade to advance policy analysis in tourism contexts.

While the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 Omicron variant of concern (VoC) has been shown to be notably more transmissible amongst humans, its ability to cause infection and spillover to non-human animals remains a challenge of concern. We found that 19 of the 131 (14.5%; 95% CI: 0.10C0.22) white-tailed deer opportunistically sampled on Staten Island, New York, between December 12, 2021, and January 31, 2022, were positive for SARS-CoV-2 specific serum antibodies using a surrogate virus neutralization assay, indicating prior exposure. The results also revealed strong evidence of age-dependence in antibody prevalence. A significantly ((2), p < 0.001) greater proportion of yearling deer possessed neutralizing antibodies as compared with fawns (OR=12.7; 95% CI 4C37.5). Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was detected in nasal swabs from seven of 68 (10.29%; 95% CI: 0.0C0.20) of the sampled deer, and whole-genome sequencing identified the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron VoC (B.1.1.529) is circulating amongst the white-tailed deer on Staten Island. Phylogenetic analyses revealed the deer Omicron sequences clustered closely with other, recently reported Omicron sequences recovered from infected humans in New York City and elsewhere, consistent with human to deer spillover. Interestingly, one individual deer was positive for viral RNA and had a high level of neutralizing antibodies, suggesting either rapid serological conversion during an ongoing infection or a breakthrough infection in a previously exposed animal. Together, our findings show that the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 Omicron VoC can infect white-tailed deer and highlights an urgent need for comprehensive surveillance of susceptible animal species to identify ecological transmission networks and better assess the potential risks of spillback to humans.","output":"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) infection of white-tailed deer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"N/A.","output":"COVID-19 third wave: A challenge for overburdened and shabby healthcare system of Pakistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The nucleoprotein (N) from SARS-CoV-2 is an essential cofactor of the viral replication transcription complex and as such represents an important target for viral inhibition.

Although there are a handful of disease-modifying treatments approved for use in progressive phenotypes of MS, there are no treatments that substantially modify the course of clinical progression in MS. Characterizing the determinants of clinical progression can inform the development of novel therapeutic agents and treatment approaches that target progression in MS, which is one of the greatest unmet needs in clinical practice. Canada, having one of the worlds highest rates of MS and a publicly-funded health care system, represents an optimal country to achieve in-depth analysis of progression. Accordingly, the overarching aim of the Canadian Prospective Cohort Study to Understand Progression in MS (CanProCo) is to evaluate a wide spectrum of factors associated with the clinical onset and rate of disease progression in MS, and to describe how these factors relate to one another to influence progression. METHODS: CanProCo is a prospective, observational cohort study with investigators specializing in epidemiology, neuroimaging, neuroimmunology, health services research and health economics. CanProCos study design was approved by an international review panel, comprised of content experts and key stakeholders. One thousand individuals with radiologically-isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting MS, and primary-progressive MS within 10C15 years of disease onset will be recruited from 5 academic MS centres in Canada. Participants will undergo detailed clinical evaluation annually over 5 years (including advanced, app-based clinical data collection). In a subset of participants within 5C10 years of disease onset (n = 500), blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and research MRIs will be collected allowing an integrated, in-depth evaluation of factors contributing to progression in MS from multiple perspectives. Factors of interest range from biological measures (e.g. single-cell RNA-sequencing), MRI-based microstructural assessment, participant characteristics (self-reported, performance-based, clinician-assessed, health-system based), and micro and macro-environmental factors. DISCUSSION: Halting the progression of MS remains a fundamental need to improve the lives of people living with MS. Achieving this requires leveraging transdisciplinary approaches to better characterize why clinical progression occurs. CanProCo is a pioneering multi-dimensional cohort study aiming to characterize these determinants to inform the development and implementation of efficacious and effective interventions.

Recently, the emergence of thermally enhanced upconversion luminescence in lanthanide-doped nanoparticles seemed to challenge this stereotype, and the research on this topic rapidly aroused wide attention. While considerable efforts have been made to explore the origin of this phenomenon, the key mechanism of luminescence enhancement is still under debate.

While healthcare institutions across the nation all faced high census numbers, hospitals in rural settings are often burdened with less resources than their urban counterparts. Therefore, we hypothesized that receiving care in rural settings would be associated with poorer clinical outcomes. OBJECTIVE To compare the characteristics and outcomes of patients with SARS-CoV-2 presenting to urban and rural emergency departments in the American southwest. METHODS A multisite retrospective chart review of patients admitted to inpatient care due SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 1st , 2020 through January 31st , 2021 was conducted at three participating hospitals. Abstracted data included patient demographics, intake laboratory values, and patient outcomes. Analysis was conducted using descriptive statistics, the Pearson chi-square for categorical data, the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous data, and Kaplan-Myer for disease progression. RESULTS A total of 489 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection via nasopharyngeal sample were included in the analysis with 57.1% (279/489) presenting to an urban emergency department. Patients admitted in the rural and urban setting showed similar demographics in regard to age (p=0.710), sex (p=0.312), and majority/minority status (p=0.062). Upon presentation, patients in rural settings were more likely to have critically low white blood cell counts (p<0.001), abnormally high hematocrit (p=0.001), and abnormally high aspartate aminotransferase levels (p<0.001) than their urban counterparts. Following admission, urban patients were 2.53 times more likely than rural patients to be transferred to critical care (p<0.001) with the transfer contributing to a reduced hospitalization length of 2.7 days in the urban setting (p=0.002). Rural patients unable to transfer to critical care were 4.95 times more likely to expire than urban patients (p=0.014). CONCLUSION Patients receiving care for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the rural setting often present with more severe clinical profiles and are more likely to experience negative outcomes than their urban counterparts.

The central role of SAA in pathogenesis of IRD has been confirmed by recent discoveries, including its involvement in the activation of the inflammasome cascade and recruitment of interleukin 17 producing T helper cells. Clinical utility of SAA in IRD was originally evaluated nearly half a century ago. From the first findings, it was clear that SAA could be used for evaluating disease severity and monitoring disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and secondary amyloidosis. However, cost-effective and more easily applicable markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), overwhelmed its use in clinical practice. In the light of emerging evidences, SAA has been discerned as a more sensitive biomarker in a wide spectrum of IRD, especially in case of subclinical inflammation. Furthermore, a growing number of studies are confirming the advantages of SAA over many other biomarkers in predicting and monitoring response to biological immunotherapy in IRD patients. Arising scientific discoveries regarding the role of SAA, as well as delineating SAA and its isoforms as the most sensitive biomarkers in various IRD by recently developing proteomic techniques are encouraging the revival of its clinical use. Finally, the most recent findings have shown that SAA is a biomarker of severe Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Interferons and ISGs are expressed in normal mucosa, but their levels were decreased in patients with CRS. Interferon and ISG levels were upregulated in cells treated with macrolides, dexamethasone, or TLR3 agonist, but some were decreased in cytokine-treated cells. TLR3 and TLR7 levels showed no significant difference between normal and inflammatory sinus mucosal tissue. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that decreased levels of interferons and ISGs in patients with CRS might contribute to impairment of the antiviral innate response in inflammatory sinonasal epithelial cells. Macrolides and glucocorticoids might provide positive effects on the treatment of CRS by upregulating interferon and ISG expression.","output":"Decreased expression of type I (IFN-) and type III (IFN-) interferons and interferon-stimulated genes in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Psychological and behavioral health policies are critical in the successful public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.

By applying intelligent data analysis techniques, many interesting patterns are identified for the early and onset detection and prevention of several fatal diseases. Diabetes mellitus is an extremely life-threatening disease because it contributes to other lethal diseases, i.e., heart, kidney, and nerve damage. In this paper, a machine learning based approach has been proposed for the classification, early-stage identification, and prediction of diabetes. Furthermore, it also presents an IoT-based hypothetical diabetes monitoring system for a healthy and affected person to monitor his blood glucose (BG) level. For diabetes classification, three different classifiers have been employed, i.e., random forest (RF), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and logistic regression (LR). For predictive analysis, we have employed long short-term memory (LSTM), moving averages (MA), and linear regression (LR). For experimental evaluation, a benchmark PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset is used. During the analysis, it is observed that MLP outperforms other classifiers with 86.08% of accuracy and LSTM improves the significant prediction with 87.26% accuracy of diabetes.

Asthmatics were listed as a high-risk group for susceptibility to SARSCoV-2. Several hypotheses have been proposed regarding protective factors in asthmatics, amongst which were the role of biological agents. One such agent is omalizumab, an IgE inhibitor, which is currently the only biological agent available in Malta for the treatment of severe asthma. METHODS This study aims to evaluate the symptomatology and disease course of SARS-CoV-2 in our cohort of severe asthmatic patients on omalizumab that contracted COVID-19. Molecular diagnostic tests (SARSCoV-2 PCR tests taken, if any, and the PCR result) since March 2020 of all adult patients receiving omalizumab for severe allergic asthma in January 2021, were reviewed from I-soft Clinical Manager (R).

However, the shortage of testing services to detect infected persons makes this approach subject to error due to its underdetection of early cases in the U.S. Our new approach overcomes this limitation and provides data supporting the public policy decisions intended to combat the spread of COVID-19 epidemic. Methods: We used Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data documenting the daily new and cumulative cases of confirmed COVID-19 in the U.S. from January 22 to April 6, 2020, and reconstructed the epidemic using a 5-parameter logistic growth model. We fitted our model to data from a 2-week window (i.e., from March 21 to April 4, approximately one incubation period) during which large-scale testing was being conducted. With parameters obtained from this modeling, we reconstructed and predicted the growth of the epidemic and evaluated the extent and potential effects of underdetection. Results: The data fit the model satisfactorily. The estimated daily growth rate was 16.8% overall with 95% CI: [15.95, 17.76%], suggesting a doubling period of 4 days. Based on the modeling result, the tipping point at which new cases will begin to decline will be on April 7th, 2020, with a peak of 32,860 new cases on that day. By the end of the epidemic, at least 792,548 (95% CI: [789,162, 795,934]) will be infected in the U.S. Based on our model, a total of 12,029 cases were not detected between January 22 (when the first case was detected in the U.S.) and April 4. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate the utility of a 5-parameter logistic growth model with reliable data that comes from a specified period during which governmental interventions were appropriately implemented.

We assessed the association between the proportion of the population from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) backgrounds, income deprivation and COVID19 mortality rates using negative binomial regression models, whilst adjusting for population density, proportion of the population aged 50-79 and 80+ years, and the duration of the epidemic in each area. Findings: Local authorities with a greater proportion of residents from ethnic minority backgrounds had statistically significantly higher COVID19 mortality rates, as did local authorities with a greater proportion of residents experiencing deprivation relating to low income. After adjusting for income deprivation and other covariates, each percentage point increase in the proportion of the population from BAME backgrounds was associated with a 1% increase in the COVID19 mortality rate [IRR=1.01, 95%CI 1.01 to 1.02]. Each percentage point increase in the proportion of the population experiencing income deprivation was associated with a 2% increase in the COVID19 mortality rate [IRR=1.02, 95%CI 1.01 to 1.04].

In vitro, activation induces virus-cell membrane fusion at the cell surface. However, the roles of TMPRSS2 during coronavirus infection in vivo are unclear. Here, we used animal models of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection to investigate the role of TMPRSS2. Th1-prone C57BL/6 mice and TMPRSS2-knockout (KO) mice were used for SARS-CoV infection, and transgenic mice expressing the human MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 (hDPP4-Tg mice) and TMPRSS2-KO hDPP4-Tg mice were used for MERS-CoV infection. After experimental infection, TMPRSS2-deficient mouse strains showed reduced body weight loss and viral kinetics in the lungs. Lack of TMPRSS2 affected the primary sites of infection and virus spread within the airway, accompanied by less severe immunopathology. However, TMPRSS2-KO mice showed weakened inflammatory chemokine and/or cytokine responses to intranasal stimulation with poly(IC), a Toll-like receptor 3 agonist. In conclusion, TMPRSS2 plays a crucial role in viral spread within the airway of murine models infected by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and in the resulting immunopathology.

The dominant paradigm underlying most standard modeling techniques assumes that the data are concentrated near a single unknown manifold of relatively small intrinsic dimension. Here, we present a systematic framework for detecting interfaces and related anomalies in data which may fail to satisfy the manifold hypothesis. By computing the local topology of small regions around each data point, we are able to partition a given dataset into disjoint classes, each of which can be individually approximated by a single manifold. Since these manifolds may have different intrinsic dimensions, local topology discovers singular regions in data even when none of the points have been sampled precisely from the singularities. We showcase this method by identifying the intersection of two surfaces in the 24-dimensional space of cyclo-octane conformations and by locating all of the self-intersections of a Henneberg minimal surface immersed in 3-dimensional space.

During ischemia, succinate accumulates and its oxidation upon reperfusion by succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) drives ROS production. Inhibition of succinate accumulation and/or oxidation by dimethyl malonate (DMM), a cell permeable prodrug of the SDH inhibitor malonate, can decrease I/R injury. However, DMM is hydrolysed slowly, requiring administration to the heart prior to ischemia, precluding its administration to patients at the point of reperfusion, for example at the same time as unblocking a coronary artery following a heart attack. To accelerate malonate delivery, here we developed more rapidly hydrolysable malonate esters. METHODS We synthesised a series of malonate esters and assessed their uptake and hydrolysis by isolated mitochondria, C2C12 cells and in mice in vivo. In addition, we assessed protection against cardiac I/R injury by the esters using an in vivo mouse model of acute myocardial infarction. RESULTS We found that the diacetoxymethyl malonate diester (MAM) most rapidly delivered large amounts of malonate to cells in vivo.

As a result of their unique mechanism of action, they are more effective and less toxic treatment option and their clinical usage is increasing. While they are more commonly used, various adverse effects have been observed including life-threatening ones, including anaphylaxis. The aim of this review is to distinguish the anaphylaxis from other hypersensitivity reactions (HSR) and provide a management algorithm for the anaphylactic reactions induced by biological agents. RECENT FINDINGS: Many case reports and series have been published regarding anaphylaxis and other hypersensitivity reactions (concerning cytokine release syndrome, acute infusionCrelated reactions) due to biologic agents. Although acute treatment of HSR varies according to the clinical presentation, desensitization with the drug is the major management option for subsequent administrations in the case of anaphylactic reactions. SUMMARY: Anaphylaxis and other immediate onset hypersensitivity reactions are occasionally difficult to differentiate from each other, and mixed-type reactions may be observed. Immediate management of anaphylaxis includes discontinuation of infusion, immediate administration of adrenaline, antihistamines, corticosteroids, and other treatment options depending on the symptoms. After 30C120 min of the reaction, a blood sample for serum tryptase levels should be obtained and after 4C6 weeks skin testing with the culprit drug should be performed for decision of long-term management via either graded challenge or desensitization.","output":"Hypersensitivity Reactions to Biologicals: from Bench to Bedside"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has impacted the lifestyle worldwide. Health, economy, daily routines, work culture, research, mode of communications etc. all have been adversely affected and a new normal has been defined. Until an effective and reliable vaccine is developed, social distancing is one of the key solutions to prevent the virus from affecting the community as lockdown is never a permanent solution to this problem. In order to ensure proper social distancing at any organization, a system is developed that is able to detect whether the people are following social distancing norms by using the proposed 'Distancia-the new normal Algorithm'. The system is designed such that it gives an alert whenever the social distancing norms are violated. It can be deployed with a CCTV camera, so that the live footage fetched by the CCTV can be directly used by the system for checking that the social distancing is being followed or not. Any organization regardless of the number of employees can use this system. Existing mobile applications designed for this purpose cannot be used at schools, educational institutes or any other organization where the use of mobile phones is prohibited. Also, since the effect of rain is not considered in any of the existing system, therefore the present applications can only be deployed at limited places where there is no hindrance caused by rain/snow etc. Thus, the proposed system can prove to be of great importance for organizations where keeping a check of the social distancing is difficult. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Ensuring Social Distancing using Artificial Intelligence: Distancia-the new normal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The retail sector in a lot of countries consists of many small and medium sized specialty retailers who face a high degree of dynamics and competition. Consequently, these companies also have to constantly evolve and develop resilient strategies that promise their future success. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to analyse the resource and capability bundle for operating as and transforming to a small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) omni-channel specialty retailer. Therefore, the authors followed the notions of the Resource-Based-View (RBV) and of the Dynamic-Capabilities-View (DCV). Design/methodology/approach: To answer the authors formulated research questions, they applied an exploratory research method by conducting 12 semi-structured and guideline-based expert interviews from two countries. Findings: The findings reveal a specific bundle of transformation resources and capabilities and important drivers for the implementation of an omni-channel strategy. Thereby, the human resources factor and the market as well as customer understanding play a decisive role. In addition, the authors have identified country-specific differences in the technological, logistical, product-specific and financial areas. Practical implications: The results reflect the importance of qualified and well-trained staff for SME retailers to implement omni-channel strategies in alignment with a high level of service quality. Especially in the Covid 19 era, flexible structures and quick adaptability are essential to remain competitive. Nevertheless, everything should always be in line with the company's own philosophy. Originality/value: The paper provides new insights into important resources and capabilities retailers need to focus on when implementing an omni-channel strategy.

Materials And Methods Three clinical MRI sequences were performed to assess imaging artefacts, grid distortion, and local heating for eight commercially available FFP3 respirators. All examinations were performed at Cardiff University Brain Research Imaging Centre using a 3 T Siemens Magnetom Prisma with a 64-channel head and neck coil. Each FFP3 mask was positioned on a custom-developed three-dimensional (3D) head phantom for testing. Results Five of the eight FFP3 masks contained ferromagnetic components and were regarded as MRI unsafe. One mask was considered MRI conditional and only two masks were deemed MRI safe for both MRI staff and patients. Temperature strips positioned at the nasal bridge of the phantom did not exhibit local heating. A maximum grid distortion of 5 mm was seen in the anterior portion of the head of the ferromagnetic FFP3 masks. Conclusion This study has demonstrated the importance of assessing respiratory FFP3 masks for use in and around MRI machines.

Curcuma is widely used in treating malaria, UC, Crohn's disease, and colon cancer, which lead to diarrhea and bloody stool. However, the systemic mechanism of curcuma in treating UC is still unclear. Our work was supposed to expound how does curcuma alleviate UC in a comprehensive and systematic way by network pharmacology, molecular docking, and experiment verification. METHODS: Traditional Chinese Medicine System Pharmacology Database (TCMSP), Shanghai Chemistry & Chemical Industry Data Platform (SGST), and papers published in Chinese Network Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and PubMed were used to collect the chemical constituents of curcuma based on ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion). And effective targets were predicted by Swiss Target Prediction to establish the curcuma-related database. The disease targets of UC were screened by GeneCards and DrugBank databases, and Wayne (Venn) analysis was carried out with curcuma targets to determine the intersection targets. AutoDock software and TCMNPAS system were used to dock the core chemical components of curcuma with key UC targets. Protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed based on the STRING database and Cytoscape software. Gene function GO analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis were carried out by using Metascape database. Finally, HE staining was performed to identify the inflammatory infiltration and expression difference in TNF- and STAT3 before and after the treatment of curcuma which was verified by immunoblotting. RESULTS: Twelve active components containing 148 target genes were selected from curcuma. Potential therapeutic targets of curcuma in the treatment of UC were acquired from 54 overlapped targets from UC and curcuma. Molecular docking was used to filter the exact 24 core proteins interacting with compounds whose docking energy is lower than ?5.5 and stronger than that of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA). GO and KEGG analyses showed that these targets were highly correlated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, JAK-STAT signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Experiments verified curcuma relieved pathological manifestation and decreased the expression of TNF- and STAT3. CONCLUSION: Curcuma relieved the colon inflammation of ulcerative colitis via inactivating TNF pathway, inflammatory bowel disease pathway, and epithelial cell signaling in Helicobacter pylori infection pathway, probably by binding to STAT3 and TNF-.","output":"Uncovering the Mechanism of Curcuma in the Treatment of Ulcerative Colitis Based on Network Pharmacology, Molecular Docking Technology, and Experiment Verification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Women's quality of life, emotional well-being, sexual functioning and satisfaction are associated, and little is known about this relationship during COVID-19 pandemic.

This study aimed to characterize the top-performing ophthalmologic posts on a large social media platform to better understand the spread of ophthalmic information via social media. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a web-based study that searched for ophthalmology-related posts on Instagram, with subjects being users who posted ophthalmic content. A list of 36 ophthalmology-related hashtags, including the most common diagnoses and procedures identified from the IRIS Registry, was queried. For each hashtag, data were collected for Top 9 posts (as ranked by Instagrams engagement-based algorithm) at three different time points. Posts were analyzed for the posters background, credentials, post format, content, caption length, and engagement level. RESULTS: Of the top-performing posts analyzed (n = 972), the most frequent post format was a photo (82.2%), followed by video (8.8%) and graphic (8.4%). Ophthalmologists (35.8%) authored the highest number of posts, followed by patients (27.1%), optometrists (20.1%), and organizations (12.7%). The highest average engagement level ratios (ELRs) belonged to ophthalmologists-in-training (0.096), followed by patients (0.084), optometrists (0.070), all ophthalmologists (0.067) and organizations (0.051); p < 0.001. The most engaging type of content was self-promotional (0.118) and personal experience-related (0.091); educational content was the least engaging (0.059) even though it comprised the majority of posts (56%); (p < 0.001). Characteristics that predicted the highest ELRs (reaching 80th percentile) were captions and/or images that featured personal experiences (3.335 OR), whitecoats (3.259), and those authored by ophthalmologist trainees (3.172); (p < 0.01). The least engaging were those featuring fundus photos (0.281), educational content (0.359), and authored by organizations (0.428); (p < 0.05).

METHODS: We utilized the TriNetX Analytics Network to query 369,563 CO-VID-19 cases up to December 30, 2020. We created 8 cohorts of patients with COVID-19 diagnosis based on a previous diagnosis of CVD. We measured the odds ratios, relative risks, risk differences for hospitalizations, ICU/critical care services, intubation, mortality, and CVD recurrence within 90 days of COVID-19 diagnosis, compared to a propensity-matched cohort with no prior history of CVD within 90 days of COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: 369,563 patients had a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 with a subset of 22,497 (6.09%) patients with a prior diagnosis of CVD within 10 years. All cohorts with a CVD diagnosis had an increased risk of hospitalization, critical care services, and mortality within 90 days of COVID-19 diagnosis. Additionally, the data demonstrate that any history of CVD is associated with significantly increased odds of subsequent CVD post-COVID-19 compared to a matched control. CONCLUSIONS: CVD, a known complication of CO-VID-19, is more frequent in patients with a prior history of CVD. Patients with any previous diagnosis of CVD are at higher risks of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 infection. In patients admitted to the ED due to COVID-19 symptoms, these risk factors should be promptly identified as delayed or missed risk stratification and could lead to an ineffective and untimely diagnosis of subsequent CVD, which would lead to protracted hospitalization and poor prognosis.","output":"A History of Cerebrovascular Disease Is Independently Associated with Increased Morbidity and Mortality in Patients with COVID-19: A Cohort Study of 369,563 COVID-19 Cases in the USA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to evaluate the sensory perceptions of users who visited a train station, this study aimed to conduct an evaluation of their spatial emotions and identify the distance and type of transfer.

There were two research questions: Will the length of movement patterns in the experiment environment vary depending on the types of the participant group? and Is there any moderating effect in the interaction between spatial familiarity and the types of the participant groups? A total of 28 participants were recruited with consideration of gender, age, and familiarity with spatial experience, which were used to analyze the participant groups. The experiment was conducted at a train station, and a vignette was presented to the participants to record the route and pattern of their wayfinding, followed by providing a questionnaire to record their spatial perception. SPSS was used to conduct a T-test, factor analysis, and multidimensional scaling (MDS). The differences in spatial perception were arranged in visual positioning based on emotional vocabulary, and average movement distances in the participant groups were compared in accordance with the type of wayfinding and interaction effect by ANOVA. The results showed that there was a difference in spatial perception depending on the negative emotional vocabulary and type of participant. An emotional positioning map for average comparison was prepared for each participant group (gender, age, and spatial familiarity) by using the factors extracted in the factor analysis (emotional factor, management factor, and aesthetic factor).

Saliva specimens were collected before and after brushing, microbiota was determined using 16S rDNA sequencing, metabolomics was profiled using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS), 80 cytokines were assayed using biochips, and inflammation inducibility was evaluated using OKF6 keratinocytes and THP-1 macrophages. Finally, the effect of ultrasonic scaling on PBC was estimated. Compared with HCs, PBC saliva had enriched taxa such as Bacteroidetes, Campylobacter, Prevotella and Veillonella and depleted taxa such as Enterococcaceae, Granulicatella, Rothia and Streptococcus. PBC saliva also had enriched sCD163, enriched metabolites such as 2-aminomalonic acid and 1-dodecanol, and depleted metabolites such as dodecanoic acid and propylene glycol. sCD163, 4-hydroxybenzeneacetic acid and 2-aminomalonic acid were significantly correlated with salivary cytokines, bacteria and metabolites. Salivary Veillonellaceae members, 2-aminomalonic acid, and sCD163 were positively correlated with liver function indicators such as serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT).

DESIGN: Multicenter observational study. SETTING: Twenty-one U.K. PICUs. PATIENTS: Children (< 18 yr) admitted to U.K. PICUs between April 1, 2020, and May 10, 2020, fulfilling the U.K. case definition of pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Routinely collected, deidentified data were analyzed. Propensity score and linear mixed effects models were used to analyze the effect of steroids, IV immunoglobulin, and biologic agents on changes in C-reactive protein, platelet counts, and lymphocyte counts over the course of PICU stay. Treatment recommendations from U.K. clinical guidelines were analyzed. Over the 6-week study period, 59 of 78 children (76%) received IV immunoglobulin, 57 of 78 (73%) steroids, and 18 of 78 (24%) a biologic agent. We found no evidence of a difference in response in clinical markers of inflammation between patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children/pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 who were treated with IV immunoglobulin, steroids, or biologics, compared with those who were not.

Descriptive statistics were reported as mean hospital-level monthly incidence rates (IR) and compared using Poisson regression GEE models with period as the only covariate. Segmented regression (SR) analysis was performed to estimate changes in monthly IR of CAUTIs, CLABSIs and CDI in the baseline period (01/2018 C 02/2020) and the Pandemic period (03/2020 C 03/2021). SR model was not appropriate for VAE based on the plot. All models were constructed using SAS v.9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary NC). RESULTS: Compared to the baseline period, CLABSIs increased significantly by 50% from 0.6 to 0.9/ 1000 catheter days (P< 0. 001). In contrast, no significant changes were identified for CAUTI (P=0.87). Similar trends were seen in SR models for CLABSI and CAUTI (Figures 1, 2 and Table 1). While overall CDIs decreased significantly from 3.5 to 2.5/10,000 patient days in the pandemic period (P< 0.001), SR model showed increasing pandemic trend change (Figure 3).

With advancements in data analytics and increasing uptake of electronic health records, developing comprehensive predictive models for fall risk is now possible. We aimed to systematically identify studies involving the development and implementation of predictive falls models which used routinely collected electronic health record data in home-based, community and residential aged care settings. METHODS: A systematic search of entries in Cochrane Library, CINAHL, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted in July 2020 using search terms relevant to aged care, prediction, and falls. Selection criteria included English-language studies, published in peer-reviewed journals, had an outcome of falls, and involved fall risk modelling using routinely collected electronic health record data. Screening, data extraction and quality appraisal using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program for Clinical Prediction Rule Studies were conducted. Study content was synthesised and reported narratively. RESULTS: From 7,329 unique entries, four relevant studies were identified. All predictive models were built using different statistical techniques. Predictors across seven categories were used: demographics, assessments of care, fall history, medication use, health conditions, physical abilities, and environmental factors. Only one of the four studies had been validated externally. Three studies reported on the performance of the models. CONCLUSIONS: Adopting predictive modelling in aged care services for adverse events, such as falls, is in its infancy. The increased availability of electronic health record data and the potential of predictive modelling to document fall risk and inform appropriate interventions is making use of such models achievable. Having a dynamic prediction model that reflects the changing status of an aged care client is key to this moving forward for fall prevention interventions.

Despite recent improvements in long-term outcome, there is still an unmet need to further reduce the risk of recurrence, especially in patients with poor response to neoadjuvant treatment. Summary: National and international guidelines included recommendations for using neratinib. Based on the health technology assessment for neratinib, the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) in Germany has granted an added benefit for neratinib compared with the standard \\"watch and wait\\" strategies. Inclusion in the Reimbursement Code, however, was rejected by the Austrian social insurance companies in July 2020, and neratinib is now in the \\"No Box\\" for individual head physician reimbursement. Key Messages: We analysed the value of extended adjuvant therapy with neratinib in early HER2+/HR+ breast cancer based on current data and made recommendations for the evidence-based and economical use of neratinib in Austria. In particular, prognostic factors associated with an increased risk of recurrence following standard therapy are considered. Extended adjuvant therapy should be offered primarily to nodal-positive patients at surgery. For nodal-negative patients, neratinib therapy may be considered in case of large and/or inflammatory primary tumours (T3-4) without pathological complete response after neoadjuvant therapy. For all other patients, neratinib may be considered depending on additional risk factors on an individual basis that should be evaluated by interdisciplinary tumour conferences.","output":"Position Paper on the Value of Extended Adjuvant Therapy with Neratinib for Early HER2+/HR+ Breast Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The role of autoimmunity and other preexisting risky conditions in hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) to COVID-19 vaccines seems unclear. The aim of the study was to investigate the autoimmunity and preexisting risky conditions in HSRs to COVID-19 vaccines. METHODS: The patients aged 18 years with a history of HSR to CoronaVac or Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines within 24 h in 2 tertiary centers were assessed. The patients were divided according to the type of vaccine which they showed immediate-type (<4 h) HSR to (group A1 for CoronaVac and group B1 for Pfizer-BioNTech). Equal number of subjects who did not show HSR to two doses of either CoronaVac or Pfizer-BioNTech was recruited into the study as control groups (group A2 for CoronaVac and group B2 for Pfizer-BioNTech). The autologous serum skin test (ASST) was performed on patient and control groups. Later, the demographic, clinical, and laboratory features were compared between groups. RESULTS: A total number of 27 patients were included in the study. Subjects with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) were more frequent in group B1 than in group B2 (p:0.041). In addition to CSU, the presence of HSRs to drugs was higher in group A1 than in A2 (both p:0.007). The presence of autoimmunity and autoimmune diseases, positivity of antithyroid peroxidase antibody, and ASST were less in group A2 than in A1 (p:0.015, p:0.048, p:0.048, and p:0.037). Additionally, COVID-19 infection history was less in group A2 than in A1 (p:0.037).

This disease, which has morphed into a global pandemic, has mobilized outrageous outpouring action worldwide. Despite international and local media attention coupled with overwhelming new facts replete with misinformation and disinformation on COVID-19 from many channels;including interpersonal and social media, efforts to scale up control measures have yielded mixed results. The government and Kenyan media have reported several cases in which the public and leaders flouted these measures thus putting themselves at risk of contracting or spreading the virus. The overarching question is: does fear-arousing communication really matter in behaviour change particularly during a global pandemic of the magnitude of COVID-19? This qualitative study therefore examined the effects of COVID-19 messages on health behaviour change among residents living in the Municipality of Busia, one of the towns that have recorded the highest incidences of confirmed COVID-19 cases as informed by the Extended Parallel Process and Health Belief behavioural change models. Focus group discussions and in-depth interviews were carried out to establish threat and coping appraisal as a result of COVID-19 messages received from different sources. The study employed a risk behaviour diagnosis assessment that focused on two components of health risk messages, that is, threat and recommended response that addresses efficacy issues. This study found out that despite universal knowledge of COVID-19 and prevention methods, perceived threat especially perceived vulnerability to the virus was low due to misinformation, disinformation and disjointed communication.","output":"Fear-arousing persuasive communication and behaviour change: COVID-19 in Kenya"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Eight members of a big family with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia were admitted to First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China, from 28 January to 5 February 2020.

A new proposal is suggested in this article which requires only small changes in the Treaty and/or the Fiscal Compact, but a strong overhaul in secondary law, that is, the Stability and Growth Pact. The key ideas are to use net interest payments, as a share of GDP, as the new metric for defining debt sustainability rather than gross public debt. This would allow the adjustment of the rules to changing monetary environments, especially interest-rate levels, and changing differentials between interest rates and growth rates. This way, much more fiscal space would be generated both for higher-debt and lower-debt member states and the entire euro area.","output":"Searching for new fiscal rules in the euro area: a new proposal: European Journal of Economics and Economic Policies = Europa?ische Zeitschrift fu?r O?konomie und Wirtschaftspolitik"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus (CoV-2) is a rapidly spreading viral infection all over the world.

OBJECTIVES: To analyze the causes and risk factors of mortality in people admitted with complete acute traumatic spinal cord injury (ATSCI). SETTING: The study was performed at the Indian Spinal Injuries Centre, New Delhi. METHODS: Data between 2000 and 2016 were retrospectively collected from case records of people with ATSCI. Risk factors for mortality were examined using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Mortality rate in ATSCI admissions (n = 758) during the study period was 10%. Median (IQR) age of study participants was 34 (21) years with a range of 14C85 years. Respiratory complications, septicemia, and cardiovascular causes were responsible for 42%, 28, and 18% of deaths. Mortality rate in people with paraplegia and tetraplegia was 3% and 22%, respectively. The proportion surviving at 6 weeks was significantly different across people with paraplegia and people with high and low tetraplegia (p < 0.001). Greater age (OR (multivariable models) = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.01C1.06), associated injuries (OR = 2.42, 95% CI = 1.11C5.27), high tetraplegia (OR = 5.09, 95% CI = 2.21C11.72), low tetraplegia (OR = 4.84, 95% CI = 1.29C18.09), need for ventilator support (OR = 31.32, 95% CI = 14.92C65.35), septicemia (OR = 4.60, 95% CI = 1.05C20.07), respiratory complications (OR = 3.46, 95% CI = 1.63C7.33), and cardiovascular causes (OR = 39.03, 95% CI = 8.29C183.89) were significant risk factors associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: Respiratory complications, septicemia, and cardiovascular causes were the commonest causes of in-hospital mortality in people with complete ATSCI. Greater age, presence of associated injuries, tetraplegia, and ventilator support were risk factors significantly associated with mortality.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the admission and treatment of patients with coronary artery diseases (CADs) by examining coronary Cath labs activities in some centers of Iran during the COVID-19 period. METHODS: A retrospective, multi-center survey was conducted in four cites in Iran which participated in National Persian Registry Of CardioVascular diseasE (N-PROVE). Two periods of COVID-19 occurrence peak in Iran were compared with the same date in 2019. Information was collected on the number of diagnostic and therapeutic coronary catheterizations in both stable ischemic heart diseases (SIHDs) and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) settings. RESULTS: In the first peak of COVID-19 pandemic, coronary angiographies and angioplasties decreased by 37 and 38% compared to the same period in 2019, respectively. The most common indication for coronary angiography during this period was ACS [especially ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)];however, at the time of peak decrease, the SIHDs were the most. In the second peak of COVID-19 pandemic in Iran, 34% and 27% decrease in diagnostic and therapeutic coronary procedures were seen, respectively.

METHODS An online survey was conducted in June 2020 with adolescents and young adults (n = 498) aged 12-25 years. Participants had to answer questions on sleep, first retrospectively, referring to the time prior to the pandemic, and then referring to the time during the pandemic. RESULTS A pronounced shift towards later sleep combined with an increase in sleep duration was found during the pandemic. However, these changes in sleep habits were more pronounced in adolescents than in young adults and seem to occur mostly during weekdays compared to weekends. During the pandemic, teens also reported an improvement in daytime sleepiness and subjective sleep quality, while young adults reported an increase in sleep difficulties associated with sleep onset difficulties, nocturnal and early morning awakenings, and nightmares. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 related lockdown seems to have had a beneficial effect on sleep in adolescents. In young adults, benefits are not as obvious.

While case reports exist on proning patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) there are limited reports of the safety and efficacy in patients with durable left ventricular assist devices (LVAD). 3,4. Case Study Patient is a 76 year old Hispanic male with a past history for ischemic cardiomyopathy requiring HeartMate III (Abbott, IL) LVAD who presented to the emergency dept in January 2021 with two day history of dyspnea on exertion, chills and insomnia. He reports no known contact with COVID individuals. In the ED, noted severe hypoxia on arterial blood gas (ABG) pH 7.343, pO2 51.5. O2 saturation was 86% and chest x-ray revealed bilateral infiltrates suggestive of COVID 19 pneumonia. He was placed on a nonrebreather (NRB) mask and empiric antibiotics started. A nasopharyngeal swab was PCR positive for COVID19 and he was admitted for management. A repeat ABG on NRB had an increase of pO2 172. He was started on remdisivir and convalescent plasma. As part of management, was proned for 12 hours daily. The LVAD driveline was supported with pillows to avoid pressure and trauma. The LVAD controller was placed on the patient side for emergent access. Peripheral oxygenation saturation remained above 93% and his respiratory status continued to improve. He was cleared for discharge on day 6. No adverse events were noted on LVAD interrogation and he had no ill effects to the driveline. Discussion Prone positioning has been integral for patients with COVID 19 to decrease intubation with severe ARDS. Patients with a LVAD already have significant cardiac disease and thus important to avoid further decompensation with intubation, VA ECMO, and cardiac demise. Driveline infections can lead to high morbidity and mortality. Patients with COVID 19 are at a high risk for poor skin care and pressure injuries. Supporting the controller and driveline allowed for decrease in pressure injury and trauma at the driveline site. This allowed our ability to prone our patient and properly oxygenate which was tolerated. References 1. Coppo,A., Bellani, G., Winterton, D., DiPerro, M., Soria, A., et al. 2020.

Co-exposure to MWCNTs and heavy metal ions is common during water disposal. However, the hepatotoxicity of co-exposure to MWCNTs and lead ions for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) subjects has not been investigated. NAFLD mice were fed intragastrically with MWCNTs and lead acetate (PbAc). Combined administration of MWCNTs and PbAc significantly damaged the liver function, and aggravated the nonalcoholic steatohepatitis phenotype as well as the hepatic fibrosis and steatosis in NAFLD mice. Furthermore, MWCNTs and PbAc significantly induced apoptosis in primary hepatocytes isolated from NAFLD mice. Combined administration of MWCNTs and PbAc also resulted in hepatic lipid peroxidation by inducing antioxidant defense system dysfunction, and significantly enhanced the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines in NAFLD mice livers. Meanwhile, combined administration of MWCNTs and PbAc may exert its hepatotoxicity in the NAFLD via inhibiting the adenosine 5'-monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors  (PPAR) pathway. Taken together, we conclude that co-exposure to MWCNTs and PbAc can remarkably aggravate the hepatotoxicity in NAFLD mice via inhibiting the AMPK/PPAR pathway.

Due to the significance of self-regulated learning regarding students' learning success, the construct of metacognition also gained in importance, since corresponding skills are closely related to successful self-direction in learning. In our study, we focused on the learning strategy of concept mapping (CM), which is (1) directly related to beneficial effects on learning and retention performance, as well as (2) considered to cause constructive side-effects regarding metacognitive skills and, thus, self-regulated learning. To grasp CM's full potential in terms of improving cognition-related learning performance, however, appropriate training of this learning strategy seems to be required. This raised the question of whether and to what extent appropriate CM training is also necessary to improve the metacognitive skills of our participants (N = 73 university students of different majors) in terms of the accuracy of their judgments of learning (JOLs). Although we were able to show, in a previous study, that the CM-training intensity did not affect the absolute level of these JOLs, the results of our current study show that there is, nevertheless, a significant effect in terms of the JOLs' accuracy when considering their relationships to objective learning performance.

Source plasma (SP) is in great demand particularly due to a shortage of immunoglobulin. To better understand how to increase supply, we examined SP donor deferrals for the previous 3 years. STUDY DESIGN This is a description of donor deferrals at 255 plasma donation centers in the United States for April 1, 2017 to March 31, 2020. RESULTS A total of 4 587 923 events were evaluated for the 3-year period 2017-2020. There were 873 227 deferrals analyzed for 2017-2018, 1 765 582 in 2018-2019, and 1 949 114 for 2019-2020. The most common deferral each year was for unacceptable blood pressure (BP) or pulse which comprised 27.9%, 28.2%, and 28.3% of deferrals in 2017-2018, 2018-2019, and 2019-2020, respectively. The second most common cause of deferral was for unacceptable hematocrit which comprised 14.1% of deferrals in 2017-2018, and 16.0% in 2018-2019 and 2019-2020. The majority of these deferred donors had low hematocrits and were predominately (~80%) female. Deferral for unacceptable total protein comprised a smaller percentage (~4%) of deferrals. DISCUSSION Most donor deferrals were due to unacceptable screening results, particularly high BP, elevated pulse, low protein, and low hematocrit. Although rates of deferrals in other categories have been slightly increasing over time, they comprise a small percentage. Donor education regarding healthy lifestyle choices may improve overall donor health, decrease deferrals, and increase SP supply.","output":"Source plasma deferral trends: A 3-year analysis of 255 centers in the United States."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The term machine learning refers to a collection of tools used for identifying patterns in data.

However, there is an important hesitance towards the vaccine. The aim of this study is to evaluate the vaccination hesitance and main concerns towards the vaccine among surgeons. METHODS: An anonymous survey of 16 questions was sent to 138 Belgian surgeons before the start of vaccination in Belgium. The questions were divided into sections, evaluating demographics, COVID-19 test status and symptoms, the surgeon's opinion on the COVID-19 vaccination and their main concerns. RESULTS: Ninety-three out of 138 surgeons (67.4%) completed the survey: two-third of them were residents. Sixty-nine surgeons (74.2%) do want to get vaccinated. Forty-two surgeons (45.2%) feel like they do not have enough information about the vaccine. Residents feel significantly more underinformed than consultants (52.3% and 29.0%, respectively). Surgeons who feel to be well-informed are more willing to get vaccinated (92.2%) compared to those who feel to have a lack of information (52.4%). The main concerns among surgeons include effectiveness (26.9%), safety and side effects (19.4%) and organisation and vaccination strategy (12.9%). Twenty-five surgeons (26.9%) have no concerns at all. CONCLUSION: Most surgeons (74.2%) are ready for their COVID-19 vaccine. However, some of the surgeons are still doubtful about the vaccine. A lack of information plays a major role in their scepticism. A strong communication strategy is necessary to educate, reassure and motivate surgeons to get vaccinated.","output":"Are surgeons ready to get the COVID-19 vaccine?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increased demand for self-managed medication abortion in states with in-clinic restrictions or high infection rates during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic demonstrates the need for remote abortion care models.","output":"Demand for Self-Managed Online Telemedicine Abortion in the United States During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is no report on the serial interval (SI) of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Iran, the present report aims to estimate the SI and time-varying R of COVID-19 in western Iran. In this study, there were 1477 confirmed, probable and suspected cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 for Kermanshah from 22 February to 9 April. The close contacts of the confirmed cases were identified using telephone follow up of patients and their contacts. The SI distribution was used as an alternative. We fitted different models using the clinical onset dates of patients with their close contact (infectorCinfectee). Also, we applied a serial interval from sample approach as a Bayesian methodology for estimating reproduction number. From 22 February to 29 March, 247 COVID-19 cases were confirmed by RT-PCR. Close contact between 21 patients (21 infectorCinfectee pairs), including 12 primary cases and 21 secondary cases, was confirmed. The mean and standard deviation of the SI were estimated as 5.71 and 3.89 days. The R varied from 0.79 to 1.88 for a 7-day time-lapse and ranged from 0.92 to 1.64 for a 14-day time-lapse on raw data. Also, the R varied from 0.83 to 1.84 for 7-day time-lapse and from 0.95 to 1.54 for a 14-day time-lapse using moving average data, respectively.

In this case report, we describe the first known instance of a patient being treated with an inhibitor of programmed death-ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1, a checkpoint inhibitor) who develops acute tubulointerstitial nephritis after contracting the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Presenting concerns of the patient: A 62-year-old patient, on immunotherapy treatment for stage 4 squamous cell carcinoma, presents to the emergency department with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection. Severe acute kidney injury is discovered with electrolyte imbalances requiring urgent dialysis initiation. Further testing reveals that the patient has contracted the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Diagnosis: A kidney biopsy was performed and was compatible with acute tubulointerstitial nephritis. Interventions: The patient was treated with high dose corticosteroid therapy followed by progressive tapering. Outcomes: Rapid and sustained normalization of kidney function was achieved after completion of the steroid course. Novel findings: We hypothesize that the viral infection along with checkpoint inhibitor use has created a proinflammatory environment which led to a loss of self-tolerance to renal parenchyma.

Thus, the patients choice and use of these MPSs is a known risk factor for the development of MK. It is then critical to determine the efficacy of popular MPSs against ubiquitous ocular microorganisms. Therefore, we compare the efficacy of nine major MPSs on the global market against four different microorganism species, and with four different common contact lenses. In accordance with International Standards Organization protocol 14729 and 18259, the microorganisms were inoculated into each MPS with and without contact lenses, and held for the manufacturers disinfection time, 24 h, and 7 days after challenge with Serratia marcescens or Fusarium spp. Plates were incubated for 2C7 days and plate counts were conducted to determine the number of surviving microorganisms. The majority of MPSs demonstrated significantly higher disinfection efficacies without contact lenses. Broadly, among the microorganisms tested, the OPTI-FREE products (Puremoist, Express, and Replenish) maintained the highest disinfection efficacies at the manufacturers stated disinfection time when paired with any contact lens, compared with other MPSs.

These variants harboring diverse mutations in the gene encoding the spike protein raise important concerns about their immune evasion potential. Here, we isolated infectious B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 strains from acutely infected individuals. We examined sensitivity of the two variants to SARS-CoV-2 antibodies present in sera and nasal swabs from individuals infected with previously circulating strains or who were recently vaccinated, in comparison with a D614G reference virus. We utilized a new rapid neutralization assay, based on reporter cells that become positive for GFP after overnight infection. Sera from 58 convalescent individuals collected up to 9 months after symptoms, similarly neutralized B.1.1.7 and D614G. In contrast, after 9 months, convalescent sera had a mean sixfold reduction in neutralizing titers, and 40% of the samples lacked any activity against B.1.351. Sera from 19 individuals vaccinated twice with Pfizer Cominarty, longitudinally tested up to 6 weeks after vaccination, were similarly potent against B.1.1.7 but less efficacious against B.1.351, when compared to D614G. Neutralizing titers increased after the second vaccine dose, but remained 14-fold lower against B.1.351. In contrast, sera from convalescent or vaccinated individuals similarly bound the three spike proteins in a flow cytometry-based serological assay. Neutralizing antibodies were rarely detected in nasal swabs from vaccinees. Thus, faster-spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants acquired a partial resistance to neutralizing antibodies generated by natural infection or vaccination, which was most frequently detected in individuals with low antibody levels.

Here, we examine ethnocentric orientations in Austria, Poland, Spain and Czech Republic in spring 2020, as the spread of SARS-CoV2 was on the rise and lockdown measures were introduced throughout Europe. Critically, these countries were affected differentially by the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 mortality. 333 participants were asked to complete questionnaires assessing identification with all humanity, attachment style, and perceived vulnerability to disease at the beginning and end of the first European curfews. Additionally, they answered questions regarding their social interactions and personal consequences of the crisis. To investigate the relationship between these variables and ethnocentrism, we train two types of machine-learning models to predict ethnocentrism based on the complex interplay of interpersonal variables (psychological traits, interpersonal interactions) and environmental conditions (economic threats, local mortality, viral spread, lockdown measures).We find that identification with all humanity in relation to narrower ingroups and perceived infectability did not systematically change over the course of the first European lockdowns, whereas we observe a slight decrease in germ aversion. Importantly, none of our models could predict any inter-individual differences in identification with narrower versus wider groups based on environmental, psychological, social, and demographic variables. Our results indicate that environmental variables connected to pathogenic and economic threat, perceived vulnerability and other psychosocial variables, all do not contribute to predicting ethnocentric orientations.Cumulatively, our results do not support the hypothesis that higher pathogenic and environmental threat predicts identification with narrower ingroups.Our findings are discussed in the context of the open debate related to the influence of harsh environments on group psychology, and might inspire further research on this topic during this unprecedented global pandemic.","output":"Dangers and Strangers: Pathogenic threat, fear, and perceived vulnerability do not predict ethnocentric orientations during the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health services provided through the telecommunications system aim to improve the populations health and well-being.

Estimation results showed that there were thresholds for telehealth provision: The demand for telehealth service usually began when the provision of telecommunication accessibility reached 50%, the proportion of elders exceeded 10%, or the proportion of health spending occupied more than 3C5% of the gross domestic product (GDP); the slope of each variable seemed to correspond with an increase in demand for such a provision. A growing number of individuals in OECD countries are now readily served by telehealth systems under the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings could be regarded as a model for other countries for implementing the necessary infrastructure early on when any of these parameters reaches its threshold. Moreover, telehealth applied in developing countries could be elevated for wider populations to access basic health services and for the remote delivery of health care.

In our qualitative study on students' and teachers' views, we identify potential enablers and drivers as well as barriers and challenges to undergraduate medical education under lockdown. In summer 2020, we conducted six focus group interviews to investigate medical students' and teachers' perspectives, experiences and attitudes.

Only few studies, however, have examined to which degree such variation will affect markers of cardiometabolic health. Therefore, the primary aim of this study is to examine if markers of cardiometabolic health differ between different days of the week in adolescents. METHODS: This cross-sectional school-based study included up to 581 participants, 11-17 years old. Markers of metabolic health were insulin, glucose, triglyceride, HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and blood pressure. Linear mixed regression modelling was used to examine the cardiometabolic profile across weekdays. RESULTS: Significant declining trends were observed across the week in adolescents' levels of cardiometabolic health markers. Lower levels of insulin (16.1%), glucose (2.6%) and triglyceride (24.7%) were observed on Fridays compared to Mondays (p &#8804; 0.006). Gradual improvement in measurement profiles across weekdays was less apparent for HDL-C, LDL-C, systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure (P &#8805; 0.06). Analyses stratified by sex suggested a more noticeable pattern of gradual improvement across weekdays in boys than in girls. CONCLUSION: Significantly lower levels of insulin, glucose and triglyceride were observed in adolescents on Fridays compared to Mondays. However, when sex specific analyses were performed significant profile variations were only observed across the week in boys. More research is needed to better understand which behavioral factors in particular seem to influence weekly variation in markers of cardiometabolic health - especially since such variation potentially will have an impact on how assessments of markers of cardiometabolic health optimally should be planned, standardized and carried out, both in research and in medical practice.","output":"Weekly variation in markers of cardiometabolic health - the possible effect of weekend behavior - a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Four of five different monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that have been crystallized in complex with the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) have remarkably similar primary and secondary loop structures at the heavy chain complementarity-determining regions (HCDR) 1 and 2 All these reports give a structural basis for the deceptively difficult problem of accurate peptidomimetic loop mimic design","output":"Striking Similarities between CDRs in Some mAbs That Neutralize COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS Drug-coated balloons (DCBs) for femoropopliteal interventions have not been tested against each other.

METHODS AND RESULTS Within a prospective, multicentre, non-inferiority, clinical trial 414 patients with symptomatic femoropopliteal lesions (Rutherford classification 2-4) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to endovascular treatment with either high- or low-dose DCB after stratification for lesion length. Primary efficacy and safety endpoints comprised primary patency and freedom from major adverse events (i.e. device and procedure-related deaths through 1 month, major amputations, and clinically driven target lesion revascularization through 12 months). We set a non-inferiority margin of -10% at 12 months. Total occlusions were observed frequently (>40%) and provisional stenting was performed in every fourth intervention. Non-inferiority was determined for both primary efficacy and safety endpoints at 12 months. Primary patency was 81.5% in the high-dose and 83.0% in low-dose DCB group {difference: 1.5% [lower bound of the 90% two-sided confidence interval (CI) -5.2%]; Pnon-inferiority < 0.01}.

A growing body of literature describes population-level SARS-CoV-2 exposure, but studies of antibody seroprevalence within school systems are critically lacking, hampering evidence-based discussions on school reopenings. The Lake Central School Corporation (LCSC), a public school system in suburban Indiana, USA, assessed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in its staff and identified correlations between seropositivity and subjective histories and demographics. METHODS: This study is a cross-sectional, population-based analysis of the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in LCSC staff measured in July 2020. We tested for seroprevalence with the Abbott Alinity? SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody test. The primary outcome was the total seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2, and secondary outcomes included trends of antibody presence in relation to baseline attributes. FINDINGS: 753 participants representative of the staff at large were enrolled. 22 participants (29%, 95% CI: 18% C 44%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Correcting for test performance parameters, the seroprevalence is estimated at 17% (90% Credible Interval: 027% C 33%). Multivariable logistic regression including mask wearing, travel history, symptom history, and contact history revealed a 48-fold increase in the odds of seropositivity if an individual previously tested positive for COVID-19 (OR: 48.2, 95% CI: 4 C 600). Amongst individuals with no previous positive test, exposure to a person diagnosed with COVID-19 increased the odds of seropositivity by 7-fold (OR: 6.5, 95% CI: 2.06 C 18.9). INTERPRETATION: Assuming the presence of antibodies is associated with immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection, these results demonstrate a broad lack of herd immunity amongst the school corporations staff irrespective of employment role or location.

METHODS A prospective mono-centric observational cohort study of PTS patients with chronic symptomatic ilio-femoral venous obstructive lesions referred for endovascular treatment was conducted from March 2012 to April 2016. Procedure consisted in recanalization, pre-dilation and self-expandable stenting of stenotic or occluded iliac and/or femoral veins. Severity of PTS, quality-of-life and treatment outcomes were assessed using Villalta scale and Chronic Venous Insufficiency Questionnaire (CIVIQ-20) at baseline and 3 months after the procedure. Imaging follow-up was based on duplex ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT). RESULTS Twenty-one patients (11 females, 10 males; median age, 41 years; range, 32-60) were included. Recanalization and stenting was successfully accomplished in all prime procedures, 4 patients benefitted from an additional procedure. Immediate technical success rate was 96% considering 25 procedures, performed without any complications. Median follow-up was 18 months (range, 6-30 months) with a 90.5% stent patency rate. Villalta score significantly decreased from baseline compared with 3 months after the procedure [14 (range, 11-22) and 5 (range, 1-10), respectively, P<0.0001], showing a significant decrease in the severity of PTS.

A portable screening device that can be accessed remotely is necessary to overcome restrictions in public places, especially places which are vital for healthcare such as hospitals. One of the most common screening devices used in the hospital is arguably ECG. Recent technology development allows the development of wireless-based ECG supported by cloud platforms. Nevertheless, wireless-based Holter monitor ECG is quite rare. Most previous studies showed the usage of regular ECG with a short record time. Moreover, none of the ECG Holter monitors currently available on the market are equipped with additional PPG sensor. Therefore, in this paper, we presented the design and development process of an integrated software application for 3 channels Holter monitor ECG and PPG. We used Android Studio, Python Flask, and Microsoft Azure to develop this integrated system. The implemented system has met our initial requirements that includes successfully sending data from a Holter device into a patient smartphone, uploading the data automatically into a cloud server, displaying the ECG data from the database into a web application made for physicians, and sending a warning message through SMS automatically when arrhythmia is detected in the server-side algorithm. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Software development of 3 channels holter for arrhythmia patient monitoring"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of large-scale human mobility patterns obtained from a passive Wi-Fi tracking system, deployed across different location typologies.

With these questionnaire elements, a pilot experiment was conducted to test the reliability, and reliability analysis was conducted. The scale reliability was checked using Cronbachs alpha coefficient. Bartletts test of sphericity, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure, and factor analysis were performed to test whether the items would constitute appropriate questionnaire items for the survey.

Also, age and multimorbidity might be confounders. No sufficient data are available to demonstrate their independent role. We designed a cross-sectional, observational, multicenter, nationwide survey in Italy to verify whether renin-angiotensin system inhibitors are related to COVID-19 severe outcomes. We analyzed information from Italian patients diagnosed with COVID-19, admitted in 26 hospitals. One thousand five hundred ninety-one charts (male, 64.1%; 660.4 years) were recorded. At least 1 preexisting condition was observed in 73.4% of patients, with hypertension being the most represented (54.9%). One hundred eighty-eight deaths were recorded (11.8%; mean age, 79.60.9 years). In nonsurvivors, older age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, coronary artery diseases, and heart failure were more represented than in survivors. The Charlson Comorbidity Index was significantly higher in nonsurvivors compared with survivors (4.30.15 versus 2.60.05; P<0.001). ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors, diuretics, and -blockers were more frequently used in nonsurvivors than in survivors.

Our objective was to describe trends (1990 to 2019) in prevalence and attributable burden of five modifiable risk factors and related metabolic risk factors in Brazil and its states. METHODS: In Global Burden of Disease 2019 analyses, we described trends in prevalence of modifiable risk factors and their metabolic mediators as percentage change in Summary Exposure Value (SEV). We estimated deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to the risk factors. RESULTS: Age-adjusted exposures to alcohol [41.0%, Uncertainty Interval (UI): 24.2 - 63.4], red meat (61.2%, UI: 42.4-92.3), low physical activity (3.9%, UI: -5-17.5) and ambient particulate matter pollution (3.3%, UI: -48.9-128.0) have worsened. Those for smoking (-51.4%, UI: -54.7- - 47.8), diet low in fruits (-28.1%, UI: -39.1- -18.7) and vegetables (-19.6%, UI: -32.7 - -8.7), and household air pollution (-85.3%, UI: -92.9- -74.3) have improved. All mediating metabolic risk factors, except high blood pressure (0.7%, UI: -6.9-8.3), have worsened: BMI (110.2%, UI: 78.6-161.7), hyperglycemia (15.1%, UI: 9.3-21.2), kidney dysfunction (12.0%, UI: 8.4-17.2), and high LDL-c (11.8%, UI: 6.9-17.2). CONCLUSIONS: A variable pattern of progress and failure in controlling modifiable risk factors has been accompanied by major worsening in most metabolic risk factors. The mixed success in public health measures to control modifiable risk factors for NCDs, when gauged by the related trends in metabolic risk factors, alert to the need for stronger actions to control NCDs in the future.","output":"Exposure to and Burden of Major Non-Communicable Disease Risk Factors in Brazil and its States, 1990-2019: The Global Burden of Disease Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During this pandemic period, emergency departments are overwhelmed by patients who present at admission with suspected symptoms of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Commercially available vaccines are only partially effective in protection against PRRSV. Moreover, modified live vaccines may allow virus shedding, and could revert generating virulent phenotypes. Therefore, new efficient vaccines are required. Vaccines based on recombinant virus genomes (virus vectored vaccines) against PRRSV could represent a safe alternative for the generation of modified live vaccines. In this paper, current vectored vaccines to protect against PRRSV are revised, including those based on pseudorabies virus, poxvirus, adenovirus, and virus replicons. Special attention has been provided to the use of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) as vector for the expression of PRRSV antigens. This vector has the capability of expressing high levels of heterologous genes, is a potent interferon- inducer, and presents antigens in mucosal surfaces, eliciting both secretory and systemic immunity. A TGEV derived vector (rTGEV) was generated, expressing PRRSV wild type or modified GP5 and M proteins, described as the main inducers of neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune response, respectively. Protection experiments showed that vaccinated animals developed a faster and stronger humoral immune response than the non-vaccinated ones. Partial protection in challenged animals was observed, as vaccinated pigs showed decreased lung damage when compared with the non-vaccinated ones. Nevertheless, the level of neutralizing antibodies was low, what may explain the limited protection observed.

Methods: We collected contact tracing data in a municipality in Hubei province during the full outbreak period of COVID-19. The exposure periods were inferred from the history of travel in Wuhan and/or history of exposure to confirmed cases. The incubation periods were estimated using parametric accelerated failure time models accounting for interval censoring of exposures. Results: The incubation period of COVID-19 follows a Weibull distribution and has a median of 5.8 days with a bootstrap 95% CI: 5.4C6.7 days. Of the symptomatic cases, 95% showed symptoms by 14.3 days (95% CI: 13.0C15.7), and 99% showed symptoms by 18.7 days (95% CI: 16.7C20.9). The incubation periods were not found significantly different between male and female. Elderly cases had significant longer incubation periods than young age cases (HR 1.49 with 95% CI: 1.09C2.05).

Individuals may use cannabis to manage pain, as well as to relieve opioid withdrawal symptoms, though it does not directly treat opioid use disorder. It is thus unclear whether RCLs are an effective policy tool to reduce adverse opioid-related health outcomes. In this study, we examine the impact of RCLs on a key opioid-related adverse health outcome: opioid-related emergency department (ED) visit rates. We estimate event study models using nearly comprehensive ED data from 29 states from 2011 to 2017.

This study aimed to evaluate the knowledge and attitudes about key end-of-life issues and principles of good death among doctors in clinical settings. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among allopathic medical doctors working in in-ward clinical settings of tertiary care hospitals in Sri Lanka using a self-administered questionnaire with open- and close-ended questions as well as hypothetical clinical scenarios. Univariate and logistic regression analysis were used to identify the independent factors associated with knowledge and attitudes. RESULTS: Of the responders who had not been a caregiver for a terminally ill relative (n = 390), 57.9% were men with a mean age of 36.5 years (SD = 8.2). Compared to undergraduate (65.6%; n = 256), only 27.4% (n = 107) had received end-of-life care training at postgraduate level. Only 65.9% of doctors favoured disclosing terminal prognosis to patients; 27.7% of doctors were aware of advance directives; 14.6% were aware of the correct time of death when certifying brain death; 70.3% felt more comfortable in withholding than withdrawing life-sustaining treatment; 61.3% were aware of do-not-attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation (DNACPR) decisions while 26.7% felt reluctant to administer it; 15.1% thought that all life-sustaining therapy should be withdrawn with a DNACPR decision; and only17.9% were able to name the four principles of medical ethics while 57.9% could not name a single. Participants scored a mean of 9.2 (SD = 3.9) of a maximum 14 points when tested on principles of a good death. Doctors who had pursued postgraduate studies were more likely to be aware of breaking bad news (adjusted-Odds-Ratio:1.99; 95%CI = 1.19C3.32), advance directives (adjusted-OR: 4.15; 95%CI = 2.49C6.94), aware of certifying the correct time of death (adjusted-OR:2.37; 95%CI = 1.33C4.2) and less reluctant to make DNACPR decisions (adjusted-OR:1.74; 95%CI = 1.13C2.68).

This consensus has been based on results obtained in middle-aged populations, whereas only few data exist for the oldest and most frail adults such as nursing home residents (NH-Res) that is, the population most vulnerable to develop severe forms of COVID-19. In this study, we studied the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG(S) level of NH-Res and healthcare workers (HCWs) with or without a history of COVID-19 infection taking into account the time since immunization (COVID-19 and/or vaccination). 654 subjects were analyzed: 397 NH-Res (median age 88, IQR 82-93 years, 75% women) and 257 Health Care Workers (HCWs, median 46, IQR 38-54 years, 81% women). NH-Res and HCWs were classified in one of the following 3 groups: No-COVID history and 2 vaccine shots (COV-NO/2VACC); Yes-COVID history and 1 (COV-YES/1VACC) or 2 (COV-YES/2VACC) vaccine injections. The time-related decrease in IgG (S) in subjects without COVID-19 history, SARS-COV-2 serology would be negative in HCWs approximately 220 days and in residents 180 days after vaccination. This time-related decrease was much slower in those with history of COVID. NH-Res belonging into the COV-NO/2VACC and the COV-YES/1VACC groups showed lower IgG (S) levels than the same groups of HCWs (for both groups, p<0.0001), whereas in the group COV-YES/2VACC, IgG (S) levels were similar in NH-Res and HCWs (p=0.88). These results remained unchanged after adjustment for age and duration since immunization. Thus, in NH-Res, 2 vaccine shots were associated with a more pronounced immune response, whereas in HCWs, 1 or 2 vaccine shots in patients with COVID-19 history did make any difference. These results indicate significant differences in mRNA vaccination between NH-Res and middle-aged controls, and could contribute to the specification of vaccine policy in this very old, frail population.","output":"Comparative analysis of post-vaccination anti-spike IgG antibodies in old Nursing Home Residents and in middle-aged Healthcare workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: the new coronavirus (COVID-19) disease has been causing economic and health system impacts worldwide, triggering humanitarian crises in vulnerable regions, marked by high mortality rates of the disease. Brazil has been suffering an increase in the number of cases, characteristic of the formation of a second wave, with great epidemiological differences observed in the most diverse regions of the country. Many studies illustrate the behaviour of COVID-19 in the state of S?o Paulo, but there are gaps in the scientific literature on the epidemiology of COVID-19 in municipalities of the S?o Paulo metropolitan region that constitute an important industrial pole in Latin America, such as the region of Grande ABC. OBJECTIVE: to evaluate mortality and lethality trends of COVID-19 during the period March 2020 to July 2021, in municipalities on region of Grande ABC, metropolitan region of S?o Paulo, Brazil, divided into two periods (March to November 2020 and December to July 2021. METHODS: we conducted an ecological time series study with population data from the Brazilian Ministry of Health. We collected the number of cases and deaths confirmed for COVID-19 in the municipalities that make up the region of Grande ABC (Diadema, Mau, Rio Grande da Serra, Ribeir?o Pires, Santo Andr, S?o Bernardo do Campo, and S?o Caetano do Sul) from March 2020 to July 2021. Prais-Winsten linear regression was performed, and the percentage of daily change was calculated. Differences were considered significant when p<0.05. RESULTS: in region of Grande ABC, in the period analysed, 217,264 cases and 10,004 deaths of COVID-19 were recorded. Although the mortality rate remained stationary during the first wave (March to November 2020) and the second wave (December 2020 to July 2021); lethality transitioned from decreasing during the first wave to increasing during the second wave, with rates varying according to municipality. CONCLUSION: trend analyses in incidence, mortality, and lethality rates assist in understanding the behaviour of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the region known as Grande ABC.

This study aims to assess how a simple, cost-effective 3D-printed face mask ear protectors (EP) attachment may decrease discomfort, increase compliance, and improve fit in an academic institutions Ophthalmology department. METHODS: Face mask EPs were distributed to patients and providers in the Ophthalmology department. A validated questionnaire was administered before and 2 weeks after EP usage. The survey included questions on demographics and frequency of mask usage during a spectrum of activities. Descriptive statistics were performed with Fischers t test. RESULTS: Post-EP responses demonstrated an increased likelihood of mask usage across all activities, although not statistically significant. The greatest change was during outdoor activities, with a 14.3% increase in highest utilization. Post-EP, all subjects were very likely to wear masks while shopping and 91.7% while in the workplace. EP usage decreased the number of noncompliant individuals while spending time with friends and family by 93.3%. Almost no subjects reported mask removal of >15 times per hour post-EP. The increase in mask compliance was greatest for low mask utilizers. 91.9% reported improved comfort, 91.9% reported improved fit, and 81.6% reported increased mask usage. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that simple cost-effective 3D-printed ear protectors may improve fit, comfort, and overall mask compliance.

Vulnerable populations, such as those living in poverty, experiencing homelessness, or who use drugs, are particularly susceptible to becoming infected with COVID-19 and often have limited access to protective supplies, such as masks and hand sanitizer. Our aim was to understand public opinion on increasing the allocation of COVID-19 prevention resources to vulnerable populations. METHODS: Data were from an online survey of 680 United States adults. Participants' opinions on the allocation of COVID-19 prevention resources to people with low income, experiencing homelessness, or who use drugs were assessed using a five-item Likert scale. We examined the prevalence of these opinions and their relationship to sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 beliefs, and drug-related experiences. RESULTS: Most participants supported increasing resources for individuals with low incomes (79.6%) and experiencing homelessness (74.6%), while a minority supported increasing resources for people who use drugs (33.5%). Politically conservative participants were less likely to support increasing resources for all three populations than those who were politically liberal. Skepticism about the severity of COVID-19 was also associated with less support for increasing resources across groups. DISCUSSION: Our results demonstrate that people who use drugs continue to be stigmatized in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in popular opinion not supporting people who use drugs with potentially lifesaving resources. Overcoming this stigma is essential to prevent COVID-19 among people who use drugs, a population which experiences elevated risk of COVID-19 infection.","output":"Political partisanship and stigma against people who use drugs in opinions about allocating COVID-19 prevention resources to vulnerable populations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biometrics and biometric-enabled decision support systems (DSS) have become a mandatory part of complex dynamic systems such as security checkpoints, personal health monitoring systems, autonomous robots, and epidemiological surveillance.

This paper offers a complete taxonomy of the R-T-B causal performance regulators for the biometric-enabled DSS. The proposed novel taxonomy links the R-T-B assessment to the causal inference mechanism for reasoning in decision making. Practical details of the R-T-B assessment in the DSS are demonstrated using the experiments of assessing the trust in synthetic biometric and the risk of bias in face biometrics.

Histopathological slides can be digitalized and their analysis can then be supported by computer algorithms. For this purpose, computer algorithms (neural networks) need to be trained to detect the desired tissue type (e.g., pancreatic cancer). However, raw training data often contain many different tissue types. Here we show a preprocessing step using two communicators that sort unfitting tissue tiles into a new dataset class. Using the improved dataset neural networks distinguished pancreatic cancer from other tissue types on digitalized histopathological slides including lymph node metastases. ABSTRACT: Pancreatic cancer is a fatal malignancy with poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Early detection in primary and secondary locations is critical, but fraught with challenges. While digital pathology can assist with the classification of histopathological images, the training of such networks always relies on a ground truth, which is frequently compromised as tissue sections contain several types of tissue entities. Here we show that pancreatic cancer can be detected on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) sections by convolutional neural networks using deep transfer learning. To improve the ground truth, we describe a preprocessing data clean-up process using two communicators that were generated through existing and new datasets. Specifically, the communicators moved image tiles containing adipose tissue and background to a new data class. Hence, the original dataset exhibited improved labeling and, consequently, a higher ground truth accuracy. Deep transfer learning of a ResNet18 network resulted in a five-class accuracy of about 94% on test data images. The network was validated with independent tissue sections composed of healthy pancreatic tissue, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and pancreatic cancer lymph node metastases. The screening of different models and hyperparameter fine tuning were performed to optimize the performance with the independent tissue sections. Taken together, we introduce a step of data preprocessing via communicators as a means of improving the ground truth during deep transfer learning and hyperparameter tuning to identify pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma primary tumors and metastases in histological tissue sections.","output":"Communicator-Driven Data Preprocessing Improves Deep Transfer Learning of Histopathological Prediction of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) is usually used in epidemiological studies to assess food consumption.

The CNN model is used to help in the early diagnosis of the virus using chest X-ray images, as it is one of the fastest and most cost-effective ways of diagnosing the disease. We proposed two convolutional neural networks (CNN) models, which were trained using two different datasets. The first model was trained for binary classification with one of the datasets that only included pneumonia cases and normal chest X-ray images. The second model made use of the knowledge learned by the first model using transfer learning and trained for 3 class classifications on COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal cases based on the second dataset that included chest X-ray (CXR) images.

These environmental disturbances during early life potentially alter the incidence of inflammatory disorders as well as priming of immune responses. Infection with the helminth Schistosoma mansoni is widely studied for its ability to alter immune responsiveness, and associated with variations in co-infection, allergy, and vaccine efficacy in endemic populations. OBJECTIVE Exposure to maternal schistosomiasis during early life, even without transmission of infection, can result in priming effects on offspring immune responses to bystander antigenic challenges as relate to allergic responsiveness and vaccination, with this work seeking to clarify further effects and underlying immunological imprinting. METHODS Here, we combine a chronic maternal schistosomiasis infection model with a thorough analysis of subsequent offspring immune responses to allergy and vaccination models, including viral challenge and steady state changes to immune cell compartments. RESULTS We demonstrate that maternal schistosomiasis alters CD4+ responses during allergic sensitization and challenge, in a skewed IL-4/B-cell-dominant response to antigenic challenge associated with limited inflammatory response. Beyond that, we uncover previously unidentified alterations to CD8+ T cell responses during immunization, dependent upon vaccine formulation, that have functional impact upon the efficacy of vaccination against viral infection in a murine Hepatitis B virus model. CONCLUSION Alongside steady-state modifications to CD4+ T cell polarization and B cell priming, we trace these modified CD8+ responses to an altered dendritic cell phenotype sustained into adulthood, providing evidence for complex priming effects imparted by infection via fetomaternal crosstalk.","output":"Fetomaternal immune crosstalk modifies T cell priming through sustained changes to DC function."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Social isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic has been identified as a risk factor of several mental disorders.

Dental practices were instructed to manage patients remotely with advice, analgesics and antibiotics, where appropriate. Aim To describe the impact of the policy to restrict dental access on antibiotic prescribing. Methods NHS Business Services Authority 2018-2020 data for England were analysed to describe national and regional trends in dental antibiotic use. Results Antibiotic prescribing in April to July 2020 was 25% higher than April to July 2019, with a peak in June 2020. Some regions experienced greater increases and for longer periods than others. The increase was highest in London (60%) and lowest in the South West (10%). East of England had the highest rate of dental antibiotic prescriptions per 1,000 of the population every month over the study period (April to July 2020). Conclusion Restricted access to dental care due to COVID-19 resulted in greatly increased dental antibiotic prescribing, against an otherwise downward trend. As dental care adapts to the COVID-19 era, it is important to ensure access for all to high-quality urgent dental care. Understanding the reasons for variation will help to optimise the use of antibiotics in the future.","output":"How did COVID-19 impact on dental antibiotic prescribing across England?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019, the novel SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has resulted in millions of cases and more than 200 000 deaths worldwide. The clinical course among nonpregnant women has been described, but data about potential risks for women and their fetus remain scarce. The SARS and MERS epidemics were responsible for miscarriages, adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes, and maternal deaths. For COVID-19 infection, only nine cases of maternal death have been reported as of 22 April 2020, and pregnant women seem to develop the same clinical presentation as the general population. However, severe maternal cases, as well as prematurity, fetal distress, and stillbirth among newborns have been reported. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic greatly impacts prenatal management and surveillance and raise the need for clear unanimous guidelines. In this narrative review, we describe the current knowledge about coronaviruses (SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2) risks and consequences on pregnancies, and we summarize available current candidate therapeutic options for pregnant women.

We therefore analysed outcome beyond 90 days in ICU patients with COVID-19, with special focus on differences between men and women. METHODS: We identified all patient  18 years with COVID-19 admitted between March 6 and June 30, 2020, in the Swedish Intensive Care Registry. Patients were followed until death or study end-point October 22, 2020. Association with patient sex and mortality, in addition to clinical variables, was estimated using Cox regression. We also performed a logistic regression model estimating factors associated with 90-day mortality. RESULTS: In total, 2354 patients with COVID-19 were included. Four patients were still in the ICU at study end-point. Median follow-up time was 183 days. Mortality at 90-days was 26.9%, 23.4% in women and 28.2% in men. After 90 days until end of follow-up, only 11 deaths occurred. On multivariable Cox regression analysis, male sex (HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.06C1.54) remained significantly associated with mortality even after adjustments. Additionally, age, COPD/asthma, immune deficiency, malignancy, SAPS3 and admission month were associated with mortality. The logistic regression model of 90-day mortality showed almost identical results.

However, linking these disruptions to effects on health outcomes has been difficult due to the lack of reliable, up-to-date health outcomes data. We identified all dialysis patients under a statewide health insurance program in Rajasthan, India (N = 2110), and conducted surveys to examine the effects of the lockdown on non-COVID care access and health outcomes. Post-lockdown mortality was our primary outcome and morbidity and hospitalization were secondary outcomes. 63% of patients experienced a disruption to their care. Transport barriers, hospital service disruptions, and difficulty obtaining medicines were the most common causes. We compared monthly mortality in the four months after the lockdown with pre-lockdown mortality trends, as well as with mortality trends for a similar cohort in the previous year. Mortality in May 2020, after a month of exposure to the lockdown, was 1.70 percentage points (95% CI 0.01C0.03) or 64% higher than in March 2020 and total excess mortality between April and July was estimated to be 22%. A 1SD increase in an index of care disruptions was associated with a 0.17SD (95% CI 0.13C0.22) increase in a morbidity index, a 3.1 percentage point (95% CI 0.012C0.051) increase in hospitalization, and a 2.1 percentage point (95% CI 0.00C0.04) increase in probability of death between May and July.

METHODS AND RESULTS: From February to April 2020, we prospectively studied a cohort of 96 participants comprising 47 consecutive patients with CAD and acute SARS-CoV-2 infection (CAD + SARS-CoV-2), 19 CAD patients without infections, and 30 healthy controls. Clinical assessment included blood sampling, echocardiography, and electrocardiography within 12 h of admission. Respiratory failure was stratified by the Horovitz Index (HI) as moderately/severely impaired when HI &#8804;200 mmHg. The clinical endpoint (EP) was defined as HI &#8804;200 mmHg with subsequent mechanical ventilation within a follow-up of 30 days. The numbers of CD14dimCD16+ non-classical monocytes in peripheral blood were remarkably low in CAD + SARS-CoV-2 compared with CAD patients without infection and healthy controls (P < 0.0001). Moreover, these CD14dimCD16 monocytes showed decreased expression of established markers of adhesion, migration, and T-cell activation (CD54, CD62L, CX3CR1, CD80, and HLA-DR). Decreased numbers of CD14dimCD16+ monocytes were associated with the occurrence of EP. Kaplan-Meier curves illustrate that CAD + SARS-CoV-2 patients with numbers below the median of CD14dimCD16+ monocytes (median 1443 cells/mL) reached EP significantly more often compared to patients with numbers above the median (log-rank 5.03, P = 0.025). CONCLUSION: Decreased numbers of CD14dimCD16+ monocytes are associated with rapidly progressive respiratory failure in CAD + SARS-CoV-2 patients. Intensified risk assessments comprising monocyte sub- and phenotypes may help to identify patients at risk for respiratory failure.","output":"Numbers and phenotype of non-classical CD14dimCD16+ monocytes are predictors of adverse clinical outcome in patients with coronary artery disease and severe SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The mechanisms underlying low intensity ultrasound (LIUS) mediated suppression of inflammation and tumorigenesis remain poorly determined. Methods: We used microarray datasets from NCBI GEO Dataset databases and conducted a comprehensive data mining analyses, where we studied the gene expression of 299 cell death regulators that regulate 13 different cell death types (cell death regulatome) in cells treated with LIUS. Results: We made the following findings: (1) LIUS exerts a profound effect on the expression of cell death regulatome in cancer cells and non-cancer cells. Of note, LIUS has the tendency to downregulate the gene expression of cell death regulators in non-cancer cells. Most of the cell death regulator genes downregulated by LIUS in non-cancer cells are responsible for mediating inflammatory signaling pathways; (2) LIUS activates different cell death transcription factors in cancer and non-cancer cells. Transcription factors TP-53 and SRF- were induced by LIUS exposure in cancer cells and non-cancer cells, respectively; (3) As two well-accepted mechanisms of LIUS, mild hyperthermia and oscillatory shear stress induce changes in the expression of cell death regulators, therefore, may be responsible for inducing LIUS mediated changes in gene expression patterns of cell death regulators in cells; (4) LIUS exposure may change the redox status of the cells. LIUS may induce more of antioxidant effects in non-cancer cells compared to cancer cells; and (5) The genes modulated by LIUS in cancer cells have distinct chromatin long range interaction (CLRI) patterns to that of non-cancer cells. Conclusions: Our analysis suggests novel molecular mechanisms that may be utilized by LIUS to induce tumor suppression and inflammation inhibition.

However, no study on somatization in anxiety and its relationship with insomnia has been conducted. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the prevalence of anxiety, somatization and insomnia and explore the relationships between different psychological states in the general population during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: A total of 1,172 respondents were recruited from 125 cities in mainland China by an online questionnaire survey. All subjects were evaluated with the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, the somatization subscale of the Symptom Checklist 90-Revised (SCL-90-R), and the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Results: The percentages of anxiety, somatization, and insomnia were 33.02%, 7.59%, and 24.66%, respectively. The prevalence of somatization was 19.38% in participants with anxiety. Compared to the anxiety without somatization group, the anxiety with somatization group had a significantly higher percentage of patients with a history of physical disease and insomnia, as well as higher GAD-7 scores and SCL-90 somatization subscores (all p &lt; 0.001). The SCL-90 somatization subscores were positively correlated with age, history of physical disease, GAD-7 scores, and ISI scores (all p &lt; 0.001).

The outcome measures were the 5-min Apgar score, neonatal unit admission, neonates receiving assisted ventilation > 6 hours, mothers requiring blood transfusion, and the intensive care unit admission. Result: There were 13,213,732 deliveries that met our inclusion criteria.

In the context of epidemic spreading this amounts to both an antagonistic partial immunity and a synergistic partial coinfection interaction between the two sequential diseases. We examine configuration model networks with tunable clustering. We find that the emergent evolutionary behavior of the second strain is highly dependent on the details of the coupling between the strains. Contact clustering generally reduces the outbreak size of the second strain relative to unclustered topologies; however, positive assortativity induced by clustered contacts inverts this conclusion for highly transmissible disease dynamics.","output":"Symbiotic and antagonistic disease dynamics on networks using bond percolation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Sixteen monoclonal antibodies (Mcabs) were prepared against infectious bronchitis virus strain M41, all of them reacting with the peplomer protein.

OBJECTIVES To investigate the association of maternal urinary bisphenol concentrations during pregnancy with maternal, newborn and early childhood thyroid function. METHODS This study was embedded in Generation R, a prospective, population-based birth cohort (Rotterdam, the Netherlands). Maternal urine samples were analyzed for eight bisphenols at early (<18), mid (18-25) and late (>25 weeks) pregnancy. Maternal serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4) and total thyroxine (TT4) were measured in early pregnancy and child TSH and FT4 were measured in cord blood and childhood. RESULTS The final study population comprised 1,267 mothers, 853 newborns and 882 children. Of the eight bisphenols measured, only bisphenol A (BPA) was detected in >50% of samples at all three time-points and bisphenol S (BPS) at the first time-point. There was no association of BPA or the bisphenol molar sum with maternal thyroid function. Higher BPS concentrations were associated with a higher maternal TT4 ( [95% CI] per 1 (natural-log) unit increase: 0.97 [0.03 to 1.91]) but there was no association with TSH or FT4. Furthermore, higher BPS was associated with an attenuation of the association between maternal FT4 and TSH (Pinteraction = 0.001). There was no association of early or mid-pregnancy BPA or early pregnancy BPS with cord blood or childhood TSH and FT4. A higher late pregnancy maternal BPA exposure was associated with a higher TSH in female newborns (Pinteraction = 0.06) and a higher FT4 during childhood in males (Pinteraction = 0.08).

Our study, based on high-throughput sequencing of transcriptomes (RNAseq) from fungal isolates grown in axenic cultures, revealed in both ERM and ORM fungi the presence of new mycoviruses closely related to already classified virus taxa, but also new viruses that expand the boundaries of characterized RNA virus diversity to previously undescribed evolutionary trajectories.

The 254 nm emission of low-pressure vacuum lamps is known for its antimicrobial effect, but unfortunately, this radiation is also harmful to human cells. Some researchers published reports that short-wavelength ultraviolet light in the spectral region of 200C230 nm (far-UVC) should inactivate pathogens without harming human cells, which might be very helpful in many applications. Methods: A literature search on the impact of far-UVC radiation on pathogens, cells, skin and eyes was performed and median log-reduction doses for different pathogens and wavelengths were calculated. Observed damage to cells, skin and eyes was collected and presented in standardized form. Results: More than 100 papers on far-UVC disinfection, published within the last 100 years, were found. Far-UVC radiation, especially the 222 nm emission of KrCl excimer lamps, exhibits strong antimicrobial properties. The average necessary log-reduction doses are 1.3 times higher than with 254 nm irradiation. A dose of 100 mJ/cm(2) reduces all pathogens by several orders of magnitude without harming human cells, if optical filters block emissions above 230 nm. Conclusion: The approach is very promising, especially for temporary applications, but the data is still sparse. Investigations with high far-UVC doses over a longer period of time have not yet been carried out, and there is no positive study on the impact of this radiation on human eyes.

Real-time, quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) is the recommended diagnostic test but a number of constraints, including cost prevent its widespread implementation. The aim of this study was to evaluate a low cost, easy-to-use rapid antigen test for diagnosing COVID-19 at the point-of-care. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs from suspect COVID-19 cases and from low-risk volunteers were tested on the STANDARD Q COVID-19 Ag Test and results compared with the qRT-PCR results. RESULTS: 262 samples were collected including 90 qRT-PCR positives. The majority were from males (89%) with a mean age of 34 years and only 13 (14%) of the positives were mildly symptomatic. Sensitivity and specificity of the antigen test were 70.0% (95% CI: 60 - 79) and 92% (95% CI: 87 - 96) respectively; diagnostic accuracy was 84% (95% CI: 79 - 88). The antigen test was more likely to be positive in samples with qRT-PCR Ct values 29 reaching a sensitivity of 92%. CONCLUSIONS: The STANDARD Q COVID-19 Ag Test performed less than optimally in this evaluation.

The purpose of this study is to explore key interventions for myopia prevalence, especially for early-onset myopia and high myopia. Methods: Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to evaluate potential associations between risk factor exposure and myopia. LASSO was performed to prioritize the risk features, and the selected leading factors were used to establish the assembled simulation model. Finally, two forecasting models were constructed to predict the risk of myopia and high myopia. Results: Children and adolescents with persistently incorrect posture had a high risk of myopia (OR 7.205, 95% CI 5.999C8.652), which was 2.8 times higher than that in students who always maintained correct posture. In the cohort with high myopia, sleep time of less than 7 h per day (OR 9.789, 95% CI 6.865C13.958), incorrect sitting posture (OR 8.975, 95% CI 5.339C15.086), and siblings with spherical equivalent <?6.00 D (OR 8.439, 95% CI 5.420C13.142) were the top three risk factors. The AUCs of integrated simulation models for myopia and high myopia were 0.8716 and 0.8191, respectively. Conclusion: The findings illustrate that keeping incorrect posture is the leading risk factor for myopia onset, while the onset age of myopia is the primary factor affecting high myopia progression.

Since its emergence in 2012, nosocomial amplifications have led to its high epidemic potential and mortality rate of 34.5%. To date, there is an unmet need for vaccines and specific therapeutics for this disease. Available treatments are either supportive medications in use for other diseases or those lacking specificity requiring higher doses. The viral infection mode is initiated by the attachment of the viral spike glycoprotein to the human Dipeptidyl Peptidase IV (DPP4). Our attempts to screen antivirals against MERS led us to identify montelukast sodium hydrate (MSH), an FDA-approved anti-asthma drug, as an agent attenuating MERS-CoV infection. We showed that MSH directly binds to MERS-CoV-Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) and inhibits its molecular interaction with DPP4 in a dose-dependent manner. Our cell-based inhibition assays using MERS pseudovirions demonstrated that viral infection was significantly inhibited by MSH and was further validated using infectious MERS-CoV culture. Thus, we propose MSH as a potential candidate for therapeutic developments against MERS-CoV infections.","output":"Antiviral activity against Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus by Montelukast, an anti-asthma drug"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A comprehensive approach, including social and emotional affectations, has been recently proposed as an important framework to understand Developmental Language Disorder (DLD). There is an increasing considerable interest in knowing how language and emotion are related, and as far as we know, the role of the emotional regulation (ER) of parents of children with and without DLD, and their impact on their childrens ER is still unknown. The main aims of this study are to advance our knowledge of ER in school-age children and adolescents with and without DLD, to analyze the predictive value of expressive and receptive vocabulary on ER in school-age children and adolescents, and to explore parental ER and their effect on their childrens and adolescents ER. To cover all objectives, we carried out three studies. In the first and second study, expressive and receptive vocabulary were assessed in wave 1, and ER (Emotional Regulation Checklist -ERC- for children and Emotion Regulation Scale -DERS- for adolescents) was assessed in wave 2, 4 years later. Participants in the first study consisted of two groups of school-aged children (13 had DLD and 20 were typically developing children -TD). Participants in the second study consisted of two groups of adolescents (16 had DLD and 16 were TD adolescents). In the third study, the ER of 65 of the parents of the children and adolescents from study 1 were assessed during wave 2 via self-reporting the DERS questionnaire. Results showed no significant differences in ER between DLD and TD groups neither in middle childhood nor in adolescence. Concerning vocabulary and ER, expressive language predicted ER in school-age children but not in adolescents. Finally, parental ER explained their school-age childrens ER, but this was not the case in adolescents. In conclusion, the present data indicated that expressive vocabulary has a fundamental role in ER, at least during primary school years, and adds new evidence of the impact of parents ER upon their childrens ER, encouraging educators and speech language pathologists to include parents assessments in holistic evaluations and interventions for children with language and ER difficulties.","output":"Vocabulary Abilities and Parents Emotional Regulation Predict Emotional Regulation in School-Age Children but Not Adolescents With and Without Developmental Language Disorder"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Nursing is a high-risk profession and nurses exposure to workplace risk factors such as heavy workloads and inadequate staffing is well documented. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated nurses exposure to workplace risk factors, further deteriorating their mental health. Therefore, it is both timely and important to determine nursing groups in greatest need of mental health interventions and supports. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to provide a granular examination of the differences in nurse mental health across nurse demographic and workplace characteristics before and after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. METHODS: This secondary analysis used survey data from two cross-sectional studies with samples (Time 1 study, 5,512 nurses; Time 2, 4,523) recruited from the nursing membership (48,000) of the British Columbia nurses union. Data was analyzed at each timepoint using descriptive statistics and ordinal logistic regression. RESULTS: Several demographic and workplace characteristics were found to predict significant differences in the number of positive screenings on measures of poor mental health. Most importantly, in both survey times younger age was a strong predictor of worse mental health, as was full-time employment. Nurse workplace health authority was also a significant predictor of worse mental health.

Due to their phylogenetic distance, mechanisms of immune diversification and the way in which they deposit IgY immunoglobulin in the egg yolk, chickens provide a number of advantages compared to mammals as hosts for immunization. These advantages include: the one-step purification of antibodies from egg yolk in large amounts facilitates having a virtually continuous supply; the epitope spectrum of avian antibodies potentially grants access to novel specificities; the broad absence of cross-reactivity with mammalian epitopes avoids assay interference and improves the performance of immunological techniques. The polyclonal nature of IgY antibodies has limited their use since avian hybridoma techniques are not well established. Recombinant IgY, however, can be generated from mammalian monoclonal antibodies which makes it possible to further exploit the advantageous properties of the IgY scaffold. Moreover, cloning and selecting the immune repertoire from avian organisms is highly efficient, yielding antigen-specific antibody fragments. The recombinant approach is well suited to circumvent any limitations of polyclonal antibodies.

Impairment in these force couples would theoretically result in impaired ball-and-socket kinematics. Although less frequently used than traditional kinematic descriptors (e.g., Euler angles, joint translations), helical axes are capable of identifying alterations in ball-and-socket kinematics by quantifying the variability (i.e., dispersion) in axis orientation and position during motion. Consequently, assessing glenohumeral helical dispersion may provide indirect evidence of rotator cuff function. The purpose of this exploratory study was to determine the extent to which rotator cuff pathology is associated with alterations in ball-and-socket kinematics. Fifty-one participants were classified into one of five groups based on an assessment of the supraspinatus using diagnostic imaging: asymptomatic healthy, asymptomatic tendinosis, asymptomatic partial-thickness tear, asymptomatic full-thickness tear, symptomatic full-thickness tear. Glenohumeral kinematics were quantified during coronal plane abduction using a biplane x-ray system and described using instantaneous helical axes. The degree to which glenohumeral motion coincided with ball-and-socket kinematics was described using the angular and positional dispersion about the optimal helical axis and pivot, respectively. No statistically significant difference was observed between groups in angular dispersion. However, symptomatic individuals with a full-thickness supraspinatus tear had significantly more positional dispersion than asymptomatic individuals with a healthy supraspinatus or tendinosis. These findings suggest that symptomatic individuals with a full-thickness supraspinatus tear exhibit impaired ball-and-socket kinematics, which is believed to be associated with a disruption of the glenohumeral force couples.","output":"Instantaneous helical axis estimation of glenohumeral kinematics: The impact of rotator cuff pathology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most prevalent sleep-related breathing disorder which could impair someone's quality of life and is also associated with poor outcomes from many diseases.

Accurate assessment of fracture risk is a crucial step for clinicians to consider patient-by-patient optimal treatments for effective prevention of fractures. Image-based biomechanical modeling has shown promising progress in assessment of fracture risk, and there is still a great possibility for improvement. The purpose of this paper is to identify key issues that need be addressed to improve image-based biomechanical modeling. MATERIALS AND METHODS We critically examined issues in consideration and determination of the four biomechanical variables, i.e., risk of fall, fall-induced impact force, bone geometry and bone material quality, which are essential for prediction of hip fracture risk. We closely inspected: limitations introduced by assumptions that are adopted in existing models; deficiencies in methods for construction of biomechanical models, especially for determination of bone material properties from bone images; problems caused by separate use of the variables in clinical study of hip fracture risk; availability of clinical information that are required for validation of biomechanical models. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS A number of critical issues and gaps were identified. Strategies for effectively addressing the issues were discussed.","output":"On challenges in clinical assessment of hip fracture risk using image-based biomechanical modelling: a critical review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A new coronavirus outbreak emerged on the 31st of December 2019 in Wuhan, China, causing commotion among the medical community and the rest of the world. This new species of coronavirus has been termed 2019-nCoV and has caused a considerable number of cases of infection and deaths in China and, to a growing degree, beyond China, becoming a worldwide public health emergency. 2019-nCoV has high homology to other pathogenic coronaviruses, such as those originating from bat-related zoonosis (SARS-CoV), which caused approximately 646 deaths in China at the start of the decade. The mortality rate for 2019-nCoV is not as high (approximately 2-3%), but its rapid propagation has resulted in the activation of protocols to stop its spread. This pathogen has the potential to become a pandemic.

The proportion of people reporting anxiety is 26%, and depression is 34% points. Disentangling associational and causal contributions of behavior, COVID-19 cases, and economic distress on mental distress will dictate different mitigation strategies to reduce long-term pandemic-related mental distress. Methods We use the Household Pulse Survey (HPS) April 2020 to February 2021 data to examine mental distress among U.S. citizens attributable to COVID-19. We combined HPS survey data with publicly available state-level weekly: COVID-19 case and death data from the Centers for Disease Control, public policies, and Apple and Google mobility data. Finally, we constructed economic and mental distress measures to estimate structural models with lag dependent variables to tease out public health policies' associational and causal path coefficients on economic and mental distress. Findings From April 2020 to February 2021, we found that anxiety and depression had steadily climbed in the U.S. By design, mobility restrictions primarily affected public health policies where businesses and restaurants absorbed the biggest hit. Period t-1 COVID-19 cases increased job loss by 4.1% and economic distress by 6.3% points in the same period. Job-loss and housing insecurity in t-1 increased period t mental distress by 29.1% and 32.7%, respectively. However, t-1 food insecurity decreased mental distress by 4.9% in time t. The pandemic-related potential causal path coefficient of period t-1 economic distress on period t depression is 57.8%, and anxiety is 55.9%. Thus, we show that period t-1 COVID-19 case information, behavior, and economic distress may be causally associated with pandemic related period t mental distress.","output":"Associational and plausible causal effects of COVID-19 public health policies on economic and mental distress (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Roux limb construction is an essential part of several major reconstructive hepatobiliary and upper gastrointestinal surgeries. This can be achieved with a stapling device or suturing. For over two decades, the LigaSure vessel sealing systems (Medtronic, MN, USA) have been in use for omental division, mesenteric transection, and sealing of vessels. We used the LigaSure vessel sealing system with a ForceTriad energy platform (Medtronic) for transection of the bowel during the formation of the Roux limb for a Roux-en-Y reconstruction. Between July 2019 and December 2020, patients who had Roux limb construction as part of a pancreato-enteric anastomosis in surgery for chronic pancreatitis were analysed. The data was reviewed from a prospectively maintained database. Fifteen patients had undergone surgery for chronic pancreatitis. The mentioned technique takes approximately eight minutes to construct a Roux limb. There was no bleeding from the gut ends that had been transected. There was no breach in the bowel's seal. The field was free of enteric contamination. In the post-operative course of these individuals, there was no Roux limb-related morbidity. This procedure is useful because it is cost-effective, time-saving, dependable, and prevents contamination and blood loss.

The role and efficacy of alvimopan in patients undergoing radical cystectomy with urinary diversion is not well understood. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of alvimopan in the context of enhanced recovery pathways compared to enhanced recovery pathways alone for perioperative bowel dysfunction in patients undergoing radical cystectomy. SEARCH METHODS The terms alvimopan and cystectomy were used to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase. We also reviewed abstracts from the past four years (2013 to 2016) of the American Urologic Association, Society of Urologic Oncology, and American Society of Clinical Oncology Genitourinary Cancers. SELECTION CRITERIA We searched for randomized controlled trials that compared alvimopan to placebo. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS This study was based on a published protocol. We performed a comprehensive search of multiple databases including CENTRAL in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Web of Science, Scopus and Biosis, which we last updated on 6 February 2017. We also searched abstract proceedings for major relevant meetings (2013 to 2016), databases of the grey literature, trial registries, citations of relevant reviews and contacted clinical experts and the drug manufacturer.Two independent reviewers screened the literature in two stages (title and abstract, full-text) using Covidence software. Two independent reviewers assessed the risk of bias on a 'per outcome' basis using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias; tool and rated the quality of evidence according to GRADE. Results of the single eligible trial were reported in a 'Summary of findings' table based on an intention-to-treat analysis. MAIN RESULTS Based on a single trial and moderate-quality evidence, alvimopan reduced the time to reach a composite endpoint of tolerance of solid food and documented bowel movements (hazard ratio (HR) 1.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.41 to 2.23). This represents 165 more patients (109 more to 207 more) per 1000 meeting this endpoint within 10 days of surgery. Based on moderate-quality evidence, alvimopan reduced the time to hospital discharge (HR 1.67, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.01). This represents 138 more patients (82 more to 198 more) per 1000 being discharged within 10 days of surgery. Also based on moderate-quality evidence, alvimopan was associated with a reduced risk of major adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 0.28, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.44) representing 355 fewer patients (404 fewer to 276 fewer) with major adverse events per 1000. We downgraded this outcome for indirectness as it included adverse events that we did not consider major.In terms of secondary outcomes, alvimopan did not appear to alter the rate of readmission (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.33), change the rate of any cardiovascular event (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.05) or alter the mean narcotic pain medication use (mean difference 0, 95% CI 14.08 fewer to 14.08 more morphine equivalents). The quality of evidence was moderate for all three outcomes. Based on high-quality evidence, alvimopan reduced the rate of nasogastric tube replacement (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.59). We did not find evidence for the drug's impact on rates of parenteral nutrition. All outcomes were short term and limited to a 30-day time horizon.Based on the existence of only one trial, we were unable to perform any subgroup or sensitivity analyses. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS In patients undergoing radical cystectomy and urinary diversion, the use of alvimopan administered as part of an enhanced recovery pathway for a limited duration (up to 15 doses for up to seven days) probably reduces the time to tolerance of solid food, time to hospital discharge and rates of major adverse events. Readmission rates, rates of cardiovascular events and narcotic pain requirements are probably similar. The need for reinsertion of nasogastric tubes is reduced. We found no evidence for the impact on rates of parenteral nutrition within 30 postoperative days.","output":"Alvimopan for recovery of bowel function after radical cystectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: To evaluate rural Colorado women's perceived access to and preferences for receiving reproductive health care services in their communities. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional, online survey of English and Spanish-speaking women 18-45 years old who are registered to vote in rural Colorado zip codes. Eligible participants were recruited with postcard mailings. Survey questions assessed experiences, beliefs, and preferences regarding facets of reproductive health care, including contraception, miscarriage, and abortion. We performed descriptive and bivariate statistics. Results: Respondents (n=373) had a mean age of 33 years (SD=7.0) and were majority white (86%) and insured (90%;24% publicly insured) from a representative distribution of rural zip codes. Most (74%) noted barriers to obtaining reproductive health care in their communities, with an average of 3.4 barriers cited per person. The most common barriers were too few providers in their communities (83%) and long distance to obtain care (68%). Many (48%) had used telemedicine, primarily (77%) since the COVID-19 pandemic. About half (54%) of respondents were somewhat or very interested in using telemedicine for reproductive health care services. Interest in telemedicine did not significantly differ by perceived barriers to accessing care (p=0.19) or previous use of telemedicine (p=0.11). Conclusions: Most reproductive-aged, rural Colorado women endorsed barriers to obtaining reproductive health care in their communities.

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included consecutive admitted patients who died at a Victorian tertiary referral hospital from 1 January to 30 September directly due to COVID-19. Clinical characteristics, symptoms, and use of supportive therapies including medications and non-pharmacological interventions in the last three days of life were extracted. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 58 patients (median age 87 years IQR 81, 90) predominantly admitted from home (n = 30), who died after a median of 11 days (IQR 6, 28) in the acute medical (n = 31) or aged care (n = 27) wards of the hospital. The median Charlson Comorbidity Score was 7 (IQR 5,8).

How can the transfer from science to society take place on a low-threshold basis? We will talk about our strategy reaching out to decision-makers within health care planning in Germany and Europe. In addition, it will be examined how we wanted our results to be accessible, which possibilities of publication we choose beyond scientific articles and what options we had when talking about research marketing. We will also have a closer look on our demands for data visualization and transparency. In an ongoing process, two things were at stake: how do we define our target groups and how we address them. It has been proven to be a good strategy to continuously build up (international) networks, to share our knowledge and implement feedback. When publishing scientific results, it has turned out to be helpful for the project to approach a well-known bi-lingual journal with a wide range of coverage. We aimed to present the pilot project online with an appealing data visualization and graphic formats. This type of presentation made it easier to approach members of the press. Also, the inclusion of current topics such as COVID-19 helped to increase the media response. There are plans to include the use of the data in media formats such as webinars. Burden of Disease assessments can be challenging in implementation and communication. Before the start, the use of the metrics for Germany had to be thoroughly explained to national stakeholders.

METHODS: Cultured explants from the frontal cortex of rhesus monkey brain (n=3) were treated with live Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 6, 12, and 24 h. Total protein was collected for sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. In addition, changes in protein expression in the explants over time following Bb treatment were screened. RESULTS: We identified 1237 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs; fold change 1.5 or 0.67, P-value 0.05). One of these, growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43), was highly expressed at all time points in the explants. The results of the protein-protein interaction network analysis of DEPs suggested that GAP-43 plays a role in the neuroinflammation associated with LNB. In HMC3 cells incubated with live Bb or PBS for 6, 12, and 24 h, real-time PCR and western blot analyses confirmed the increase of GAP-43 mRNA and protein, respectively.

METHODS: A total of 2321 eligible patients were included in this study from February 4 to April 15, 2020. Two illness conditions, including mild/moderate (M/M) subtype to severe/critical (S/C) and S/C to fatality, were classified. Clinical message was collected and compared, respectively. KaplanCMeier method, Cox regression model and risk score system were used to predict disease progression in S/C COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 112 of 1761 patients with M/M subtype were progressors (P) and 1649 non-progressors (NP). Increasing disease progression associated with higher levels of neutrophils count (HR=1.958, 95% CI=1.253C3.059, P=0.003), CK (HR=2.203, 95% CI=1.048C4.632, P=0.037), LDH (HR=3.309, 95% CI=2.083C5.256, P<0.001) and CRP (HR=2.575, 95% CI=1.638C4.049, P<0.001), and lower level of lymphocytes count (HR=1.549, 95% CI=1.018C2.355, P=0.041), as well as total lesion volume ratio greater than 10% (HR=2.286, 95% CI=1.451C3.601, P<0.001) on admission. In progression to fatality, 56 of the 672 S/C cases died and 616 survived. Increasing fatality associated with lower level of lymphocytes count (HR:2.060, 95% CI:1.000C4.242, P=0.050), higher levels of BUN (HR:2.715, 95% CI:1.539C4.790, P<0.001), CK-MB (HR:3.412, 95% CI:1.760C6.616, P<0.001), LDH (HR:5.578, 95% CI:2.317C13.427, P<0.001), and PT (HR:3.619, 95% CI:2.102C6.231, P<0.001). Furthermore, high risk of neutrophils count, lymphocytes count, CK, LDH, CRP, and total lesion volume ratio was powerfully correlated with the incidence of progression to S/C in patients with NS COVID-19 and high odds of lymphocytes count, BUN, CK-MB, LDH, and PT were significantly associated with death in patients with S/C COVID-19. In addition, the progression and mortality rates increased with increasing risk scores. CONCLUSION: Elevated LDH level and lymphopenia were independent predictors for COVID-19 sustainable management in classifying non-severe patients who progressed to severe condition and identifying S/C patients who deteriorated to fatal outcomes as well. Total lesion volume ratio 10% may provide early predictive evidence with COVID-19 patients at high risk of developing into S/C to improve prognosis.","output":"Independent Risk Factors for the Dynamic Development of COVID-19: A Retrospective Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT BACKGROUND Objectives: \\"In patient-facing healthcare workers delivering secondary care, what is the evidence behind UK Government PPE Guidance on surgical masks versus respirators for SARS-CoV-2 protection?\\" METHODS Two independent reviewers searched MEDLINE, Google Scholar and grey literature 11th-30th April 2020. Studies published on any date containing primary data comparing surgical facemasks and respirators specific to SARS-CoV-2, and studies underpinning government PPE guidance, were included. Appraisal was performed using CASP checklists. Results were synthesised by comparison of findings and appraisals. RESULTS In all three laboratory studies of 14 different respirators and 12 surgical facemasks, respirators were significantly more effective than facemasks in protection factors, reduction factors, filter penetrations, and total inspiratory leakages at differing particle sizes, mean inspiratory flows, and breathing rates. Tests included live viruses and inert particles on dummies and humans. In six clinical studies, 6,502 participants, there was no consistent definition of \\"exposure\\" to determine the efficacy of RPE. It is difficult to define \\"safe\\". The only statistically significant result found continuous use of respirators more effective in clinical respiratory illness compared to targeted use or surgical facemask. CONCLUSIONS There is a paucity of evidence on the comparison of FRSMs and respirators specific to SARS-CoV-2, and poor-quality evidence in other contexts. Indirectness results in extrapolation of non-SARS-CoV-2 specific data to guide UK Government PPE guidance. The appropriateness of this is unknown given the uncertainty over the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. 1. The evidence base for UK Government PPE guidelines is not based on SARS-CoV-2 and requires generalisation from low-quality evidence of other pathogens/particles. 2. There is a paucity of high-quality evidence regarding the efficacy of RPE specific to SARS-CoV-2. 3. HMG's PPE guidelines are underpinned by the assumption of droplet transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

Our data further reveal that SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG memory B cells increased over time. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2-specific memory lymphocytes exhibited characteristics associated with potent antiviral function: memory T cells secreted cytokines and expanded upon antigen re-encounter, whereas memory B cells expressed receptors capable of neutralizing virus when expressed as monoclonal antibodies.

In this paper, a fog-centric IoT-based smart healthcare support service for monitoring and controlling the Swine Flu virus epidemic is proposed. The proposed framework utilizes the concept of fog computing for delay-sensitive applications. Furthermore, a hybrid classifier is used to classify the swine flu patient at an early stage and generate alerts to the health officials and patients' guardians. In the experimental setup, the iFogSim simulator is used to mimic the IoT devices and fog nodes for evaluating various parameters such as accuracy, energy, and Latency, whereas WEKA is used for developing a hybrid classifier.

In this study, based on a large number of substrates and inhibitors related to five important CYP450 isozymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4), a series of high-performance predictive models for metabolic DDIs were constructed by two machine learning methods (random forest and XGBoost) and 4 different types of descriptors (MOE_2D, CATS, ECFP4 and MACCS). To reduce the uncertainty of individual models, the consensus method was applied to yield more reliable predictions. A series of evaluations illustrated that the consensus models were more reliable and robust for the DDI predictions of new drug combination.

We conducted a prospective study of IBD patients vaccinated with BNT162b2, CX-024414, and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines. The aim was to evaluate the rate and magnitude of seroconversion, assess the effect of different immune-modifying treatment modalities on the magnitude of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels, and analyze the impact of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination on the inflammatory biomarkers of IBD. METHODS: The study included 602 IBD patients and 168 immunocompetent health care workers serving as controls. Serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were measured by chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay before the vaccination and 8 weeks after the vaccination. RESULTS: Of IBD patients, 82.2% were receiving biological treatment: most of them were treated with antitumor necrosis factor (TNF)- inhibitors (48.5%), and just under half of them were treated with concomitant thiopurines or methotrexate, followed by vedolizumab (18.6%) and ustekinumab (15.1%). Only 8.1% of patients were on 5-aminosalicylates, and a minority (2.2%) were treatment-free. The postvaccine seropositivity rate among IBD patients and controls was 97.8% vs 100%. Median anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were lower among IBD recipients of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 compared with 2 other vaccines (P < .0001) and control ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 recipients (P=.01). No correlation was found between serum trough levels and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG concentrations for any of the biological drugs used. The TNF- inhibitors with concomitant immunosuppressive treatment but no other treatment modalities were associated with a lower postvaccination antibody response (P < .0001).

In patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), IgM, IgA, and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 emerge within a few days and can be detected in several body fluids, such as serum and oral fluids. End Stage Kidney Disease patients are especially vulnerable in this pandemic as they are immunocompromised, putting them at higher risks of infection and impaired response to vaccines. While repeated blood draws in hemodialysis patients pose no substantial medical or logistic problems, the situation is different in those treated by peritoneal dialysis. To overcome that limitation, we explored the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in spent peritoneal dialysate in patients treated with acute and chronic peritoneal dialysis, respectively. METHOD: We analyzed spent PD dialysate samples from four distinct patient groups, namely Pre-Covid-19 controls (Group 1; 15 samples collected between May 2019 and Feb 2020), Covid-19 negative controls during ongoing pandemic (Group 2; 33 samples collected between March and September 2020); chronic PD patients with confirmed Covid-19 (Group 3; 30 samples collected between March and September 2020,); and patients with confirmed Covid-19 and acute kidney injury treated with acute PD (Group 4; 18 samples collected in April 2020). SARS-CoV-2 IgG titer in spent PD dialysate was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) targeting Nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 virus (MPBIO cat#: 08440100). Total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG, IgM, and IgA) were measured using ELISA targeting recombinant N Protein and Spike protein (S Protein) (AFFYPRO Cat#: EA821). Absolute IgG concentration was calculated using IgG standard provided by the MPBIO ELISA kit. The total antibody titer was calculated as a relative value to the mean of antibody levels of COVID-19 negative patients. To account for different dialysate and ultrafiltration volumes, antibody titers were also normalized to total protein concentrations in the spent dialysate samples. The ratio of IgG or total antibody to total protein reflects the normalized titer. RESULTS: Normalized anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titer in the four groups is illustrated in Figure 1A. The mean IgG/protein levels in Group 3 and Group 4 are 86-fold (p=0.023) and 220-fold (p=0.0003), respectively, above the mean IgG/protein levels in COVID negative patients (Group 1 and 2 combined). The discrimination between patients with and without COVID-19 is excellent (AUC 0.938). At a threshold of 0.0024%, the sensitivity and specificity are 89.6% and 97.9%, respectively (Figure 1B). Using same threshold as Figure 1B, in Group 3, 9 out of 11 patients had a positive IgG response in all samples. In 5 patients, IgG levels decreased over time. The mean normalized total antibody/protein levels in Group 3 and Group 4 are 7.3-fold and 24-fold above those in COVID negative patients (combined Group 1 and 2; both p<0.001). Distribution pattern, ROC analysis, and dynamic change over time of total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are like those of IgG (Figure 1D-F). CONCLUSION: Covid-19 serology tests can provide much information including diagnosis, immune response, local seroprevalence, et al. Currently, most of serology tests are done using blood-related specimens. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in spent PD dialysate. Presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in spent PD dialysate of peritoneal dialysis patients potentially provides a new way to perform frequent serology tests for this high-risk group. As USA is moving fast on national vaccination at this moment, using test strip developed for PD effluent to quickly and frequently check SARS-CoV-2 antibody in PD effluent could be used to monitor the vaccination efficiency while avoiding clinic visit.","output":"MO685 PRESENCE OF SARS-COV-2 ANTIBODIES IN SPENT PERITONEAL DIALYSATE"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severity of the initial COVID-19 outbreak varied substantially across the United States.

Since recent studies indicate that TLR7 recognizes not only viral RNA but also microRNAs that are released by damaged neurons and elevated during neurological diseases, we first examined the response of glial cells to TLR7 stimulation using microarray analysis. Microglia were found to generate a much stronger response to TLR7 activation than astrocytes, both in the number of genes induced as well as fold induction. Although the primary pathways induced by both cell types were directly linked to immune responses, microglia also induced pathways associated with cellular proliferation, while astrocytes did not. Targeted analysis of a subset of the upregulated genes identified unique mRNA, including Ifi202b which was only upregulated by microglia and was found to be induced during both retroviral and bunyavirus infections in the CNS. In addition, other genes including Birc3 and Gpr84 as well as two expressed sequences AW112010 and BC023105 were found to be induced in both microglia and astrocytes and were upregulated in the CNS following virus infection. Thus, expression of these genes may a useful measurement of glial activation during insult or injury to the CNS.","output":"Identification of Glial Activation Markers by Comparison of Transcriptome Changes between Astrocytes and Microglia following Innate Immune Stimulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Summary A new virus, SARS-CoV-2, has spread world-wide since December 2019, probably affecting millions of people and killing thousands.

This review aims to determine the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on mental health outcomes of hospital-based HCWs and formulate recommendations for future action. METHODS: A systematic review was performed between 31st December 2019 and 17th June 2020 through Ovid Medline and Embase databases (PROSPERO ID CRD42020181204). Studies were included for review if they investigated the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on mental health outcomes of hospital-based HCWs and used validated psychiatric scoring tools. Prevalence of ICD-10 classified psychiatric disorders was the primary outcome measure. RESULTS: The initial search returned 436 articles. Forty-four studies were included in final analysis, with a total of 69,499 subjects. Prevalence ranges of six mental health outcomes were identified: depression 13.5%-44.7%; anxiety 12.3%-35.6%; acute stress reaction 5.2%-32.9%; post-traumatic stress disorder 7.4%-37.4%; insomnia 33.8%-36.1%; and occupational burnout 3.1%-43.0%. Direct exposure to SARS-CoV-2 patients was the most common risk factor identified for all mental health outcomes except occupational burnout. Nurses, frontline HCWs, and HCWs with low social support and fewer years of working experience reported the worst outcomes. CONCLUSION: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has significantly impacted the mental health of HCWs. Frontline staff demonstrate worse mental health outcomes. Hospitals should be staffed to meet service provision requirements and to mitigate the impact onmental health. This can be improved with access to rapid-response psychiatric teams and should be continually monitored throughout the pandemic and beyond its conclusion.","output":"The impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the mental health of healthcare workers in a hospital setting-A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has profoundly and pervasively disrupted the world's health, economy, security and attitudes.

Improved understanding of the role of respiratory pathogens in acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) is required and the use of molecular microbiological techniques may lead to insights into hostCpathogen interactions and the development of more targeted therapeutic approaches. METHODS AND ANALYSES: Acute Exacerbation and Respiratory InfectionS in COPD (AERIS) is a longitudinal epidemiological study to assess how changes in the COPD airway microbiome contribute to the incidence and severity of AECOPD. Patients with COPD aged 40C85 are followed monthly for 2 years, and reviewed within 72 h of onset of symptoms of AECOPD. Exacerbations are detected using daily electronic diary cards. Blood, sputum, nasopharyngeal and urine samples are collected at prespecified timepoints. Molecular diagnostic and typing techniques are used to describe the dynamics of airway infection during AECOPD and stable disease, and associations with clinical outcome. This study aims to refine the case definition of AECOPD to reflect the possible microbiological aetiology. AERIS will assess the impact of AECOPD on health-related quality of life and healthcare resource utilisation, and the possible interactions between nutritional status, infection and immune responses. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: AERIS is conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice, and has been approved by the institutional ethics and review board. All participants must provide written informed consent. The results obtained will be disseminated at international medical conferences and in peer-reviewed publications. DISCUSSION: Few other studies have addressed the complexity of the microbiological and systemic components of COPD or employed real-time electronic tracking of symptoms to identify AECOPD and potential aetiological triggers. RESULTS: Results of AERIS will increase our understanding of the contribution of pathogens to AECOPD, potentially leading to new targeted therapeutic and preventative interventions.

SSA countries bear significantly high proportions of TB and HIV cases reported worldwide, compared to countries in the West. Whilst COVID-19 epidemiology appears to vary across Africa, most countries in this region have reported relatively lower-case counts compared to the West. Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic has added an additional burden to already overstretched health systems in SSA, which, among other things, have been focused on the longstanding dual epidemics of TB and HIV. As with these dual epidemics, inadequate resources and poor case identification and reporting may be contributing to underestimations of the COVID-19 case burden in SSA. Modelling studies predict that the pandemic-related disruptions in TB and HIV services will result in significant increases in associated morbidity and mortality over the next five years. Furthermore, limited empirical evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 coinfections with TB and HIV are associated with increased mortality risk in SSA. However, predictive models require a better evidence-base to accurately define the impact of COVID-19, not only on communicable diseases such as TB and HIV, but on non-communicable disease comorbidities. Further research is needed to assess morbidity and mortality data among both adults and children across the African continent, paying attention to geographic disparities, as well as the clinical and socio-economic determinants of COVID-19 in the setting of TB and/or HIV.","output":"Minimizing the impact of the triple burden of COVID-19, tuberculosis and HIV on health services in sub-Saharan Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The optimization of the Beetle readout ASIC and the performance of the software for the signal processing based on machine learning methods are presented. The Beetle readout chip was developed for the LHCb (Large Hadron Collider beauty) tracking detectors and was used in the VELO (Vertex Locator) during Run 1 and 2 of LHC data taking. The VELO, surrounding the LHC beam crossing region, was a leading part of the LHCb tracking system. The Beetle chip was used to read out the signal from silicon microstrips, integrating and amplifying it. The studies presented in this paper cover the optimization of its electronic configuration to achieve the lower power consumption footprint and the lower operational temperature of the sensors, while maintaining a good condition of the analogue response of the whole chip. The studies have shown that optimizing the operational temperature is possible and can be beneficial when the detector is highly irradiated. Even a single degree drop in silicon temperature can result in a significant reduction in the leakage current. Similar studies are being performed for the future silicon tracker, the Upstream Tracker (UT), which will start operating at LHC in 2021. It is expected that the inner part of the UT detector will suffer radiation damage similar to the most irradiated VELO sensors in Run 2.

This study aimed to explore the impact of bacterial colonization on the severity of virus-induced wheezing, and accompanying airway inflammation. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) from 68 hospitalized children with bronchiolitis and 85 children with recurrent wheezing were obtained. Eleven common respiratory viruses were sought by PCR and/or direct fluorescence assay. Bacteria were isolated from NPAs by routine culture methods. Cell numbers and concentrations of cytokines/chemokines in the NPAs were measured, and nucleated cells were characterized. The frequency of bacterial colonization in children with recurrent wheezing was significantly higher than in children with an initial attack of bronchiolitis. Bacterial colonization accompanying virus infection had no effect on clinical manifestations, duration of hospitalization, concentrations of cytokines/chemokines (except interleukin-10 (IL-10)) or cellularity in the children with bronchiolitis; however, among the children with recurrent wheezing, those who had coexistent non-invasive bacterial colonization and virus infection presented more frequent cyanosis, longer duration of hospitalization, a higher concentration of IL-10 and a higher percentage of neutrophils in NPAs than those with virus infection but without bacterial colonization. Bacterial colonization was common in children with virus-induced wheezing, particularly in the situation of recurrent wheezing.

One major concern has been the spread of misinformation via social media channels about the implications of the use of face masks. We assessed the association between social media as the main COVID-19 information source and perceived effectiveness of face mask use. METHODS In this survey in six sub-Saharan African countries (Botswana, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Zambia and Zimbabwe), respondents were asked how much they agreed that face masks are effective in limiting COVID-19. Responses were dichotomised as 'agree' and 'does not agree'. Respondents also indicated their main information source including social media, television, newspapers, etc. We assessed perceived effectiveness of face masks, and used multivariable logistic models to estimate the association between social media use and perceived effectiveness of face mask use. Propensity score (PS) matched analysis was used to assess the robustness of the main study findings. RESULTS Among 1988 respondents, 1169 (58.8%) used social media as their main source of information, while 1689 (85.0%) agreed that face masks were effective against COVID-19. In crude analysis, respondents who used social media were more likely to agree that face masks were effective compared with those who did not [odds ratio (OR) 1.29, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-1.65]. This association remained significant when adjusted for age, sex, country, level of education, confidence in government response, attitude towards COVID-19 and alternative main sources of information on COVID-19 (OR 1.33, 95%CI: 1.01-1.77).

MATERIAL AND METHODS: From January 16, 2020 to March 28, 2020, among the 568 cases of COVID-19 patients diagnosed in Xiaogan Central Hospital, 64 cases of COVID-19 patients with diabetes were selected as the diabetic group, and 64 cases of COVID-19 patients with age and gender matching without diabetes were selected as the non-diabetic group, and their clinical data and pulmonary CT characteristics were retrospectively analysed. RESULTS: Compared with the non-diabetic group, the proportion of patients in the diabetic group with chronic underlying disease was higher, and they were in more a serious condition at admission. Inflammation index and characteristics of glycolipid metabolism results showed that COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus were more likely to have elevated inflammatory markers and hypercoagulability, accompanied by hypoproteinaemia and glucose and lipid metabolism disorders. Treatment and clinic outcome results showed that the time of nucleic acid turning negative in the diabetic group was significantly longer than that in the non-diabetic group. Radiological data showed that COVID-19 combined with diabetes prolonged the time of detoxification in patients. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus and chronic hypertension are associated with increased inflammatory markers and disorders of glucose and lipid metabolism. These patients tend to develop serious diseases, especially the rapid progression of CT lesions in the lungs of patients with a wide range ofinvolvement, and prolonged absorption and detoxification time.","output":"Analysis of clinical features and pulmonary CT features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with diabetes mellitus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Airflow signal encodes rich information about respiratory system. While the gold standard for measuring airflow is to use a spirometer with an occlusive seal, this is not practical for ambulatory monitoring of patients. Advances in sensor technology have made measurement of motion of the thorax and abdomen feasible with small inexpensive devices, but estimation of airflow from these time series is challenging. We propose to use the nonlinear-type time-frequency analysis tool, synchrosqueezing transform, to properly represent the thoracic and abdominal movement signals as the features, which are used to recover the airflow by the locally stationary Gaussian process. We show that, using a dataset that contains respiratory signals under normal sleep conditions, an accurate prediction can be achieved by fitting the proposed model in the feature space both in the intra- and inter-subject setups. We also apply our method to a more challenging case, where subjects under general anesthesia underwent transitions from pressure support to unassisted ventilation to further demonstrate the utility of the proposed method.","output":"Airflow recovery from thoracic and abdominal movements using Synchrosqueezing Transform and Locally Stationary Gaussian Process Regression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive degeneration of motor neurons (MNs). Most cases are sporadic, whereas 10% are familial. The pathological mechanisms underlying the disease are partially understood, but it is increasingly being recognized that alterations in RNA metabolism and deregulation of microRNA (miRNA) expression occur in ALS. In this study, we performed miRNA expression profile analysis of iPSC-derived MNs and related exosomes from familial patients and healthy subjects. We identified dysregulation of miR-34a, miR-335 and miR-625-3p expression in both MNs and exosomes. These miRNAs regulate genes and pathways which correlate with disease pathogenesis, suggesting that studying miRNAs deregulation can contribute to deeply investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease. We also assayed the expression profile of these miRNAs in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of familial (fALS) and sporadic patients (sALS) and we identified a significant dysregulation of miR-34a-3p and miR-625-3p levels in ALS compared to controls. Taken together, all these findings suggest that miRNA analysis simultaneously performed in different human biological samples could represent a promising molecular tool to understand the etiopathogenesis of ALS and to develop new potential miRNA-based strategies in this new propitious therapeutic era.","output":"Insights into the identification of a molecular signature for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis exploiting integrated microRNA profiling of iPSC-derived motor neurons and exosomes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are few detailed investigations of neurologic complications in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.

However, little is known about the infectiousness of RT-PCR positive patients who pass undetected by AGT. In a screening setting for mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic patients with high COVID-19 prevalence (30-40%), 1141 patients were tested using one of five AGTs and RT-PCR. Where the results differed, virus viability in the samples was tested on cell culture (CV-1 cells). The test battery included AGTs by JOYSBIO, Assure Tech, SD Biosensor, VivaChek Biotech and NDFOS. Sensitivities of the ATGs compared to RT-PCR ranged from 42% to 76%. The best test yielded a 76% sensitivity, 97% specificity, 92% positive, and 89% negative predictive values, respectively. However, in the best performing ATG tests, almost 90% of samples with \\"false negative\\" AGT results contained no viable virus. Corrected on the virus viability, sensitivities grew to 81-97% and, with one exception, the tests yielded high specificities >96%. Performance characteristics of the best test after adjustment were 96% sensitivity, 97% specificity, 92% positive, and 99% negative predictive values (high prevalence population). We, therefore, believe that virus viability should be considered when assessing the AGT performance. Also, our results indicate that a well-performing antigen test could in a high-prevalence setting serve as an excellent tool for identifying patients shedding viable virus. We also propose that the high proportion of RT-PCR-positive samples containing no viable virus in the group of \\"false negatives\\" of the antigen test should be further investigated with the aim of possibly preventing needless isolation of such patients.","output":"Five Antigen Tests for SARS-CoV-2: Virus Viability Matters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID\\\\19 case fatality rate in the United States is currently reported at 4.8% based on the confirmed cases of COVID\\\\19.

The epitope of CR3022 does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site within 2019-nCoV RBD. These results suggest that CR3022 may have the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infections. Interestingly, some of the most potent SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies (e.g. m396, CR3014) that target the ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein, implying that the difference in the RBD of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV has a critical impact for the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies, and that it is still necessary to develop novel monoclonal antibodies that could bind specifically to 2019-nCoV RBD.","output":"Potent binding of 2019 novel coronavirus spike protein by a SARS coronavirus-specific human monoclonal antibody"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Homologous to E6AP carboxyl-terminus (HECT)-type E3 ligase performs ubiquitin (Ub)-proteasomal protein degradation via forming a complex with E2Ub.

Molecular dynamics analysis revealed more opening of E2(UbcH5B)-binding pocket upon binding to HECT(NEDD4L), HECT(WWP1), HECT(WWP2), HECT(HECW1), and HECT(HECW2). We observed similar binding pattern for E2(UbcH5B) and mentioned HECT domains as previously reported for HECT(NEDD4L) where Trp762, Trp709, and Trp657 residues of HECT(NEDD4L), HECT(WWP1), and HECT(WWP2) are involved in making contacts with Ser94 residue of E2(UbcH5B).

Study aim was to evaluate serological response and adverse events following standard and third dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in IMID-patients on immunosuppressive therapy. METHODS: Adult patients on immunosuppressive therapy for rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and healthy controls receiving standard two dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, were included in this prospective observational study. Analyses of antibodies to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-COV-2 spike protein were performed prior to, and 2-4 weeks after vaccination. Poorly responding patients were allotted a third vaccine dose. RESULTS: 1505 (91%) patients and 1096 (98%) healthy controls (p<0.001) responded to standard SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Anti-RBD levels were lower in patients (median 619 AU/ml [IQR 192-4191]) than controls (median 3355 AU/ml [896 -7849]), p<0.001. The proportion of responders was lowest in patients receiving tumor necrosis factor inhibitor combination therapy, janus kinase inhibitors, or abatacept.

Patients and controls had a comparable safety profile. CONCLUSIONS: IMID-patients had an attenuated response to standard vaccination as compared to healthy controls. A third vaccine dose was safe and resulted in serological response in most patients.

While the former is determined by the immunity of an individual towards a disease, the latter depends on the duration of exposure to the infection. We model the spatio-temporal propagation of a pandemic using a generalized SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Removed) model by introducing the susceptibility and infectivity distributions to understand their combined effects, which appear to remain inadequately addressed till date. We consider the coupling between $\\\\sigma_{inh}$ and $\\\\iota_{ext}$ through a new Critical Infection Parameter (CIP) ($\\\\gamma_c$). We find that the neglect of these distributions, as in the naive SIR model, results in an overestimation of the amount of infection in a population, which leads to incorrect (higher) estimates of the infections required to achieve the herd immunity threshold. Additionally, we include the effects of seeding of infection in a population by long-range migration. We solve the resulting master equations by performing Kinetic Monte Carlo Cellular Automata (KMC-CA) simulations. Importantly, our simulations can reproduce the multiple infection peak scenario of a pandemic. The latent interactions between disease migration and the distributions of susceptibility and infectivity can render the progression a character vastly different from the naive SIR model. In particular, inclusion of these additional features renders the problem a character of a living percolating system where the disease cluster survives by migrating from region to region.","output":"Origin of Multiple Infection Waves in a Pandemic: Effects of Inherent Susceptibility and External Infectivity Distributions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To analyze the epidemiological characteristics of a local outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2(Delta) variant in Liwan district, Guangzhou, and provide evidence for the further prevention and control of the Delta variant of COVID-19.

Background: Remdesivir is the only antiviral treatment that has been shown to be useful against SARS-CoV-2 infection. It shorts hospitalization time compared to placebo. Its effects in Kidney transplant (KT) patients are limited to some published cases. Methods: We performed a retrospective observational study that included all KT patients admitted between August 01, 2020 and December 31, 2020 with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who received remdesivir. The objective of this study was to describe the experience of a cohort of KT patients treated with remdesivir. Discussion: A total of 37 KT patients developed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 7 of them received treatment with remdesivir. The rest of the patients did not receive the drug due to either CKD-EPI less than 30mL/min or they did not present clinical criteria. In addition to remdesivir, all pacients received dexamethasone and anticoagulation therapy. 4 were men, the median age was 59 (53-71) years. Median time from transplantation was 43 (16-82) months. Chest X-rays of all patients showed pulmonary infiltrates and required low oxygen flow therapy upon admission, requiring high flow nasal therapy in 3 cases. Only 2 cases presented deterioration of the graft function, not requiring hemodialysis in any case, and all recovered renal function at hospital discharge. 2 patients rise up 1.5 times the liver function test. No patient died or required admission to the critical care unit. Median days of admission was 12 (9-27) days. Conclusions: Our study suggests that the use of remdesivir could be useful in KT patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia without side effects.

We put forward a spatial, information-theoretic approach to critically examine the link between voting behavior and COVID-19 incidence in the 2020 presidential elections. The approach overcomes classical limitations of traditional regression analysis, where it does not require an underlying mathematical model and it can capture nonlinear interactions. From the analysis of county-level data, we uncovered a robust association between voting behavior and prevalence of COVID-19 cases. Surprisingly, such an association points in the opposite direction from the accepted narrative: in counties that experienced less COVID-19 cases, the incumbent President lost more ground to his opponent, now President Joseph R. Biden Jr. A tenable explanation of this observation is the different attitude of liberal and conservative voters toward the pandemic, which led to more COVID-19 spreading in counties with a larger share of republican voters.","output":"Quantifying the role of the COVID-19 pandemic in the 2020 U.S. presidential elections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the increasing number of published case reports and studies, probability of newborns acquiring COVID-19 infection through vertical transmission is on rise.

OBJECTIVES: To analyze COVID-19 death rates in European countries or regions to determine whether there was a significant association between bacillus Calmette-Gurin (BCG) vaccination policy and lower rates of COVID-19 related deaths. METHODS: Certain Northern European countries or regions had low death rates regardless of BCG policy. The authors assumed the consumption of foods containing salmiak (NH4Cl) was a common and peculiar cause of the reduced COVID-19 related death rates in these countries, because NH4Cl is a known lysosomotropic agent, which has been indicated to inhibit or prevent SARS-CoV infection. To check the possible effectiveness of salmiak consumption against COVID-19 related death, the authors used a linear regression model with the death rate as the dependent variable and BCG-policy and salmiak consumption score as independent variables. RESULTS: Using least squares regression and a robust standard error algorithm, the authors found a significant effect exerted by the independent variables (P < 0.0005 for BCG and P = 0.001 for salmiak). Salmiak score alone was significant (P = 0.016) when using least squares regression with robust error algorithm. CONCLUSIONS: The results seem to confirm an association between BCG-positive vaccination policy and salmiak consumption, and lower death rates from COVID-19. Implementing BCG vaccination policy and fortification of foods with salmiak (NH4Cl) may have a significant impact on the control of SARS-CoV epidemic.","output":"Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccination Policy and Consumption of Ammonium Chloride-Enriched Confectioneries May Be Factors Reducing COVID-19 Death Rates in Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In pancreatic cancer, imaging plays an essential role in surveillance, diagnosis, resectability evaluation, and treatment response evaluation.

He has no other health conditions of note. Brian lives with his parents and an older brother, who also has ASD, in a rural area 2 hours from the center where he was diagnosed. Brian has a history of intermittent self-injurious behaviors (head-banging, throwing himself onto the floor, etc.) that regularly result in bruising, intense and lengthy tantrums, and aggression toward family and teachers. Brian will occasionally indicate items that he wants, but otherwise has no functional communication skills. Over the past 18 months, Brian's challenging behaviors have waxed and waned. The regional special education program is not equipped to safely manage his behaviors, and there are no in-home or center-based agencies that provide applied behavior analysis (ABA) available. Brian's developmental pediatrician initiated guanfacine (eventually adding a small dose of aripiprazole) and referred the family to psychology for weekly telehealth behavioral parent training to address behavioral concerns using the Research Units in Behavioral Intervention curriculum.Brian's behavioral problems decreased during the initial weeks of the COVID-19 crisis, when he no longer had to leave home or attend special education. However, as summer continued, his behaviors worsened substantially (regular bruising and tissue damage, numerous after-hours consultations with his psychologist and developmental pediatrician, and one trip to the emergency department). The intensity of Brian's behaviors (maintained primarily by access to tangible items and escape from demands) made progress with behavioral supports slow and discouraging for his parents. Other psychosocial stressors coalesced for the family as well, including employment loss, limited social support because of social distancing requirements, and illness of one of his parents.

The basic reproduction number of the special case of the model without immigration of infective people is derived. We varied two key factors that affect the transmission of COVID-19, namely the immigration and vaccination rates. In addition, we considered two different SARS-CoV-2 transmissibilities in order to account for new more contagious variants such as Omicron. Numerical simulations using initial conditions approximating the situation in the US when the vaccination program was starting show that increasing the vaccination rate significantly improves the outcomes regarding the number of deaths, cumulative infected and cumulative asymptomatic. Other factors are the natural recovery rates of infected and asymptomatic individuals, the waning rate of the vaccine and the vaccination rate. When the immigration rate is increased significantly, the number of deaths, cumulative infected and cumulative asymptomatic increase.

RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were included. Of these, 8% were smokers, 54% had been to Wuhan, and 46% had comorbidities. Before acute exacerbation, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (232.9  88.7) was present, and chest CT scans showed the number of involved lobes was 4 (2C5) and total CT score was 6 (2C8). Following acute exacerbation, patients were likely to have more clinical symptoms (p < 0.01) and abnormal laboratory changes (p < 0.01).

Accepting wildlife cases is often perceived by (prospective) clients as a positive reinforcement of a veterinarian's compassion toward animals and can serve, directly or indirectly, as a method of increasing a veterinarian's domestic and exotic pet caseload. One ethical consideration to make with these cases is deciding when intervention may interfere with a natural process occurring in a population. The potential costs of accepting wildlife cases usually include expenses associated with captivity, treatment, release, and failure to reestablish the animal in the wild, as well as the welfare risks to conspeci?cs and other species through the possible introduction of infection or competition for resources and the upset in natural selection (for example, treating animals that have increased susceptibility to disease may inadvertently select for less ?t animals). The potential benefits associated with working with these animals include the emotional pleasure humans derive from helping a lesser species, the potential to educate the public, and the opportunities this type of medicine provides for monitoring threats to wildlife and human populations.","output":"WILDLIFE"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has posed the greatest challenge to the water sector in the 21st century A recent roundtable discussion offers insights from a range of water professionals on the challenges they've faced and the strategies they've used to maintain operations","output":"Water Professionals Reflect on Pandemic Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Caring for patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in the hospital presents unique challenges. This review provides an update on significant issues relevant to the inpatient management of T1D. Topics include trends in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hypoglycemia, and adapting ambulatory technologies for inpatient use. RECENT FINDINGS: Rates of DKA in the United States are rising. Although socioeconomic status, health insurance coverage, and hemoglobin A1c are persistently associated with DKA in individuals with T1D, newer risk factors have also emerged. These include the off-label use of sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitor medications, immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced diabetes, and infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Hypoglycemia is common among hospitalized patients with T1D. Use of validated hypoglycemia risk prediction models and multidisciplinary care initiatives can reduce the risk of inpatient hypoglycemia. Finally, continuous glucose monitoring is being adapted for use in the hospital setting and has shown promise during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

This paper evaluates the expected effects of a tobacco tax increase on the Sustainable Development Goals in Colombia. Methods: We use microsimulation to build an artificial society that mimics the observed characteristics of Colombias population, and from there we simulate the behavioral response to a tax increase of COP$4,750 (an increase that has been discussed by policy makers and legislators) and the subsequent effects in all SDGs. Results: The tobacco tax hike reduces the number of smokers (from 4.51 to 3.45 MM smokers) and smoking intensity, resulting in a drop in the number of cigarettes smoked in Colombia (from 332.3 to 215.5 MM of 20-stick packs). Such reduction is expected to decrease premature mortality, healthcare costs, poverty and people facing catastrophic expenditure on healthcare, to increase health, income and gender equity, and to strengthen domestic resource mobilization even in the presence of illicit cigarettes. Conclusion: Tobacco taxes are an effective intervention for public health and a powerful instrument to advance on the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. Relevance: A comprehensive analysis of the impact of tobacco taxes on all areas of Sustainable Development is missing in the empirical literature. Such perspective is needed to break the barriers for further tobacco tax increases by gathering wider societal support, especially from stakeholders and key decision makers from development areas other than health.

The demand for high quality face masks has seen an upsurge in the recent times, leading to exploration of alternative economic and easily available options, without compromising on the quality. Particle removal from air in terms of capture efficiency of the filter media or the face mask is a crucial parameter for testing and quality assurance. Short-term reusability of the face masks is also an important aspect as the demand for masks will potentially outstrip the supply in future. Sterilization Wraps, which are used to wrap sterile surgical instruments, have shown a promising performance in terms of removal of particles from air. In this study, we evaluate the particle filtration characteristics of face masks made of 2 different metric weights [45 and 60 gram per square metre (GSM)] respectively, using locally available Sterilization Wraps. The aerosol filtration characteristics were also studied after sterilisation by different techniques such as heat with 50% humidity (thermal treatment), ethylene oxide (ETO), steam and radiation dose of 30kGy. We found that 60 GSM face mask had particle capture efficiency of 94% for total particles greater than 0.3 microns and this capture efficiency was maintained even after sterilisation with ETO and thermal treatment. The cost of producing these masks was 30 US cents/mask at our institute. Our study suggests that sterilization wrap material made of non-woven polypropylene spunbond-meltblown-spunbond (SMS) fibres could be an appropriate readily available inexpensive material for making face masks or N95 respirators.","output":"Particle removal from air by face masks made from Sterilization Wraps: Effectiveness and Reusability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents simulations of the potential effect of COVID-19-related school closures on schooling and learning outcomes It considers four scenarios - varying in both the duration of school closures and the effectiveness of any mitigation strategies being deployed by governments Using data on 174 countries, the analysis finds that the global level of schooling and learning will fall substantially School closures could result in a loss of between 0 3 and 1 1 years of schooling adjusted for quality, bringing down the effective years of basic schooling that students achieve during their lifetime from 7 8 years to between 6 7 and 7 5 years Close to 11 million students from primary up to secondary education could drop out due to the income shock of the pandemic alone Exclusion and inequality will likely be exacerbated if already marginalized and vulnerable groups, such as girls, ethnic minorities, and persons with disabilities, are more adversely affected by school closures Students from the current cohort could, on average, face a reduction of $366 to $1,776 in yearly earnings In present value terms, this amounts to between $6,680 and $32,397 dollars in lost earnings over a typical student's lifetime Globally, a school shutdown of 5 months could generate learning losses that have a present value of $10 trillion By this measure, the world could stand to lose as much as 16 percent of the investments that governments make in the basic education of this cohort of students In the pessimistic and very pessimistic scenarios, cumulative losses could add up to between $16 and $20 trillion in present value terms Unless drastic remedial action is taken, the world could face a substantial setback in achieving the goal of halving the percentage of learning poor by 2030 ? 2021 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / THE WORLD BANK","output":"Simulating the Potential Impacts of COVID-19 School Closures on Schooling and Learning Outcomes: A Set of Global Estimates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In chapter nine, When Sports Stood Still: COVID-19 and the Lost Season, \\" Donna J.

The isolate with the largest zone was identified by PCR. Sixty fish were used to test the safety of a potential probiotic. One hundred and eighty fish were used in a two-month feeding experiment. Fish were divided into 3 groups, group (1): the control, group (2): fed on potential probiotics, and group (3): fed on commercial probiotic (Organic Green&#8482;). The effects of tested products on the immune response were recorded in all groups. After one and two months of feeding experiment, blood and nonspecific immune parameters were evaluated. Disease resistance against Aeromonas hydrophila was evaluated through challenge experiment. The histopathology of the treated groups was fully recorded in comparison with the control group. The potential probiotic based on the in vitro antimicrobial activity test was identified as P. putida using routine and gel electrophoresis and 16S rRNA sequencing. During the first and the second month of experiment, there was a highly significant increase in the survival percent of the experimental fish in both treated groups with probiotics. In the first phase of the experiment, a significant increase in the haematocrit values and NBT, lysozyme activity, and phagocytic activity was seen in all treated groups in comparison with the control.

Underpowering and lack of reproducibility due to small sample sizes have weakened conclusions of these investigations.

These investigations take advantage of the ability to reliably track the activity of a participant's computer keyboard, mouse, and eye gaze in the context of large-scale studies online that involve diverse research participant pools. Crowdsourcing allows for testing the generalizability of behavioral hypotheses in real-life environments that are less accessible to lab-designed investigations. Crowdsourcing is further useful when in-laboratory studies are limited, for example during the current COVID-19 pandemic.

Important considerations need to be given to retrograde embolic migration or perforator involvement while treating these fistulas endovascularly with a liquid embolic agent. We report a lateral spinal artery feeding the DAVF, the recognition of which is important to avoid potential catastrophic complications during definitive therapy, and which has not been described before. OBJECTIVE To discuss the anatomy of the lateral spinal artery (LSA) and its communications with pial arteries such as the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) that may have important implications in the management of neurovascular diseases in and around the foramen magnum. METHODS A retrospective analysis of cerebral angiograms and 3-dimensional rotational angiograms of a patient with medullary-bridging vein DAVF treated by transarterial embolization under balloon protection was performed after the patient developed lateral medullary syndrome in the postoperative period. RESULTS Detailed analysis revealed a dural branch from the LSA feeding the DAVF which anastomosed with rudimentary PICA. CONCLUSION LSA has important anastomoses with perforating arteries of the medulla and cervical cord and, hence, it is important to recognize and identify LSA prospectively in the vascular pathologies of the foramen magnum to avoid fatal neurological complications during endovascular therapy. This is especially important while treating neurovascular pathologies using liquid embolic agents such as Onyx or SQUID, because they can percolate retrogradely through the anastomoses into PICA or other vertebrobasilar perforators.","output":"The Lurking Catastrophic Complication of an Equally Catastrophic Disease: The Lesson Learned."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become a public health emergency of global concern.

Topics include \\"Adrenal Masses,\\" \\"Preventing Misdiagnosis,\\" and \\"The Use of CT in Cancer Screening.\\" Unrelatedly, we started hosting remote case conference meetings for the faculty in our radiology department soon after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with an aim to help faculty learn while maintaining a sense of community during this new era of heavy remote work after having held these conferences in person for nearly 15 years. During the case conferences, we show approximately 3-6 slide pairs for each case and quiz the faculty on the diagnosis. In December 2020, we decided to merge the two practices and host additional case conferences each month on Facebook Live via Zoom. We theorized that this would give our followers a better sense of community while teaching and reviewing diagnostic cases. Our goal was to increase engagement with our users. Here, we compare these methods of education in terms of popularity with our users and make recommendations to radiology education peers for using images in their live videos to create content more applicable to viewers.","output":"Facebook Live: One Year of Traditional Discussions vs. Case Conferences."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report a high-throughput method that enables us to automatically compute the vibrational spectra of more than 100,000 proteins available in the Protein Data Bank to date, in a consistent manner. Using this new algorithm we report a comprehensive database of the normal mode frequencies of all known protein structures, which has not been available before. We then use the resulting frequency spectra of the proteins to generate audible sound by overlaying the molecular vibrations and translating them to the audible frequency range using the music theoretic concept of transpositional equivalence. The method, implemented as a Max audio device for use in a digital audio workstation (DAW), provides unparalleled insights into the rich vibrational signatures of protein structures, and offers a new way for creative expression by using it as a new type of musical instrument. This musical instrument is fully defined by the vibrational feature of almost all known protein structures, making it fundamentally different from all the traditional instruments that are limited by the material properties of a few types of conventional engineering materials, such as wood, metals or polymers.","output":"Analysis of the vibrational and sound spectrum of over 100,000 protein structures and application in sonification."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The establishment of assisted spontaneous breathing is a phase of ventilation therapy that is generally considered to be beneficial and not dangerous.

Herein we provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2 spreads through cell-cell contact in cultures, mediated by the spike glycoprotein. SARS-CoV-2 spike is more efficient in facilitating cell-to-cell transmission than SARS-CoV spike, which reflects, in part, their differential cell-cell fusion activity. Interestingly, treatment of cocultured cells with endosomal entry inhibitors impairs cell-to-cell transmission, implicating endosomal membrane fusion as an underlying mechanism. Compared with cell-free infection, cell-to-cell transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is refractory to inhibition by neutralizing antibody or convalescent sera of COVID-19 patients. While ACE2 enhances cell-to-cell transmission, we find that it is not absolutely required. Notably, despite differences in cell-free infectivity, the variants of concern (VOC) B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 have similar cell-to-cell transmission capability. Moreover, B.1.351 is more resistant to neutralization by vaccinee sera in cell-free infection, whereas B.1.1.7 is more resistant to inhibition by vaccine sera in cell-to-cell transmission. Overall, our study reveals critical features of SARS-CoV-2 spike-mediated cell-to-cell transmission, with important implications for a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 spread and pathogenesis.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Spreads through Cell-to-Cell Transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives It is essential to engage learners in efforts aimed at dismantling racism and other contributors to health care disparities. Barriers to their involvement include limited access to data. The objective of our study was to create a data dashboard using an existing quality improvement (QI) infrastructure and provide resident access to data to facilitate exploratory analysis on disparities in emergency department (ED) patient care. Methods Focusing on patient populations that have previously been shown in the literature to suffer significant disparities in the ED, we extracted outcomes across a variety of metrics already collected as part of routine ED operations. Using data visualization software, we developed an interactive dashboard for visual exploratory analyses. Results We designed a dashboard for our resident learners with views that are flexible and allow user selected filters to view clinical outcomes by patient age, treatment area, and chief complaint. Learners were also allowed to select grouping and outcomes of interest to investigate questions and form new hypotheses of their choosing. Available dashboard views included summary counts view to assess ED visits over time by selectable group, a rooming and triage acuity view, time-to-event survival curve view, histogram and box plot views for continuous variables, a view to assess outcome variables by time of day of ED arrival, customizable contingency table views, and correspondence analysis. Conclusions Utilizing an existing QI infrastructure, we developed a dashboard that provides a new perspective into commonly collected ED operations data to allow for the exploration of disparities in ED care that is accessible to learners.

Speech and language therapy interventions work, especially in high doses, but these doses are rarely achieved outside of research studies. Intensive Comprehensive Aphasia Programs (ICAPs) are an option to deliver high doses of therapy to people with aphasia over a short period of time. METHODS: Forty-six people with aphasia in the chronic stage poststroke completed the ICAP over a 3-week period, attending for 15 days and averaging 6 hours of therapy per day. Outcome measures included the Comprehensive Aphasia Test, an impairment-based test of the 4 main domains of language (speaking, writing, auditory comprehension, and reading) which was measured at 3 time points (baseline, immediately posttreatment at 3 weeks and follow-up at 12-week post-ICAP); and, the Communicative Effectiveness Index, a carer-reported measure of functional communication skills collected at baseline and 12 weeks. RESULTS: A 2-way repeated measures multivariate ANOVA was conducted.

Understanding the patient-specific and cancer-specific features that impact the severity of COVID-19 may inform optimal cancer care during this pandemic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined consecutive patients with lung cancer and confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 (n = 102) at a single center from 12 March 2020 to 6 May 2020. Thresholds of severity were defined a priori as hospitalization, intensive care unit/intubation/do not intubate ([ICU/intubation/DNI] a composite metric of severe disease), or death. Recovery was defined as >14 days from COVID-19 test and >3 days since symptom resolution. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles were inferred from MSK-IMPACT (n = 46) and compared with controls with lung cancer and no known non-COVID-19 (n = 5166). RESULTS: COVID-19 was severe in patients with lung cancer (62% hospitalized, 25% died). Although severe, COVID-19 accounted for a minority of overall lung cancer deaths during the pandemic (11% overall). Determinants of COVID-19 severity were largely patient-specific features, including smoking status and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [odds ratio for severe COVID-19 2.9, 95% confidence interval 1.07-9.44 comparing the median (23.5 pack-years) to never-smoker and 3.87, 95% confidence interval 1.35-9.68, respectively]. Cancer-specific features, including prior thoracic surgery/radiation and recent systemic therapies did not impact severity. Human leukocyte antigen supertypes were generally similar in mild or severe cases of COVID-19 compared with non-COVID-19 controls. Most patients recovered from COVID-19, including 25% patients initially requiring intubation. Among hospitalized patients, hydroxychloroquine did not improve COVID-19 outcomes. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is associated with high burden of severity in patients with lung cancer. Patient-specific features, rather than cancer-specific features or treatments, are the greatest determinants of severity.","output":"COVID-19 in patients with lung cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Household cleaning products may be a significant source of chemical exposures, including carcinogens and suspected endocrine disruptors. OBJECTIVES: We characterized exposures during routine household cleaning and tested an intervention to reduce exposures to cleaning product chemicals.

Youth researchers conducted personal air monitoring with 50 Latina women while they cleaned their homes with their regular cleaning products (preintervention visit) and then 1 week later while they used green cleaning products provided by the study (postintervention visit). Air samples were analyzed for volatile and semivolatile organic compounds using gas chromatographyCmass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography. We compared pre- and postintervention air concentrations of 47 chemicals of concern, selected because they were on Californias Proposition 65 list of carcinogens or reproductive/developmental toxicants or were suspected endocrine disruptors. Youth researchers were integrally involved in the study design, data collection, interpretation, and dissemination of findings. RESULTS: We observed statistically significant decreases in air concentrations of 17 chemicals of concern when participants switched to green cleaning products, including decreases in geometric mean concentrations of 1,4-dioxane ([Formula: see text]), chloroform ([Formula: see text]), benzene ([Formula: see text]), naphthalene ([Formula: see text]), toluene ([Formula: see text]), and hexane ([Formula: see text]).

METHODS: We included all singleton children born in Denmark between 1995 and 2008, who were listed in the Danish National School Test Register (n=738,862). Children born to women with SLE were identified through linkage of national healthcare registers. We assessed the children's performance in the national school tests between 2nd and 8th grade, in reading and mathematics. Information on the mothers' redeemed prescriptions in pregnancy was included in stratified analyses. Differences of mean test scores were derived from linear regressions and compared according to maternal SLE status, and predefined categories of medication exposures. RESULTS: In total, 312 (0.04%) children were born to mothers with SLE. There were no differences in performance in neither reading nor mathematics tests between those born to mothers with SLE and children born to mothers without SLE. When stratifying on medication exposures among children whose mothers had SLE, there was a non-significant tendency towards poorer results among those exposed to hydroxychloroquine and/or immunosuppressants (n=31), compared to those not exposed to these medications. A similar tendency was not observed among children whose mothers received hydroxychloroquine for non-SLE reasons (n=1,235).

Global health is increasingly viewed not just as a humanitarian obligation, but also as a vehicle for health diplomacy and part of the broader mission to reduce poverty, build stronger economies, and strengthen global security. Despite the global economic recession, there are trends that portend well for support of global health efforts: increased globalization of research and development, growing investment from private philanthropy, an absolute growth of spending in research and innovation, and an enhanced interest in global health among young people. More systematic and far-reaching efforts will be required to address oral health inequalities through the engagement of oral health funders and sponsors of research, with partners from multiple public and private sectors. The oral health community must be \\"at the table\\" with other health disciplines and create opportunities for eliminating inequalities through collaborations that can harness both the intellectual and financial resources of multiple sectors and institutions.","output":"Global oral health inequalities: the view from a research funder."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The widespread and rapid social and economic changes from Covid-19 response might be expected to dramatically improve air quality However, national monitoring data from the US Environmental Protection Agency for criteria pollutants (PM2 5, ozone, NO2, CO, PM10) provide inconsistent support for that expectation Specifically, during stay-at-home orders, average PM2 5 levels were slightly higher (~10% of its multi-year interquartile range [IQR]) than expected;average ozone, NO2, CO, and PM10 levels were slightly lower (~30%, ~20%, ~27%, and ~1% of their IQR, respectively) than expected The timing of peak anomaly, relative to the stay-at-home orders, varied by pollutant (ozone: 2 weeks before;NO2, CO: 3 weeks after;PM10: 2 weeks after);but, by 5-6 weeks after stay-at-home orders, the concentration anomalies appear to have ended For PM2 5, ozone, CO, and PM10, no US state had lower-than-expected pollution levels for all weeks during stay-at-home-orders;for NO2, only Arizona had lower-than-expected levels for all weeks during stay-at-home orders Our findings show that the enormous changes from the Covid-19 response have not lowered PM2 5 levels across the US beyond their normal range of variability;for ozone, NO2, CO, and PM10 concentrations were lowered but the reduction was modest and transient","output":"Changes in criteria air pollution levels in the US before, during, and after Covid-19 stay-at-home orders: evidence from regulatory monitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Audio signals generated by the human body (e.g., sighs, breathing, heart, digestion, vibration sounds) have routinely been used by clinicians as diagnostic or progression indicators for diseases and disease onset. However, until recently, such signals were usually collected through manual auscultation at scheduled visits. Research has now started to use digital technology to gather bodily sounds (e.g., from digital stethoscopes) for cardiovascular or respiratory examination, which could then be used for automatic analysis. Some initial work shows promise in detecting diagnostic signals of COVID-19 from voice and coughs. In this paper we describe our data analysis over a large-scale crowdsourced dataset of respiratory sounds collected to aid diagnosis of COVID-19. We use coughs and breathing to understand how discernible COVID-19 sounds are from those in asthma or healthy controls. Our results show that even a simple binary machine learning classifier is able to classify correctly healthy and COVID-19 sounds. We also show how we distinguish a user who tested positive for COVID-19 and has a cough from a healthy user with cough, and users who tested positive for COVID-19 and have a cough from users with asthma and a cough. Our models achieve an AUC above 70% across all tasks. Clearly these results are preliminary and only scratch the surface of the possibilities of the exploitation of this type of data and audio-based machine learning.

Plitidepsin is an antitumor agent of marine origin that has also shown a potent pre-clinical efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. Plitidepsin targets the host protein eEF1A (eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha) and affects viral infection at an early, post-entry step. Because electron microscopy is a valuable tool to study virus-cell interactions and the mechanism of action of antiviral drugs, in this work we have used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to evaluate the effects of plitidepsin in SARS-CoV-2 infection in cultured Vero E6 cells 24 and 48h post-infection. In the absence of plitidepsin, TEM morphological analysis showed double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), organelles that support coronavirus genome replication, single-membrane vesicles with viral particles, large vacuoles with groups of viruses and numerous extracellular virions attached to the plasma membrane. When treated with plitidepsin, no viral structures were found in SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero E6 cells. Immunogold detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) provided clear signals in cells infected in the absence of plitidepsin, but complete absence in cells infected and treated with plitidepsin. The present study shows that plitidepsin blocks the biogenesis of viral replication organelles and the morphogenesis of virus progeny. Electron microscopy morphological analysis coupled to immunogold labeling of SARS-CoV-2 products offers a unique approach to understand how antivirals such as plitidepsin work.","output":"Unraveling the antiviral activity of plitidepsin by subcellular and morphological analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The clinical and laboratory features of severe COVID\\\\19 infection overlap with those of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a hyperinflammatory disorder often associated with several viral infections.

METHODS: We analyzed clinicopathological and laboratory features of thirteen patients with severe COVID\\\\19 infection suspected to have HLH and found to have hemophagocytic histiocytosis on bone marrow examination (BME). RESULTS: Five of thirteen (38.46%) patients fulfilled five of eight HLH 2004 criteria and/or had a H\\\\score 169. Three (23.08%) satisfied four of eight and remainder five (38.46%) satisfied three of eight HLH 2004 criteria.

During this time, countries around the world imposed lockdowns and social distancing measures. The physical movements of people ground to a halt, while their online interactions increased as they turned to engaging with each other virtually. As the means of communication shifted online, information consumption also shifted online. Governing authorities and health agencies have intentionally shifted their focus to use social media and online platforms to spread factual and timely information. However, this has also opened the gate for misinformation, contributing to and accelerating the phenomenon of misinfodemics. OBJECTIVE: We carried out an analysis of Twitter discourse on over 1 billion tweets related to COVID-19 over a year to identify and investigate prevalent misinformation narratives and trends. We also aimed to describe the Twitter audience that is more susceptible to health-related misinformation and the network mechanisms driving misinfodemics. METHODS: We leveraged a data set that we collected and made public, which contained over 1 billion tweets related to COVID-19 between January 2020 and April 2021. We created a subset of this larger data set by isolating tweets that included URLs with domains that had been identified by Media Bias/Fact Check as being prone to questionable and misinformation content. By leveraging clustering and topic modeling techniques, we identified major narratives, including health misinformation and conspiracies, which were present within this subset of tweets. RESULTS: Our focus was on a subset of 12,689,165 tweets that we determined were representative of COVID-19 misinformation narratives in our full data set. When analyzing tweets that shared content from domains known to be questionable or that promoted misinformation, we found that a few key misinformation narratives emerged about hydroxychloroquine and alternative medicines, US officials and governing agencies, and COVID-19 prevention measures. We further analyzed the misinformation retweet network and found that users who shared both questionable and conspiracy-related content were clustered more closely in the network than others, supporting the hypothesis that echo chambers can contribute to the spread of health misinfodemics. CONCLUSIONS: We presented a summary and analysis of the major misinformation discourse surrounding COVID-19 and those who promoted and engaged with it. While misinformation is not limited to social media platforms, we hope that our insights, particularly pertaining to health-related emergencies, will help pave the way for computational infodemiology to inform health surveillance and interventions.","output":"Charting the Information and Misinformation Landscape to Characterize Misinfodemics on Social Media: COVID-19 Infodemiology Study at a Planetary Scale"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The prevalence of rotavirus and coronavirus shedding by adult cows was investigated using capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.

Nonetheless, data are lacking regarding the management of EES during this pandemic. METHODS: A web-based survey of skull base surgeons worldwide was conducted. Different practices by geographical regions and COVID-19 prevalence were analyzed. RESULTS: 135 unique responses were collected. Regarding the use of personal protection equipment (PPE), North America reported using more powered air-purifying respirators (PAPR) and Asia/Europe using more standard precautions. North America and Europe resorted more to reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for screening asymptomatic patients. High prevalence countries showed a higher use of PAPR. The medium prevalence group reported lower RT-PCR testing for symptomatic cases and the high prevalence group used it significantly more in asymptomatic cases. 19 respondents reported healthcare personnel transmission of COVID-19 from EES, with a higher rate of transmission among countries classified as having a medium prevalence of COVID-19. These specific respondents (medium prevalence) also reported a lower use of airborne PPE. In the cases of healthcare transmission, the patient was reportedly asymptomatic 32% of the time.

We compared direct VIC in 1109 consecutive bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) and a well-validated CMV-QNAT (Basel-CMV-UL111a-77bp). In the retrospective group-1 (N=694) and group-2 (N=303), CMV-QNAT was performed within 48 hours from 2-fold and 10-fold concentrated total nucleic acid (TNA)-eluates, respectively. In group-3 (N=112), 2-fold and 10-fold concentrated TNA-eluates were prospectively analyzed in parallel to VIC. CMV was detected by VIC in 79/694 (11%) and 26/303 (9%) of group-1 and -2, but in 114/694 (16%) and 57/303 (17%) by CMV-QNAT, respectively. Median CMV-loads were significantly higher in VIC-positive than in VIC-negative BALF. The likelihood for CMV-detection by VIC was 85% for BALF CMV-loads >4 log10 copies/mL. In the prospective group-3, CMV was detected by VIC in 10/112 (9%), and in 14/112 (13%) and 20/112 (18%) by CMV-QNAT, when using 2-fold and 10-fold concentrated TNA-eluates, respectively. Notably, CMV was undetectable by CMV-QNAT in 10 VIC-positive cases of group-1 and -2, but in none of group-3. We conclude that CMV-QNAT can be adopted to BALF diagnostics but require several careful steps in validation. CMV-QNAT loads >10'000 copies/mL in BALF may indicate significant CMV replication as defined by VIC, if short shipment and processing procedures can be guaranteed. Discordance of detecting CMV in time-matched plasma samples emphasies the role of local CMV replication, for which histopathology remains the gold standard of proven CMV pneumonia.

For people living with cancer, treatments are interrupted, surgeries cancelled and regular oncology evaluations rescheduled. People with cancer and their physicians must balance plausible fears of COVID-19 and cancer treatment with the consequences of delaying cancer care. We aim to evaluate the experience of women with ovarian cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Women with a current or prior diagnosis of ovarian cancer completed an online survey focusing on treatment interruptions and quality of life (QOL). QOL was measured with the Cancer Worry Scale and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The survey was distributed through survivor networks and social media. Univariate and multivariable linear regression analysis were utilized to evaluate the effect of participant characteristics on QOL survey scores. Results Six hundred and three women, from 41 states, visited the survey website between March 30 and April 13, 2020 and 555 (92.0%) completed the survey. The median age was 58 years (range 20-85). Two hundred and seventeen participants (43.3%) were in active treatment at the time of survey completion. One hundred and seventy-five participants (33%) experienced a delay in some component of their cancer care. Ten (26.3%) of the 38 participants scheduled for surgery experienced a delay and 18 (8.3%) of the 217 participants scheuled for nonsurgical cancer treatment. One hundred and thirty-three participants (24.0%) had a delayed physician appointment, 84 (15.1%) laboratory test and 53 (9.6%) cancer related imaging. Among the cohort, 88.6% (489) reported significant cancer worry, 51.4% (285) borderline or abnormal anxiety and 26.5% (147) borderline or abnormal depression. On univariate analysis, age less than 65 years, being scheduled for cancer treatment or cancer surgery, delay in oncology care, self-described as immunocompromised and use of telemedicine were all associated with higher levels of cancer worry. Higher anxiety scores were associated with age less than 65 years and self-described as immunocompromised. Higher depression scores were associated with age less than 65 years, being scheduled for cancer surgery, delay in oncology care, self-described as immunocompromised and use of telemedicine. On multivariable linear regression analysis, age less than 65 and being self-described as immunocompromised were independently predictive of greater cancer worry, anxiety and depression and delay in cancer care was predictive of anxiety and depression. Conclusions The COVID-19 crisis is impacting care of ovarian cancer patients: surgeries, treatments, scheduled physician appointments, laboratory tests and imaging are cancelled or delayed. Younger age, presumed immunocompromise and delay in cancer care were associated with significantly higher levels of cancer worry, anxiety and depression.

However, the effects of these drugs on HCoV-229E replication and infection-induced inflammation in the human airway are unknown. METHODS: Primary human nasal (HNE) and tracheal (HTE) epithelial cell cultures were infected with HCoV-229E. RESULTS: Pretreatment of HNE and HTE cells with glycopyrronium or formoterol decreased viral RNA levels and/or titers, the expression of the HCoV-229E receptor CD13, the number and fluorescence intensity of acidic endosomes where HCoV-229E RNA enters the cytoplasm, and the infection-induced production of cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8, and IFN-. Treatment of the cells with the CD13 inhibitor 22-dipyridyl decreased viral titers. Pretreatment of the cells with a combination of three drugs (glycopyrronium, formoterol, and budesonide) exerted additive inhibitory effects on viral titers and cytokine production. Pretreatment of HNE cells with glycopyrronium or formoterol reduced the susceptibility to infection, and pretreatment with the three drugs inhibited activation of nuclear factor-kappa B p50 and p65 proteins. Pretreatment with formoterol increased cAMP levels and treatment with cAMP decreased viral titers, CD13 expression, and the fluorescence intensity of acidic endosomes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that glycopyrronium, formoterol, and a combination of glycopyrronium, formoterol, and budesonide inhibit HCoV-229E replication partly by inhibiting receptor expression and/or endosomal function and that these drugs modulate infection-induced inflammation in the airway.","output":"Inhibitory effects of glycopyrronium, formoterol, and budesonide on coronavirus HCoV-229E replication and cytokine production by primary cultures of human nasal and tracheal epithelial cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic has inflicted a painful unforgettable number of deaths throughout the world. Hematological inflammatory and organ-specific biomarkers are universally practiced in helping clinical decisions in various infectious diseases. Accordingly, their role in predicting progression and severity, and fatal outcome of COVID-19 was investigated to take initial appropriate treatment measures to reduce associated mortality. MethodsThe retrospective analysis of a total of 126 COVID-19 cases representing mild, moderate, severe, and succumbed cases were assessed for the pattern of hematological, inflammatory, and organ-specific biomarkers. ResultsA total of 126 proven cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were retrospectively analyzed for the association of various biomarkers with the COVID-19 disease progression. The CBC analysis showed that the median TLC was high for the severe group of both males (12.49 x 103/l) and females (14.23 x103/l). Similarly, the neutrophil count was also found high in the severe group, whereas the monocytes count showed low median values in severe cases, but both these parameters had no significant difference among the males and the females. The platelet count showed a significant difference (p=0.018) among the non-severe and severe groups between males and females. Among inflammatory markers, D-dimer, CRP, LDH, and APTT showed a higher median value in severe cases among both the males and females while ESR value was higher in non-severe cases and ferritin showed similar values in both severe and non-severe cases.

The increasing global demand for Bupleuri Radix cannot be fulfilled with wild populations only. Therefore, cultivated Bupleurum is now the main commercial source of this medicinal product. Different species of Bupleurum show different medicinal properties and clinical effects, making reliable authentication and assignment of correct botanical origin for medicinal species critical. However, accurate identification of the cultivated Bupleurum species is difficult due to dramatic morphological variations resulting from cultivation. In this study, we sampled 56 cultivated Bupleurum populations of six different morphotypes (Types A-F) from the main production areas of China, and 10 wild populations of four species were used as reference materials. Conventional DNA barcoding was conducted to identify cultivated Bupleurum species. Additionally, verification based on complete chloroplast genomes was performed and new chloroplast markers were developed and evaluated.

Moreover, sleep difficulties seem to be more prominent in the older group during the pandemic, suggesting that there could be additional risk factors involved. The current study aimed to investigate the role of resilience in the association between changes in sleep and the subjective sleep quality (SSQ) in teens and young adults during COVID-19. METHODS: 289 teens (12-17 years old) and 294 young adults (18-25 years old) completed the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-10 and an adapted version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index online. Teens and young adults were each divided into a resilient and less resilient group. Hierarchical regression models were conducted to examine the unique contribution of weekdays sleep duration, sleep difficulties, and resilience to SSQ. Sleep duration, sleep difficulties and SSQ before COVID-19, and gender were entered as controls. RESULTS: Results show that in less resilient teens, changes in sleep onset difficulties (=-.285, p=.003), nocturnal and early awakenings (=-.218, p=.019), and weekdays sleep duration (=.282, p=.001) significantly predicted SSQ and explained 36.5% of the variance. In less resilient young adults, changes in nightmares (=-.309, p=.027) and sleep onset difficulties (=-.263, p=.012) significantly predicted SSQ and explained 24.1% of the variance. In resilient teens, changes in weekdays sleep duration (=.296, p=.007) significantly predicted SSQ and explained 20.1% of the variance. In resilient adults, changes in sleep onset difficulties (=-.325, p=.001), nocturnal and early awakenings (=-.374, p=.000), and weekdays sleep duration (=.192, p=.009) significantly predicted SSQ and explained 46.0% of the variance. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that resilience appears to be a protecting factor in the impacts of sleep difficulties on sleep quality, but only in adolescents. Indeed, in young adults, sleep difficulties seem to be a more important factor modulating sleep quality than changes in sleep duration. These results underline the importance of focusing on the intrinsic characteristics of each population to better target interventions.

This has led to widespread research for the identification of molecular-based biomarkers. Among them, survivin is a recently characterized protein which is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis family. The aim of this study is evaluating the expression of survivin in oral leukoplakia, oral lichen planus, and OSCC compared with normal mucosa. Materials and Methods The retrospective study consisted of twenty cases of oral leukoplakia, oral lichen planus, and OSCC in the age group of 20-70 years. Twenty cases of normal mucosa made up the control group. Immunohistochemical staining was performed with the use of survivin polyclonal antibody. Grades of expression of survivin were evaluated. Kruskal-Wallis test was used for statistical analysis. Results The expression of survivin was higher in OSCC (80%) when compared to oral leukoplakia (70%), oral lichen planus (45%), and normal mucosa (35%). The variation in the expression of survivin between the samples was statistically significant with P = 0.015 (Kruskal-Wallis test significant at 0.01 level).

In the third world countries, information about CAP etiology is scarce. Therefore, rapid and highly sensitive diagnostic methods are crucial to determine etiological agents. METHODS Between March 2016 and March 2017, we have prospectively studied the clinical, radiological, laboratory, and molecular aspects of patients with CAP at 2 tertiary-level hospitals in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, using a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS A total of 274 children were evaluated, with a median age of 13 months. An etiologic agent was identified in 187 patients (68.2%): 54% (n = 148) were viruses and 14.2% (n = 39) were bacteria. CAP prevalence was highest among children under 2 years (71%; 195/274); respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most frequent cause in 22% (60/274), especially among infants, followed by influenza (14.5%; 40/274). Streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for 7% of the total (19/274), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (3%;8/274) and Haemophilus influenzae (1.4%;4/274). Together, these cases accounted for 79.5% (31/39) of all bacterial CAP. Pleural effusion (PE) complicated CAP in 13.8% (38/274), of which 29 were of bacterial etiology. RT-PCR increased the detection rate of pneumococcus by 47%. Coinfection occurred in 28 patients (10%); 26 (9.5%) required intensive care and 9 patients (3%) died. CONCLUSIONS RT-PCR provided additional diagnostic value to conventional, clinical, and laboratory methods.

The present study describes detailed observations of the frequency and nature of hand-to-mouth and other hand-to-face touching behavior among 14 male and female volunteers in a controlled, quasi-naturalistic setting. Participants performed four 15-min tasks: 1) installation of a brass object as part of a short home improvement project, 2) completion of a pen-and-paper survey, 3) engagement in a telephone conversation, and 4) use of headphones to listen to music. Video recordings of the participants performing each task were reviewed and coded for touches to the face with emphasis on specific regions of the face and palmar versus dorsal contacts. During the installation task, only one of the 14 participants was observed touching his face; this was to the nose, on two separate occasions. Summed across the three non-installation tasks, including palmar and dorsal contacts, participants touched their lips, their mouth, and anywhere on their face on average (range) 5.1 (0-19), 0.4 (0-3), and 27.7 (6-49) times, respectively.

Ornithine decarboxylase 1 (ODC1) and its antienzyme 1 (OAZ1) are major regulators of polyamine biosynthesis in animal cells. Here, we report that rice yellow stunt virus (RYSV), a plant rhabdovirus, could activate putrescine biosynthesis in leafhoppers to promote viral propagation by inhibiting OAZ1 expression. We observed that the reduction of putrescine biosynthesis by treatment with difluormethylornithine (DFMO), a specific nontoxic inhibitor of ODC1, or with in vitro synthesized dsRNAs targeting ODC1 mRNA could inhibit viral infection. In contrast, the supplement of putrescine or the increase of putrescine biosynthesis by treatment with dsRNAs targeting OAZ1 mRNA could facilitate viral infection. We further determined that both RYSV matrix protein M and ODC1 directly bind to the ODC-binding domain at the C-terminus of OAZ1. Thus, viral propagation in leafhoppers would decrease the ability of OAZ1 to target and mediate the degradation of ODC1, which finally activates putrescine production to benefit viral propagation. This work reveals that polyamine-metabolizing enzymes are directly exploited by a vector-borne virus to increase polyamine production, thereby facilitating viral infection in insect vectors.

METHODS: Ten ophthalmology residents were stratified by postgraduate year and randomized to perform a corneal suturing task consisting of placing the 4 cardinal sutures for a penetrating keratoplasty in porcine eyes with or without remote ophthalmology attending feedback. Subsequently, both groups repeated the same task without remote feedback to test whether initial remote feedback affected subsequent performance. Finally, the group without feedback was crossed over to repeat the same corneal suturing task with remote feedback. The effectiveness of the remote wet lab was assessed subjectively by survey and objectively by grading each suture pass. RESULTS: Resident-reported comfort with corneal suturing improved significantly after the remote wet lab for all residents. Residents and attendings rated the remote wet lab as equally or more effective compared to prior in-person wet labs and overall effective in corneal suturing. Attendings rated the remote wet lab as effective in multiple domains of microsurgical education using a modified microsurgical global rating scale. Objective corneal suturing performance was similar for both groups. CONCLUSION: The remote wet lab was feasible and effective for training ophthalmology residents in corneal suturing.

Therefore, we updated our routine clinical protocol to 1) inform patients with ongoing treatment about the potential risks of their medications in the case of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, 2) discuss opt out of treatment temporarily, and 3) perform a closer follow-up on a monthly basis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes in patients with HS, who suspended and continued immunosuppressive therapy following COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: This retrospective study included patients with HS, who had been receiving biologic/immunosuppressive treatment when the COVID-19 pandemic was announced. Those who withdrew treatment for any reason or continued were analyzed. The primary endpoint was physician-diagnosed disease exacerbation. The secondary outcomes were changes in visual analogue scale (VAS) and COVID-19 diagnosis. Results: A total of 37 patients were included in the analysis. The majority of the patients were on adalimumab treatment (n=33). Fifteen (40.5%) patients withdrew the treatment for COVID-19 related concerns. During 83.20.6 days of follow-up following the withdrawal, all patients in this group had at least one exacerbation. Also, the mean VAS score increased from 5.70.56 to 8.60.57 (p=0.001). On the other hand, three patients (13.6%) who continued the treatment reported worsening in disease course, 12 patients (54.5%) remained stable and seven of them (31.9%) had clinical relief. We did not observe any confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in any of our 37 HS patients. Conclusions: The present study suggests that even a temporary withdrawal of biologic/immunosuppressive treatments may have significant adverse consequences on disease course and quality of life in patients with HS.

Understanding the real needs of these persons is lacking. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to contribute a fine-grained understanding of the home isolation experience of persons with mild COVID-19 symptoms to enhance AI in eHealth services. METHODS: A design research method with a qualitative approach was used to map the patient journey. Data on the home isolation experiences of persons with mild COVID-19 symptoms was collected from the top-viewed personal video stories on YouTube and their comment threads. For the analysis, this data was transcribed, coded, and mapped into the patient journey map. RESULTS: The key findings on the home isolation experience of persons with mild COVID-19 symptoms concerned (1) an awareness period before testing positive, (2) less typical and more personal symptoms, (3) a negative mood experience curve, (5) inadequate home health care service support for patients, and (6) benefits and drawbacks of social media support.

However, emerging results on the role of smoking in SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibility or COVID-19 outcomes are conflicting, and their robustness remains uncertain. OBJECTIVE: In this context, this study aims at quantifying the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence, studying the changes in antibody levels over time, and analyzing the association between the biochemically verified smoking status and SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: The research design involves a 6-month prospective cohort study with a serial sampling of the same individuals. Each participant will be surveyed about their demographics and COVID-19Crelated information, and blood sampling will be collected upon recruitment and at specified follow-up time points (ie, after 8 and 24 weeks). Blood samples will be screened for the presence of SARS-CoV-2Cspecific antibodies and serum cotinine, being the latter of the principal metabolite of nicotine, which will be used to assess participants smoking status. RESULTS: The study is ongoing. It aims to find a higher antibody prevalence in individuals at high risk for viral exposure (ie, health care personnel) and to refine current estimates on the association between smoking status and SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The added value of this research is that the current smoking status of the population to be studied will be biochemically verified to avoid the bias associated with self-reported smoking status. As such, the results from this survey may provide an actionable metric to study the role of smoking in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 outcomes, and therefore to implement the most appropriate public health measures to control the pandemic.

Methods: The data of epidemiology, clinical data and continuous dynamic chest high-resolution CT images of the patients with mild COVID-19 were analyzed retrospectively. Twenty-five patients (including 24 common type and 1 mild) were enrolled in the group, including 14 males and 11 females, with age of (4212) years and hospital stay of (195) days. The basic images and dynamic images of HRCT were analyzed and compared by the radiologists. Results: The clinical manifestations were fever (22 cases), cough (18 cases), expectoration (8 cases), pharyngeal pain (6 cases). Most laboratory tests lacked specificity. There were no significant abnormalities on chest CT of one mild patient. HRCT findings of the common type were as follows: (1) the distribution of the lesions: most of the multiple lesions involved both lungs (19 cases), with average of 3 (31) lobes, located in the peripheral pulmonary zone near the pleura (22 cases); (2) the morphology and density of the lesions: most of the lesions were ground glass density foci (22 cases), which were patchy and massive (18 cases), nodular (10 cases) and arc broadband (7 cases); with the development of the disease, the density of some lesions increased with localized pulmonary consolidation (10 cases), accompanied by air bronchus sign (5 cases) and halo sign (5 cases).

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to apply network modeling and rule-based classification to characterize the relationships between e-cigaretteCrelated search items on YouTube and gauge the level of importance of each search item as part of an e-cigarette information network on YouTube. METHODS: We used 16 fictitious YouTube profiles to retrieve 4201 distinct videos from 18 keywords related to e-cigarettes. We used network modeling to represent the relationships between the search items. Moreover, we developed a rule-based classification approach to classify videos. We used betweenness centrality (BC) and correlations between nodes (ie, search items) to help us gain knowledge of the underlying structure of the information network. RESULTS: By modeling search items and videos as a network, we observed that broad search items such as e-cig had the most connections to other search items, and specific search items such as cigalike had the least connections. Search items with similar words (eg, vape and vaping) and search items with similar meaning (eg, e-liquid and e-juice) yielded a high degree of connectedness. We also found that each node had 18 (SD 34.8) connections (common videos) on average. BC indicated that general search items such as electronic cigarette and vaping had high importance in the network (BC=0.00836). Our rule-based classification sorted videos into four categories: e-cigarette devices (34%-57%), cannabis vaping (16%-28%), e-liquid (14%-37%), and other (8%-22%). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that search items on YouTube have unique relationships that vary in strength and importance. Our methods can not only be used to successfully identify the important, overlapping, and unique e-cigaretteCrelated search items but also help determine which search items are more likely to act as a gateway to e-cigaretteCrelated content.","output":"An Exploration of e-CigaretteCRelated Search Items on YouTube: Network Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) is a clinically relevant biomarker and therapeutic target for many human pathologies, yet a noninvasive agent for the assessment of PDE5 expression has yet to be realized.

Given that emergency general surgery (GS) conditions are often associated with high morbidity and mortality if left untreated, the objective of this study was to describe and quantify the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on rates of emergency department (ED) utilization and hospital admission due to GS conditions. METHODS: This cohort study involved the analysis of an institutional database and retrospective chart review. We identified adult patients presenting to the ED in a network of three teaching hospitals in Montreal, Canada during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic (March13CMay13, 2020) and a control pre-pandemic period (March13CMay13, 2019). Patients with GS conditions were included in the analysis. ED utilization rates, admission rates and 30-day outcomes were compared between the two periods using multivariate regression analysis. RESULTS: During the pandemic period, 258 patients presented to ED with a GS diagnosis compared to 351 patients pre-pandemically (adjusted rate ratio (aRR) 0.75; p < 0.001). Rate of hospital admission during the pandemic was also significantly lower (aRR = 0.77, p < 0.001). Patients had a significantly shorter ED stay during the pandemic (adjusted mean difference 5.0 h; p < 0.001). Rates of operative management during the pandemic were preserved compared to the pre-pandemic period. There were no differences in 30-day complications (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.46; p = 0.07), ED revisits (aOR 1.10; p = 0.66) and (re)admissions (aOR 1.42; p = 0.22) between the two periods. CONCLUSION: There was a decrease in rates of ED utilization and hospital admissions due to GS conditions during the first wave of the Covid -19 pandemic; however, rates of operative management, complications and healthcare reutilization were unchanged. Although our findings are not generalizable to patients who did not seek healthcare, it was possible to successfully uphold institutional standards of care once patients presented to the ED.

Due to a greater risk of exposure to the virus, increased working hours, and fear of infecting their families, health service providers are more vulnerable to emotional distress than the general population during this pandemic. This online survey attempts to assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 and its associated variables among healthcare workers in Nepal. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For data collection purposes, Covid-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI) Questionnaire, was used whose content validity was verified by Shanghai mental health center. Data for the survey were collected from 11 to 24 October 2020 which was extracted to Microsoft Excel-13 and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 254 health care workers from different provinces of the country participated in this study with a mean age of 26.01( 4.46) years. A majority 46.9% (n = 119) of the participants were not distressed (score &#8804;28) while 46.5% (n = 118) were mild to moderately distressed (score >28 to &#8804;51) and 6.7% (n = 17) were severely distressed (score &#8805;52) due to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Female participants (p = 0.004) and participants who were doctors by profession (p = 0.001) experienced significantly more distress.

RESULTS 90.2% (n = 65) of residents and 85.7% (n = 24) of faculty surgeons reported having received nutritional education. The majority (78%) of respondents utilize patient nutrition on a regular basis (monthly or more often), with 54% reporting utilization daily or weekly. Overall, 65% of respondents reported experiencing challenges in managing patient nutritional needs, and 86% agreed that additional nutritional education during training would assist with patient care. Residents and faculty surgeons both significantly reported challenges in determining which specific nutritional formula to use (X2 = 22.414, P = .049). Residents were associated with reporting challenges in successfully managing oral, enteral, and parenteral routes of nutrition (X2 = 16.241, P = .023).

The majority of the studies in the domain are grounded on hospital-based data or are based on small sample size, findings from which can only be generalized to a specific sub-group. These studies recommend exploring multimorbidity holistically at a national level to ensure adequate healthcare management in the country. Therefore, the present study examines the pattern and correlates of single and multimorbidity over the past two decades in India. METHODS: The study utilized data on 397901, 257519, and 399705 individuals from 52nd (1994C1995), 60th (2004C2005), and 75th (2018) rounds of cross-sectional data from the National Sample Survey (NSS). Univariate, bivariate, and multivariable statistical methods were applied to draw inferences from the data. The findings depict an increase in single and multimorbidity burden over individuals age and NSS rounds. RESULTS: Hypertension and diabetes were the fastest-growing morbidities over time. Higher education, urban residence, and belonging to an affluent class were significantly associated with both single and multimorbidity occurrence over time.

Dermatan sulfate (DS), a glycosaminoglycan crucial for wound healing, has unique affinity for autoantigens (autoAgs) from apoptotic cells. DS-autoAg complexes are capable of stimulating autoreactive B cells and autoantibody production. Using DS affinity, we identified an autoantigenome of 408 proteins from human fetal lung fibroblast HFL11 cells, at least 231 of which are known autoAgs. Comparing with available COVID data, 352 proteins of the autoantigenome have thus far been found to be altered at protein or RNA levels in SARS-Cov-2 infection, 210 of which are known autoAgs. The COVID-altered proteins are significantly associated with RNA metabolism, translation, vesicles and vesicle transport, cell death, supramolecular fibrils, cytoskeleton, extracellular matrix, and interleukin signaling. They offer clues to neurological problems, fibrosis, smooth muscle dysfunction, and thrombosis. In particular, 150 altered proteins are related to the nervous system, including axon, myelin sheath, neuron projection, neuronal cell body, and olfactory bulb. An association with the melanosome is also identified. The findings from our study illustrate a strong connection between viral infection and autoimmunity. The vast number of COVID-altered proteins with propensity to become autoAgs offers an explanation for the diverse autoimmune complications in COVID patients.

However, they tend to suffer from poor generalization due to imbalanced data distributions where a small number of classes are over-represented (e.g. frontal or non-occluded faces) and some of the remaining rarely appear (e.g. profile or heavily occluded faces). This is the reason why the performance is dramatically degraded in minority classes. For example, this issue is serious for recognizing masked faces in the scenario of ongoing pandemic of the COVID-19. In this work, we propose an Attention Augmented Network, called AAN-Face, to handle this issue. First, an attention erasing (AE) scheme is proposed to randomly erase units in attention maps. This well prepares models towards occlusions or pose variations. Second, an attention center loss (ACL) is proposed to learn a center for each attention map, so that the same attention map focuses on the same facial part. Consequently, discriminative facial regions are emphasized, while useless or noisy ones are suppressed. Third, the AE and the ACL are incorporated to form the AAN-Face. Since the discriminative parts are randomly removed by the AE, the ACL is encouraged to learn different attention centers, leading to the localization of diverse and complementary facial parts. Comprehensive experiments on various test datasets, especially on masked faces, demonstrate that our AAN-Face models outperform the state-of-the-art methods, showing the importance and effectiveness.","output":"AAN-Face: Attention Augmented Networks for Face Recognition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) remains the most common malignancy worldwide.

When entering a new room, a subject is re-identified among several other individuals by computing gait-related features from the radar reflections through a deep neural network and using a weighted extreme learning machine as the final re-identification tool. Experimental results, obtained from a real implementation of milliTRACE-IR, demonstrate decimeter-level accuracy in distance/trajectory estimation, inter-personal distance estimation (effective for subjects getting as close as 0.2 m), and accurate temperature monitoring (max. errors of 0.5C).

However, this notion is changing as other viruses such as Parvovirus B19 and human herpesvirus-6 are increasingly reported as causes of myocarditis in the United States, with the most recent example being the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, causing the Coronavirus Disease-19. The mouse model of Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced myocarditis, which may involve mediation of autoimmunity, is routinely used in the study of immune pathogenesis of viral infections as triggers of DCM.

In the JHM strain of MHV, expression of the HE gene is variable and corresponds to the number of copies of a UCUAA pentanucleotide sequence present at the 3-end of the leader RNA. This copy number varies among MHV strains, depending on their passage history. The JHM isolates with two copies of UCUAA in their leader RNA showed a high level of HE expression, whereas the JHM isolate with three copies had a low-level expression. In this study, the analysis of HE gene expression was extended to other MHV strains. The synthesis of HE mRNA in these viruses also correlates with the copy number of UCUAA in the leader RNA and the particular intergenic sequence preceding the HE gene. In one MHV strain, MHV-1, no detectable HE mRNA was synthesized, despite the presence of a proper transcription initiation signal. This lack of HE mRNA expression was consistent with a leader RNA containing three UCUAA copies. However, mutations and deletions within the coding region of the MHV-1 HE gene have generated a stretch of sequence which resembled the transcriptional initiation motif, and was shown to initiate the synthesis of a novel smaller mRNA. These findings strengthened the theory that interactions between leader RNA and transcriptional initiation sequences regulate MHV subgenomic mRNA transcription. Sequence analysis revealed that most MHV strains, through extensive mutations, deletions, or insertions, have lost the complete HE open reading frame, thus turning HE into a pseudogene. This high degree of variation is unusual as the other three structural proteins (spike, membrane, and nucleocapsid) are well-maintained. In contrast to bovine coronavirus, which apparently requires HE for viral replication, the HE protein in MHV may be only an accessory protein which is not necessary for viral replication. JHM and MHV-S, however, have preserved the expression of HE protein.","output":"Heterogeneity of gene expression of the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein of murine coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 is a novel and highly virulent virus, which caused a rapid and massive onset of clinical trials in a short period of time.With the aim to obtain suggestions in the guidance on performing emergency clinical trials, and control this virus in China and other countries and for the prevention of the onset of other infectious viruses in the future.MethodsCOVID-19, SARS, MERS and Ebola clinical trials registered in the Chinese clinical trial registry and clinical trials.gov were collected and analyzed and intervention protocols were compared, focusing on the analysis and comparison of the drug used. The search period ended on February 24, 2020.ResultsThe number of the registered COVID-19 clinical trials was 295. Among 203 intervention trials, 78.3% (159) were drug clinical trials, in which 46.3% (94) used chemical drugs and biological agents, 32.0% (65) were performed using Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and integrated traditional Chinese and western medicine.The 159 COVID-19 trials were designed and analyzed with the highest proportion of blank randomized controls [45.9% (73)], and placebo randomized trials [14.5% (23)]. The drug mostly used was Lopinavir/Ritonavir (15.1%). The sample size ranged from 10 to 100 in 52.8% (84) trials. The number of the registered SARS was 6, MERS 15, and Ebola 97.

The effects of elevated ABP after BCPA on cerebrovascular hemodynamics are unknown. We sought to determine the relationship between elevated ABP and cerebrovascular autoregulation after BCPA. METHODS Prospective, observational study on infants with single-ventricle physiology after BCPA surgery. Continuous recordings of mean ABP, mean cavopulmonary artery pressure (PAP), near-infrared spectroscopy measures of cerebral oximetry (regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2)), and relative cerebral blood volume index were obtained from admission to extubation. Autoregulation was measured as hemoglobin volume index (HVx). Physiologic variables, including the HVx, were tested for variance across ABP. RESULTS Sixteen subjects were included in the study. Elevated ABP post-BCPA was associated with both, elevated PAP (P<0.0001) and positive HVx (dysautoregulation; P<0.0001). No association was observed between ABP and alterations in rSO2. Using piecewise regression, the relationship of PAP to ABP demonstrated a breakpoint at 68 mm Hg (interquartile range (IQR) 62-70 mm Hg). Curve fit of HVx as a function of ABP identified optimal ABP supporting robust autoregulation at a median ABP of 55 mm Hg (IQR 51-64 mm Hg). CONCLUSIONS Elevated ABP post-BCPA is associated with cerebrovascular dysautoregulation, and elevated PAP.

METHODS We assessed ALC at baseline, monthly till 3 months, and every 3 months (core phase) and with variable periodicity (extension phase) of Phase 3 PARADIGMS study (N = 215). Incidence rates (IRs) of infection-related adverse events (infAEs)/100 patient-years were analysed by on-study nadir ALC. RESULTS With fingolimod, ALC rapidly reduced to 29.9%-34.4% of baseline values within 2 weeks and remained stable thereafter; no relevant changes observed with interferon. IRs of infAEs were 67.6 with fingolimod and 61.8 with interferon; IR ratios with respect to interferon, overall: 1.09, by nadir ALC 0.2-0.4  109/L: 1.13 and >0.4  109/L: 0.91.

A few available African studies have reported inconsistent findings using different single socio-economic measures. Our aim was to investigate the association between socio-economic status and the risk of breast cancer among Nigerian women based on a range of socio-economic status measures. Methods: we conducted a hospital-based case-control study involving participants from five hospitals in Lagos and Abuja. Women were interviewed in-person between October 2016 and May 2017 using a semi-structured questionnaire. Socio-economic status was assessed based on education, occupation, income, wealth, and socio-economic index. Multivariable logistic regression was applied in data analysis using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23. Level of significance was based on 95% confidence interval or p-values less than 0.05. Results: we recruited 379 histologically confirmed breast cancer cases and 403 controls. Following full adjustments, breast cancer risk reduced as socio-economic index increased (p for trend=0.028).

However, there is limited data on the efficacy of virucidal products against EBOV, because the virus has a high biosafety level and is only available in a few laboratories worldwide. The virucidal efficacy of antiseptics and disinfectants can be determined using the European Standard EN14476:2013/FprA1:2015. Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) was introduced in 2014 as a reference virus for the claim virucidal active against enveloped viruses for hygienic hand rub and hand wash. For EBOV, also an enveloped virus, the suitability of MVA as a surrogate needs to be proven. The aim of this study was to test the in vitro efficacy of four povidone iodine (PVP-I) formulations against EBOV: 4 % PVP-I skin cleanser; 7.5 % PVP-I surgical scrub; 10 % PVP-I solution; and 3.2 % PVP-I and 78 % alcohol solution. The formulations were tested with MVA to define the test conditions, and as a secondary objective the suitability of MVA as a surrogate for enveloped viruses like EBOV was assessed. METHODS: According to EN14476, a standard suspension test was used for MVA. Large-volume plating was used for EBOV to increase test sensitivity and exclude potential after-effects. All products were tested under clean (0.3 g/L BSA) and dirty (3.0 g/L BSA + 3.0 mL/L erythrocytes) conditions with MVA for 15, 30, and 60 s.

Dietary SBF had no effect on the number of ACF, aberrant crypts (AC) or AC/focus induced by abdominal -irradiation. However, an ingestion of SBF resulted in an increase in the number of these parameters in apoptosis-suppressed rats by cycloheximide (CHX). An injection of CHX suppressed irradiation-induced apoptosis of the colonic epithelial cells for at least 6 h after the irradiation. In CHX-injected rats, an ingestion of SBF significantly increased the number of ACF, AC and AC/focus compared with fiber-free fed rats at 9 weeks after the first irradiation. On the other hand, in saline-injected rats, no significant difference was found between SBF and fiber-free diets in the number of ACF, AC and AC/focus through the experimental period. These results suggest that dietary SBF may be involved in the elimination of abnormal cells from an irradiated colon through the apoptosis of colonic epithelial cells. In this study, we have shown a new method for inducing ACF by using -rays which were not influenced by luminal contents such as bacterial enzyme, at least in the initiation stage.","output":"Ingestion of sugar beet fiber enhances irradiation-induced aberrant crypt foci in the rat colon under an apoptosis-suppressed condition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the COVID-19 pandemic impacted everyone, social determinants of health and structural inequities have had compounding effects that shaped the experiences of some sub-populations during the pandemic. Stigmatization, discrimination, and exclusion contribute to a disproportionately high burden of mental health concerns among sexual minority (i.e., lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, and other sexually-diverse) and gender minority people. Pre-pandemic, these health inequities are exacerbated by barriers to adequate mental health services including cost, waitlists, and experiences of sexual and gender minority stigma when accessing providers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, these barriers were further complicated by drastic changes in service delivery and access during the pandemic--i.e., a shift to online/virtual provision of care to reduce risk of COVID-19 transmission. To better understand the experiences of sexual and gender minority people accessing mental health services during the first three to nine months of the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 15 health care providers and administrators (summer 2020) and 14 sexual and gender minority individuals interested in accessing mental health services (fall 2020) in British Columbia, Canada. We used interpretive description to inductively analyze interview data. Triangulating between the provider and service user datasets, we examined changes in mental health and coping during the COVID-19 pandemic. We recorded increases in isolation and lack of identity affirmation; inequities in accessing mental health services during the pandemic, perceived opportunities for mental health support, and avenues for reducing mental health inequities through system-level changes that deserve particular attention during the pandemic.","output":"Health Provider and Sexual and Gender Minority Service User Perspectives on Provision of Mental Health Services During the Early Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic in British Columbia, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a newly discovered deadly disease with no proven definitive treatment until now.

O3 also can manage hypoxia and increase tissue oxygenation, besides its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties which may have an important role in the management of cytokine storm. We used rectal O3 insufflation therapy assuming that it may have a beneficial role in the management of COVID-19 disease. Two sessions of rectal O3 therapy were given to a 60-year-old female patient who was confirmed COVID-19 positive. Before applying O3 therapy, she was hypoxic (sPO2:90%) despite mechanical ventilation with high fraction inspired oxygen (FiO2:90%). After therapy, she was markedly improved and discharged to the inpatient ward and then discharged home on day 10 post-admission. Another 40-year-old male patient who was confirmed COVID-19 positive and was home isolated received one session of O3 therapy. Before therapy, he was hypoxic (sPO2:85% on room air and 95% with O2 face mask 5 L/min). The patient showed gradual improvement over the next 3 days after therapy and becomes oxygen-independent (sPO2 became 94-97% on room air). No adverse effects were noticed in both cases.

STUDY DESIGN: Observational study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Radiology, Shifa International Hospital, from 1st March to June 30th, 2020. METHODOLOGY: One hundred and three consecutive patients' RT PCR positive for COVID-19 were included. Two consultant radiologists, with experience of 7 to 10 years in body imaging, evaluated their HRCT studies in consensus and calculated the CT severity score. A scoring of all 20 individual regions in each lung were assigned by the radiologists attributing a score of 0, 1 or 2 to each region, if parenchymal opacification was none, less than 50%, or 50% or more, respectively. The CT severity score was a summation of scores of all 20 regions of both lungs combined with a range of 0 to 40 points. The scores were compared for clinically mild and severe disease. RESULTS: Significant differences were noted regarding the scoring of lung opacity in mild and severe groups in each lung segment, p <0.05. The most significantly involved segments were right lower lobe's medial and lateral basal segment, left upper lobe's superior lingular segment and left lower lobe's medial basal and lateral basal segments.

Despite being discovered more than 50 years ago, the biosynthetic pathway of KSM remains an unresolved puzzle. Here we report a structural and functional analysis for an epimerase, KasQ, that primes KSM biosynthesis rather than the previously proposed KasF/H, which instead acts as an acetyltransferase, inactivating KSM. Our biochemical and biophysical analysis determined that KasQ converts UDP-GlcNAc to UDP-ManNAc as the initial step in the biosynthetic pathway. The isotope-feeding study further confirmed that (13)C, (15)N-glucosamine/UDP-GlcNH(2) rather than glucose/UDP-Glc serves as the direct precursor for the formation of KSM. Both KasF and KasH were proposed, respectively, converting UDP-GlcNH(2) and KSM to UDP-GlcNAc and 2-N-acetyl KSM. Experimentally, KasF is unable to do so; both KasF and KasH are instead KSM-modifying enzymes, while the latter is more specific and reactive than the former in terms of the extent of resistance.

The local and systemic injury that ensues after reperfusion of ischemic skeletal muscle is an important clinical problem in flap surgery. Flap delay may be applied chemically or sympathetically. Early use of botulinum toxin A (Btx-A) in muscle flap surgery relied on chemical denervation; however, in our study, we tried to emphasize a possible chemical delay mechanism of Btx-A, through the release of substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). METHODS Pretreatment with perivascular or intramuscular Btx-A was applied 1 week before the flap elevation, 3.5 units in 2 experimental groups each containing 8 Sprague-Dawley rats. The control groups (2 groups, each containing 8 rats) received 0.07 mL saline perivascularly and intramuscularly. The right gastrocnemius muscle flap was used as the experimental model. Ischemia-reperfusion cycle was applied to all groups. On the seventh day, the gastrocnemius flap was elevated, and perivascular tissues were observed macroscopically. Comparisons between perivascular Btx-A and intramuscular Btx-A groups were made, and the animals were killed. Muscle biopsies were taken. Damaged myocytes were counted using McCormack technique, and chemical delay was shown as angiogenesis, lymphocyte counts, and edema formation with VEGF3-R, CGRP, and substance P markers as immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS The amount of muscle necrosis was the highest in intramuscular Btx-A admitted groups. The intramuscular and perivascular Btx-A groups showed significant angiogenesis scored blindly by the senior pathologist.

Methods We utilized the mobility data from Google from February 15 to December 31, 2020. We explored several statistical models to estimate the COVID-19 dynamics in Jakarta. Model 1 was a Poisson Regression Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Model 2 was a Negative Binomial Regression Generalized Linear Model (GLM), and Model 3 was a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). Results We found that Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) with some adjustments using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was the best fit model.

Analysis was performed by the generalized additive models with Poisson distribution. The effects of time trend, season, other cyclical factors, temperature and humidity were adjusted. Autocorrelation and overdispersion were corrected. RESULTS Altogether, 69 716 admissions were assessed. Significant associations were found between hospital admissions for asthma and levels of NO(2), O(3), PM(10) and PM(2.5). The relative risks (RR) for hospitalization for every 10 microg/m(3) increase in NO(2), O(3), PM(10) and PM(2.5) were 1.028, 1.034, 1.019 and 1.021, respectively, at a lag day that ranged from cumulative lag 0-4 to 0-5.

MEASUREMENTS We conducted an in-person needs assessment and telephone post-visit interviews. RESULTS Through 50 needs assessments, we identified patient-perceived barriers in interest, access to care, access to technology, and confidence. 34 (68%) patients were interested in completing a home telehealth visit, but fewer (32, 64%) had access to the necessary technology or were confident (21, 42%) that they could participate. We categorized patients into four phenotypes based on their interest and capability to complete a home telehealth visit: Interested and Capable, Interested and Incapable, Uninterested and Capable, and Uninterested and Incapable. These phenotypes allowed us to create trainings to overcome patient-perceived barriers. We completed 32 home telehealth visits and 12 post-visit interviews. Our formative evaluation showed that our pilot was successful in addressing many patient-perceived barriers. All interviewees reported that the home telehealth visits improved their wellbeing.

Six pills twice a day were administered for 3 days. The primary outcome measure used was testing recruitment and retention in this quarantined setting. Secondary outcomes were numbers testing positive for COVID-19 after developing symptoms of illness, number of subjects hospitalized, and days to recovery. RESULTS: Good rates of recruitment and retention were achieved. Of 4,497 quarantined individuals, 2,343 sought enrollment, with 2,294 enrolled and 2,233 completing the trial (49.7% recruitment, 97.3% retention).

Mean follow-up period was 88 days (range 5-369). Dupilumab was discontinued in 31.5% (6/19) of patients; of those who discontinued, 3 restarted it later. Conclusion Conjunctival injection was the most frequent dupilumab-related ocular symptom and most common exam finding followed by corneal staining. Most patients initially treated with antihistamine drops or artificial tears alone subsequently required steroid drops to control symptoms. Some patients who discontinued dupilumab restarted the medication after achieving adequate control of ocular symptoms.","output":"Clinical Characteristics and Treatment for Dupilumab-Related Ocular Complications in Atopic Dermatitis Patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We reviewed the first 21 years (1991-2011) of Australia's National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS).

In total, 2 421 134 cases were analysed. The 10 diseases with highest notification incidence (chlamydial infection, campylobacteriosis, varicella zoster, hepatitis C, influenza, pertussis, salmonellosis, hepatitis B, gonococcal infection, and Ross River virus infection) comprised 88% of all notifications. Annual notification incidence was 591 cases/100 000, highest in the Northern Territory (2598/100 000) and in children aged <5 years (698/100 000). A total of 84% of cases were Indigenous Australians. Notification incidence increased by 64% per year (12% for sexually transmissible infections and 15% for vaccine-preventable diseases). The number of notifiable diseases also increased from 37 to 65. The number and incidence of notifications increased throughout the study period, partly due to addition of diseases to the NNDSS and increasing availability of sensitive diagnostic tests. The most commonly notified diseases require a range of public health responses addressing high-risk sexual and drug-use behaviours, food safety and immunization.

There is interest in fully exploiting FIT measures to improve bowel cancer (CRC) screening strategies. In this paper, we estimate the relationship of the quantitative haemoglobin concentration provided by FIT in faecal samples with underlying pathology. From this we estimate thresholds required for given levels of sensitivity to CRC and high-risk adenomas (HRA). METHODS: Data were collected from a pilot study of FIT in England in 2014, in which 27,238 participants completed a FIT. Those with a faecal haemoglobin concentration (f-Hb) of at least 20 g/g were referred for further investigation, usually colonoscopy. Truncated regression models were used to explore the relationship between bowel pathology and FIT results. Regression results were applied to estimate sensitivity to different abnormalities for a number of thresholds. RESULTS: Participants with CRC and HRA had significantly higher f-Hb, and this remained unchanged after adjusting for age and sex. While a threshold of 20 g/g was estimated to capture 82.2% of CRC and 64.0% of HRA, this would refer 7.8% of participants for colonoscopy. The current programme threshold used in England of 120 g/g was estimated to identify 47.8% of CRC and 25.0% of HRA. CONCLUSIONS: Under the current diagnostic policy of dichotomising FIT results, a very low threshold would be required to achieve high sensitivity to CRC and HRA, which would place further strain on colonoscopy resources. The NHS BCSP in England might benefit from a diagnostic policy that makes greater use of the quantitative nature of FIT.","output":"Faecal immunochemical testing in bowel cancer screening: Estimating outcomes for different diagnostic policies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The possibility that viral infections of the respiratory tract might predispose to bacterial colonization or infection was studied in 120 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 30 control subjects; these individuals were observed for seven years.

We intend to outline the current radiation therapy methods that are employed to treat uveal melanoma. We will outline their relative benefits over one another. We will also provide some background about radiation therapy in general to accustom the ophthalmologists likely reading this review. RECENT FINDINGS Four main options exist for radiation therapy of uveal melanoma. Because the eye is a small space, and because melanomas are relatively radioresistant, oncologists treating uveal melanoma must deliver highly focused doses in high amounts to a small space. Therapies incorporating external beams include proton beam therapy and stereotactic radiosurgery. Stereotactic radiosurgery comes in two forms, gamma knife therapy and cyberknife therapy. Radiation may also be placed directly on the eye surgically via plaque brachytherapy. All methods have been used effectively to treat uveal melanoma. SUMMARY Each particular radiotherapy technique employed to treat uveal melanoma has its own set of benefits and drawbacks. The ocular oncologist can choose amongst these therapies based upon his or her clinical judgment of the relative risks and benefits. Availability of the therapy and cost to the patient remain significant factors in the ocular oncologist's choice.","output":"Radiation therapy for uveal melanoma: a review of treatment methods available in 2021."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract While all groups are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the elderly, underrepresented minorities, and those with underlying medical conditions are at the greatest risk. The high rate of consumption of diets high in saturated fats, sugars, and refined carbohydrates (collectively called Western diet, WD) worldwide, contribute to the prevalence of obesity and type II diabetes, and could place these populations at an increased risk for severe COVID-19 pathology and mortality. WD consumption activates the innate immune system and impairs adaptive immunity, leading to chronic inflammation and impaired host defense against viruses. Furthermore, peripheral inflammation caused by COVID-19 may have long-term consequences in those that recover, leading to chronic medical conditions such as dementia and neurodegenerative disease, likely through neuroinflammatory mechanisms that can be compounded by an unhealthy diet. Thus, now more than ever, wider access to healthy foods should be a top priority and individuals should be mindful of healthy eating habits to reduce susceptibility to and long-term complications from COVID-19.","output":"The impact of nutrition on COVID-19 susceptibility and long-term consequences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES : Misuse of antibiotics, especially in low-and-middle-income countries is a major contributor to antimicrobial resistance.

In holometabolous insects, larval ecology plays a major role in determining the expression of traits in adulthood, but how ecological conditions during the larval stage interact to shape adult life history and fitness, particularly in nonmodel organisms, remains subject to scrutiny. Consequently, our knowledge of the interactive effects of ecological factors on insect development is limited. Here, using the polyphagous fly Bactrocera tryoni, we conducted a fully factorial design where we manipulated larval density and larval diet (protein rich, standard, and sugar rich) to gain insights into how these ecological factors interact to modulate adult fitness. As expected, a protein-rich diet resulted in faster larval development and heavier and leaner adults that were more fecund compared with the standard and sugar-rich diets, irrespective of larval density. Females from the protein-rich larval diet had overall higher reproductive rate (i.e., eggs per day) than females from other diets, and reproductive rate decreased linearly with density for females from the protein-rich diet but nonlinearly for females from the standard and sugar-rich diets over time. Surprisingly, adult lipid reserve increased with larval density for adults from the sugar-rich diet (as opposed to decreasing as in other diets), possibly because of a stress response to an extremely adverse condition during development (i.e., high intraspecific competition and poor nutrition). Together, our results provide insights into how ecological factors early in life interact and shape the fate of individuals through life stages in holometabolous insects.","output":"Density-by-Diet Interactions during Larval Development Shape Adult Life History Trait Expression and Fitness in a Polyphagous Fly."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) has been widely utilized to treat neonatal respiratory failure for two decades.

Case group was defined as pneumonia with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and the control group consisted of patients with non-COVID-19 pneumonia. Biomarkers of anemia and iron metabolism, CRP, procalcitonin were analyzed. Demographic features, CT findings, SpO2, development of ARDS, ICU admission, duration of hospitalization, discharge status (event free survival or death) were evaluated. Results: 205 hospitalized patients with pneumonia were analyzed retrospectively. COVID-19 group was significantly younger than control group. 23 of 106 patients had critical COVID-19 infection. Comorbidity frequency and mortality rate of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were significantly higher. Hb, RET-He, iron, TSAT, CRP, PCT and SpO2 were significantly lower. Hb, RET-He, iron, TSAT levels significantly correlated to lung aeration loss, hospitalization day and inflamatory markers in COVID-19 pneumonia. Conclusion: The patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had iron deficiency anemia even they were young.

When the COVID-19 UK-wide lockdown commenced on 23rd March 2020, paediatricians faced unprecedented child protection challenges.ObjectivesOur objective was to assess the impact of the first lockdown on safeguarding referrals received in our Child Development Centre (CDC).MethodsWe analysed all Social Care (SC) referrals requesting Child Protection Medical Examinations (CPMEs) during lockdown and one week prior: 16th March - 1st June 2020. These were compared to all SC referrals for CPMEs during the same period the year before.Results6 CPMEs were completed in 2020 compared to 17 CPMEs in 2019 C a 65% reduction during lockdown.Referral Source 2019 2020 School 9 0 Social Worker 7 4 Hospital 1 0 Individual/Family 0 2 Total 17 6 Just over half (9/17) of the referrals in 2019 stemmed from school concerns being reported to SC. Two thirds (4/6) of the referrals in 2020 were directly from SC. Schools were closed during the first lockdown and thus, the input from this avenue was absent at our CDC. Whilst there was school provision offered to vulnerable children, attendance was low.2 School provision may not have been utilised due to shielding or parents/caregivers opting out.The main reasons for referral in both years have consistently been physical abuse and neglect.In 2020, the most common age groups to be referred were the 2C5 year olds and the 11C16 year olds (2/6 respectively), whereas in 2019, the most frequent age group referred was the 6C10 year olds (10/17).In 2020, 33% (2/6) of the referrals consisted of children with learning difficulties, compared to 23% (4/17) in 2019, highlighting the vulnerability of this group.The most common conclusion to CPMEs in 2020 was the finding of an unclear injury and requiring further evidence before non-accidental injury could be ruled out (83%;5/6). In contrast, in 2019, the medical conclusion most commonly made in CPMEs was that no injury [had been] seen but [there was] risk of significant harm based on the story (29%;5/17). In both cases generally, paediatricians recommended SC and/or police investigation. Other suggestions made as part of the management plan included parenting courses and health visitor follow-ups.ConclusionsThis project has demonstrated the reduction in number of child protection referrals made during lockdown, with no referrals initiated by schools. Historically, schools have been the main referrers of child protection concerns to SC. Taking into account that all children (and especially the identified vulnerable) are less visible during a lockdown, paediatricians need to adapt to meet these unique safeguarding challenges during the pandemic. Paediatricians should be constantly mindful of safeguarding risks, incorporate strong safeguarding partnerships with social workers and continue to be professionally curious when seeing children in all settings, particularly during the pandemic and most especially during lockdown.","output":"The advent of socially distanced child protection C a study of the impact of the first UK lockdown on safeguarding referrals during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We exploit changes in air quality seen during the COVID-19 lockdown over China to show how a cleaner atmosphere has notable co-benefits for solar concentrator photovoltaic energy generation We use satellite observations and analyses of the atmospheric state to simulate surface broadband and spectrally resolved direct normal irradiance (DNI) Over Wuhan, the first city placed under lockdown, we show how the atmospheric changes not only lead to a 19 8% increase in broadband DNI but also induce a significant blue-shift in the DNI spectrum Feeding these changes into a solar cell simulator results in a 29 7% increase in the power output for a typical triple-junction photovoltaic cell, with around one-third of the increase arising from enhanced cell efficiency due to improved spectral matching Our estimates imply that these increases in power and cell efficiency would have been realised over many parts of China during the lockdown period This study thus demonstrates how a cleaner atmosphere may enable more efficient large scale solar energy generation We conclude by setting our results in the context of future climate change mitigation and air pollution policies","output":"COVID-19 lockdown air quality change implications for solar energy generation over China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aging of population has brought great challenges to many regions throughout the world.

Specifically, holding part\\\\time work in the service sector, and feeling disempowered in the workplace, receiving low material rewards, having few benefits, and experiencing obstacles in exercising rights all significantly doubled the probability of losing income or jobs. CONCLUSION: Our analysis underscores the increasing vulnerability faced by our workforce and how a public health crisis magnifies the dire consequences of a precarious job.","output":"Job precarity and economic prospects during the COVID\\\\19 public health crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The unanticipated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has hit global business heavily, disrupting the management of human resources across numerous industries.

For this reason, it is recommended to continue b/ tsDMARD treatments with maximum compliance with pandemic measures. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of patients using b/tsDMARDs on drug survival and rheumatic disease control during pandemic. Methods: In this study, patients diagnosed with rheumatic disease using b/tsDMARDs and who were followed up during the 12-month period (January 2020-2021) including the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic at Dokuz Eylul University Faculty of Medicine Rheumatology Clinic were evaluated. In the first 3 months of the pandemic (March-June 2020), the patients skipped at least 2 cycles of treatment with the fear of Covid-19 infection except for infection / surgical reasons was considered as a disruption of the drug. The drug retention rates of the patients on b/tsDMARDs treatments during the pandemic process and the factors affecting this situation were evaluated. Results: The rate of disrupting their b/tsDMARDs was higher in patients> 65 years of age, with a diagnosis of RA and who needed to come to the hospital for bDMARD treatment (p=0.007, p=0.015 and p=0.004, respectively). The overall 1-year b/tsDMARD retention rates was found 91%. It was determined that a history of interruption in b/tsDMARD treatments in the first 3 months of the pandemic [OR: 1.28 (CI: 1.042-8.71), p=0.014] and the need to come to the hospital to receive bDMARD [OR: 0.59 (CI: 0.64-13.11), p=0.041] caused unresponsiveness to return to the same bDMARD treatment and a significant increase in the risk of discontinuation of the biologic treatment. Conclusion: We conclude that it is important for patients to continue taking b/ tsDMARD treatments without interruption in the days past abnormal periods such as pandemic conditions and to make sufficient effort for minimum dose of CS and low disease activity by determining patient-based risk.","output":"High drug retention rates despite B/ TSDMARD interruptions in COVID-19 pandemic chaos"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to propose better mental health interventions under the pandemic threat, the present study aimed to investigate whether depression and anxiety are associated to Chinese adults' perceptions of government's pandemic responses and the personal lifestyle changes imposed by those responses during the COVID-19 pandemic. We used a telephone survey with random sampling and obtained a probability community sample of 616 adults (39.1% men; M age = 41.7, SD age = 16.3) in Macao, China in April 2020. The prevalence of 8.8% probable depression and 12.0% probable anxiety was observed in this sample. Positive perceptions toward government's pandemic responses were found to be negatively associated with probable depression and probable anxiety (ORu = .36 and .41, p < .05). Three lifestyle-changing stressors (i.e., increased family conflict, friendship deterioration, and weight gain), were commonly reported (29.9, 27.5, and 43.0% respectively), and displayed positive associations with probable depression (ORu = 1.67 to 1.87, p < .05) and probable anxiety (ORu = 1.54 to 2.10, p < .05).

Social media and mobile journalists assist in fulfilling this requirement, but quick on-site presence is not always feasible. In the past few years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and specifically drones, have evolved to accessible recreational and business tools. Drones could help journalists and news organizations capture and share breaking news stories. Media corporations and individual professionals are waiting for the appropriate flight regulation and data handling framework to enable their usage to become widespread. Drone journalism services upgrade the usage of drones in day-to-day news reporting operations, offering multiple benefits. This paper proposes a system for operating an individual drone or a set of drones, aiming to mediate real-time breaking news coverage. Apart from the definition of the system requirements and the architecture design of the whole system, the current work focuses on data retrieval and the semantics preprocessing framework that will be the basis of the final implementation.

Most of the countries reported a mortality rate of 2-3 % majorly due to cardiorespiratory failures. Recent studies highlighted the neurological involvement playing a key role in cardiorespiratory failures and other symptoms such as headache, anosmia, and ageusia observed in Covid-19 patients. Studies suggests SARS-CoV-2 entry via olfactory epithelium (OE) and the expression of type 2 transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) in addition to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) can facilitate SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism. The virus can either travel via peripheral blood vessel causing endothelial dysfunction, triggering coagulation cascade and multiple organ dysfunction or reach the systemic circulation and take a different route to the blood brain barrier (BBB), disrupting the BBB causing neuroinflammation or neuronal excitotoxicity resulting in the development of encephalitis, encephalopathy, seizures, and strokes. SARS-CoV-2 invasion on brain stem is believed to be responsible for the cardiorespiratory failures observed in Covid-19 patients. Apart from viral invasion via hematogenous route, SARS-CoV-2 neural invasion via PNS nerve terminal, resulting in viral replication and retrograde transportation to soma leading to invasion of the CNS including the brain producing neurological manifestations of the disease either in the initial stages or during the course of the disease and even in a long period post infection in many cases. The ACE2 receptors are expressed in the brain and glial cells and SARS-CoV-2 acts via neuronal as well as non-neuronal pathway.

We studied genetic and early-life environmental effects on wheel-running behavior in a mouse model that includes four replicate high runner (HR) lines selectively bred for increased voluntary wheel running as young adults and four non-selected control (C) lines. In a full factorial design, mice from each line were granted wheel access or not and administered either standard or Western diet (WD) from weaning (3 weeks old) to 6 weeks of age (sexual maturity). In addition to acute effects, after a washout period of 8 weeks (a6 human years) in which all mice had standard diet and no wheel access, we found both beneficial and detrimental effects of these early-life exposures. During the first week of treatments, WD increased distance run by 29% in C mice and 48% in HR mice (significant Dieta?a?Linetype interaction), but diet effects disappeared by the third week. Across the three weeks of juvenile treatment, WD significantly increased fat mass (with lean mass as a covariate). Tested as adults, early-life exercise increased wheel running of C mice but not HR mice in the first week. Early-life exercise also reduced adult anxiety-like behavior and increased adult fasted blood glucose levels, triceps surae mass, subdermal fat pad mass, and brain mass, but decreased heart ventricle mass. Using fat mass as a covariate, early-life exercise treatment increased adult leptin concentration. In contrast, early-life WD increased adult wheel running of HR mice but not C mice. Early-life WD also increased adult lean mass and adult preference for Western diet in all groups. Surprisingly, early-life treatment had no significant effect on adult body fat or maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max). No previous study has tested for combined or interactive effects of early-life WD and exercise. Our results demonstrate that both factors can have long-lasting effects on adult voluntary exercise and related phenotypes, and that these effects are modulated by genetic background. Overall, the long-lasting effects of early-life exercise were more pervasive than those of WD, suggesting critical opportunities for health intervention in childhood habits, as well as possible threats from modern challenges. These results may be relevant for understanding potential effects of activity reductions and dietary changes associated with the obesity epidemic and COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Effects of early-life exposure to Western diet and voluntary exercise on adult activity levels, exercise physiology, and associated traits in selectively bred High Runner mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the pandemic brought on by novel Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19), consumers of applied behavior analytic interventions may be experiencing disrupted access to services.

However, currently limited data are available, and with mixed results, to elucidate which inflammatory biomarkers may be most associated with clinical phenotype in pregnant patients. OBJECTIVE: : We aimed to compare laboratory findings among pregnant patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) by symptom status and disease severity. STUDY DESIGN: : We retrospectively evaluated pregnant patients at an urban academic U.S. hospital with positive polymerase-chain reaction SARS-CoV-2 testing between March and October 2020, performed for reported symptoms or universal screening on admission. In our hospital, all patients with SARS-CoV-2 were recommended to have baseline laboratory testing, including leukocyte, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts; aspartate and alanine aminotransferase; high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP); procalcitonin (PCT); lactate dehydrogenase (LDH); D-dimer; and ferritin. We performed multivariable logistic regression to evaluate peak laboratory abnormalities significantly associated with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease severity with gestational age at diagnosis, maternal age, and obesity as covariates. The sensitivity and specificity of laboratory abnormalities to identify symptomatic versus asymptomatic infection, and severe to critical disease versus mild to moderate disease, were calculated. RESULTS: : We identified 175 pregnant patients with SARS-CoV-2, of whom 100 (57%) were symptomatic; 17 (17%) of those who were symptomatic had severe to critical disease. Laboratory data was available for 128 patients, of whom 67 (52%) were symptomatic. Compared to asymptomatic people, symptomatic people were more likely to exhibit elevated hsCRP after adjusting for gestational age (aOR 5.67, 95% CI 1.42-22.52, sensitivity 81%, specificity 43%). In symptomatic individuals, transaminitis (aOR 5.67, 95% CI 1.27-25.43), elevated PCT (aOR 16.60, 95% CI 2.61-105.46), and elevated LDH (aOR 17.55, 95% CI 2.51-122.78) were independently associated with severe to critical disease compared to mild to moderate disease after adjusting for maternal age and obesity. Sensitivity for transaminitis, PCT elevation and LDH elevation was 47%, 87% and 53%, while specificity was 89%, 63% and 90%, respectively, for differentiating disease severity. CONCLUSION: : Inflammatory biomarkers in pregnant patients with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit vast heterogeneity, poor discriminative ability, and thereby limited clinical utility.

The increase in co-prescription of benzodiazepines and opioids may indicate population-level changes in health behaviors that can be exacerbated by limited access, hence necessitating the tracking of these drugs during COVID-19. We evaluated the impact of the declaration of COVID-19 as a US national emergency on prescription patterns in 2020. METHODS: Prescriptions of benzodiazepines and opioids were analyzed using data aggregated on a weekly basis across 38 states over the January 2019-December 2020 period. Data were from Bamboo Health Prescription Drug Monitoring Program and covered all individuals regardless of insurance status. Generalized additive models estimated the effects of the March 13, 2020 declaration on proportion of prescriptions to all controlled substances by comparing volumes before to after the week of March 13 in 2020 (range: January 27-May 24) and comparing this trend to its 2019 counterpart. RESULTS: When comparing the January 27-March 9 period to the March 16-May 24 period in 2020, there was a statistically significant 2.0% increase in the proportion of benzodiazepine dispensations to all controlled substances, and a significant 1.7% mean decrease in proportion of opioid dispensations to all controlled substances. A significant return approaching pre-declaration levels was observed only for opioids (beginning week of May 18, 2020).

Accordingly, in Italy, a country severely affected by the pandemic, various measures were applied and the care at university clinics was limited to urgent cases. Here we retrospectively analyzed data of patients who presented at an Italian academic outpatient clinic reserved only for emergency cases. In total, 252 patients (109 males and 143 females) with a mean age of 55.25  20.99 years were cared for at our clinic during a three\\\\month period.

We aimed to assess, under controlled conditions, whether infection rates among attendees at a large, indoor gathering event would be similar to those in non-attendees, given implementation of a comprehensive prevention strategy including antigen-screening within 3 days, medical mask wearing, and optimised ventilation. METHODS: The non-inferiority, prospective, open-label, randomised, controlled SPRING trial was done on attendees at a live indoor concert held in the Accor Arena on May 29, 2021 in Paris, France. Participants, aged 18C45 years, recruited via a dedicated website, had no comorbidities, COVID-19 symptoms, or recent case contact, and had had a negative rapid antigen diagnostic test within 3 days before the concert. Participants were randomly allocated in a 2:1 ratio to the experimental group (attendees) or to the control group (non-attendees). The allocation sequence was computer-generated by means of permuted blocks of sizes three, six, or nine, with no stratification. The primary outcome measure was the number of patients who were SARS-CoV-2-positive by RT-PCR test on self-collected saliva 7 days post-gathering in the per-protocol population (non-inferiority margin <035%). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04872075. FINDINGS: Between May 11 and 25, 2021, 18 845 individuals registered on the dedicated website, and 10 953 were randomly selected for a pre-enrolment on-site visit. Among 6968 who kept the appointment and were screened, 6678 participants were randomly assigned (4451 were assigned to be attendees and 2227 to be non-attendees; median age 28 years; 59% women); 88% (3917) of attendees and 87% (1947) of non-attendees complied with follow-up requirements.

Kinetochore function is controlled by recruitment of regulatory proteins, many of which have been documented, however their function often remains uncharacterized and many are yet to be identified. To identify candidates of kinetochore regulation we used a proteome-wide protein association strategy in budding yeast and detected many proteins that are involved in post-translational modifications such as kinases, phosphatases and histone modifiers. We focused on the Polo-like kinase, Cdc5, and interrogated which cellular components were sensitive to constitutive Cdc5 localization. The kinetochore is particularly sensitive to constitutive Cdc5 kinase activity. Targeting Cdc5 to different kinetochore subcomplexes produced diverse phenotypes, consistent with multiple distinct functions at the kinetochore.

This threat presents a concurrent challenge for educational systems. With schools closed during the pandemic, students and teachers have had to stay at home worldwide. This shift has required us to move beyond conventional ideas regarding education. From kindergarten to higher education, schools offered web-based and online classes, both synchronous and asynchronous. However, while technology emerged as a savior, it is not possible to achieve thorough learning only by listening or watching content. Instead of championing technologies in which pedagogy is irrelevant, schools must invest in helping students become lifelong learners, enrich their learning processes, and focus on critical self-reflection, problem-solving skills, imagination, ideas, and projects involving social problems. A significant attempt to redefine the concepts that we have traditionally used must be made. The aim of this article is to develop new suggestions on how curriculum as the essence and core of all educational systems can be reconceptualized for the post-Covid-19 era.","output":"Waking up to the dawn of a new era: Reconceptualization of curriculum post Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Many institutionalized older people have died during the first wave of COVID-19. Other related consequences have not yet been described objectively. The aim of this study was to compare functional, cognitive, and nutritional status before and after the first wave among nursing home residents, in both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Older adults institutionalized in four nursing homes were assessed from May to June 2020, by a geriatric multidisciplinary team in collaboration with the nursing homes staff. Comprehensive geriatric assessment was performed including functional, cognitive, and nutritional variables before and after the first wave of the pandemic. Data from residents with positive results for microbiological testing for SARS-CoV-2 were compared with those who did not. RESULTS: 435 nursing home residents were included. The median age was 86.77  8.5 years, 78.4% were women. 190 (43.9%) tested positive for coronavirus. Functional decline after the first wave was detected in 20.2% according to the Barthel Index and in 18.5% according to functional ambulation categories, p < 0.001. Cognitive status worsened by 22 and 25.9% according to the global deterioration scale (p < 0.001) and Lobo's Mini-Examen Cognoscitivo (p 0.01), respectively. Onset of depressive symptoms was found in 48% (p < 0.001). The prevalence of malnutrition increased by 36.8 and 38.4% lost weight. When comparing the functional, cognitive, and nutritional decline between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients no clinical or statistically significant differences were found except for the presence of prior malnutrition, higher in the COVID-19 group. CONCLUSION: We observed a significative functional, cognitive, and nutritional decline in institutionalized elderly after the first wave of COVID-19. These results may be caused by the lockdown itself, since no differences have been found between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. According to these results, interventions are necessary during social isolation or confinement to prevent systemic decline in the elderly.","output":"Functional, cognitive, and nutritional decline in 435 elderly nursing home residents after the first wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Detailed information about the replication cycle of viruses and their interactions with host organisms is required to develop strategies to stop them.

The aim was to design, deliver and evaluate an ENT course for undergraduate medical students. Method: A three-part simulation course on common and emergency ENT conditions was delivered by ENT trainees to undergraduate medical students (n=50). It involved theoretical and hands-on experience with otoscopy on head models;nasoendoscopy and epistaxis management with upper airway head models and nasal packing kits;and management of compromised airways using critical airway models, airway adjuncts, intubation and cricothyroidotomy kits. Delegates were given pre- and post-course questionnaires, with another at six-weeks to test knowledge retention. Results were statistically analysed using paired and independent sample t-tests. Results: A statistically significant improvement in post-test knowledge of 55% (p<0.01) was observed. Delegates also demonstrated a sustained improvement of 51% (p<0.01) six-weeks later compared to baseline knowledge. 76% and 80% reported improved confidence managing epistaxis and performing intubation respectively;46% reported increased interest in pursuing ENT as a potential career. Conclusions: This study demonstrated statistically significant and sustained improvements in knowledge about common and emergency ENT concepts. ENT simulation therefore represents an efficacious mechanism for teaching key ENT concepts and improving confidence in undergraduate medical students, whilst improving interest in pursuing ENT as a career. Additionally, simulation is an invaluable educational adjunct that may foster more realistic, impactful, and safer educational experiences for medical students whilst exposure to patients is minimised due to the current pandemic.","output":"Undergraduate otolaryngology: enhancing interest and education with hands-on simulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"NF-B, a family of transcription factors involved in different cell functions and immune responses is targeted by viruses.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 100 patients with HIV-infection were included in the study. The patients underwent immunological examination and the collection of biomaterial from the posterior pharyngeal wall for microbiological examination. After obtaining the results of the examinations, PCV13 was intramuscularly administered. 7 days after the introduction of the vaccine, an assessment of adverse events was carried out, after 3 months, microbiological and immunological examinations were repeated. RESULTS: Immediately after the administration of PCV13, 5% of patients felt pain during the administration. Local reactions were reported in 6 patients. One participant showed a rise in temperature to 38.3C over 2 days. Before vaccination, 16 strains of S. pneumoniae were seeded in patients. 3 months after the administration of PCV13, pneumococcus was isolated in 8 patients. 3 months after immunization, the median level of populations and subpopulations of lymphocytes became higher than the pre-vaccination. DISCUSSION: Our results show high risk of pneumococcal infections in HIV-positive patients. A tendency towards a decrease in the level of S. pneumoniae carriage was revealed 3 months after the administration of PCV13. The high level of enterobacteria carriage in HIV-positive patients is noteworthy. There is a pronounced positive effect from the use of PCV13 in HIV-positive patients on cellular factors of the immune system.

However, it is challenging to properly evaluate device performance and train medical personnel for device deployment without the aid of functionally relevant models. Current in vitro aneurysm models suffer from a lack of key functional and morphological features of brain vasculature that limit their applicability for these purposes. These features include the physiologically relevant mechanical properties and the dynamic cellular environment of blood vessels subjected to constant fluid flow. Herein, we developed three dimensionally (3D) printed aneurysm-bearing vascularized tissue structures using gelatin-fibrin hydrogel of which the inner vessel walls were seeded with human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMECs). The hCMECs readily exhibited cellular attachment, spreading, and confluency all around the vessel walls, including the aneurysm walls. Additionally, the in vitro devices were directly amenable to flow measurements via particle image velocimetry, enabling the direct assessment of the vascular flow dynamics for comparison to a 3D computational hydrodynamics model. Detachable coils were delivered into the printed aneurysm sac through the vessel using a microcatheter and static blood plasma clotting was monitored inside the aneurysm sac and around the coils. This biomimetic aneurysm in vitro model is a promising method for examining the biocompatibility and hemostatic efficiency of embolization devices and for providing hemodynamic information which would aid in predicting aneurysm rupture or healing response after treatment.","output":"Three-dimensional bioprinting of aneurysm-bearing tissue structure for endovascular deployment of embolization coils"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The declaration of COVID-19 a pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11 March 2020 marked the beginning of a global health crisis of an unprecedented nature and scale. The approach taken by countries across the world varied widely, however, the delivery of frontline healthcare was consistently recognised as being central to the pandemic response. This study aimed to identify and explore the issues currently facing pharmacy teams across Commonwealth countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study also evaluates pharmacy professionals understanding of key knowledge areas from the COVID-19 webinar hosted by the Commonwealth Pharmacists Association (CPA). METHOD: A quantitative survey-based approach was adopted, using a 32-item questionnaire developed from the literature on pharmacy and pandemic response. The survey was hosted on Survey Monkey and pilot tested. The final survey was disseminated by CPA member organisations. A 6-item online questionnaire was sent via email to all attendees of CPA's COVID-19 webinar. Descriptive statistics on frequency distributions and percentages were used to analyse the responses. Data were analysed using Microsoft(?) Excel (2010). RESULTS: There were 545 responses from pharmacy professionals across 31/54 Commonwealth countries in Africa, Asia, the Americas, Europe and the Pacific. Majority of the respondents reported being at least somewhat worried (90%) and more than 65% were very worried or extremely about the impact of COVID-19 on them personally and professionally. Nearly two-thirds of respondents stated finding it somewhat difficult or very difficult to work effectively during the pandemic. Challenges mostly faced by pharmacy professionals working remotely included; general anxiety about the impact of COVID-19 on their lives (12%), and difficulties in communicating with their co-workers (12%). Most pharmacy professionals had not previously been actively involved in a global health emergency (82%) nor obtained training on global/public health emergency preparedness (62%). Between 45 and 97% of the COVID-19 webinar attendees provided the correct answers to post-webinar questions, suggesting some improvement in knowledge. CONCLUSION: Our study confirms pharmacy professionals concerns about practice during a pandemic and provides preliminary data on the challenges and learning needs of the profession. The CPA has since acted on these findings, providing ongoing opportunities to develop and refine resources for the profession as the pandemic evolves. Pharmacy professionals have also demonstrated improved knowledge on the management of COVID-19 and resources available for professionals.","output":"Needs assessment and impact of COVID-19 on pharmacy professionals in 31 commonwealth countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Persons living with HIV-1 (PLHIV) are at increased risk of cardiovascular complications in part due to the persistent inflammatory state despite viral suppression.

The rapid community transmission and relatively high mortality rates with COVID-19 in modern times are relatively unique features of this flu pandemic and have resulted in an unparalleled global health crisis. SARS-CoV-2, being a respiratory virus, mainly affects the lungs, but is capable of infecting other vital organs, such as brain, heart and kidney. Emerging evidence suggests that the virus also targets male and female reproductive organs that express its main receptor ACE2, although it is as yet unclear if this has any implications for human fertility. Furthermore, professional bodies have recommended discontinuing fertility services during the pandemic such that reproductive services have also been affected. Although increased safety measures have helped to mitigate the propagation of COVID-19 in a number of countries, it seems that there is no predictable timeline to containment of the virus, a goal likely to remain elusive until an effective vaccine becomes available and widely distributed across the globe. In parallel, research on reproduction has been postponed for obvious reasons, while diagnostic tests that detect the virus or antibodies against it are of vital importance to support public health policies, such as social distancing and our obligation to wear masks in public spaces. This review aims to provide an overview of critical research and ethics issues that have been continuously emerging in the field of reproductive medicine as the COVID-19 pandemic tragically unfolds.Abbreviations: ACE2: angiotensin- converting enzyme 2; ART: Assisted reproductive technology; ASRM: American Society for Reproductive Medicine; CCR9: C-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 9; CDC: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; COVID-19: Coronavirus disease 2019; Ct: Cycle threshold; CXCR6: C-X-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 6; ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; ESHRE: European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology; ET: Embryo transfer; FSH: Follicle Stimulating Hormone; FFPE: formalin fixed paraffin embedded; FYCO1: FYVE And Coiled-Coil Domain Autophagy Adaptor 1; IFFS: International Federation of Fertility Societies; IUI: Intrauterine insemination; IVF: In vitro fertilization; LH: Luteinizing Hormone; LZTFL1: Leucine Zipper Transcription Factor Like 1; MAR: medically assisted reproduction services; MERS: Middle East Respiratory syndrome; NGS: Next Generation Sequencing; ORF: Open Reading Frame; PPE: personal protective equipment; RE: RNA Element; REDa: RNA Element Discovery algorithm; RT-PCR: Reverse=trascriptase transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; SARS: Severe acute respiratory syndrome; SARS-CoV-2: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2; SLC6A20: Solute Carrier Family 6 Member 20; SMS: Single Molecule Sequencing; T: Testosterone; TMPRSS2: transmembrane serine protease 2; WHO: World Health Organization; XCR1: X-C Motif Chemokine Receptor.","output":"COVID-19 and human reproduction: A pandemic that packs a serious punch."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transforming growth factor  (TGF-) has long been identified with its intensive involvement in early embryonic development and organogenesis, immune supervision, tissue repair, and adult homeostasis.

Under pathological conditions, overexpressed TGF- causes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) formation, which leads to fibrotic disease, and cancer. Given the critical role of TGF- and its downstream molecules in the progression of fibrosis and cancers, therapeutics targeting TGF- signaling appears to be a promising strategy.

It is associated with high mortality in those who develop respiratory complications and require admission to intensive care. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a supportive therapy option for selected severely ill patients who deteriorate despite the best supportive care. During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, extra demand led to staff reorganization; hence, cardiac surgery consultants joined the ECMO retrieval team. This article describes how we increased service provisions to adapt to the changes in activity and staffing. METHODS: The data were collected from 16 March 2020 to 8 May 2020. The patients were referred through a dedicated Web-based referral portal to cope with increasing demand. The retrieval team attended the referring hospital, reviewed the patients and made the final decision to proceed with ECMO. RESULTS: We reported 41 ECMO retrieval runs during this study period. Apart from staffing changes, other retrieval protocols were maintained. The preferred cannulation method for veno-venous ECMO was drainage via the femoral vein and return to the right internal jugular vein. There were no complications reported during cannulation or transport. CONCLUSIONS: Staff reorganization in a crisis is of paramount importance. For those with precise transferrable skills, experience can be gained quickly with appropriate supervision. Therefore, the team members were selected based on skill mix rather than on roles that are more traditional. We have demonstrated that an ECMO retrieval service can be reorganized swiftly and successfully to cope with the sudden increase in demand by spending cardiac surgeons services to supplement the anaesthetic-intensivist roles.","output":"Regional extracorporeal membrane oxygenation retrieval service during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic: an interdisciplinary team approach to maintain service provision despite increased demand"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we try to analyse the extent to which a redefinition of the monetary policy rule would help to avoid the zero-lower bound, as well as to explore the conditions needed to avoid that constraint.

The threshold model allows us to know which are the turning points from which the relationship between the key variables and the interest rate revert. In the Eurozone countries, we have found that the inflation gap always contributes to increasing the nominal interest rate.

The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of convalescent plasma therapy for MERS-CoV-infected patients by using MERS-CoV-specific convalescent plasma obtained from previously recovered patients. METHODS: A survey was adapted from validated questionnaire originally aimed to measure network capacities and capabilities within the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC). The questionnaire was modified for this study to include 26 items that were divided into three main domains of interest: (1) the ability to care for critically ill MERS-CoV patients; (2) laboratory capacity to diagnose MERS-CoV and blood bank ability to prepare convalescent plasma; and (3), research capacity to conduct randomized controlled trials. The questionnaire was emailed to physicians. RESULTS: Of 582 physicians who were invited to the survey, 327 responded (56.2 %). The professional focus of the majority of respondents was critical care (106/249 (43 %)), pediatrics (59/249, (24 %)) or internal medicine (52/249 (21 %)) but none was blood banking. Nearly all respondents (251/263 (95 %)) reported to have access to ICU facilities within their institutions. Most respondents (219/270 (81 %)) reported that intensivists were the most physician group responsible for treatment decisions about critically ill SARI patients. While 125/165 respondents (76 %) reported that they conduct research in ICUs, and 80/161 (49.7 %) had been involved in the conduct of RCTs, including using a placebo comparison (60/161 (37 %)), only 49/226 (21 %) of respondents regularly participated in research networks.

Working groups developed plans by discussion and consensus for resuming elective services in pulmonary and sleep-medicine clinics, pulmonary function testing laboratories, bronchoscopy and procedure suites, polysomnography laboratories, and pulmonary rehabilitation facilities.Results: The community new case rate should be consistently low or have a downward trajectory for at least 14 days before resuming elective clinical services. In addition, institutions should have an operational strategy that consists of patient prioritization, screening, diagnostic testing, physical distancing, infection control, and follow-up surveillance. The goals are to protect patients and staff from exposure to the virus, account for limitations in staff, equipment, and space that are essential for the care of patients with COVID-19, and provide access to care for patients with acute and chronic conditions.Conclusions: Transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a dynamic process and, therefore, it is likely that the prevalence of COVID-19 in the community will wax and wane.

The peripheral regions of the Greater Toronto Area (York, Durham, Halton) would not enter lockdown until later the following month.

Methods: We used anonymized smartphone data to estimate the number of visits by residents of regions in the urban core to shopping malls and restaurants in peripheral regions in the week before compared to the week after the November 23 lockdown. Results: Residents of Toronto and Peel took fewer trips to shopping malls and restaurants in the week following lockdown. This was entirely driven by reductions in visits within the locked down regions themselves, as there was a significant increase in trips to shopping malls in peripheral regions by these residents in the same period (Toronto: +40.7%, Peel: +65.5%). Visits to restaurants in peripheral regions also increased slightly (Toronto: +6.3%, Peel: +11.8%). Discussion: Heterogeneous restrictions may undermine lockdowns in the urban core as well as driving residents from zones of higher transmission to zones of lower transmission. These concerns are likely generalizable to other major metropolitan areas, which often comprise interconnected but administratively independent regions.","output":"Increased Interregional Travel to Shopping Malls and Restaurants in Response to Differential COVID-19 Restrictions in the Greater Toronto Area"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the digital economy, the need and prospects for business development determine their own conditions to the personnel departments of enterprises and organizations.

During this timeframe, clinicians focused their efforts on repurposing drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) or azithromycin (AZM) to treat hospitalized COVID-19 patients. While clinical trials are time-consuming, the exponential increase in hospitalizations compelled the FDA to grant an emergency use authorization for HCQ and AZM as treatment for COVID-19, although there was limited evidence of their combined efficacy and safety. The authorization was revoked 4 months later, giving rise to controversial political and scientific debates illustrating important challenges such as premature authorization of potentially ineffective or unsafe therapeutics, while diverting resources from screening of effective drugs. Here we report on a preclinical drug screening platform, a cardiac microphysiological system (MPS), to rapidly identify clinically relevant cardiac liabilities associated with HCQ and AZM. The cardiac MPS is a microfabricated fluidic system in which cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells self-arrange into a uniaxially beating tissue. The drug response was measured using outputs that correlate with clinical measurements such as action potential duration (proxy for clinical QT interval) and drug-biomarker pairing. The cardiac MPS predicted clinical arrhythmias associated with QT prolongation and rhythm instabilities in tissues treated with HCQ. We found no change in QT interval upon acute exposure to AZM, while still observing a significant increase in arrhythmic events. These results suggest that this MPS can not only predict arrhythmias, but it can also identify arrhythmias even when QT prolongation is absent. When exposed to HCQ and AZM polytherapy, this MPS faithfully reflected clinical findings, in that the combination of drugs synergistically increased QT interval when compared to single drug exposure, while not worsening the overall frequency of arrhythmic events. The high content cardiac MPS can rapidly evaluate the cardiac safety of potential therapeutics, ultimately accelerating patients access to safe and effective treatments.","output":"Heart Muscle Microphysiological System for Cardiac Liability Prediction of Repurposed COVID-19 Therapeutics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Proteins play a key role in facilitating the infectiousness of the 2019 novel coronavirus.

This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of digital eye strain (DES), describe the pattern of gadget usage, and analyse the risk factors for DES. Methods: This online survey analysed 941 responses from students of online classes (688), teachers of online classes (45), and general population (208). A pre-validated questionnaire was used to calculate the DES score. Non-parametric tests of medians were used to compare the median DES score, Chi-square test to compare categorical variables, and binary logistic regression to find the predictors of DES. Results: The prevalence of eye strain was higher among students taking online classes compared to the general public (50.6% vs 33.2%; 2 = 22.5, df = 1, p < .0001). There was an increase in screen time during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic time. The DES score was highest among students attending online classes (p < .0001), in those with eye diseases (p = .001), greater screen time (p = <0.0001), screen distance <20 cm (p = .002), those who used gadgets in dark (p = .017) and those who took infrequent/no breaks (p = .018). The DES scores were proportional to the increase in the number of hours of gadget usage during the pandemic. Conclusion: There is a need to educate people about limiting overall screen exposure and ergonomic methods of screen viewing. Efforts from policymakers to reduce the duration of online classes for students and online work hours for professionals are warranted to control this epidemic of eye strain.","output":"Digital Eye Strain Epidemic amid COVID-19 Pandemic - A Cross-sectional Survey."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although COVID-19 has been primarily associated with pneumonia, recent data show that its causative agent, the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, can infect many vital organs beyond the lungs, including the heart, kidneys and the brain. The literature agrees that COVID-19 is likely to have long-term mental health effects on infected individuals, which signifies a need to understand the role of the virus in the pathophysiology of brain disorders that is currently unknown and widely debated. Our docking and molecular dynamic simulations show that the affinity of the spike protein from the wild type (WT) and the South African B.1.351 (SA) variant towards the MAO enzymes is comparable to that for its ACE2 receptor. This allows for the WT/SAMAO complex formation, which changes MAO affinities for their neurotransmitter substrates, thus consequently impacting the rates of their metabolic conversion and misbalancing their levels. Knowing that this fine regulation is strongly linked with the etiology of various brain pathologies, these results are the first to highlight the possibility that the interference with the brain MAO catalytic activity is responsible for the increased neurodegenerative illnesses following a COVID-19 infection, thus placing a neurobiological link between these two conditions in the spotlight. Since the obtained insight suggests that a more contagious SA variant causes even larger disturbances, and with new and more problematic strains likely emerging in the near future, we firmly advise that the presented prospect of the SARS-CoV-2 induced neurological complications should not be ignored, but rather requires further clinical investigations to achieve an early diagnosis and timely therapeutic interventions.

In the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of COVID-19 patients, we observed reduced expression of human leukocyte antigen class DR (HLA-DR) and proinflammatory cytokines by myeloid cells as well as impaired mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and interferon- (IFN-) production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells. By contrast, we detected enhanced plasma levels of inflammatory mediatorsincluding EN-RAGE, TNFSF14, and oncostatin Mwhich correlated with disease severity and increased bacterial products in plasma. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed a lack of type I IFNs, reduced HLA-DR in the myeloid cells of patients with severe COVID-19, and transient expression of IFN-stimulated genes. This was consistent with bulk PBMC transcriptomics and transient, low IFN- levels in plasma during infection.

METHODS: Data on 670 men who participated in the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)-9601 trial and who experienced biochemical recurrence were extracted using the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) data archive platform. Patients were stratified into four treatment groups: early sRT (pre-sRT prostate-specific antigen [PSA] < 0.7 ng/mL) and late sRT (pre-sRT PSA  0.7 ng/mL) with/without concomitant AAT, based on cut-offs reported in the original trial. Time-varying Cox proportional hazards and FineCGray competing-risk regression analyses assessed the adjusted hazards of overall mortality, CaP-specific mortality, and metastasis among the four treatment groups. RESULTS: At 15-years (median follow-up of 14.7 years), for patients treated with early sRT, early sRT with AAT, late sRT, and late sRT with AAT, the overall mortality, CaP-specific mortality, and metastasis rates were 22.9, 22.8, 40.1, and 22.9% (log-rank p = 0.0039), 12.1, 3.9, 22.7, and 8.0% (Grays p = 0.0004), and 18.8, 14.6, 35.9, and 19.5% (Grays p = 0.0004), respectively. Time-varying multivariable adjusted analysis demonstrated increased hazards of overall mortality in patients receiving delayed sRT versus early sRT (hazards ratio [HR] 1.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02C2.17); however, no difference remained after the addition of concomitant AAT to late sRT (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.55C1.32, referent early sRT). Likewise, the hazards of cancer-specific mortality and metastatic progression were worse for late sRT when compared with early sRT, but were no different after the addition of AAT to late sRT.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and deaths across Italian regions and provinces in March 2020 were linked to past exposure to fine and coarse particulate matter (namely, PM(2.5) and PM(10), respectively). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Geographical distributions of COVID-19 cases and deaths (105,792 and 12,428, respectively, up to 31(st) March 2020), PM(2.5) and PM(10) exposure, and demographic characteristics were extracted from publicly accessible databases. Adjusted regression models were performed to test the association between particulate matter exposure in different Italian regions and provinces and COVID-19 incidence proportions and death rates. RESULTS: A heterogeneous distribution of COVID-19 cases/deaths and particulate matter exposure was observed in Italy, with the highest numbers in Northern Italy regions and provinces. Independent associations between regional PM(2.5)/PM(10) exposure and COVID-19 incidence proportion and death rate were observed (COVID-19 incidence proportion:  = 0.71, p = 0.003,  = 0.61, p = 0.031, respectively; COVID-19 death rate:  = 0.68, p = 0.004 and  = 0.61, p = 0.029, respectively).

The virus remains in the gut weeks to months after respiratory infection, causing zonulin release from the intestinal epithelial cells. Zonulin loosens tight junctions, permitting trafficking of highly inflammatory viral particles into circulation. Current MIS-C treatments target the subsequent immune hyperactivation, not the causative loss of mucosal barrier integrity. Larazotide, a zonulin inhibitor, prevents breakdown of tight junctions, limiting antigen trafficking. DESIGN: Children with MIS-C were treated with larazotide as an adjuvant to steroid/intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. Clinical outcomes, SARS-CoV-2 antigenemia, and cytokine profiles are reported. Outcomes were compared with children with MIS-C receiving steroids and/or IVIG therapy alone. PATIENTS: Four children with MIS-C, ages 3C17 years, were enrolled. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were treated with open label larazotide 10 mcg/kg (maximum 500 mcg/dose) orally four times daily for 21 days. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All four patients tolerated larazotide without adverse effects and displayed reduction in Spike antigenemia to undetectable levels. When compared with 22 children with MIS-C receiving steroids and/or intravenous immunoglobulin therapy alone, larazotide-treated patients reported significantly improved time to resolution of gastrointestinal symptoms (p = 0.03), and time to clearance of Spike antigenemia (p = 0.04), plus a trend towards shorter length of stay.

Deficient N conditions (N1) resulted in low vegetation and fruit yield, high fruit:leaf ratio, high photosynthetic activity, high leaf P and K concentrations, as well as high sugar content and low acidity in the fruit. Excess N concentration (N3) enhanced vegetative growth and reduced fruit yield and gas exchange. The calculated annual nitrogen uptake heavily depended on the nitrogen supply, being highest for the N2 treatment (196 g/tree) as compared with the N1 (25 g/tree) or N3 (185 g/tree) treatments. Fruits were a major N sink being 82% (in N1), 26% (in N2), and 5% (in N3) of the total annual N supplied. The N accumulation rate in the fruit of the N1 and N2 treatment were above the N quantities supplied via fertigation, suggesting that N reserve in the vegetative tissues supplied the fruit's high N demand.

The data were analyzed using statistical methods. In general, the household hygiene conditions in the study need to be improved. The main potential sources of pathogen transmission were from the surrounding environment, i.e., non-permanent floor and garbage, and personal hygiene, i.e., handwashing facilities with water and soap were only observed in the homes of four out of ten respondents. The presence of livestock roaming freely in the houses yard was another source of contamination. Easy access to water and wealth significantly influenced the hygiene conditions. Implementing low-cost interventions, i.e., cleaning the house of garbage and animal feces and cleaning nails, should be the priority in immediate intervention, while providing easier access to water supply, especially during the dry season, could be a long-term intervention.

To evaluate the effects of erythropoietin administration on the adrenal glands in a swine model of ventricular fibrillation and resuscitation. Methods. Ventricular fibrillation was induced via pacing wire forwarded into the right ventricle in 20 female Landrace/Large White pigs, allocated into 2 groups: experimental group treated with bolus dose of erythropoietin (EPO) and control group which received normal saline. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed immediately after drug administration as per the 2010 European Resuscitation Council (ERC) guidelines for Advanced Life Support (ALS) until return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) or death. Animals who achieved ROSC were monitored, mechanically ventilated, extubated, observed, and euthanized. At necroscopy, adrenal glands samples were formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, and routinely processed. Sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Results. Oedema and apoptosis were the most frequent histological changes and were detected in all animals in the adrenal cortex and in the medulla. Mild and focal endothelial lesions were also detected. A marked interindividual variability in the degree of the intensity of apoptosis and oedema at cortical and medullary level was observed within groups. Comparing the two groups, higher levels of pathological changes were detected in the control group. No significant difference between the two groups was observed regarding the endothelial changes.

In our work, we aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism of artesunate-induced growth inhibition in human lung adenocarcinoma cells and reported that the anticancer effects of artesunate is related to its ability in downregulating AKT/Survivin signaling in A549 cells. The effect of artesunate on the proliferation of A549 cells was determined by CCK-8 assay and colony formation assay; its effect on A549 cell apoptosis was evaluated by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay. The role of artesunate on the activation of AKT/Survivin signaling was analyzed by western blot and quantitative QPCR. Finally, we used two mouse tumor models to investigate the function of artesunate on the in vivo growth of lung cancer cells. Artesunate treatment caused significant growth inhibition and apoptosis in A549 cells. Mechanistically, artesunate downregulated the activation of AKT/Survivin signaling. In agreement, hyperactivation of AKT signaling restored artesunate-induced growth inhibition in A549 cells. In mouse lung cancer models, artesunate administration significantly reduced the growth of A549 cells and LLC cells in nude mice and immunocompetent mice, respectively.

Traditionally, telemedicine has been used for acute events (e.g., stroke, used to relay essential information to the emergency department) and chronic disease management (e.g., diabetes and chronic kidney disease management). Though the utilization of telemedicine in gastroenterology and hepatology has been modest at best, especially for inflammatory bowel diseases and chronic liver disease management, since the onset of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, utilization of telemedicine in gastroenterology increased by 4000% in the first two weeks, equivalent to the last six years of growth before the pandemic. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) relaxed rules for the use of telemedicine with easing restrictions on reimbursements, location, licensing requirements (across state lines), and the need for a prior provider-patient relationship. These changes increased the use of telemedicine in inpatient and outpatient settings for gastroenterology-related referrals. The use of inpatient telephonic or video consults helps provide timely care during the pandemic while conserving personal protective equipment and decreasing provider and patient exposure. Nevertheless, telehealth use comes at the cost of no direct patient contact and lesser reimbursements. The appropriate use of technology and equipment, training of healthcare providers, use of platforms that can be integrated into the electronic health record while protecting the privacy and the flow of information are essential components of telemedicine. Furthermore, encouraging patients to seek medical care remotely with the proper equipment and improving digital literacy without the need for physical examinations is a challenge, further compounded in elderly or hard-of-hearing patients and in patients who are more comfortable with in-person visits.

The purpose of this study was to describe the tug-exposure technique, an innovative technique for performing safe single-incision laparoscopic splenectomy (SILS-Sp). METHODS We performed SILS-Sp in ten consecutive adult patients with a variety of pathology requiring total splenectomy. A SILS? Port with three 5-mm trocars was placed in the umbilicus as a single-access site. A flexible 5-mm laparoscope and an articulating grasper were used in addition to standard laparoscopic equipment. A cloth tape was introduced intraperitoneally to encircle and tug the splenic hilum. Both ends of the tape were extracted through an extra needle hole in the skin. Pulling the tape in appropriate directions provided excellent exposure of the splenic hilum (the tug-exposure technique). Under sufficient tension and exposure by tugging the spleen, a linear stapler was introduced for stapling and dividing the splenic hilum and the splenic artery and vein. The spleen was extracted through the umbilical wound within a retrieval bag. The umbilical wound was closed with subcutaneous sutures. RESULTS The tug-exposure technique was successfully used in all patients and markedly improved the exposure of the splenic hilum during SILS-Sp. The median intraoperative blood loss was 15 (range 0-1,000) ml. Only one patient (10%) required conversion to open surgery. Median operative time was 230 (range, 150-378) min, the median extracted spleen weight was 260 (range, 100-580) g, and the median postoperative hospital stay was 7 (range, 4-9) days. All patients were discharged uneventfully. The umbilical incision was nearly invisible at the 1-month follow-up.

Highly expressed in vivo during infection, Staphylococcal protein A (SpA) is reported to also contribute to nasal colonization that can be a prelude to invasive infection. Co-evolution with the host immune system has provided SpA with an Fc-antibody binding site, and a Fab-binding site responsible for non-immune superantigen interactions via germline-encoded surfaces expressed on many human BCRs. We wondered whether the recurrent exposures to S. aureus commonly experienced by adults, result in the accumulation of memory B-cell responses to other determinants on SpA. We therefore isolated SpA-specific class-switched memory B cells, and characterized their encoding VH : VL antibody genes. In SpA-reactive memory B cells, we confirmed a striking bias in usage for VH genes, which retain the surface that mediates the SpA-superantigen interaction. We postulate these interactions reflect co-evolution of the host immune system and SpA, which during infection results in immune recruitment of an extraordinarily high prevalence of B cells in the repertoire that subverts the augmentation of protective defenses. Herein, we provide the first evidence that human memory responses are supplemented by B-cell clones, and circulating-antibodies, that bind to SpA determinants independent of the non-immune Fc- and Fab-binding sites. In parallel, we demonstrate that healthy individuals, and patients recovering from S. aureus infection, both have circulating antibodies with these conventional binding specificities.

Bone marrowCderived hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) are known to stimulate vascular regeneration. Activation of either the Mas receptor (MasR) by angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)) or angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) stimulates vasoreparative functions in HSPCs. This study tested if aging is associated with decreased ACE2 expression in HSPCs and if Ang-(1-7) restores vasoreparative functions. Flow cytometric enumeration of Lin(?)CD45(low)CD34(+) cells was carried out in peripheral blood of male or female individuals (22C83 years of age). Activity of ACE2 or the classical angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was determined in lysates of HSPCs. Lin(?)Sca-1(+)cKit(+) (LSK) cells were isolated from young (3C5 months) or old (20C22 months) mice, and migration and proliferation were evaluated. Old mice were treated with Ang-(1-7), and mobilization of HSPCs was determined following ischemia induced by femoral ligation. A laser Doppler blood flow meter was used to determine blood flow. Aging was associated with decreased number (Spearman r = ? 0.598, P < 0.0001, n = 56), decreased ACE2 (r = ? 0.677, P < 0.0004), and increased ACE activity (r = 0.872, P < 0.0001) (n = 23) in HSPCs. Migration or proliferation of LSK cells in basal or in response to stromal-derived factor-1 in old cells is attenuated compared to young, and these dysfunctions were reversed by Ang-(1-7). Ischemia increased the number of circulating LSK cells in young mice, and blood flow to ischemic areas was recovered. These responses were impaired in old mice but were restored by treatment with Ang-(1-7).

The F protein folds initially to form a trimeric metastable prefusion form that is triggered to undergo large-scale irreversible conformational changes to form the trimeric postfusion conformation. It is thought that F refolding couples the energy released with membrane fusion. The F protein is synthesized as a precursor (F0) that must be cleaved by a host protease to form a biologically active molecule, F1,F2. Cleavage of F protein is a prerequisite for fusion and virus infectivity. Cleavage creates a new N terminus on F1 that contains a hydrophobic region, known as the FP, which intercalates target membranes during F protein refolding. The crystal structure of the soluble ectodomain of the uncleaved form of PIV5 F is known; here we report the crystal structure of the cleavage-activated prefusion form of PIV5 F. The structure shows minimal movement of the residues adjacent to the protease cleavage site.

COVID-19 is extremely infectious and is transmitted via respiratory droplets from infected persons. DM, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease are highly prevalent comorbidities associated with COVID-19. It has been observed that COVID-19 is associated with high blood-glucose levels, mainly in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Several studies have shown DM to be a significant risk factor affecting the severity of various kinds of infection. Dysregulated immunoresponse found in diabetic patients plays an important role in exacerbating severity. DM is among the comorbidities linked with mortality and morbidity in COVID-19 patients. Chronic conditions like obesity, cardiovascular disorders, and hypertension, together with changed expression of ACE2, dysregulated immunoresponse, and endothelial dysfunction, may put diabetic patients at risk of greater COVID-19 severity. Therefore, it is important to study specific characteristics of COVID-19 in diabetic people and treat these comorbidities along with COVID-19 infection, mainly among old individuals who are already suffering from serious and critical infections.

This study aims to examine the role of exercise in relieving stressful mental health outcomes (anxiety and depressive symptoms) during the COVID-19 pandemic and explore the underlying mechanism from the perspective of hope, using a combination of goal-directed planning (pathways) and motivation (agency). A cross-sectional online survey recruiting 2390 Chinese participants was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. A series of questions and scales, including the self-designed exercise questionnaire, the Adult Dispositional Hope Scale, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, were used to measure exercise, hope, anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms, respectively. A structural equation model was constructed to test the hypothesis that exercise benefits mental health outcomes through the mediating role of hope. Our results showed that exercise relieved stressful mental health outcomes via three paths: one direct path ( = ?0.077, 95% CI = (?0.138, ?0.017), p < 0.01), one indirect path through hope of pathways thinking ( = ?0.046, 95% CI = (?0.064, ?0.027), p < 0.001) and another indirect path through hope of agency thinking ( = ?0.060, 95% CI = (?0.081, ?0.039), p < 0.001).

A multi example learning student engagement assessment method based on a one-dimensional convolutional neural network is proposed. Based on the conceptual composition of student engagement, head posture, eye gaze, and eye-opening and closing states and the most used facial movement units are used as visual features. For feature extraction, the proposed view of relative change features, based on the video features extracted from the Open Face toolset, the standard deviation of the distance between adjacent multiple frames relative to the center point of the three visual features is used as the relative change features of the video. This results in the phenomenon that students are highly motivated in the early stage and significantly increase the rate of absenteeism in the later stage. With the development of information technology injecting new vitality into educational innovation, many researchers have introduced computer vision and image processing technology into students' online learning activities, and understand students' current learning situation by analyzing students' learning status. There are relatively few studies in this area in classroom teaching. Considering the low relative position correlation of the features in the examples, the examples are analyzed using a one-dimensional convolutional neural network to obtain the example-level student engagement, and a multi-example pooling layer is used to infer the student engagement in the video from the example-level student engagement. Finally, the experimental method is used to apply the student classroom attention evaluation detection system to actual classroom teaching activities, and the effectiveness and accuracy of the design of the student classroom attention evaluation detection system are investigated in depth through specific applications and example analysis, and the accuracy of the method of this paper is further verified by communicating feedback with teachers and students in the form of interviews.","output":"Analysis of Students' Role Perceptions and their Tendencies in Classroom Education Based on Visual Inspection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aims of this cross-sectional study were: (i) to establish the prevalence of problematic Internet use (PIU) and eating disorders (EDs) among Polish students; (ii) to investigate potential correlations between the two phenomena; and (iii) to identify predictors of eating disorders among socio-demographic and Internet use characteristics in this population.

A technical assistance system such as an e-coach could help to positively influence changes in dietary and exercise behavior and contribute to a sustainable improvement in ones nutrition and mobility status. Most apps do not provide a combination of nutrition and exercise content. In most cases, these apps were evaluated with healthy individuals aged <70 years, making transferability to vulnerable patients, with functional limitations and an assumed lower affinity for technology, in geriatric rehabilitation unlikely. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the potential for optimization and enhance usability through iterative test phases to develop a nutrition and mobility e-coach suitable for older adults (65 years) based on individual health behavior change stages in a rehabilitation setting. METHODS: Iterative testing was performed with patients aged 65 years in a rehabilitation center. During testing, participants used an e-coach prototype with educational elements and active input options on nutrition and mobility as a 1-time application test. The participants performed navigation and comprehension tasks and subsequently provided feedback on the design aspects. Hints were provided by the study team when required, documented, and used for improvements. After testing, the participants were asked to rate the usability of the prototype using the System Usability Scale (SUS). RESULTS: In all, 3 iterative test phases (T1-T3) were conducted with 49 participants (24/49, 49% female; mean 77.8, SD 6.2 years). Improvements were made after each test phase, such as adding explanatory notes on overview screens or using consistent chart types. The use of the user-centered design in this specific target group facilitated an increase in the average SUS score from 69.3 (SD 16.3; median 65) at T1 to 78.1 (SD 11.8; median 82.5) at T3. Fewer hints were required for navigation tasks (T1: 14.1%; T2: 26.5%; T3: 17.2%) than for comprehension questions (T1: 30.5%; T2: 21.6%; T3: 20%). However, the proportion of unsolved tasks, calculated across all participants in all tasks, was higher for navigation tasks (T1: 0%, T2: 15.2%, T3: 4.3%) than for comprehension tasks (T1: 1.9%, T2: 0%, T3: 2.5%). CONCLUSIONS: The extensive addition of explanatory sentences and terms, instead of shorter keywords, to make it easier for users to navigate and comprehend the content was a major adjustment. Thus, good usability (SUS: 80th-84th percentile) was achieved using iterative optimizations within the user-centered design. Long-term usability and any possible effects on nutritional and physical activity behavior need to be evaluated in an additional study in which patients should be able to use the e-coach with increasing independence, thereby helping them to gain access to content that could support their long-term behavior change.","output":"Iterative Development and Applicability of a Tablet-Based e-Coach for Older Adults in Rehabilitation Units to Improve Nutrition and Physical Activity: Usability Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing lethal acute respiratory disease emerged in December 2019 The World Health Organization named this disease \\"COVID-19\\" and declared it a pandemic on March 11, 2020 Many studies have shown that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their exosomes (MSCs-Exo), which are isolated from allogenic bone marrow stem cells, significantly lower the risk of alveolar inflammation and other pathological conditions associated with distinct lung injuries For example, in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pneumonia patients, MSCs-Exo and MSCs provide similar healing properties and some clinical trials have used cell-based inhalation therapy which show great promise MSCs and MSCs-Exo have shown potential in clinical trials as a therapeutic tool for severely affected COVID-19 patients when compared to other cell-based therapies, which may face challenges like the cells' sticking to the respiratory tract epithelia during administration However, the use of MSCs or MSCs-Exo for treating COVID-19 should strictly adhere to the appropriate manufacturing practices, quality control measurements, preclinical safety and efficacy data, and the proper ethical regulations This review highlights the available clinical trials that support the therapeutic potential of MSCs or MSCs-Exo in severely affected COVID-19 patients","output":"The Potential Use of Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Their Derived Exosomes as Immunomodulatory Agents for COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On 16 July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union issued their decision in the Schrems II case concerning Facebooks transfers of personal data from the EU to the US.

The impact of PVA on clinical outcomes has not been systematically evaluated. Effective interventions (except for closed-loop ventilation) for reducing PVA are not well established. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the impact of PVA on clinical outcomes in patients undergoing MV (Part A) and the effectiveness of interventions for patients undergoing MV except for closed-loop ventilation (Part B). We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO-ICTRP until August 2020. In Part A, we defined asynchrony index (AI)  10 or ineffective triggering index (ITI)  10 as high PVA. We compared patients having high PVA with those having low PVA. RESULTS: Eight studies in Part A and eight trials in Part B fulfilled the eligibility criteria. In Part A, five studies were related to the AI and three studies were related to the ITI. High PVA may be associated with longer duration of mechanical ventilation (mean difference, 5.16 days; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.38 to 7.94; n = 8; certainty of evidence [CoE], low), higher ICU mortality (odds ratio [OR], 2.73; 95% CI 1.76 to 4.24; n = 6; CoE, low), and higher hospital mortality (OR, 1.94; 95% CI 1.14 to 3.30; n = 5; CoE, low). In Part B, interventions involving MV mode, tidal volume, and pressure-support level were associated with reduced PVA. Sedation protocol, sedation depth, and sedation with dexmedetomidine rather than propofol were also associated with reduced PVA. CONCLUSIONS: PVA may be associated with longer MV duration, higher ICU mortality, and higher hospital mortality. Physicians may consider monitoring PVA and adjusting ventilator settings and sedatives to reduce PVA.

The first group (n=18, nine singing and nine controls) started face-to-face (five sessions) before changing to online delivery (seven sessions) due to COVID-19-related physical distancing measures. As such, the experience of this group is here reported as a pilot study to inform further research in this area. METHODS: We conducted semistructured interviews and thematic analysis regarding barriers, facilitators and key considerations for transitioning from face-to-face to online delivery. Pilot quantitative outcomes include attendance, premeasures and postmeasures of quality of life and disease impact (Short Form 36 Health Survey, COPD Assessment Test score), breathlessness (Medical Research Council breathlessness scale, Dyspnoea-12), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9, PHQ-9), anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7), balance confidence (Activity specific Balance Confidence, ABC scale) and physical activity (clinical visit PROactive physical activity in COPD tool, combining subjective rating and actigraphy). RESULTS: Attendance was 69% overall, (90% of the face-to-face sessions, 53% online sessions). Analysis of semistructured interviews identified three themes regarding participation in SLH delivered face to face and online, these where (1) perceived benefits; (2) digital barriers (online) and (3) digital facilitators (online).

METHODS: We enabled a tailored text-mining platform to identify data in their natural settings by retrieving and filtering online sources, and constructed vocabularies and learning word representations from natural language processing for deductive analysis along with the research theme. The data sources comprised of ten news websites, eleven discussion forums, one social network, and two principal media sharing networks in Taiwan. A synthesis of news and social networking analytics was present from December 30, 2019, to March 31, 2020. RESULTS: We collated over 1.07 million Chinese texts. Almost two-thirds of the texts on COVID-19 came from news services (n=683,887, 63.68%), followed by Facebook (n=297,823, 27.73%), discussion forums (n=62,119, 5.78%), and Instagram and YouTube (n=30,154, 2.81%). Our data showed that online news served as a hotbed for negativity and for driving emotional social posts. Online information regarding COVID-19 associated it with Chinaand a specific city within China through references to the Wuhan pneumoniapotentially encouraging xenophobia. The adoption of this problematic moniker had a high frequency, despite the World Health Organization guideline to avoid biased perceptions and ethnic discrimination. Social stigma is disclosed through negatively valenced responses, which are associated with the most blamed targets. CONCLUSIONS: Our sample is sufficiently representative of a community because it contains a broad range of mainstream online media. Stigmatizing language linked to the COVID-19 pandemic shows a lack of civic responsibility that encourages bias, hostility, and discrimination. Frequently used stigmatizing terms were deemed offensive, and they might have contributed to recent backlashes against China by directing blame and encouraging xenophobia. The implications ranging from health risk communication to stigma mitigation and xenophobia concerns amid the COVID-19 outbreak are emphasized.

So-called 'non-coding RNA' exerts specific and profound functional control on regulation of protein production and indeed controls the expression of all genes through processes collectively known as RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi is a naturally occurring intracellular process that regulates gene expression through the silencing of specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Methods are being developed that allow the catalytic degradation of targeted mRNAs using specifically designed complementary small interfering RNAs (siRNA). siRNAs are now being chemically modified and packaged into advanced delivery systems so as to acquire drug-like properties and the ability to deliver their effects systemically. Recent in vivo studies have provided proofs of the concept that RNAi may be useful therapeutically. Much of the design of these siRNAs can be accomplished bioinformatically, thus potentially expediting drug discovery and opening new avenues of therapy for many uncommon, orphan, or emerging diseases. Theoretically, any disease that can be ameliorated through knockdown of any endogenous or exogenous protein is a potential therapeutic target for RNAi-based therapeutics. Lung diseases in general are attractive targets for RNAi therapeutics, since the location of affected cells increases their accessibility to topical administration of siRNA, and respiratory viral infections are particularly attractive targets for RNAi-based drug discovery and development. RNAi therapeutics have been shown to exert potent antiviral effects against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza, influenza, coronaviruses, measles and human metapneumoviruses in vitro and in vivo. Recently, a double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial of an RNAi-based therapeutic against RSV demonstrated that this technology has therapeutic activity, representing the first proof-of-concept test of efficacy for RNAi's therapeutic effect in humans.

The purpose of this study was to assess how this decision affected hospital worker anxiety. METHODS: From April 27 to May 1, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel, while the country was under lock-down, an electronic questionnaire survey was carried out among hospital workers of the CTH and NCTH. The questionnaire includes personal demographics and attitudes about COVID-19 and assesses present anxiety state using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults (STAI-S) validated questionnaire. A STAI-S score of &#8805;45 was considered to represent clinical anxiety. RESULTS: Completed questionnaires were received from 1570 hospital employees (24%). 33.5% of responders had STAI-S scores &#8805;45. Multivariable regression analysis showed that being a resident doctor (odds ration [OR] 2.13; 95% CL, 1.41-3.23; P = 0.0003), age &#8804; 50 (OR, 2.08; 95% Cl, 1.62-2.67; P < .0001), being a nurse (OR, 1.29; 95% CL, 1.01-1.64; P = 0.039), female gender (OR, 1.63; 95% CL, 1.25-2.13; P = 0.0003) and having risk factors for COVID-19 (OR, 1.51; 95% CL, 1.19-1.91; P = 0.0007), but not hospital workplace (p = 0.08), were associated with the presence of clinical anxiety. 69% of the responders had been tested for COVID-19, but only nine were positive.

Compared with antibiotic treatment which could result in drug resistance, the vaccine therapy is becoming a promising immunotherapy option against H. pylori. Further, the multi-epitope vaccine could provoke a wider immune protection to control H. pylori infection. In this study, the in-silico immunogenicity calculations on 381 protein sequences of H. pylori were performed, and the immunogenicity of selected proteins with top-ranked score were tested. The B cell epitopes and T cell epitopes from three well performed proteins UreB, PLA1, and Omp6 were assembled into six constructs of multi-epitope vaccines with random orders. In order to select the optimal constructs, the stability of the vaccine structure and the exposure of B cell epitopes on the vaccine surface were evaluated based on structure prediction and solvent accessible surface area analysis. Finally Construct S1 was selected and molecular docking showed that it had the potential of binding TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 to stimulate strong immune response. In particular, this study provides good suggestions for epitope assembly in the construction of multi-epitope vaccines and it may be helpful to control H. pylori infection in the future.

Emerging literature increasingly supports the premise that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 promotes a prothrombotic milieu. However, to date there have been no reports of acute aortic occlusion, itself a rare phenomenon. We report a case of fatal acute aortic occlusion in a patient with coronavirus disease 2019. CASE REPORT: A 59-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of peripheral vascular disease presented to the emergency department for evaluation of shortness of breath, fevers, and dry cough. His symptoms started 5C7 days prior to the emergency department visit, and he received antibiotics in the outpatient setting without any effect. He was found to be febrile, tachypneic, and hypoxemic. He was placed on supplemental oxygen via a non-rebreather mask. Chest X-ray showed multifocal opacifications. Intravenous antibiotics for possible pneumonia were initiated. Hydroxychloroquine was initiated to cover possible coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia. During the hospitalization, the patient became progressively hypoxemic, for which he was placed on bilevel positive airway pressure. D-dimer, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein were all elevated. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was positive. On day 3, the patient was upgraded to the intensive care unit. Soon after he was intubated, he developed a mottled appearance of skin, which extended from his bilateral feet up to the level of the subumbilical plane. Bedside ultrasound revealed an absence of flow from the mid-aorta to both common iliac arteries. The patient was evaluated emergently by vascular surgery. After a discussion with the family, it was decided to proceed with comfort-directed care, and the patient died later that day. DISCUSSION: Viral infections have been identified as a source of prothrombotic states due to direct injury of vascular tissue and inflammatory cascades. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 appears to follow a similar pattern, with numerous institutions identifying elevated levels of thrombotic complications. We believe that healthcare providers should be aware of both venous and arterial thrombotic complications associated with coronavirus disease 2019, including possible fatal outcome.","output":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-induced acute aortic occlusion: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Physicians and nurses have received many accolades in commercial and scientific media for their heroic efforts in caring for patients with COVID-19.

Conventional management for leaks includes invasive reoperation and even gastrointestinal diversion. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to examine our contemporary outcome of using endoscopic esophageal stenting as primary therapy for management of anastomotic leak following minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE). METHODS We reviewed data on 11 patients who developed an esophageal leak following 111 MIE between January 2011 and December 2019. Of the 11 anastomotic leaks, 10 patients had an anastomotic disruption and underwent endoscopic esophageal stenting as primary therapy for management of leaks, while 1 patient had an anastomotic disruption complicated by an associated tracheoesophageal fistula that required surgical reoperation and subsequent colonic interposition. Main outcome measures focused on the 10 patients who were managed with endoscopic stenting, including length of hospital stay following leak management, need for thoracotomy or gastrointestinal diversion for leak, stent complications, and leak-associated mortality. RESULTS Of the 10 patients who underwent endoscopic esophageal stenting as primary therapy for management of leaks, there were 8 males with a median age of 66 years. The median time to diagnosis of anastomotic leak was 10 days postoperatively. One of the ten patients also underwent percutaneous drain placement, while none of the patients required thoracotomy. Median duration of stent placement was 39 (range, 29-105) days. Median length of stay after stent placement was 10 (range, 4-43) days. The median number of stent exchange was 1 (range, 1-3) stent. Gastrointestinal continuity was maintained in all patients. The 90-day leak-associated mortality was 9.1% (1 of 11 patients).

METHODS: We conducted a cohort-controled, nonrandomized, study in a Covid-19 reference centre in south-eastern France. Participants were consecutive surgical patients after triage and application to prevent from Covid-19 (Tab1). Data were collected prospectively during the propagation period from March 15th to May1st and compared with control data from outside the Covid-19 period. Primary endpoint was intensive care unit (ICU) admissions for surgery-related complications. Rates of surgery-specific death, postponed operations, positive PCR testing and Clavien-Dindo complications were assessed. Cancer and non-cancer subgroups during Covid-19 were also compared. RESULTS: After triage, 96 of 142 elective surgeries were postponed. Altogether, 71 patients, median age 68 yo [56-75], sex ratio M/F of 4/1, had surgery, among whom, 48 (68%) had uro-oncological surgery (Tab 2). No patients developed Covid-19 pneumonia in the post-surgery period. Three (4%) were admitted to the ICU, one of whom died from multi-organ failure due to septic shock caused by klebsiella pneumonia following a delay in treatment. Three Covid-19 RT-PCR were done and all were negative. There was no difference in mortality rates or ICU admission rates between control and Covid-era patients (Tab 3). CONCLUSIONS: Surgery after triage during the Covid-19 pandemic was not associated with worse short-term outcomes. Urological cancers could be operated on safely in our context but delays in care for aggressive genitourinary diseases could be lifethreatening.

Following pre-existing evidence in many other viral diseases, such as SARS, MERS and Ebola, CP and HP have also been proposed for the treatment of COVID-19. Nevertheless, due to the lack of large, well-designed, clinical trials, no clear-cut guidelines exist about what subtype of patient CP and HP should be administered to. CASE PRESENTATION: We have reported the cases of 3 patients, all immunosuppressed and affected by non-severe, prolonged COVID-19. They were treated with HP, whose neutralizing titer was higher than 1/80. The first patient was a 55-year-old male, who had undergone lung transplant. He was under therapy with Tacrolimus and developed non-neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV2. The second patient was a 77-year-old female, affected by follicular lymphoma. She had tested positive for SARS-CoV2 after 6 months. The third was a 60-year-old patient, affected by chronic leukemia. He did not develop antibodies after 2-month disease. All 3 patients received HP and had tested negative for SARS-CoV2 within 2 weeks. CONCLUSION: Despite encouraging initial data, no strong evidence exist in support of CP and HP to treat COVID-19.

With this major policy change, it is unknown how the attitude of the public changed and how information on cannabis changed. Social media platforms, including Twitter, are significant venues for studying emerging patterns in social issues such as cannabis legalization. This study aimed to examine sentiments, themes and contents of cannabis-related tweets by suppliers (both licensed and unlicensed) and general tweets in Canada. To our knowledge, this is the first analysis that mixes sentiment analysis and thematic analysis of Canadians cannabis-related Twitter data. METHOD: A sample of Canadian cannabis-related tweets was collected from January 2018 to August 2020 through the Twitter Application Programming Interface (API). Using a standard access token and the Twitter Standard Search API, tweets were extracted based on Twitter handles to capture the content of both licensed and unlicensed cannabis retailers in Canada, as well as relevant cannabis-related keywords to capture public content. We conducted sentiment and positive polarity analyses, and content analysis to identify attitudes and themes around cannabis use in Canada. RESULTS: This study gathered and analyzed a total of 44,970 tweets in the sentiment analysis and a total of 1035 tweets in the thematic analysis. Descriptive analysis showed that monthly tweets peaked prior to legalization in October 2018 and again during the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in February and March 2020. The data showed an overall positive sentiment polarity with a high of + 0.24 in April 2019 and a low of + 0.14 in March 2020.
