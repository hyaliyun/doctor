Recent studies using high-throughput sequencing have identified various genes responsible for cold adaptation. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying initial thermoregulation in response to acute cold exposure remain unclear. Therefore, we investigated transcriptional profiles of six young Japanese male adults exposed to acute cold stress. METHODS: In a climatic chamber, the air temperature was maintained at 28C for 65 min and was then gradually decreased to 19C for 70 min. Saliva samples were obtained from the subjects at 28C before and after 19C cold exposure and were used for RNA sequencing. RESULTS: In the cold exposure experiment, expression levels of 14 genes were significantly changed [false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05] although the degree of transcriptional changes was not high due to experimental conditions or blunted transcriptional reaction in saliva to cold stress. As a result, differential gene expression analyses detected the cathepsin L (CTSL) gene to be significantly upregulated, with FDR < 0.05 and log(2) fold change value > 1; thus, this gene was identified as a differentially expressed gene. Given that the cathepsin L protein is related to invasion of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), mild cold stress might alter the susceptibility to coronavirus disease-19 in humans. The gene ontology enrichment analysis for 14 genes with FDR < 0.05 suggested that immune-related molecules could be activated by mild cold stress. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained from this study indicate that CTSL expression levels can be altered by acute mild cold stress.

Currently, viruses of two distinct lineages of parvoviruses (PVs, family Parvoviridae; subfamily Hamaparvovirinae) infect penaeid shrimp. Here, a PV was isolated and cloned from Vietnamese P. monodon specimens, designated Penaeus monodon metallodensovirus (PmMDV). This is the first member of a third divergent lineage shown to infect penaeid decapods. PmMDV has a transcription strategy unique among invertebrate PVs, using extensive alternative splicing and incorporating transcription elements characteristic of vertebrate-infecting PVs. The PmMDV proteins have no significant sequence similarity with other PVs, except for an SF3 helicase domain in its nonstructural protein. Its capsid structure, determined by cryoelectron microscopy to 3-? resolution, has a similar surface morphology to Penaeus stylirostris densovirus, despite the lack of significant capsid viral protein (VP) sequence similarity. Unlike other PVs, PmMDV folds its VP without incorporating a A strand and displayed unique multimer interactions, including the incorporation of a Ca2+ cation, attaching the N termini under the icosahedral fivefold symmetry axis, and forming a basket-like pentamer helix bundle. While the PmMDV VP sequence lacks a canonical phospholipase A2 domain, the structure of an EDTA-treated capsid, determined to 2.8-? resolution, suggests an alternative membrane-penetrating cation-dependent mechanism in its N-terminal region. PmMDV is an observed example of convergent evolution among invertebrate PVs with respect to host-driven capsid structure and unique as a PV showing a cation-sensitive/dependent basket structure for an alternative endosomal egress.","output":"Molecular biology and structure of a novel penaeid shrimp densovirus elucidate convergent parvoviral host capsid evolution."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Piper was used to cure certain human afflictions.

This may occur in a subacute or chronic context, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or occur acutely as in pathogen challenge and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Despite the frequent challenge of lung homeostasis, not all pulmonary insults lead to disease. Traditionally thought of as a quiescent organ, emerging evidence highlights that the lung has significant capacity to respond to injury by repairing and replacing damaged cells. This occurs with the appropriate and timely resolution of inflammation and concurrent initiation of tissue repair programmes. Airway epithelial cells are key effectors in lung homeostasis and host defence; continual exposure to pathogens, toxins, and particulate matter challenge homeostasis, requiring robust defence and repair mechanisms. As such, the epithelium is critically involved in the return to homeostasis, orchestrating the resolution of inflammation and initiating tissue repair. This review examines the pivotal role of pulmonary airway epithelial cells in initiating and moderating tissue repair and restitution. We discuss emerging evidence of the interactions between airway epithelial cells and candidate stem or progenitor cells to initiate tissue repair as well as with cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems in driving successful tissue regeneration. Understanding the mechanisms of intercellular communication is rapidly increasing, and a major focus of this review includes the various mediators involved, including growth factors, extracellular vesicles, soluble lipid mediators, cytokines, and chemokines. Understanding these areas will ultimately identify potential cells, mediators, and interactions for therapeutic targeting.","output":"Epithelial Cells and Inflammation in Pulmonary Wound Repair"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although active surveillance SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) is required for proper outbreak control measures, many lower income countries find it challenging to detect VOCs by carrying genomic sequencing alone, due to limited resources. METHODS: VOCs can also be identified by the unique mutations in the spike protein by real-time PCR that detect these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We used a multiplex, real-time PCR assay for detection of these SNPs for identification of the prevalence of different SARS-CoV-2 VOCs in 16/26 districts in Sri Lanka. RESULTS: Of the 664/934 that were subjected to the multiplex qRT-PCR, 638 (96.1 %) detected L452R and K417 in the channels and were identified as the delta variant. 25 samples (3.9 %) detected N501Y, with K417 were considered as the alpha variant. Of 10/16 districts in Sri Lanka, the delta variant was the only VOC detected. CONCLUSIONS: This multiplex real-time qRT-PCR which identifies certain SNPs specific to the VOCs appears to be a fast, cheaper and less technically demanding method to generate data regarding the spread of different SARS-CoV-2 variants, and is a suitable method for lower income countries, to supplement the data generated by genomic sequencing.","output":"Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern by identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the spike protein by a multiplex real-time PCR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Large granular lymphocyte leukemia (LGLL) is characterized by somatic gain-of-function STAT3 mutations.

Correspondingly, treatment of healthy CD8+ T cells with IL-6, IL-15, and/or MCP-1 cytokines resulted in STAT3 activation, increased DNMT1, EZH2, c-MYC, l-MYC, MAX, and NFB levels, increased DNA methylation, and increased oxidative stress. Similar results were discovered in KAI3 NK cells overexpressing gain-of-function STAT3Y640F and STAT3G618R mutants compared to KAI3 NK cells overexpressing STAT3WT. Our results also confirm that STAT3 forms a direct complex with DNMT1, EZH2, and HDAC1. In STAT3 mutated LGLL cells, DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor azacitidine abrogated the activation of STAT3 via restored SHP1 expression. In conclusion, STAT3 mutations cause DNA hypermethylation resulting in sensitivity to DNMT inhibitors, which could be considered as a novel treatment option for LGLL patients with resistance to standard treatments.","output":"STAT3 activation in large granular lymphocyte leukemia is associated with cytokine signaling and DNA hypermethylation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Intensive rehabilitation of adolescents occurs in general and pediatric inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs), but differences in admission and outcomes by facility type have not been thoroughly investigated, particularly among persons with spinal cord injury (SCI). Objectives To investigate factors related to admission to pediatric or adult IRFs among adolescents and compare the rehabilitation outcomes between facility types. Methods Using a single-center retrospective cohort study design, demographic information, medical data, and rehabilitation outcomes were obtained by chart review of patients aged 15 to 18 years who received a rehabilitation medicine consultation at an urban level 1 trauma center between 2017 and 2019 (N = 96). Analysis was performed using R statistical software. Results SCI was the second most common diagnosis (21% of patients) and accounted for 36% of inpatient rehabilitation admissions. SCI patients were more likely to undergo rehabilitation at the level 1 trauma versus pediatric facility (relative risk [RR] = 2.43; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.08-5.44) compared to traumatic brain injury patients.

However, few studies have characterized the clinical features and outcomes associated with PIV infections among young children in the Middle East. METHODS: We conducted hospital-based surveillance for ARI among children < 2 years of age in a large referral hospital in Amman, Jordan. We systematically collected clinical data and respiratory specimens for pathogen detection using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. We compared clinical features of PIV-associated ARI among individual serotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4 and among PIV infections compared with other viral ARI and ARI with no virus detected. We also compared the odds of supplemental oxygen use using logistic regression. RESULTS: PIV was detected in 221/3168 (7.0%) children hospitalized with ARI. PIV-3 was the most commonly detected serotype (125/221; 57%). Individual clinical features of PIV infections varied little by individual serotype, although admission diagnosis of croup was only associated with PIV-1 and PIV-2. Children with PIV-associated ARI had lower frequency of cough (71% vs 83%; p < 0.001) and wheezing (53% vs 60% p < 0.001) than children with ARI associated with other viruses. We did not find a significant difference in supplemental oxygen use between children with PIV-associated infections (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.12, 95% CI 0.66C1.89, p = 0.68) and infections in which no virus was detected.

Studies were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria after assessing the risk of bias in comparative studies with Cochrane and rating quality of evidence with the GRADE methodology. The meta-analysis was carried out using the Review Manager 5.4 program to conduct homogeneity tests. RESULTS One cohort study and three randomized controlled trials (RCT), including a total of 1457 participants were included in the meta-analysis. ETA included endovenous laser ablation (ELVA) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the selected studies. Comparison between CA and a combination of EVLA and RFA or RFA alone were carried out in two of RCTs, while comparison between CA with EVLA was conducted in one RCT and the cohort study. There was no statistical difference in closure rates between CA and ETA after pooled analysis. Similar symptom alleviation observed between different groups. However, the CA group showed a lower ecchymosis rate than RFA and a significantly lower incidence of adverse events, such as ecchymosis, phlebitis and paresthesia, than EVLA.

Previous research on the effectiveness of rumor rebuttal, to a certain extent, ignored or simplified the structure of dissemination networks and users' cognition as well as decision-making and interaction behaviors. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to roughly evaluate the effectiveness of rumor rebuttal; dig deeply into the attitude-based echo chamber effect on users' responses to rumor rebuttal under multiple topics on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform, in the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic; and evaluate the echo chamber's impact on the information characteristics of user interaction content. METHODS: We used Sina Weibo's application programming interface to crawl rumor rebuttal content related to COVID-19 from 10 AM on January 23, 2020, to midnight on April 8, 2020. Using content analysis, sentiment analysis, social network analysis, and statistical analysis, we first analyzed whether and to what extent there was an echo chamber effect on the shaping of individuals' attitudes when retweeting or commenting on others' tweets. Then, we tested the heterogeneity of attitude distribution within communities and the homophily of interactions between communities. Based on the results at user and community levels, we made comprehensive judgments. Finally, we examined users' interaction content from three dimensions-sentiment expression, information seeking and sharing, and civility-to test the impact of the echo chamber effect. RESULTS: Our results indicated that the retweeting mechanism played an essential role in promoting polarization, and the commenting mechanism played a role in consensus building. Our results showed that there might not be a significant echo chamber effect on community interactions and verified that, compared to like-minded interactions, cross-cutting interactions contained significantly more negative sentiment, information seeking and sharing, and incivility.

Currently, several studies have documented the association between obesity and COVID-19 severity. The mechanisms underlying the increased risk of complications and mortality in obese patients with COVID-19 are of diverse nature. Inflammation plays a central role in obesity. Metabolic alterations seen in obese patients are related to an inflammatory response, and several studies report elevated levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines in obese patients. Also, deregulated expression of adipokines, such as leptin and resistin, increase the expression of vascular adhesion molecule 1 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 that contribute to increased vascular leukocyte adhesiveness and additional oxidative stress. Additionally, it is now recognized that the chronic impairment of systemic vascular endothelial function in patients with cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, including obesity, when intensified by the detrimental effects of SARS-CoV-2 over the endothelium, may explain their worse outcomes in COVID-19. In fact, vascular endothelial dysfunction may contribute to a unfavorable response of the endothelium to the infection by SARS-CoV-2, whereas alterations in cardiac structure and function and the prothrombotic environment in obesity may also provide a link to the increased cardiovascular events in these patients.","output":"Obesity-Related Inflammation and Endothelial Dysfunction in COVID-19: Impact on Disease Severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A highly pathogenic human coronavirus (CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), has emerged in Jeddah and other places in Saudi Arabia, and has quickly spread to European and Asian countries since September 2012. Up to the 1(st) October 2015 it has infected at least 1593 people with a global fatality rate of about 35%. Studies to understand the virus are necessary and urgent. In the present study, MERS-CoV main protease (M(pro)) is expressed; the dimerization of the protein and its relationship to catalysis are investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: The crystal structure of MERS-CoV M(pro) indicates that it shares a similar scaffold to that of other coronaviral M(pro) and consists of chymotrypsin-like domains I and II and a helical domain III of five helices. Analytical ultracentrifugation analysis demonstrated that MERS-CoV M(pro) undergoes a monomer to dimer conversion in the presence of a peptide substrate. Glu169 is a key residue and plays a dual role in both dimerization and catalysis. The mutagenesis of other residues found on the dimerization interface indicate that dimerization of MERS-CoV M(pro) is required for its catalytic activity. One mutation, M298R, resulted in a stable dimer with a higher level of proteolytic activity than the wild-type enzyme. CONCLUSIONS: MERS-CoV M(pro) shows substrate-induced dimerization and potent proteolytic activity. A critical assessment of the residues important to these processes provides insights into the correlation between dimerization and catalysis within the coronaviral M(pro) family.","output":"Critical Assessment of the Important Residues Involved in the Dimerization and Catalysis of MERS Coronavirus Main Protease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the present study is to reveal the opinions of the chefs who working as a manager in the kitchen department within the food and beverage sector about what changes might have occurred in their occupation and food and beverage sector after the COVID-19 outbreak The data were collected through online interview forms and content analysis was used as a data analysis method The findings reveal three main categories: general opinions after the COVID-19 outbreak, changes that could occur in the food and beverage sector after COVID-19 outbreak, and thoughts for the future of the chef occupation after the COVID-19 outbreak Since this paper is the first to reveal the opinions of the chefs about what changes might have occurred in their occupation and food and beverage sector after the COVID-19 outbreak, and no similar study could be found in the existing literature, these findings are original","output":"The future of the chef occupation and the food and beverage sector after the COVID-19 outbreak: Opinions of Turkish chefs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 has triggered a global pandemic without successful therapeutics. The goal of present study was to define the antiviral effect and therapeutic action of blue light irradiation in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Vero cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (NCCP43326) or mock inoculum at 50 pfu/well. After blue light irradiation, inhibitory effect was assessed by qPCR and plaque reduction assay. When Vero cells were irradiated to blue light ranging from 1.6 to 10 J/cm2 , SARS-CoV-2 replication was inhibited by up to 80%. The antiviral effect of blue light irradiation was associated with translation suppression via the phosphorylation of eIF2 by prolonging endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The levels of LC3A/B and Beclin-1, which are key markers of autophagy, and the levels of PERK and PDI for ER stress were highly increased, whereas caspase-3 cleavage was inhibited after blue light irradiation in the later stage of the infection. Our data revealed that blue light irradiation exerted antiviral and photo-biogoverning activities by prolonging ER stress and stimulating autophagy progression during viral infection.

Critically, successful adaptation helps reduce such symptoms to baseline, preventing long-term psychiatric disorders. It is thus important to understand whether and which psychiatric symptoms only show transient elevations, and which persist long-term and become chronically heightened. At particular risk for the latter trajectory are disorders with symptoms directly affected by the pandemic, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder. Methods: In this longitudinal large-scale study (N=416), we assessed how obsessive-compulsive (OC), anxiety, and depression symptoms changed throughout the course of the first pandemic wave in a sample of the general UK public. We further examined how these symptoms affected pandemic-related information seeking and adherence to governmental guidelines. Findings: All psychiatric domains were initially elevated, but showed distinct adaptation patterns. Depression scores decreased during the first pandemic wave, however, OC symptoms further increased, even after the end of lockdown. These OC symptoms were directly linked to Covid-related information seeking which gave rise to higher adherence to government guidelines. Interpretation: The rise and persistence of OC symptoms, despite the ease of Covid-19 restrictions, shows that OCD is disproportionally and chronically affected by the pandemic. This is particularly worrying with regards to the long-term impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on public mental health and indicates that patients with OCD may require particular treatment efforts.","output":"A Selective Increase in OC Symptoms is Driving Information Seeking and Guideline Adherence During the Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic has resulted in a universal search for potential treatments of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Initial reports of the therapeutic potential of chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and early non-randomized non-controlled studies were followed by subsequent trials refuting such properties. The use of CQ and HCQ in diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), prompted us to examine the prevalence of COVID-19 and proposed prophylactic and therapeutic properties of HCQ in this population. Methods: A total of 103 patients with RA and SLE aged 18 to 75 diagnosed with COVID-19 were identified. The patients were categorized as those taking HCQ (cases) and those not on HCQ (controls) for at least 6 months. Primary (mechanical ventilation, length of stay, death) and secondary outcomes were defined, data were collected, and results were compared and statistically analyzed between cases and controls. Results: No statistical difference was observed in demographic features, baseline comorbidities, and medications. Primary outcomes statistical analysis did not reveal any differences between cases and controls. Statistical analysis of secondary outcomes revealed that cases had a statistically higher chance of being tachypneic (p 0.034). D-Dimer (p 0.017) and LDH levels (p 0.044) were found to be significantly lower in cases versus controls. Conclusion: This study highlights the lack of clinical prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of HCQ against COVID-19 when taken at regular doses for patients with RA and SLE. It also shows that the prevalence of COVID-19 was similar in RA and SLE patients regardless of baseline consumption of HCQ. ? 2021 Mollaeian et al.","output":"Covid-19 prevalence and outcomes among individuals with rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus taking hydroxychloroquine;a retrospective analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Alcoholism causes various maladaptations in the central nervous system, including the neuroimmune system. Studies of alcohol-induced dysregulation of the neuroimmune system generally focus on alcohol dependence and brain damage, but our previous research indicates that repetitive binge-like consumption perturbs cytokines independent of cell death. This paper extends that research by examining the impact of binge-like consumption on microglia in the hippocampus and the amygdala. Microglia were assessed using immunohistochemistry following binge-like ethanol consumption based on Drinking-in-the-Dark model. Immunohistochemistry results showed that binge-like ethanol consumption caused an increase in Iba-1 immunoreactivity and the number of Iba-1+ cells after one Drinking-in-the-Dark cycle. However, after three Drinking-in-the-Dark cycles, the number of microglia decreased in the hippocampus. We showed that in the dentate gyrus, the average immunoreactivity/cell was increased following ethanol exposure despite the decrease in number after three cycles. Likewise, Ox-42, an indicator of microglia activation, was upregulated after ethanol consumption. No significant effects on microglia number or immunoreactivity (Iba-1 nor Ox-42) were observed in the amygdala. Finally, ethanol caused an increase in the expression of the microglial gene Aif-1 during intoxication and ten days into abstinence, suggesting persistence of ethanol-induced upregulation of microglial genes. Altogether, these findings indicate that repetitive binge-like ethanol is sufficient to elicit changes in microglial reactivity. This altered neuroimmune state may contribute to the development of alcohol use disorders.","output":"Repetitive binge-like consumption based on the Drinking-in-the-Dark model alters the microglial population in the mouse hippocampus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A sizeable proportion of individuals contracting the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection remains asymptomatic, while some patients develop mild symptoms and others exhibit severe symptomatology becoming critically ill necessitating admission to intensive care unit exposed to a high mortality risk The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this diversity in the clinical picture of COVID-19 are poorly understood A variety of reasons have been postulated, among which, viral load, age, gender, immune response, blood type, genotypes, polymorphisms, comorbidities and pre-existing immunity are actively explored Thus, there is a dire need to further elucidate this phenomenon and find ways to identify and discern susceptible from resistant individuals with the ultimate goal to find a cure for the disease These issues are herein discussed and pertinent recent literature is reviewed [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Rhythmos is the property of Evagelismos General Hospital of Athens and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Asymptomatic Carriers/Patients with COVID-19 Infection: How is this Possible?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted the search for animal models that recapitulate the pathophysiology observed in humans infected with SARS-CoV-2 and allow rapid and high throughput testing of drugs and vaccines.

However, the degree to which people use mobile devices to help them make medical decisions remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to explore factors associated with self-reported use of tablets or smartphones to support medical decision making in a nationally representative sample of US adults. METHODS: Cross-sectional data from participants in the 2018 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS 5, Cycle 2) were evaluated. There were 3504 responses in the full HINTS 5 Cycle 2 data set; 2321 remained after eliminating respondents who did not have complete data for all the variables of interest. The primary outcome was use of a tablet or smartphone to help make a decision about how to treat an illness or condition. Sociodemographic factors including gender, race/ethnicity, and education were evaluated. Additionally, mobile health (mHealth)- and electronic health (eHealth)-related factors were evaluated including (1) the presence of health and wellness apps on a tablet or smartphone, (2) use of electronic devices other than tablets and smartphones to monitor health (eg, Fitbit, blood glucose monitor, and blood pressure monitor), and (3) whether people shared health information from an electronic monitoring device or smartphone with a health professional within the last 12 months. Descriptive and inferential statistics were conducted using SAS version 9.4. Weighted population estimates and standard errors, univariate odds ratios, and 95% CIs were calculated, comparing respondents who used tablets or smartphones to help make medical decisions (n=944) with those who did not (n=1377), separately for each factor. Factors of interest with a P value of <.10 were included in a subsequent multivariable logistic regression model.

The contribution of this research to the study of financial market behavior is that uncertainty and uncertainty faced by investors affect market behavior and changes as measured by the index. ? 2021 by authors.","output":"Impact of covid-19 news on performance of indonesia stock market"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The contemporary strategic operating environment is increasingly characterized by increasing complexity and dynamic change, leading into new vulnerabilities and uncertainty. Whilst global information and transparency have reached unparalleled levels, we still seem to be taken by surprise with sudden shocks and crisis. In some cases this is due to the deep or extreme uncertainty, i.e. in case of events that are so unique that they are genuinely unprecedented or extremely rare (think of a planet killer meteorite striking Earth), or high impactlow probability risks that do not get prioritized by political decision-makers as preparedness priorities. The COVID-19 pandemic appears to be a good example of the latter. Whilst experts were warning governments (for instance the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board in a September 2019 report [1]) about an influenza pandemic involving a high-impact respiratory pathogen and criticized them about the lack of preparedness for such an event, the exponential spread of COVID-19 took governments around the world by surprise. The initial excuse was that COVID-19 was an unexpected black swan, which it of course was not. Either the thinking as it relates to pandemic threats is in too linear terms, or the message from the experts was not sufficiently convincing to political decision-makers to spring into action. This begs the questionwhy do we either ignore such risks or fail to take decisive action in face of a large-scale disaster? The purpose of this chapter is to review and examine methods and approaches that could enable governments and organizations to integrate security and preparedness decision-making from monitoring and detection to action through improved sensemaking. In other words, it seeks a path to being less taken surprise by the perils of deep uncertainty and taking the appropriate actions in a timely and sufficient manner. ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"Sensemaking Under Conditions of Extreme Uncertainty: From Observation to Action"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Abrupt implementation of lockdowns during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic affected the management of diabetes mellitus in patients worldwide. Limited access to health facilities and lifestyle changes potentially affected metabolic parameters in patients at risk. We conducted a meta-analysis to determine any differences in the control of metabolic parameters in patients with diabetes, before and during lockdown. METHODS: We performed searches of five databases. Meta-analyses were carried out using random- or fixed-effect approaches to glycaemic control parameters as the primary outcome: glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), random blood glucose (RBG), fasting blood glucose (FBG), time-in-range (TIR), time-above-range (TAR), time-below-range (TBR). Mean difference (MD), confidence interval (CI), and P value were calculated. Lipid profile was a secondary outcome and is presented as a descriptive analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies enrolling a total of 3,992 patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T1DM or T2DM) were included in the study. Patients with T1DM showed a significant improvement of TIR and TAR (MD=3.52% [95% CI, 0.29 to 6.74], I(2)=76%, P=0.03; MD=?3.36% [95% CI, ?6.48 to ?0.25], I(2)=75%, P=0.03), while FBG among patients with T2DM significantly worsened (MD=3.47 mg/dL [95% CI, 1.22 to 5.73], I(2)=0%, P<0.01). No significant difference was found in HbA1c, RBG, and TBR. Use of continuous glucose monitoring in T1DM facilitated good glycaemic control. Significant deterioration of lipid parameters during lockdown, particularly triglyceride, was observed. CONCLUSION: Implementation of lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic did not worsen glycaemic control in patients with diabetes. Other metabolic parameters improved during lockdown, though lipid parameters, particularly triglyceride, worsened.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown on the Metabolic Control Parameters in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly altered common social and economic patterns as governments all over the world have been forced to take drastic measures to counter the spread of the disease Among them, quarantine, the closure of borders, and social distancing are the ones that have affected transportation systems most severely With the clear need to avoid all unnecessary direct human contact, an increased interest in contactless transportation and delivery modes emerged Drones are a promising alternative in this regard, especially for the delivery of essential goods, such as COVID-19 viral tests In this study, we therefore investigate how drones can be used to distribute viral tests to potentially infected patients The novel approach that we propose is to use existing drone infrastructure to perform this task, where drones owned and operated by different public and private entities are retrofitted for the distribution of essential goods in the case of emergency In a wider sense, we hence suggest the establishment of a drone enabled back-up transport system Potential performance gains are analyzed through a mathematical time and cost model that was developed in close cooperation with the state Red Cross Organization and a utility drone manufacturer Process design as well as parameter estimation are based on empirical investigation including, but not limited to, accompanying a COVID-19 mobile testing team in the field The practical feasibility was verified by retrofitting drones initially assigned to other purposes Additionally, policy recommendations, such as the establishment of public-public and public-private partnerships, were identified","output":"Containing the COVID-19 Pandemic with Drones - Feasibility of a Drone Enabled Back-up Transport System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multiple strains of the SARS-CoV-2 have arisen and jointly influence the trajectory of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.

AIM: The study was performed to describe the changes in hospital admissions during the first phase of the pandemic. METHODS: The Norwegian Institute of Public Health established a national preparedness register with daily updates on COVID-19 cases and the use of health services. We used individual-level information on inpatients from the electronic journal systems for all hospitals in Norway to estimate daily hospital admissions. RESULTS: Before the onset of the pandemic in March, there was an average of 2400 inpatient admissions per day in Norway, which decreased to approximately 1500 in the first few days after lockdown measures were implemented. The relative magnitudes of the decreases were similar in men and women and across all age groups. The decreases were substantial for both elective (54%) and emergency (29%) inpatient care. The admission rate gradually increased and reached pre-pandemic levels in June. However, the reductions in admissions for pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease seemed to persist.

In 2019 and 2020, COVID-19 mitigation was the only issue the world raised questions about; for example, the KSA and the rest of the world are working diligently to meet COVID-19 mitigation targets. To assess policy supervision in terms of the ability to achieve COVID-19 targets, this survey examines the operators necessary to achieve the SDGs in regard to improving COVID-19 mitigation and increasing economic growth. In particular, we examine COVID-19 mitigation under the setting of an N-shaped environmental Kuznets curve (N-shaped EKC) in the KSA. To identify the COVID-19 shock in the KSA, the effects of oil price and oil rent on CO(2) emissions are examined. The results of the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) and non-autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) bound testing approach indicate that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the inverted N-shaped EKC hypothesis is validated in the long term. Empirically, we find that oil price strengthens the relationship of level, quadratic and cubic of economic growth and environmental quality while oil rent weakens this relationship. Additionally, the long-term incidences of positive shocks on oil price in the presence of COVID-19 outbreak are not similar to the negative shock to CO(2) emissions, implying the existence of asymmetric impacts on carbon dioxide emissions in long-term forms. Our research implies that an oil price shock could be judicious for macro guidance of the economy in the KSA.

METHODS: An anonymous online REDCap survey was developed and emailed to 436 dental and dental hygiene students at a US dental school. The survey consisted of 81 questions that covered demographics, career plans postgraduation, and readiness and wellness measures. An open-ended question assessing how students career plans have changed during the pandemic was also included. RESULTS: A total of 252 students completed the survey, of whom 11.5% reported that their plans for future dental practice have changed since the COVID-19 outbreak. Students who reported a change to their career plans had significantly higher mean perceived stress (20.1 vs. 16.3; P = 0.003) and anxiety (9.2 vs. 6.2; P = 0.004) scores and lower mean resilience (18.9 vs. 20.9; P = 0.01) scores than those who reported no change to their career plans. Concerns were raised regarding the limited employment opportunities, long-term stability of the dental profession, and the interruptions to clinical education and licensure examinations consequent to the pandemic.

This perspective allows to model different scenarios and illustrates the evolution and trends of the pandemic because it is based on the open data daily provided by the governments. To measure the severity of the pandemic along the time, a danger index (DI) is proposed in addition to the well-known R0 index.

Socio-environmental measures implemented as Ireland s prudent response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19) pandemic represented, in effect, a national lockdown and have possibly influenced the health and wellbeing of pregnant women and unborn infants. Cumulative impact of such socio-environmental factors operating contemporaneously on PTB has never been assessed before. Methods: Regional PTB trends of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants in one designated health area of Ireland over two decades were analysed. Poisson regression and rate ratio analyses with 95% CI were conducted. Observed regional data from January to April 2020 were compared to historical regional and national data and forecasted national figures for 2020. Results: Poisson regression analysis found that the regional historical VLBW rate per 1000 live births for January to April, 2001 to 2019 was 8.18 (95% CI: 7.21, 9.29). During January to April 2020, an unusually low VLBW rate of just 2.17 per 1000 live births was observed. The rate ratio of 3.77 (95% CI: 1.21, 11.75), p = 0.022, estimates that for the last two decades there was, on average, 3.77 times the rate of VLBW, compared to the period January to April 2020 during which there is a 73% reduction. National Irish VLBW rate for 2020 is forecasted to be reduced to 400 per 60,000 births compared to historical 500 to 600 range. Conclusion: An unprecedented reduction in PTB of VLBW infants was observed in one health region of Ireland during the COVID-19 lockdown. Potential determinants of this unique temporal trend reside in the summative socio-environmental impact of the COVID-19 dictated lockdown. Our findings, if mirrored in other regions that have adopted similar measures to combat the pandemic, demonstrate the potential to evaluate these implicated interdependent behavioural and socio-environmental modifiers to positively influence PTB rates globally.","output":"Reduction in preterm births during the COVID-19 lockdown in Ireland: a natural experiment allowing analysis of data from the prior two decades."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Riccio examines whether one test is enough in the COVID-19 pandemic It is now generally recognized that testing is critical to beating the novel coronavirus, for designing policies with long lasting effects, and allowing for the safe opening of our economy Beyond the general public health aspects of testing, most people want to know answers to several key questions No test is perfect There is always the possibility of someone without the virus testing positive, called a false positive, and there is always the possibility of someone with the virus testing negative, called a false negative The two probabilities are not only most often not equal, but they are also not necessarily related One can be high and the other low, or they both may be high or both may be low","output":"Testing for coronavirus: Is one test enough?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM To present own experience in surgical treatment of cervical paragangliomas.

Production of recombinant proteins in P. pastoris is usually performed by controlling gene expression with the strong AOX1 promoter, which is induced by addition of methanol. Optimization of processes using the AOX1 promoter in P. pastoris is generally done in bioreactors by fed-batch fermentation with a controlled continuous addition of methanol for avoiding methanol toxification and carbon/energy starvation. The development of feeding protocols and the study of AOX1-controlled recombinant protein production have been largely made in shake flasks, although shake flasks have very limited possibilities for measurement and control. RESULTS: By applying on-line pO(2 )monitoring we demonstrate that the widely used pulse feeding of methanol results in long phases of methanol exhaustion and consequently low expression of AOX1 controlled genes. Furthermore, we provide a solution to apply the fed-batch strategy in shake flasks. The presented solution applies a wireless feeding unit which can be flexibly positioned and allows the use of computer-controlled feeding profiles. By using the human collagen II as an example we show that a quasi-continuous feeding profile, being the simplest way of a fed-batch fermentation, results in a higher production level of human collagen II. Moreover, the product has a higher proteolytic stability compared to control cultures due to the increased expression of human collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase as monitored by mRNA and protein levels. CONCLUSION: The recommended standard protocol for methanol addition in shake flasks using pulse feeding is non-optimal and leads to repeated long phases of methanol starvation. The problem can be solved by applying the fed-batch technology. The presented wireless feeding unit, together with an on-line monitoring system offers a flexible, simple, and low-cost solution for initial optimization of the production in shake flasks which can be performed in parallel. By this way the fed-batch strategy can be applied from the early screening steps also in laboratories which do not have access to high-cost and complicated bioreactor systems.","output":"Improved production of human type II procollagen in the yeast Pichia pastoris in shake flasks by a wireless-controlled fed-batch system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter reviews the cardiovascular anatomy, the effects of medications on the cardiovascular system, and current guidelines.

Lymph node size was assessed in the patient group on the injection side. Student t-test, analyses of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey post-hoc test, and 2 test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: 20 patients with clinically suspected post-vaccine myocarditis (28a??a??12 years; 12 men) and 40 controls (31a??a??11 years; 25 men) were evaluated. According to the 2018 Lake Louise criteria (LLC), patients with clinically suspected myocarditis were further subdivided into an LLC-positive group (na??=a??9) and an LLC-negative group (na??=a??11). The mean time of symptom onset after vaccination was 1.1a??a??1.2 days (LLC-positive) and 6.5a??a??9.2 days (LLC-negative). Group differences in inflammatory variables between myocarditis patients and control subjects were more pronounced in the LLC-positive group (e.a??g., T1 relaxation time: 1041a??a??61a??ms [LLC positive] vs. 1008a??a??79a??ms [LLC-negative] vs. 970a??a??25a??ms [control]; pa??<.001; or T2 signal intensity ratio 2.0a??a??0.3 vs. 1.6a??a??0.3 [LLC-negative] and vs. 1.6a??a??0.3 [control], pa??=a??.012). LLC-positive patients were significantly faster in receiving an MRI after initial symptom onset (8.8a??a??6.1 days vs. 52.7a??a??33.4 days; pa??=a??.001) and had higher troponin T levels (3938a??a??5850a??ng/l vs. 9a??a??11a??ng/l; pa??<.001). LGE lesions were predominantly located at the subepicardium of the lateral wall. Axillary lymphadenopathy was more frequent in the LLC-positive group compared to the LLC-negative group (8/9 [89a??%] vs. 0/11 [0a??%], pa??<a??0.001). CONCLUSION: Vaccine-induced myocarditis should be considered in patients with acute symptom onset after mRNA vaccination, especially if elevated serum troponin T is observed.

OBJECTIVE: Comparison of the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients during the pandemic with those of influenza patients in previous influenza seasons at the same hospital DESIGN: Admission rates, clinical measurements, and clinical outcomes from confirmed COVID-19 cases between March 1 and April 30, 2020, were compared with those from confirmed influenza cases in the previous five influenza seasons (8 months each) beginning September 1, 2014. SETTING: Large tertiary care teaching hospital in Boston, MA PARTICIPANTS: Laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and influenza inpatients MEASUREMENTS: Patient demographics and medical history, mortality, incidence and duration of mechanical ventilation, incidences of vasopressor support and renal replacement therapy, and hospital and intensive care admissions. RESULTS: Data was abstracted from medical records of 1052 influenza patients and 582 COVID-19 patients. An average of 210 hospital admissions for influenza occurred per 8-month season compared to 582 COVID-19 admissions over 2 months. The median weekly number of COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation was 17 (IQR: 4, 34) compared to a weekly median of 1 (IQR: 0, 2) influenza patient (p=0.001). COVID-19 patients were significantly more likely to require mechanical ventilation (31% vs 8%) and had significantly higher mortality (20% vs. 3%; p<0.001 for all). Relatively more COVID-19 patients on mechanical ventilation lacked pre-existing conditions compared with mechanically ventilated influenza patients (25% vs 4%, p<0.001). Pneumonia/ARDS secondary to the virus was the predominant cause of mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients (94%) as opposed to influenza (56%).

The preferred method for COVID-19 detection is the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based technique; however, it also has certain limitations, such as sample-dependent procedures with a relatively high false negative ratio. We propose a safe and efficient method for screening COVID-19 based on Raman spectroscopy. A total of 177 serum samples are collected from 63 confirmed COVID-19 patients, 59 suspected cases, and 55 healthy individuals as a control group. Raman spectroscopy is adopted to analyze these samples, and a machine learning support-vector machine (SVM) method is applied to the spectrum dataset to build a diagnostic algorithm. Furthermore, 20 independent individuals, including 5 asymptomatic COVID-19 patients and 5 symptomatic COVID-19 patients, 5 suspected patients, and 5 healthy patients, were sampled for external validation. In these three groups-confirmed COVID-19, suspected, and healthy individuals-the distribution of statistically significant points of difference showed highly consistency for intergroups after repeated sampling processes. The classification accuracy between the COVID-19 cases and the suspected cases is 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85-0.88), and the accuracy between the COVID-19 and the healthy controls is 0.90 (95% CI: 0.89-0.91), while the accuracy between the suspected cases and the healthy control group is 0.68 (95% CI: 0.67-0.73). For the independent test dataset, we apply the obtained SVM model to the classification of the independent test dataset to have all the results correctly classified. Our model showed that the serum-level classification results were all correct for independent test dataset.

Under the Hong Kong Jockey Club SMART Family-Link Project, we developed an innovative web-based training, learning, and sharing platform (i-TLS) to support not only ICT and other learning needs of Hong Kong social workers but also their practice. OBJECTIVE: We developed i-TLS with 3 major components (i-Training, i-Learning, and i-Sharing) and assessed its acceptability and impact on facilitating ICT use in family services. METHODS: We described the i-TLS development based on a 4-phase model and evaluated i-TLS using the platform database, Google Analytics, a self-administered survey, and individual phone interviews 1 year after launching. RESULTS: i-TLS was launched in 12 nongovernmental organizations on July 1, 2019. The COVID-19 outbreak in December 2019 limited face-to-face services, which galvanized digital transformation in social work practice. By July 31, 2020, 313 social workers had registered with i-TLS. Approximately 79.6% (249/313) of users accessed i-TLS at least once in the past 28 days, averaging 3.2 (SD 1.35) platform visits per day and viewing 4.8 (SD 1.42) pages per visit. i-Training provided 41 mini-modules on applying ICT to family services, with 730 enrollments. Approximately 70% (511/730) of users completed the mini-modules and obtained digital mini-certificates. i-Learning provided 112 items of learning resources centered on ICT use in family services, with nearly 4000 page views. i-Sharing had 25 discussion threads with 59 posts. Approximately 53.7% (168/313) of users completed the 1-year evaluation survey, including 7.1% (12/168) who were phone interviewed. The mean i-TLS satisfaction score (out of 10) increased from light (4.99, SD 1.54) to occasional (6.15, SD 1.34) and frequent (6.31, SD 2.29) users. Frequent users showed higher scores (out of 10) than light users for an increase in knowledge (5.84, SD 1.34 vs 4.09, SD 1.74; P<.001), self-efficacy (5.23, SD 1.92 vs 3.96, SD 1.77; P=.02), and knowledge application (6.46, SD 1.33 vs 1.91, SD 1.40; P<.001). Interviewees reported increased ICT use in services and considered i-TLS an acceptable and supportive tool for learning and practice, especially during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: i-TLS is acceptable to social workers and enhances their learning and use of ICT in family services. This was achieved through access to self-directed and collaborative learning and sharing of experiences within their practice. Further research on enhancing web-based platforms is needed to expand participation and capacity building among social workers and other health and social care professionals.","output":"Development and Evaluation of an Innovative Web-Based Training, Learning, and Sharing Platform for Social Workers (Hong Kong Jockey Club SMART Family-Link Project): Mixed Methods Evaluation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 'D614G' mutation (Aspartate-to-Glycine change at position 614) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has been speculated to adversely affect the efficacy of most vaccines and countermeasures that target this glycoprotein, necessitating frequent vaccine matching.

Severe cases of H1N1pdm infection are characterized by prolonged activation of the immune response, yet the specific role of inflammatory mediators in disease is poorly understood. The inflammatory cytokine IL-6 has been implicated in both seasonal and severe pandemic H1N1 influenza A (H1N1pdm) infection. Here, we investigated the role of IL-6 in severe H1N1pdm infection. We found IL-6 to be an important feature of the host response in both humans and mice infected with H1N1pdm. Elevated levels of IL-6 were associated with severe disease in patients hospitalized with H1N1pdm infection. Notably, serum IL-6 levels associated strongly with the requirement of critical care admission and were predictive of fatal outcome. In C57BL/6J, BALB/cJ, and B6129SF2/J mice, infection with A/Mexico/4108/2009 (H1N1pdm) consistently triggered severe disease and increased IL-6 levels in both lung and serum. Furthermore, in our lethal C57BL/6J mouse model of H1N1pdm infection, global gene expression analysis indicated a pronounced IL-6 associated inflammatory response. Subsequently, we examined disease and outcome in IL-6 deficient mice infected with H1N1pdm. No significant differences in survival, weight loss, viral load, or pathology were observed between IL-6 deficient and wild-type mice following infection. Taken together, our findings suggest IL-6 may be a potential disease severity biomarker, but may not be a suitable therapeutic target in cases of severe H1N1pdm infection due to our mouse data.","output":"Interleukin-6 Is a Potential Biomarker for Severe Pandemic H1N1 Influenza A Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We previously reported that the specific IgE levels to &#945;s1-casein (CN) and ?-CN in patients with cow's milk allergy decreased with similar dynamics during oral immunotherapy. Therefore, we hypothesized that &#945;s1- and ?-CN have strong cross-reactivity among CN components, despite the low similarity in the full-length amino acid sequences. METHODS: The &#945;s1-, ?-, and &#954;-CN were purified from commercial cow's milk. We recruited 39 patients with cow's milk allergy, and the serum IgE levels for each CN component were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Cross-reactivity between CN components was investigated by competitive ELISA against &#945;s1-CN. Sequence homology between CN components at the peptide level was calculated using in silico analysis and quantified by the property distance (PD) value. RESULTS: The &#945;s1-CN-specific IgE levels exhibited a strong positive correlation with the ?-CN-specific IgE (r = 0.945, P < .001). Complete competition was observed by ?-CN against &#945;s1-CN, suggesting the presence of common epitopes between them.

Much remains unknown about the mechanisms and targets of DPP4. Here we discuss new studies exploring DPP4-mediated cellular regulation, provide an updated list of potential targets of DPP4, and discuss clinical implications of each. RECENT FINDINGS Recent studies have sought enhanced efficacy of targeting DPP4's role in regulating hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells for improved clinical application. Further studies have identified DPP4 functions in different cellular compartments and have proposed ways to target this protein in malignancy. These findings, together with an expanded list of putative extracellular, cell surface, and intracellular DPP4 targets, provide insight into new DPP4-mediated cell regulation. SUMMARY DPP4 posttranslationally modifies proteins and peptides with essential roles in hematopoietic cell regulation, stem cell transplantation, and malignancy. Targets include secreted signaling factors and may include membrane proteins and transcription factors critical for different hematopoietic functions. Knowing these targets and functions can provide insight into new regulatory roles for DPP4 that may be targeted to enhance transplantation, treat disease, and better understand different regulatory pathways of hematopoiesis.","output":"An expanded role for dipeptidyl peptidase 4 in cell regulation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 outbreak is a sudden and devastating global pandemic in which the control of the spread is highly dependent on individual reactions, until the development of a vaccine and adequate treatments Considering that older adults are at high risk for COVID-related medical complications and mortality, the present study focuses on the age-related differences on the adoption of protective behaviors during the initial stages of this outbreak, while accounting for the role of sociodemographic, COVID-related, perceived risk, and psychosocial variables (i e , anxiety, optimism, fear of death, and social isolation) in this relation The study sample included 1696 participants, aged between 18 and 85 years old, who completed an online survey during the initial stages of the first COVID-19 outbreak in Portugal Overall, results reveal that the engagement in protective behaviors declines with advancing age and that older adults show a pattern toward lower perceived risk compared with middle-aged adults Multicategorical mediation analyses show that anxiety, optimism, fear of death, and social isolation significantly mediate age effects on protective behaviors Specifically, both anxiety and fear of death increase protective behaviors via higher perceived risk in the middle-aged and in the younger groups, respectively Optimism directly predicts protective behaviors in the middle-aged groups, while social isolation reduces protective behaviors in the younger and older-aged groups Results are discussed in terms of its implications for public health policies ?

This pilot study aimed at developing a lateral flow assay (LFA)-based test prototype to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus in saliva samples. METHODS: Mice were immunized using the recombinant receptor-binding domain (rRBD) of SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein. The combinations of the obtained mouse anti-receptor-binding domain (RBD) polyclonal antibodies (PAbs) and several commercial antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were used for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to select antibody pairs for LFA. The antibody pairs were tested in a LFA format using saliva samples from individuals with early SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 9). The diagnostic performance of the developed LFA was evaluated using saliva samples from hospitalized COVID-19 patients (n = 111); the median time from the onset of symptoms to sample collection was 10 days (0C24 days, interquartile range (IQR): 7C13). The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was used as a reference method. RESULTS: Based on ELISA and preliminary LFA results, a combination of mouse anti-RBD PAbs (capture antibody) and rabbit anti-spike PAbs (detection antibody) was chosen for clinical analysis of sample. When compared with rRT-PCR results, LFA exhibited 26.5% sensitivity, 58.1% specificity, 50.0% positive prediction value (PPV), 33.3% negative prediction value (NPV), and 38.7% diagnostic accuracy.

Qualitative or quantitative data were collected on process variables (context, recruitment, reach, dose delivered, dose received, satisfaction), barriers and facilitators to the process were explored in focus group interviews, and immediate outcomes (perceived knowledge, understanding office rules, satisfying information and support) were measured by questionnaire before and after the relocation. The evaluation showed that recruitment was unsatisfactory and reach insufficientand participation in activities was thus low for both offices. However, intended changes improved.

Mammalian gestation encounters an immunological paradox wherein the placenta balances the tolerance of an allogeneic fetus with protection against pathogens. Viruses cannot easily transmit from mother to fetus due to physical and immunological barriers at the maternal-fetal interface posing a restricted threat to the fetus and newborns. Despite this, the unknown strategies utilized by certain viruses could weaken the placental barrier to trigger severe maternal and fetal health issues especially through vertical transmission, which was not fully understood until now. In this review, we summarize diverse aspects of the major viral infections relevant to pregnancy, including the characteristics of pathogenesis, related maternal-fetal complications, and the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of vertical transmission. We highlight the fundamental signatures of complex placental defense mechanisms, which will prepare us to fight the next emerging and re-emerging infectious disease in the pregnancy population.","output":"Viral Infections During Pregnancy: The Big Challenge Threatening Maternal and Fetal Health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, a new outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 began to occur.

Both the public and the scientific community are currently discussing the extent to which school closings have worsened existing social differences, especially with regard to childrens academic and socio-emotional development. At the same time, parents have had to manage childcare and home schooling alongside their jobs and personal burdens posed by the pandemic. Parents possibilities for meeting these cognitive and emotional challenges might also depend on the different conditions in families. For this reason, the present paper investigates the structural and process characteristics of the family as well as childrens and parents psychological characteristics that predict how parents assess their ability to support their childs learning during homeschooling as well as parents perceived emotional stress caused by school closure. The study analyses data of the Newborn Cohort Study of the German National Educational Panel Study. The two dependent variables (self-assessment of abilities, perceived stress) were measured during the COVID-19 pandemic after the first school closure in Germany, at a time when the children of this cohort were attending second grade. Besides a number of control variables (including the childs struggle with home schooling), families structural characteristics [socioeconomic status (SES), education], process characteristics (home learning environment, HLE), parents psychological characteristics (preceding psychological stress), and the childs psychological characteristics (self-regulation, school-related independence) from earlier waves were included as predictors. The results of structural equation models show that perceived stress was associated with structural factors and the preceding psychological stress of parents. Parents with higher preceding stress reported higher perceived stress. Interestingly, higher-educated parents also reported more stress than lower educated parents during the pandemic. The effect was the other way around for SES C parents with lower SES reported more stress than parents with higher SES. The self-reported abilities to support the learning of the child seemed to be mainly predicted by the parents education as well as preceding psychological stress. To sum up, the results identify important aspects that determine how parents handle the challenges of the school closures. Especially, socially disadvantaged families carry their burden into the pandemic.","output":"Carrying the Burden Into the Pandemic C Effects of Social Disparities on Elementary Students Parents Perception of Supporting Abilities and Emotional Stress During the COVID-19 Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Progressive respiratory failure is seen as a major cause of death in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2)-induced infection Relatively little is known about the associated morphologic and molecular changes in the circulation of these patients In particular, platelet and erythrocyte pathology might result in severe vascular issues, and the manifestations may include thrombotic complications These thrombotic pathologies may be both extrapulmonary and intrapulmonary and may be central to respiratory failure Previously, we reported the presence of amyloid microclots in the circulation of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Here, we investigate the presence of related circulating biomarkers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), serum ferritin, and P-selectin These biomarkers are well-known to interact with, and cause pathology to, platelets and erythrocytes We also study the structure of platelets and erythrocytes using fluorescence microscopy (using the markers PAC-1 and CD62PE) and scanning electron microscopy Thromboelastography and viscometry were also used to study coagulation parameters and plasma viscosity We conclude that structural pathologies found in platelets and erythrocytes, together with spontaneously formed amyloid microclots, may be central to vascular changes observed during COVID-19 progression, including thrombotic microangiopathy, diffuse intravascular coagulation, and large-vessel thrombosis, as well as ground-glass opacities in the lungs Consequently, this clinical snapshot of COVID-19 strongly suggests that it is also a true vascular disease and considering it as such should form an essential part of a clinical treatment regime","output":"Erythrocyte, Platelet, Serum Ferritin, and P-Selectin Pathophysiology Implicated in Severe Hypercoagulation and Vascular Complications in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The Corona virus pandemic rendered most live education this spring term impossible.

Project outline: To ensure proficiency of current 5(th) semester students in future BST sessions, the introduction could not be cancelled albeit teaching with patients was. Knowing that the practical learning objectives of bedside teaching cannot be mirrored in online formats, a compensating module to teach the concept of BST and clinical reasoning had to be designed. Summary of work: To facilitate an understanding of the concept of bedside teaching with a focus on clinical reasoning we developed paper cases and a survey in Microsoft Forms following the history and examination path used in live BST with the addendum of clinical reasoning tables. For the first paper case, a personal feedback was provided for the clinical reasoning tables. A sample solution was provided later for self-feedback on the whole case. The first case was completed by 87, the second by 40 of 336 students. Response to individual feedback was positive. Students still missed hands-on training in history taking and examination with patients. Discussion: Paper cases cannot fully substitute BST. However, given the prime directive during the pandemic to protect our patients, this module engaged around one third of the cohort. The review of uploaded clinical reasoning tables gave proof to the sufficient students grasp of clinical reasoning.

Evidence-based interventions to address these risk factors exist, but often as a separate and overlapping package. The current study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a common elements-based intervention to improve mother-infant interaction at 12 months post-partum. METHOD AND ANALYSIS: A two-arm, single-blinded, individual randomised controlled trial is being carried out in the community settings of the rural subdistrict of Gujar Khan in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. 250 pregnant women in third trimester with distress (Self-Reporting Questionnaire, cut-off score >9) have been randomised on 1:1 allocation ratio into intervention (n=125) and treatment-as-usual arms (n=125). The participants in the intervention arm will receive 15 individual sessions of intervention on a monthly basis by non-specialist facilitators. The intervention involves components of early stimulation, learning through play, responsive feeding, guided discovery using pictures, behavioural activation and problem solving. The primary outcome is caregiver-infant interaction at 12 months postpartum. The secondary outcomes include maternal psychological well-being, quality of life, social support and empowerment. Infant secondary outcomes include growth, nutrition and development. The data will be collected at baseline, 6 and 12 months postpartum. A qualitative process evaluation will be conducted to inform the feasibility of intervention delivery. ETHICS: Ethics approval for the present study was obtained from the Human Development Research Foundation Institutional Review Board, Islamabad Pakistan.

However, there are increasing concerns about the severe economic and wider societal consequences of these measures. Some countries have begun to lift some of the rules on physical distancing in a stepwise manner, with differences in what these \\"exit strategies\\" entail and their timeframes. The aim of this work was to inform such exit strategies by exploring the types of indoor and outdoor settings where transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to occur and result in clusters of cases. Identifying potential settings that result in transmission clusters allows these to be kept under close surveillance and/or to remain closed as part of strategies that aim to avoid a resurgence in transmission following the lifting of lockdown measures. Methods: We performed a systematic review of available literature and media reports to find settings reported in peer reviewed articles and media with these characteristics. These sources are curated and made available in an editable online database. Results: We found many examples of SARS-CoV-2 clusters linked to a wide range of mostly indoor settings. Few reports came from schools, many from households, and an increasing number were reported in hospitals and elderly care settings across Europe. Conclusions: We identified possible places that are linked to clusters of COVID-19 cases and could be closely monitored and/or remain closed in the first instance following the progressive removal of lockdown restrictions.

Vaccine efficacy against infectiousness (VEINF), defined as the decrease in secondary transmissions from infected vaccine recipients versus from infected placebo recipients, is also not being measured. Using mathematical modeling of data from King County Washington, we demonstrate that if the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, which have observed VEDIS>90%, mediate VEDIS predominately by complete protection against infection, then prevention of a fourth epidemic wave in the spring of 2021, and associated reduction of subsequent cases and deaths by 60%, is likely to occur assuming rapid enough vaccine roll out. If high VEDIS is explained primarily by reduction in symptoms, then VEINF>50% will be necessary to prevent or limit the extent of this fourth epidemic wave. The potential added benefits of high VEINF would be evident regardless of vaccine allocation strategy and would be enhanced if vaccine roll out rate is low or if available vaccines demonstrate waning immunity. Finally, we demonstrate that a 1.0 log vaccine-mediated reduction in average peak viral load might be sufficient to achieve VEINF=60% and that human challenge studies with 104 infected participants, or clinical trials in a university student population could estimate VESUSC, VESYMP and VEINF using viral load metrics.","output":"Vaccines that prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission may prevent or dampen a spring wave of COVID-19 cases and deaths in 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1021/acsanm.8b00779.].","output":"Correction to Multisite Inhibitors for Enteric Coronavirus: Antiviral Cationic Carbon Dots Based on Curcumin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Many older adults spend the majority of their waking hours sitting, which increases their risk of chronic diseases. Given the challenges that many older adults face when engaging in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, understanding the health benefits of decreasing sitting time and increasing the number of sit-to-stand transitions is needed to address this growing public health concern. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this 3-arm randomized controlled trial is to investigate how changes in sitting time and brief sit-to-stand transitions impact biomarkers of healthy aging and physical, emotional, and cognitive functioning compared with a healthy attention control arm. METHODS: Sedentary and postmenopausal women (N=405) will be recruited and randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 study conditions for 3 months: healthy living attention control (Healthy Living), reduce sitting time (Reduce Sitting), and increase sit-to-stand transitions (Increase Transitions). Assessments conducted at baseline and 3 months included fasting blood draw, blood pressure, anthropometric measurements, physical functioning, cognitive testing, and 7 days of a thigh-worn accelerometer (activPAL) and a hip-worn accelerometer (ActiGraph). Blood-based biomarkers of healthy aging included those associated with glycemic control (glycated hemoglobin, fasting plasma insulin and glucose, and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance). RESULTS: Recruitment began in May 2018. The intervention is ongoing, with data collection expected to continue through the end of 2022. CONCLUSIONS: The Rise for Health study is designed to test whether 2 different approaches to interrupting sitting time can improve healthy aging in postmenopausal women. Results from this study may inform the development of sedentary behavior guidelines and interventions to reduce sitting time in older adults.

Baseline chest CT scan was performed in all patients. CT-based automated and semi-automated lung segmentation was performed using the Alma Medical workstation to calculate normal lung volume, lung opacities volume, total lung volume, and RLV. The primary end point of the study was mortality. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine independent predictors of mortality. RESULTS: Overall, 84 men (61%) and 54 women (39%) with a mean age of 47.3 years (14.3 y) were included in the study. Overall mortality rate was 21% (29 patients) at a median time of 7 days (interquartile range, 4 to 11 d). Univariate analysis demonstrated that age, hypertension, and diabetes were associated with death (P<0.01). Similarly, patients who died had lower normal lung volume and RLV than patients who survived (P<0.01). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that low RLV was the only independent predictor of death (odds ratio, 1.042; 95% confidence interval, 10.2-10.65). Furthermore, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that a RLV &#8804;64% significantly increased the risk of death (odds ratio, 4.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.9-11.7).

In many cases, the structural stress was a result of incorrect allocation of medical care resources. In turn, this misallocation resulted from fear and apprehensions that superseded thorough calculations. A key role in exacerbating the healthcare sector overburdening was played by misleading information on the virus and disease caused by it. In the current paper, we study the situation in Russian healthcare system and advance recommendations how to avoid further crises.

In this study, we aimed to analyze the clinical spectrum, treatment options and outcomes of children with MIS-C who were admitted to our pediatric intensive care (PICU). Materials and Methods Clinical and laboratory findings and treatment of the patients admitted to the PICU with MIS-C between April 2020 and January 2021 were recorded, and their outcomes were evaluated. Results Nineteen patients with a median age of 12.5 years (interquartile range (IQR): 5.8-14.0 years) were admitted. Eleven (57.8%) were males. The most frequent clinical and laboratory features were fever (100%), abdominal pain (94.7%), rash (63.1%), headache (68.4%), diarrhea (47.3%), seizure (10.5%), cardiac dysfunction (52.6%), acute kidney injury (26.3%), lymphopenia (84.2%), and thrombocytopenia (36.8%). However, 8 patients needed mechanical respiratory support, 11 patients needed inotropes, 2 patients needed plasma exchange, and 1 patient needed continuous renal replacement therapy. All patients received corticosteroids, 17 patients (89.2%) received intravenous immunoglobulin, 2 patients received anakinra, 10 patients received acetylsalicylic acid, and 6 patients received enoxaparin. Median PICU length of stay was 3 days (IQR: 2-5) and only one patient died.

Yet, for most clinically approved vaccines, binding antibody titers only serve as a surrogate of protection. Instead, the ability of vaccine induced antibodies to neutralize or mediate Fc-effector functions is mechanistically linked to protection. While evidence has begun to point to persisting antibody responses among SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, cases of re-infection have begun to emerge, calling the protective nature of humoral immunity against this highly infectious pathogen into question. Using a community-based surveillance study, we aimed to define the relationship between titers and functional antibody activity to SARS-CoV-2 over time. Here we report significant heterogeneity, but limited decay, across antibody titers amongst 120 identified seroconverters, most of whom had asymptomatic infection. Notably, neutralization, Fc-function, and SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses were only observed in subjects that elicited RBD-specific antibody titers above a threshold. The findings point to a switch-like relationship between observed antibody titer and function, where a distinct threshold of activity-defined by the level of antibodies-is required to elicit vigorous humoral and cellular response. This response activity level may be essential for durable protection, potentially explaining why re-infections occur with SARS-CoV-2 and other common coronaviruses.","output":"Discrete SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers track with functional humoral stability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic (COVID-19), which emerged in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, is still continuing to ravage every country in the world.

For the year 2020, periods without restrictions on freedom of movement and social contact were compared with periods of moderate and severe COVID-19 restrictions. To avoid distortions due to seasonal fluctuations and linear time trends, suicide risk during the COVID-19 pandemic was compared with data from 2010 to 2019 using an interrupted time series analysis.

Houston, located in the Harris County of Texas, is becoming the next hotspot of this pandemic. With a severe decline in international and inter-state travel, a model at the county level is needed as opposed to the state or country level. Existing approaches have a few drawbacks. Firstly, the data used is the number of COVID-19 positive cases instead of positivity. The former is a function of the number of tests carried out while the number of tests normalizes the latter. Positivity gives a better picture of the spread of this pandemic as, with time, more tests are being administered. Positivity under 5% has been desired for the reopening of businesses to almost 100% capacity. Secondly, the data used by models like SEIRD (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered, and Deceased) lacks information about the sentiment of people concerning coronavirus. Thirdly, models that make use of social media posts might have too much noise and misinformation. On the other hand, news sentiment can capture long-term effects of hidden variables like public policy, opinions of local doctors, and disobedience of state-wide mandates. The present study introduces a new artificial intelligence (i.e., AI) model, viz., Sentiment Informed Time-series Analyzing AI (SITALA), trained on COVID-19 test positivity data and news sentiment from over 2750 news articles for Harris county.

IAV DIPs are usually characterized by a large internal deletion in one viral RNA segment. Consequentially, DIPs can only propagate in presence of infectious standard viruses (STVs), compensating the missing gene function. Here, they interfere with and suppress the STV replication and might act universally against many IAV subtypes. We recently reported a production system for purely clonal DIPs utilizing genetically modified cells. In the present study, we established an automated perfusion process for production of a DIP, called DI244, using an alternating tangential flow filtration (ATF) system for cell retention. Viable cell concentrations and DIP titers more than 10-times higher than for a previously reported batch cultivation were observed. Further, we investigated a novel tubular cell retention device for its potential for continuous virus harvesting into the permeate. Very comparable performances to typically used hollow fiber membranes were found during the cell growth phase. During the virus replication phase the tubular membrane, in contrast to the hollow fiber membrane, allowed 100% of the produced virus particles to pass through. To our knowledge, this is the first time a continuous virus harvest was shown for a membrane-based perfusion process. Overall, the process established offers interesting possibilities for advanced process integration strategies for next-generation virus particle and virus vector manufacturing.

In addition, cross-virus neutralization assays were conducted with the main IBV serotypes present in Europe. The four Spanish field strains and the Italy 02 S1 sequence from the NCBI database were established as a new genotype that showed maximum amino acid identities with the 4/91 serotype (81.7% to 83.7%), the D274 group that included D207, D274 and D3896 strains (79.8% to 81.7%), and the B1648 serotype (79.3% to 80%). Furthermore, on the basis of these results, it was demonstrated that the Italy 02 genotype had been circulating in Spain since as early as 1997. Based on the average ratio of synonymous:non-synonymous (dS/dN) amino acid substitutions within Italy 02 sequences, no positive selection pressures were related with changes observed in the S1 gene. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene suggested that the Italy 02 genotype has undergone a recombination event. Virus neutralization assays demonstrated that little antigenic relatedness (less than 35%) exists between Italy 02 and some of the reference IBV serotypes, and indicated that Italy 02 is likely to be a new serotype.","output":"Antigenic and molecular characterization of isolates of the Italy 02 infectious bronchitis virus genotype."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic represents an unprecedented traumatic stressor to mental health. Psychological distress is considered a reliable proxy for psychopathology and can be negatively influenced by childhood trauma through sensitization effects. Emotion dysregulation has been proposed as a potential mediator of this mechanism. We aimed to test this hypothesis in a national Italian sample assessed in the early phase of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. METHODS We investigated the relationship between psychological distress and childhood trauma in 500 healthy participants assessed through a survey-based study, after the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic lockdown in Italy. Levels of psychological distress and history of childhood trauma were obtained using the Kessler-10 (K10) and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, respectively. We used bootstrapped mediation analysis to test the mediator role of emotional dysregulation, measured through the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, on the effect of childhood trauma on psychological distress. RESULTS In total, 190 (38%) reported psychological distress related to the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. Individuals with psychological distress experienced more childhood trauma, specifically emotional abuse (F = 23.51, df = 1, p < 0.001) and neglect (F = 10.98, df = 1, p = 0.001). After modelling the effect of emotional dysregulation, the impact of childhood trauma on coronavirus disease 2019-related psychological distress resulted in indirect effects and mediated by deficits in emotion regulation mechanisms (bootstrapped lower level of confidence interval = 0.345, upper level of confidence interval = 0.598). CONCLUSION Childhood trauma is associated with increased vulnerability to the stressful effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. Our data suggest that emotional dysregulation may represent a dimension mediating the impact of childhood trauma on coronavirus disease 2019-related psychological distress and may be considered as specific target for interventions aiming at empowering resilience.","output":"Emotional dysregulation mediates the impact of childhood trauma on psychological distress: First Italian data during the early phase of COVID-19 outbreak."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Although most patients recover within several weeks after acute COVID\\\\19, some of them develop long\\\\lasting clinical symptoms. Renal transplant recipients have an increased mortality risk from COVID\\\\19. We aimed to describe complications occurring after COVID\\\\19 in this group of patients. METHODS: A prospective single\\\\center cohort study was conducted at University Hospital Centre Zagreb. Patients with two negative reverse transcriptase\\\\polymerase chain reaction (RT\\\\PCR) tests for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 after COVID\\\\19 were eligible for further follow\\\\up at our outpatient clinic. They underwent detailed clinical and laboratory assessments. The primary outcome was the development of complications after COVID\\\\19. RESULTS: Only 11.53% of renal transplant recipients who survived acute COVID\\\\19 were symptomless and free from new\\\\onset laboratory abnormalities during the median follow\\\\up of 64 days (range: 50C76 days). Three patients died from sepsis after discharge from the hospital. In 47 patients (45.2%), clinical complications were present, while 74 patients (71.2%) had one or more laboratory abnormalities. The most common clinical complications included shortness of breath (19.2%), tiredness (11.5%), peripheral neuropathy (7.7%), self\\\\reported cognitive impairments (5.7%), and dry cough (7.7%). Most common laboratory abnormalities included shortened activated partial thromboplastin time (50%), elevated D\\\\dimers (36.5%), elevated fibrinogen (30.16%), and hypogammaglobulinemia (24%). Positive RT\\\\PCR for cytomegalovirus (8.7%), EpsteinCBarr virus (26%), or BK virus (16.3%). Multivariate analysis identified the history of diabetes mellitus and eGFR CKD\\\\EPI as predictors for the development of post\\\\COVID clinical complications. Six months after acute COVID\\\\19, elevated D\\\\dimers persisted with normalization of other laboratory parameters. Twenty\\\\nine patients were hospitalized, mostly with several concomitant problems. However, initially reported clinical problems gradually improved in the majority of patients. CONCLUSION: Post\\\\COVID\\\\19 clinical and laboratory complications are frequent in the renal transplant population, in some of them associated with significant morbidity.

Objective: This study aims to investigate and analyze the public's attention to COVID-19-related events in China at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in China (December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020) through the Sina Microblog hot search list. Methods: We collected topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic on the Sina Microblog hot search list from December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020 and described the trend of public attention on COVID-19 epidemic-related topics. ROST CM6.0 (ROST Content Mining System Version 6.0) was used to analyze the collected text for word segmentation, word frequency, and sentiment analysis. We further described the hot topic keywords and sentiment trends of public attention. We used VOSviewer to implement a visual cluster analysis of hot keywords and build a social network of public opinion content. Results: The study has four main findings. First, we analyzed the changing trend of the public's attention to the COVID-19 epidemic, which can be divided into three stages. Second, the hot topic keywords of public attention at each stage are slightly different. In addition, the emotional tendency of the public toward the COVID-19 epidemic-related hot topics has changed from negative to neutral, with negative emotions weakening and positive emotions increasing as a whole. Finally, we divided the COVID-19 topics with the most public concern into five categories: (1) new COVID-19 epidemics and their impact; (2) frontline reporting of the epidemic and prevention and control measures; (3) expert interpretation and discussion on the source of infection; (4) medical services on the frontline of the epidemic; and (5) focus on the global epidemic and the search for suspected cases. Conclusions: This is the first study of public attention on the COVID-19 epidemic using a Chinese social media platform (i.e., Sina Microblog). Our study found that social media (e.g., Sina Microblog) can be used to measure public attention to public health emergencies. During the epidemic of the novel coronavirus, a large amount of information about the COVID-19 epidemic was disseminated on Sina Microblog and received widespread public attention. We have learned about the hotspots of public concern regarding the COVID-19 epidemic.

Design: Prospective longitudinal observation. Methods: Twenty adults (median 71 years) with an established diagnosis of glaucoma were issued a tablet-perimeter (Eyecatcher), and were asked to perform one VF home-assessment per eye, per month, for 6 months (12 tests total). Before and after home-monitoring, two VF assessments were performed in-clinic using Standard Automated Perimetry (SAP; 4 tests total, per eye). Results: All 20 participants could perform monthly home-monitoring, though one participant stopped after 4 months (Adherence: 98%). There was good concordance between VFs measured at home and in the clinic (r = 0.94, P < 0.001). In 21 of 236 tests (9%) Mean Deviation deviated by more than {+/-}3 dB from the median. Many of these anomalous tests could be identified by applying machine learning techniques to recordings from the tablets' front-facing camera (Area Under the ROC Curve = 0.78). Adding home-monitoring data to 2 SAP tests made 6 months apart reduced measurement error (between-test measurement variability) in 97% of eyes, with mean absolute error more than halving in 90% of eyes. Median test duration was 4.5 mins (Quartiles: 3.9 - 5.2 mins). Substantial variations in ambient illumination had no observable effect on VF measurements (r = 0.07, P = 0.320).

Cats that are infected with FeLV may develop a progressive infection resulting in persistent viremia, immunodeficiency, tumors, anemia and death. A significant number of cats mount a protective immune response that suppresses viremia; these cats develop a regressive infection characterized by the absence of viral replication and the presence of low levels of proviral DNA. The biological importance of these latter provirus carriers is largely unknown. RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate that ten cats that received a transfusion of blood from aviremic provirus carriers developed active FeLV infections, some with a progressive outcome and the development of fatal FeLV-associated disease. The infection outcome, disease spectrum and evolution into FeLV-C in one cat mirrored those of natural infection. Two cats developed persistent antigenemia; six cats were transiently antigenemic. Reactivation of infection occurred in some cats. One recipient developed non-regenerative anemia associated with FeLV-C, and four others developed a T-cell lymphoma, one with secondary lymphoblastic leukemia. Five of the ten recipient cats received provirus-positive aviremic blood, whereas the other five received provirus- and viral RNA-positive but aviremic blood. Notably, the cats that received blood containing only proviral DNA exhibited a later onset but graver outcome of FeLV infection than the cats that were transfused with blood containing proviral DNA and viral RNA. Leukocyte counts and cytokine analyses indicated that the immune system of the latter cats reacted quicker and more efficiently. CONCLUSIONS: Our results underline the biological and epidemiological relevance of FeLV provirus carriers and the risk of inadvertent FeLV transmission via blood transfusion and demonstrate the replication capacity of proviral DNA if uncontrolled by the immune system. Our results have implications not only for veterinary medicine, such as the requirement for testing blood donors and blood products for FeLV provirus by sensitive polymerase chain reaction, but are also of general interest by revealing the importance of latent retroviral DNA in infected hosts. When aiming to eliminate a retroviral infection from a population, provirus carriers must be considered.

Therefore, there is an urgent need for devising more efficient preventive measures, to limit the spread of the infection until an effective treatment or vaccine is available. The preventive measures depend mainly on the understanding of the transmission routes of this virus, its environmental stability, and its persistence on common touch surfaces. Due to the very limited knowledge about SARS-CoV-2, we can speculate its stability in the light of previous studies conducted on other human and animal coronaviruses. In this review, we present the available data on the stability of coronaviruses (CoVs), including SARS-CoV-2, from previous reports to help understand its environmental survival. According to available data, possible airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been suggested. SARS-CoV-2 and other human and animal CoVs have remarkably short persistence on copper, latex and surfaces with low porosity as compared to other surfaces like stainless steel, plastics, glass and highly porous fabrics. It has also been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with diarrhoea and that it is shed in the faeces of COVID-19 patients. Some CoVs show persistence in human excrement, sewage and waters for a few days. These findings suggest a possible risk of faecal-oral, foodborne and waterborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in developing countries that often use sewage-polluted waters in irrigation and have poor water treatment systems. CoVs survive longer in the environment at lower temperatures and lower relative humidity. It has been suggested that large numbers of COVID-19 cases are associated with cold and dry climates in temperate regions of the world and that seasonality of the virus spread is suspected.","output":"Stability of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses in the environment and on common touch surfaces and the influence of climatic conditions: A review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The EU emissions trading systems (ETS) invalidation rule implies that shocks and overlapping policies can change cumulative carbon emissions.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study of health services utilization from health facilities at all levels in all provinces of mainland China. We analyzed monthly all-cause health facility visits and inpatient volume in health facilities before and during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak using nationwide routine health information system data from January 2016 to June 2020. We used interrupted time series analyses and segmented negative binomial regression to examine changes in healthcare utilization attributable to the pandemic. Stratified analyses by facility type and by provincial Human Development Index (HDI) C an area-level measure of socioeconomic status C were conducted to assess potential heterogeneity in effects. FINDINGS: In the months before the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, a positive secular trend in patterns of healthcare utilization was observed. After the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, we noted statistically significant decreases in all indicators, with all indicators achieving their nadir in February 2020. The magnitude of decline in February ranged from 63% (95% CI 61C65%; p<0?0001) in all-cause visits at hospitals in regions with high HDI and 71% (95% CI 70C72%; p<0?0001) in all-cause visits at primary care clinics to 33% (95% CI 24C42%; p<0?0001) in inpatient volume and 10% (95% CI 3C17%; p = 0?0076) in all-cause visits at township health centers (THC) in regions with low HDI. The reduction in health facility visits was greater than that in the number of outpatients discharged (51% versus 48%; p<0?0079). The reductions in both health facility visits and inpatient volume were greater in hospitals than in primary health care facilities (p<0?0001) and greater in developed regions than in underdeveloped regions (p<0?0001). Following the nadir of health services utilization in February 2020, all indicators showed statistically significant increases. However, even by June 2020, nearly all indicators except outpatient and inpatient volume in regions with low HDI and inpatient volume in private hospitals had not achieved their pre-SARS-COV-2 forecasted levels. In total, we estimated cumulative losses of 1020.5 (95% CI 951.2- 1089.4; P<0.0001) million or 23.9% (95% CI 22.5C25.2%; P<0.0001) health facility visits, and 28.9 (95% CI 26.1C31.6; P<0.0001) million or 21.6% (95% CI 19.7C23.4%; P<0.0001) inpatients as of June 2020. INTERPRETATION: Inpatient and outpatient health services utilization in China declined significantly after the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, likely due to changes in patient and provider behaviors, suspension of health facilities or their non-emergency services, massive mobility restrictions, and the potential reduction in the risk of non-SARS-COV-2 diseases.

We collected data on the number of clients getting different essential health care services from May to October 2019 (Pre COVID) and the same period in 2020 (during a COVID-19 pandemic) from the patient registry book. The analysis was done with SPSS version 24 software. RESULT: Overall, the essential services of SPHMMC were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The most affected service is inpatient admission, which showed a 73.3% (2044 to 682) reduction from the pre-COVID period and the least affected is maternal service, which only decreased by 13% (3671 to 3177). During the 6 months after the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a progressive increment in the number of clients getting essential health services. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION: The establishment of a triple setup for fighting against COVID-19, which encompasses non-COVID services, an isolation center and a COVID-19 treatment center, played a vital role in preserving essential health services.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 and mitigation plans on essential health services: institutional experience of a hospital in Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemics, balneotherapic establishments were closed in Italy like in the rest of Europe.

The aim of this study is to explore the expression of m6A-related regulators in lung adenocarcinoma, identify the effect of altered key factors modified by m6A on the prognosis of patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Methods: A comprehensive analysis of m6A-related gene expressions in patients with lung adenocarcinoma based on The Cancer Genome Atlas database (TCGA) and the CBioPortal database. A prognostic risk score was established based on a linear combination of 4 key gene expression levels using the regression coefficients of the multivariate Cox regression models. Immunohistochemical staining analysis was performed to validate the relationship between the protein expression level of m6A regulators and the prognosis of patients retrospectively. The possible mechanism and prospective therapeutic targets of these key m6A molecules were explored by the M6A2Target database and the CMAP database. Results: Mutation pattern analysis revealed that 32% of 656 patients had genetic alterations. Four genes (writer: methyltransferase like 3 [METTL3] and three readers: insulin like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 2 [IGF2BP2], heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C [HNRNPC], and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 [HNRNPA2B1]) were selected to construct a survival risk prediction model and the results of immunohistochemical staining showed that the expression of these four m6A genes was significantly different between lung adenocarcinoma tissues and normal lung tissues (p < .01). The possible downstream genes and prospective therapeutic targets of these four m6A key molecules were discovered.

A hemodynamically significant thrombus burden in such patients can result in visceral malperfusion and bilateral lower extremity ischemia, both of which, historically, have a high mortality rate. Open thrombectomy via a thoracoabdominal approach is associated with high mortality. Other endovascular alternatives, including Fogerty embolectomy and mechanical thrombectomy, are associated with visceral embolization. The Penumbra CAT-12 lightning device (Penumbra Inc, Alameda, Calif) most commonly used to treat ileofemoral deep vein thrombosis is a 12F suction catheter with the ability to remove large amounts of clot burden with minimal blood loss owing to its sensor mechanism. The ability to suction thrombectomy-focused areas in the aorta reduces the likelihood of embolization. We have presented the cases of two patients with acute symptomatic paravisceral aortic thrombus who were treated with this device and their outcomes. Methods: Two patients had presented to the emergency room with acute onset abdominal pain and bilateral lower extremity rest pain and numbness. Patient 1 was a 46-year-old woman with antithrombin III and protein C deficiency (Fig 1). Patient 2 was a 78-year-old woman with recent coronavirus disease 2019 infection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and congestive heart failure (Fig 2). Computed tomography angiography of patients demonstrated aortic thrombus in the paravisceral aorta extending from the supraceliac to the infrarenal aorta. Both patients underwent percutaneous suction thrombectomy of the aorta using the Penumbra CAT-12 lightning device. Patient 2 also underwent bilateral femoral cutdown, thrombectomy, and kissing iliac stents, followed by diagnostic laparoscopy without any further intervention. Results: The intraoperative angiographic images demonstrated the initial aortic thrombus in the paravisceral aorta with resolution of thrombus after suction thrombectomy (Figs 1 and 2). The abdominal pain and bilateral lower extremity rest pain had resolved in both patients postoperatively and did not require any further surgical intervention. Patient 1 was discharged home on postoperative day 3. Patient 2 was discharged to a rehabilitation facility on postoperative day 10. Conclusions: Percutaneous suction thrombectomy devices such as the Penumbra CAT-12 lightning device is effective in removing a large paravisceral aortic clot burden without any embolization to the visceral vessels. This is a newly available alternative to consider for such patients with symptomatic paravisceral aortic thrombus considered to have a high mortality risk with open intervention.

Meanwhile in Asia, where the disease began, the spread continues, in China it seems for now to have passed its peak. Italy, Spain, France, UK, and the US have been the countries more affected in terms of deaths. The coronavirus is more dangerous to the elderly and those with certain pre-existing medical conditions which is precisely the profile of lung cancer patients. Essential cancer services should be delivered but all steps should be taken to protect patients and the health workforce from infection with COVID-19. This presents a major challenge to radiotherapy (RT) departments worldwide. An international panel with expertise in the management of lung cancer in high-volume comprehensive centres has come together to share its experience on COVID-19 preparedness to deliver optimal care in such exceptional circumstances. A comprehensive systematic review of the literature through a PubMed search was undertaken. Twelve recommendations including, among others, the consideration of shorter courses, delays, and the omission of RT for lung cancer are proposed by the panel. In summary, we recommend the screening of every single person accessing the treatment room, the consideration of hypofractionation and to delay postoperative RT for non-small cell lung cancer, to avoid twice-daily treatments and delay or deliver prophylactic cranial irradiation during radio(chemo)therapy for limited-stage small cell lung cancer, review image guided RT images for suspicious image findings, and the use of single-fraction RT for the palliative treatment of stage IV lung cancer patients. Given that lung cancer is one of the most common and severe pathologies in radiation oncology departments, the following recommendations require particularly urgent consideration. The decision-making paths strongly depend on locally available resources, and a tailored approach should be used to attend lung cancer patients during this pandemic.","output":"Optimizing lung cancer radiation treatment worldwide in COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This survey study examines the use of and satisfaction with telehealth services by adults in rural Virginia during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Factors Associated With Use of and Satisfaction With Telehealth by Adults in Rural Virginia During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the increased reliance on technology, computer programming has emerged as an essential skill that is interesting to many audiences beyond merely computer scientists. As a result, many students from various disciplines take first-year computer science courses. This led to classrooms with a lot of diversity in student motivation, backgrounds, learning needs, and educational levels. Teaching the same material to such a diverse group is challenging. The aim of this paper is two-fold. Firstly, we present a flipped-based approach that benefits from the mixed-ability nature of first-year programming courses rather than considering it as a burden. Secondly, we present a study that evaluates the extent to which the proposed approach enhances student learning in such a mixed-ability environment. The study was conducted in a first-year course at the University of British Columbia C Okanagan, and it was based on three components:1) a survey of 25 Likert items(n = 46), 2) class average grade and pass rate over 6 years (n = 42 + 38 + 56 + 79 + 90 + 74), and 3) student ratings of the course over 5 years (n = 42 + 38 + 56 + 79 + 90).

We built this model based on a 2-by-2 matrix that plots the risk of STI/HIV transmission and risk of STI/HIV exposure. The intercept of these two measures classifies a person as low, medium, or high risk. After automating this logic, 16 expert clinicians in STI/HIV care tested this system with over 400 test patient cases and refined the algorithm until it yielded the exact outcomes that these clinicians would offer patients based on guidelines. Findings of interest are that the scale of the y-axis is exponential, in that risk factors for exposure do not climb cumulatively but do so according to a quadratic equation.

One area of agreement among these reports is that front line health care workers, especially those who come into regular contact with Covid-19 patients, ought to be afforded highest priority. But this convergence, though significant, raises questions concerning the ethics of vaccine distribution among those highest-priority health care workers: If a hospital has inadequate supply to vaccinate its entire workforce, which of its essential workers should it prioritize? In this paper, we begin with a general overview of ethical questions of vaccine administration before narrowing our focus to some of the most pressing theoretical and practical issues hospital officials must face in building justifiable and actionable frameworks for vaccinating their workers.

We report for the first time a case of AFOP complicated with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) caused by chronic active Epstein-Barr virus (CAEBV) infection. CASE PRESENTATION: A 64-year-old man was admitted with a complaint of fever and dyspnea for 2 weeks. The patient presented with elevated serum aminotransferase levels, splenomegaly, progressive decrease of red blood cells and platelets, hyperferritinemia, hypofibrinogenemia, and elevated of Soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sCD25). His chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed multiple patchy consolidation in both lungs and multiple lymphadenopathy in the mediastinum and hilum. The serology for antibodies of VCA-IgG was positive, EBV-DNA in peripheral blood was elevated, and EBV nucleic acid was detected in the alveolar lavage fluid. Histopathology of the lung tissue showed a dominant of intra-alveolar fibrin and organizing pneumonia. Hemophagocytic cells was found in the bone marrow smear and biopsy. EBV-DNA was detected in lung tissue and bone marrow using in situ hybridization with an EBV-encoded RNA (EBER) probe. After 50 days of hospitalization, he was improved in lung and hemogram.

Results: The study found that there was no statistically significant difference between the test and control groups in the number of present rhythm disorders and actions taken to treat patients with either observation or administration of a new drug. However, in the test group, there were significantly fewer patients being referred to a cardiologist than in the control group (p < 0.001). Discussion: The use of an ECG sensor helps family physicians to distinguish between patients who need to be referred to a cardiologist and those who can be treated by them. This method is useful for both physicians and patients because it shortens the time taken to start treatment, can be used during pandemics such as COVID-19, and reduces unnecessary cost.","output":"Implementation of a Savvy Mobile ECG Sensor for Heart Rhythm Disorder Screening at the Primary Healthcare Level: An Observational Prospective Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: to analyze how the social isolation measures and closed borders affected the health and economy in an international border region.

When sick people are detected, home quarantine is usually recommended because of the lack of available hospital rooms for first-stage symptoms that do not require constant medical monitoring. In this situation, one can thus wonder about the transmission of the disease to other household members. In this paper, we numerically investigate the transport of the aerosol generated by an infected person quarantined to his bedroom to the other rooms in a typical French detached house by performing TRNSYS-CONTAM simulations. The intent here is to assess the exposure concentration to the virus of the other household members when simple strategies are employed to reduce the risk of airborne transmission. Due to the uncertainty regarding the evaluation of different parameters such as the emission of contaminated droplets and the infectivity of the occupants, critical cases have been considered in this study. The main results show that, even if remediation actions lower the exposure of other occupants, the risk of contamination remains high even if the contagious person is quarantined to its bedroom.","output":"Home quarantine: A numerical evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 spread in a single-family house."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: COVID-19 has caused a worldwide illness and New York has become the epicenter of COVID-19 in the United States.

Design: Retrospective case study of positive COVID inpatients between 3/20/2020-3/31/2020. Setting: Montefiore Health System main hospital, Moses, a large tertiary care center in the Bronx. Participants: Adult inpatients with positive COVID tests hospitalized at MHS. Exposure (for observational studies): Datasets of participants were queried for physiological, demographic (age, sex, socioeconomic status and self-reported race and/or ethnicity) and laboratory data. Main Outcome and Measures: Relationship and predictive value of measured parameters to mortality and illness severity. Results: Of the 217 in this case review, 70 died during hospitalization while 147 were discharged home. Only the admission PT and first D-Dimer could very significantly differentiate those who were discharged alive and those who died. Logistic regression analysis shows increased odds ratio for mortality by first D-Dimer within 48 hrs. of admission. The optimal cut-point for the initial D-Dimer to predict mortality was found to be 1.65 mcg/mL. Conclusions: We describe here a comprehensive assessment of hematologic and coagulation parameters in COVID and examine the relationship of these to mortality. We demonstrate that both initial and maximum D-Dimer values are biomarkers that can be used for survival assessments.","output":"Correlation of coagulation parameters with clinical outcomes in Coronavirus-19 affected minorities in United States: Observational cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rsum: Cet article prsente une rponse de la formation des enseignants canadiens a la fermeture des coles de la maternelle a la douzieme anne en raison de la pandmie de la COVID-19 et le stage de formation des enseignants en ligne qui en a rsult et qui a ensuite t dvelopp, appel stage pandmique.

More than 15% of adolescents have a body mass index (BMI) higher than the 95th percentile. The use of surgical strategies in adolescent patients is still controversial due to the impact on the continuing maturing process. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) is considered a minimal invasive procedure that does not alter the physiological behavior of the bowel and has already shown promising results in short-term studies. METHODS Between 1998 and 2004, 50 adolescent patients above the 99.5th age- and gender-adjusted growing percentile were treated with LAGB. The surgical procedure was performed at three highly experienced centers for bariatric surgery. Mean age was 17.1  2.2 years (range = 9-19 years) at the time of surgery. Follow-up investigations were performed in the outpatient clinic of the treating hospitals. Psychological changes were analyzed using the BAROS questionnaire. RESULTS The mean BMI decreased from 45.2  7.6 kg/m(2) at the time of surgery to 38.3  6.2 kg/m(2) 1 year after surgery, 31.5  6.6 kg/m(2) after 3 years, and 27.3  5.3 kg/m(2) after 5 years. Mean excessive weight loss was 49.7  29.2, 76.8  27.5, and 92.6  24.5% at 1, 3, and 5 years after surgery. Quality of life showed a further significant improvement between 3 and 5 years after surgery (BAROS: 5.5  1.9 increased to 6.3  2.2, p = 0.01). All preoperative comorbidities resolved in patients with a functional band after 5 years of follow-up. CONCLUSION LAGB shows promising results in the long-term follow-up with continuous weight loss in patients with a functional band. Nevertheless, most of the weight loss is within the first 3 years after surgery. Thereafter, further weight reduction is about 10% over the following 2 years. Perioperative comorbidities resolve within the first 5 years after treatment.","output":"Long-term results after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding in adolescent patients: follow-up of the Austrian experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has now become a global pandemic due to its high transmissibility.

There is concern regarding disruption or dissemination of tissue during this process, which may be of particular significance in cases of undetected malignancy. Contained tissue extraction techniques have been developed in an effort to mitigate morcellation-related risks. OBJECTIVE The objective of the study was to quantify perioperative outcomes of contained tissue extraction using power morcellation, specifically evaluating parameters of tissue or fluid leakage from within the containment system. STUDY DESIGN This was a study including a multicenter prospective cohort of adult women who underwent minimally invasive hysterectomy or myomectomy using a contained power morcellation technique. Blue dye was applied to the tissue specimen prior to removal to help identify cases of fluid or tissue leakage from within the containment system. RESULTS A total of 76 patients successfully underwent the contained power morcellation protocol. Mean time for the contained morcellation procedure was 30.2 minutes (22.4). The mean hysterectomy specimen weight was 480.1 g (359.1), and mean myomectomy specimen weight was 239.1 g (229.7). The vast majority of patients (73.7%) were discharged home the same day of surgery. Final pathological diagnosis was benign in all cases. Spillage of dye or tissue was noted in 7 cases (9.2%), although containment bags were intact in each of these instances.

ABSTRACT: Canadas current non-legislated oversight system for animal-based science not only fails to adequately incentivize the replacement of sentient animals as best scientific practice in any meaningful way, but also fails to adequately protect those animals bred, harmed, and killed in the name of science. In this paper, we outline the various shortcomings of the Canadian Council on Animal Care, and we highlight the need for Canada to move towards national legislation akin to that seen in other jurisdictions like the U.K. We conclude that while legislation alone cannot ensure the replacement of sentient animals in science, it appears to be a precondition for significant progress in animal protection and for the development and adoption of non-animal methods.","output":"Protecting Canadas Lab Animals: The Need for Legislation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background The outbreak of a new coronavirus, first reported in Wuhan, China, is spreading around the world.

Methods In this retrospective study, we recruited 10 children infected with SARS-COV-2 from January 27 to March 10, 2020, in Changsha, China. We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and high-resolution CT findings for these children. Qualitative descriptive analysis was used to describe the key results. Results Ten children were included. Three were male and seven were female. Three were from Wuhan, Hubei Province, and seven were from Changsha. All had a history of close contact with adults with COVID-19 before the onset of disease. Clinical manifestations included fever in four cases, respiratory symptoms in three cases, febrile convulsions in one case, vomiting in one case, abdominal pain in one case, and asymptomatic infection in two cases. All the children tested positive for nucleic acid in throat swabs at admission. Stool swabs of three cases were positive for nucleic acid after several days of fever. In nine children, blood routine results were normal, whereas in one case the white blood cell count was elevated. In four cases, CT findings of the lungs showed light ground-glass opacities, one case showed changes similar to bronchopneumonia, and the remaining cases were normal. All were treated with symptomatic support without complications. Conclusion Our findings indicate that intrafamily transmission may be the main form of transmission of COVID-19 in children, and persistent intestinal excretion of virus is another characteristic among children. The results of stool swab tests should be considered for discharge and release from isolation.","output":"Epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of 10 children with coronavirus disease 2019 in Changsha, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose Through its impact on both demand and supply, the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has profoundly disrupted supply chains throughout the world The purpose of this paper is to explore the underlying drivers of the supply chain vulnerability exposed by COVID-19 and considers potential future directions for global supply Design/methodology/approach This paper adopts a case study approach, reviewing the automotive manufacturing sector in Australia to illustrate how neoliberal globalisation policy settings have shifted large tracts of manufacturing from the global north to the global south Findings The authors demonstrate the way that neoliberal globalisation policies, facilitated by certain accounting rhetorics and technologies, have consolidated manufacturing in China and Southeast Asia in ways that embed vulnerabilities in global supply chains The authors present three scenarios for post-COVID-19 supply chains and the accounting techniques likely to garner stronger attention as a result of the pandemic Research limitations/implications The paper illustrates how certain accounting rhetorics and technologies facilitate neoliberal globalisation, embedding supply chain vulnerability that has been exposed by COVID-19 It also suggests how supply chain accounting may develop more robust supply chains in a post-COVID-19 world and sets out an agenda for future research in this area Practical implications A number of practical supply chain accounting and planning technologies are suggested to facilitate more robust supply chains Originality/value This paper draws attention to the neoliberal globalisation policies that have shaped global supply chains as well as how COVID-19, in concert with other geopolitical trajectories, may represent a watershed moment for global supply chains","output":"Global supply chains after COVID-19: the end of the road for neoliberal globalisation?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study describes an outbreak of Classical swine fever (CSF) in an organized pig farm followed by an episode of CSF virus (CSFV) associated congenital tremors in piglets.

Initial experimentation in small-volume samples showed that both types of particles readily adsorbed to the positively charged glass wool but were poorly detached from it through standard elution with 0.05 M glycine with 3% of beef extract buffer, pH 9.5, with elution efficiencies of 7.2% and 2.6%, for HAV and TGEV, respectively. To improve the recovery of enveloped viruses, several modifications in the elution were assayed: increasing the elution pH, extending glass wool and eluent contact time, adding a detergent, or performing the elution by recirculation or under agitation. Considering practicability and performance, recircularization of the eluent at pH 11.0 for 20 min was the elution procedure of choice, with efficiencies of 25.7% and 18.8% for HAV and TGEV in 50 L of water. Additionally, employing 20% PEG instead of 10% for virus reconcentration improved recoveries up to 47% and 51%, respectively.

For example, epidemiologists demonstrated 100% prevalence of dental caries in the Russian population followed by clinical manifestation of periodontal diseases. Inadequately provided oral health services in populations are caused by multi-factorial deficits including but not limited to low socio-economic status of affected individuals, lack of insurance in sub-populations, insufficient density of dedicated medical units. Another important aspect is the \\"participatory\\" medicine based on the active participation of population in maintaining oral health: healthcare will remain insufficient as long as the patient is not motivated and does not feel responsible for their oral health. To this end, nearly half of chronically diseased people do not comply with adequate medical services suffering from severely progressing pathologies. Noteworthy, the prominent risk factors and comorbidities linked to the severe disease course and poor outcomes in COVID-19-infected individuals, such as elderly, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and cardiovascular disease, are frequently associated with significantly altered oral microbiome profiles, systemic inflammatory processes and poor oral health. Suggested pathomechanisms consider potential preferences in the interaction between the viral particles and the host microbiota including oral cavity, the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Since an aspiration of periodontopathic bacteria induces the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and production of inflammatory cytokines in the lower respiratory tract, poor oral hygiene and periodontal disease have been proposed as leading to COVID-19 aggravation. Consequently, the issue-dedicated expert recommendations are focused on the optimal oral hygiene as being crucial for improved individual outcomes and reduced morbidity under the COVID-19 pandemic condition.

We assessed saliva-based specimens for detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) in the community setting and compared three different collection methods. This prospective study was conducted in three primary care centers. RT-PCR was performed on paired nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and saliva samples collected from outpatients with a broad clinical spectrum of illness. To assess differences in collection methods, saliva specimens were obtained in a different way in each of the participating centers: supervised collection (SVC), oropharyngeal washing (OPW), and self-collection (SC). Pairs of NPS and saliva samples from 577 patients (median age, 39 years; 44% men; 42% asymptomatic) were collected and tested, and 120 (20.8%) gave positive results. The overall agreement with NPS results and kappa coefficients (&#954;) for saliva samples obtained by SVC, OPW, and SC were 95% (&#954; = 0.85), 93.4% (&#954; = 0.76), and 93.3% (&#954; = 0.76), respectively. The sensitivities (95% confidence intervals [95% CI]) of the saliva specimens ranged from 86% (72.6% to 93.7%) for SVC to 66.7% (50.4% to 80%) for SC samples. Sensitivity was higher for samples with lower cycle threshold (CT ) values.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), lung failure, and fulminant pneumonia are major lung diseases in H7N9 patients. Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is a promising choice for treating virus-induced pneumonia, and was needed to treat H7N9 induced ARDS at the time. MSCs transplant into patients with H7N9 induced ARDS were conducted in a single center and open-label clinical trial. Based on the principle of voluntariness and informed consent, 44 patients with H7N9 induced ARDS were included as a control group while 17 patients with H7N9 induced ARDS were served as an experimental group with allogeneic menstrual blood-derived MSC. Notably, MSC transplantation significantly lower the mortality compared with in control group (17.6% died in MSC group vs 54.5% died in control group). Furthermore, MSC transplantation did not result in harmful effects in human body within the 5 year follow up period with 4 patients. Collectively, these results suggest that MSCs significantly improve survival rate of H7N9 induced ARDS and provide a theoretical basis for the treatment of H7N9 induced ARDS in both preclinical research and clinical studies. Because H7N9 and the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) share similar complications (such as ARDS and lung failure) and corresponding multi-organ dysfunction, MSC-based therapy could be a possible alternative for treating COVID-19.","output":"Clinical study of mesenchymal stem cell treating acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by epidemic Influenza A (H7N9) infection, a hint for COVID-19 treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundA multi-tiered surveillance system based on influenza surveillance was adopted in the United Kingdom in the early stages of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic to monitor different stages of the disease.

We aimed to examine human colectomy specimens for microplastics and to report the characteristics as well as polymer composition of the particles. METHODS: Colectomy samples were obtained from 11 adults (mean age 45.7, six males) who were residents of Northeastern Peninsular Malaysia. Microplastics were identified following chemical digestion of specimens and subsequent filtration. The samples were then examined for characteristics (abundance, length, shape, and color) and composition of three common polymer types using stereo\\\\ and Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR) microscopes. RESULTS: Microplastics were detected in all 11 specimens with an average of 331 particles/individual specimen or 28.1  15.4 particles/g tissue. Filaments or fibers accounted for 96.1% of particles, and 73.1% of all filaments were transparent.

If these data are acquired by a malicious user, it will not only cause the pilferage of the patients personal data but also affect the diagnosis and treatment. One of the most challenging tasks in cloud-based healthcare systems is to provide security and privacy to electronic health records. Various probabilistic data structures and watermarking techniques were used in the cloud-based healthcare systems to secure patients data. Most of the existing studies focus on cuckoo and bloom filters, without considering their throughputs. In this research, a novel cloud security mechanism is introduced, which supersedes the shortcomings of existing approaches. The proposed solution enhances security with methods such as fragile watermark, least significant bit replacement watermarking, class reliability factor, and Morton filters included in the formation of the security mechanism. A Morton filter is an approximate set membership data structure (ASMDS) that proves many improvements to other data structures, such as cuckoo, bloom, semi-sorting cuckoo, and rank and select quotient filters. The Morton filter improves security; it supports insertions, deletions, and lookups operations and improves their respective throughputs by 0.9 to 15.5, 1.3 to 1.6, and 1.3 to 2.5, when compared to cuckoo filters. We used Hadoop version 0.20.3, and the platform was Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6; we executed five experiments, and the average of the results has been taken. The results of the simulation work show that our proposed security mechanism provides an effective solution for secure data storage in cloud-based healthcare systems, with a load factor of 0.9. Furthermore, to aid cloud security in healthcare systems, we presented the motivation, objectives, related works, major research gaps, and materials and methods; we, thus, presented and implemented a cloud security mechanism, in the form of an algorithm and a set of results and conclusions.","output":"Morton Filter-Based Security Mechanism for Healthcare System in Cloud Computing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Video directly observed therapy (vDOT) was introduced to increase flexibility and meet patient-specific needs for TB treatment.

METHODS: We prospectively evaluated routinely collected data to estimate 1) reach (proportion of patients initiated on vDOT vs. in-person DOT); and 2) effectiveness (proportion of prescribed doses with verified administration by vDOT vs. in-person DOT). RESULTS: Among 163 TB patients, 94 (58%) utilized vDOT during treatment, of whom 54 (57%) received exclusively vDOT. Individuals receiving vDOT were on average younger than those receiving in-person therapy (46 vs. 61 years; P < 0.001). The median time to vDOT initiation was 2.2 weeks (IQR 1.1C10.0); patients were monitored for a median of 27.0 weeks (IQR 24.6C31.9). vDOT led to higher proportions of verified prescribed doses than in-person DOT (68% vs. 54%; P < 0.001). Unobserved self-administration occurred for all patients on weekends based on clinic instructions, but a larger proportion of doses were self-administered during periods of in-person DOT than of vDOT (45% vs. 24%; P < 0.001).

However, absolute and fast removal of pathogens requires highly permeable but selective membranes. Herein, we report the preparation of such advanced membranes using carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as one-dimensional building blocks. We first disperse CNTs with the help of an amphiphilic block copolymer, poly(2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate)-block-polystyrene (PDMAEMA-b-PS, abbreviated as BCP). The PS blocks adsorb on the surface of CNTs via the - interaction, while the PDMAEMA blocks are solvated, thus forming homogeneous and stable CNT dispersions. We then spray the CNT dispersions on porous substrates, producing composite membranes with assembled CNT layers as the selective layers. We demonstrate that the optimized membrane shows 100% rejection to phage viruses and bacteria (Escherichia coli) while giving a water permeance up to 3300 L m-2 h-1 bar-1. The performance of the resultant BCP/CNT membrane outperforms that of state-of-the-art membranes and commercial membranes.

As the COVID-19 pandemic has now affected the whole planet, even countries with moderate to strong healthcare support and expenditure have struggled to contain disease transmission and casualties. Countries affected by COVID-19 have different demographics, socioeconomic, and lifestyle health indicators. In this context, it is important to find out to what extent these parametric variations are modulating disease outcomes. To answer this, this study selected demographic, socioeconomic, and health indicators e.g., population density, percentage of the urban population, median age, health expenditure per capita, obesity, diabetes prevalence, alcohol intake, tobacco use, case fatality of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) as independent variables. Countries were grouped according to these variables and influence on dependent variables e.g., COVID-19 positive tests, case fatality, and case recovery rates were statistically analyzed. The results suggested that countries with variable median age had a significantly different outcome on positive test rate (P < 0.01). Both the median age (P = 0.0397) and health expenditure per capita (P = 0.0041) showed a positive relation with case recovery. An increasing number of tests per 100 K of the population showed a positive and negative relationship with the number of positives per 100 K population (P = 0.0001) and the percentage of positive tests (P < 0.0001), respectively. Alcohol intake per capita in liter (P = 0.0046), diabetes prevalence (P = 0.0389), and NCDs mortalities (P = 0.0477) also showed a statistical relation to the case fatality rate. Further analysis revealed that countries with high healthcare expenditure along with high median age and increased urban population showed more case fatality but also had a better recovery rate. Investment in the health sector alone is insufficient in controlling the severity of the pandemic. Intelligent and sustainable healthcare both in urban and rural settings and healthy lifestyle acquired immunity may reduce disease transmission and comorbidity induced fatalities, respectively.","output":"Lifestyle Acquired Immunity, Decentralized Intelligent Infrastructures, and Revised Healthcare Expenditures May Limit Pandemic Catastrophe: A Lesson From COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two novel phases, potassium copper aluminium bis(phosphate), KCuAl[PO4]2 (I), and potassium zinc aluminium bis(phosphate-silicate), K(Al,Zn)2[(P,Si)O4]2 (II), were obtained in one hydrothermal synthesis experiment at 553 K.

Numerous studies have shown that dogs and their olfactory abilities are of great importance to humans. It was found that the changes within the skull have had a significant impact on the structure of the initial sections of the respiratory system, including the turbinates of the nasal passages. Congenital defects, defined as brachycephalic syndrome, are currently a significant problem in dog breeding as they can affect animal welfare and even lead to death; therefore this manuscript also focuses on this topic. After identifying the subject, we believe that further characteristics of the nasal turbinates and in-depth research related to their hypertrophy are needed. The study also summarized the state of knowledge about the structure of the respiratory system and nasal cavity in dogs compared to other species of domestic animals. ABSTRACT: Dogs are a good starting point for the description and anatomical analysis of turbinates of the nose. This work aimed at summing up the state of knowledge on the shape of the nasal cavity and airflow in these domestic animals and dealt with the brachycephalic syndrome (BOAS) and anatomical changes in the initial airway area in dogs with a short and widened skull. As a result of artificial selection and breeding concepts, the dog population grew very quickly. Modern dog breeds are characterized by a great variety of their anatomical shape. Craniological changes also had a significant impact on the structure and physiology of the respiratory system in mammals. The shape of the nasal cavity is particularly distinctive in dogs. Numerous studies have established that dogs and their olfactory ability are of great importance in searching for lost people, detecting explosives or drugs as well as signaling disease in the human body. The manuscript describes the structure of the initial part of the respiratory system, including the nasal turbinates, and compares representatives of various animal species. It provides information on the anatomy of brachycephalic dogs and BOAS. The studies suggest that further characterization and studies of nasal turbinates and their hypertrophy are important.","output":"The Shape of the Nasal Cavity and Adaptations to Sniffing in the Dog (Canis familiaris) Compared to Other Domesticated Mammals: A Review Article"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As learning-based approaches progress towards automating robot controllers design, transferring learned policies to new domains with different dynamics (e.g. sim-to-real transfer) still demands manual effort.

Our hybrid simulator combines neural networks and traditional physics simulation to balance expressiveness and generalizability, and alleviates the need for a carefully selected parameter set in System ID. Once the hybrid simulator is identified via adversarial reinforcement learning, it can be used to refine policies for the target domain, without the need to interleave data collection and policy refinement.

Whereas NCS collaboration in HIV/AIDS area may result in research capacity strengthening of Southern partners, it is not clear what factors are associated with this type of collaboration. The study aims to characterize NCS research collaboration focusing on HIV/AIDS and to determine factors associated with such NCS research collaborations. METHODS: Clinical trial data on HIV/AIDS-related studies conducted between 2000 and 2019 were obtained from ClinicalTrials.gov. Using these data, we characterized NCS collaborative studies focusing on HIV/AIDS and summarized them using frequencies and percentages. To determine factors associated with these studies, we used logistic regression and reported results as adjusted odds ratios with Wald 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Of the 4,832 HIV/AIDS-related studies retrieved from the registry, less than one-quarter (n = 1133, 23%) involved a Southern institution, with 77% of these studies classified as NCS collaborations. Majority of these studies have single PI (50%), are conducted at single location (39%); have large sample sizes (41%); are federally-funded (32%) or receive funding from other sources (32%); are intervention studies (64%); and involve a mixture of male and female participants (58%) and adult participants (54%). Single PIs (as opposed to multiple PIs) were more likely to be from the North than South institution (odds ratio = 5.59, 95%CI: 4.16 C 11.57). Trend analyses showed that NCS research collaborations produced HIV/AIDS-related studies at a faster rate than SCS research collaborations. NCS collaborations involving female or children produced HIV/AIDS-related studies between 2000 and 2019 at a significantly faster rate than SCS collaborations involving females and children during the same period. Holding other factors constant, NCS collaborative research focusing on HIV/AIDS are associated with: multiple PIs as opposed to single PI, multiple institutions as opposed to a single institution, multiple locations as opposed to a single location, large number of participants as opposed to small sample sizes, and public funding as opposed to industry funding. Almost half of these studies had a Northern PI only, about one-third had a Southern PI only, and much fewer had PIs from both North and South. However, these studies were less likely to receive funding from other sources than industry funding. CONCLUSIONS: HIV/AIDS-related research is increasingly becoming a more collaborative global research involving more NCS collaborations than SCS collaborations. Factors associated with NCS collaborative studies focusing on HIV/AIDS include multiple PIs, institutions, and locations; large sample sizes; publicly funded; and involve vulnerable populations such as women and children. Whereas almost half of these studies have a Northern PI only, about one-third have a Southern PI only, and much fewer have PIs from both North and South.

The SARS-CoV-2 uses the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to gain entry inside the human cells where it replicates by using the cell protein synthesis mechanisms. The knowledge of the tissue distribution of ACE2 in human organs is therefore important to predict the clinical course of the COVID-19. Also important is the understanding of the viral receptor-binding domain (RBD), a region within the spike (S) proteins, that enables the entry of the virus into the host cells to synthesize vaccine and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). We performed an exhaustive search of human protein databases to establish the tissues that express ACE2 and performed an in-depth analysis like sequence alignments and homology modeling of the spike protein (S) of the SARS-CoV-2 to identify antigenic regions in the RBD that can be exploited to synthesize vaccine and mAbs.

Students using VR simulators are provided with a 3D human model to observe the details by using multiple senses and they can participate in an environment that is similar to reality. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to promote a new approach consisting of a shared and independent study platform for medical orthopedic students, to compare traditional tendon repair training with VR simulation of tendon repair, and to evaluate future applications of VR simulation in the academic medical field. METHODS: In this study, 121 participants were randomly allocated to VR or control groups. The participants in the VR group studied the tendon repair technique via the VR simulator, while the control group followed traditional tendon repair teaching methods. The final assessment for the medical students involved performing tendon repair with the Kessler tendon repair with 2 interrupted tendon repair knots (KS) method and the Bunnell tendon repair with figure 8 tendon repair (BS) method on a synthetic model. The operative performance was evaluated using the global rating scale. RESULTS: Of the 121 participants, 117 participants finished the assessment and 4 participants were lost to follow-up. The overall performance (a total score of 35) of the VR group using the KS method and the BS method was significantly higher (P<.001) than that of the control group. Thus, participants who received VR simulator training had a significantly higher score on the global rating scale than those who received traditional tendon repair training (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that compared with the traditional tendon repair method, the VR simulator for learning tendon suturing resulted in a significant improvement of the medical students in the time in motion, flow of operation, and knowledge of the procedure. Therefore, VR simulator development in the future would most likely be beneficial for medical education and clinical practice.

Given that many infected individuals are asymptomatic, they transmit the disease to others unknowingly, which has resulted in the spread of infection at an alarming rate. This review aims to provide an overview of the pathophysiology, preventive measures to reduce the disease spread, therapies currently in use, an update on vaccine development and opportunities for vaccine delivery. The World Health Organization has advised several precautions including social distancing, hand washing and the use of PPE including gloves and face masks for minimizing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection. At present, several antiviral therapies previously approved for other infections are being repositioned to study their efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. In addition, some medicines (i.e., remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine) have received emergency use authorisation from the FDA. Plasma therapy has also been authorised for emergency use for the treatment of COVID-19 on a smaller scale. However, no vaccine has been approved so far against this virus. Nevertheless, several potential vaccine targets have been reported, and development of different types of vaccines including DNA, mRNA, viral vector, inactivated, subunit and vaccine-like particles is in process. It is concluded that a suitable candidate delivered through an advanced drug delivery approach would effectively boost the immune system against this coronavirus.","output":"COVID-19: Current Developments and Further Opportunities in Drug Delivery and Therapeutics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a proof of concept for a spectrally selective thermal mid-IR source based on nanopatterned graphene (NPG) with a typical mobility of CVD-grown graphene (up to 3000 [Formula: see text] ), ensuring scalability to large areas. For that, we solve the electrostatic problem of a conducting hyperboloid with an elliptical wormhole in the presence of an in-plane electric field. The localized surface plasmons (LSPs) on the NPG sheet, partially hybridized with graphene phonons and surface phonons of the neighboring materials, allow for the control and tuning of the thermal emission spectrum in the wavelength regime from [Formula: see text] to 12 [Formula: see text] m by adjusting the size of and distance between the circular holes in a hexagonal or square lattice structure. Most importantly, the LSPs along with an optical cavity increase the emittance of graphene from about 2.3% for pristine graphene to 80% for NPG, thereby outperforming state-of-the-art pristine graphene light sources operating in the near-infrared by at least a factor of 100. According to our COMSOL calculations, a maximum emission power per area of [Formula: see text] W/[Formula: see text] at [Formula: see text] K for a bias voltage of [Formula: see text] V is achieved by controlling the temperature of the hot electrons through the Joule heating. By generalizing Plancks theory to any grey body and deriving the completely general nonlocal fluctuation-dissipation theorem with nonlocal response of surface plasmons in the random phase approximation, we show that the coherence length of the graphene plasmons and the thermally emitted photons can be as large as 13 [Formula: see text] m and 150 [Formula: see text] m, respectively, providing the opportunity to create phased arrays made of nanoantennas represented by the holes in NPG. The spatial phase variation of the coherence allows for beamsteering of the thermal emission in the range between [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] by tuning the Fermi energy between [Formula: see text] eV and [Formula: see text] eV through the gate voltage. Our analysis of the nonlocal hydrodynamic response leads to the conjecture that the diffusion length and viscosity in graphene are frequency-dependent. Using finite-difference time domain calculations, coupled mode theory, and RPA, we develop the model of a mid-IR light source based on NPG, which will pave the way to graphene-based optical mid-IR communication, mid-IR color displays, mid-IR spectroscopy, and virus detection.","output":"Plasmonically enhanced mid-IR light source based on tunable spectrally and directionally selective thermal emission from nanopatterned graphene"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Few studies exist on the clinical manifestation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients who previously had a common cold due to an endemic coronavirus (eCoV).

National COVID-19 surveillance data showed that four (6.2%) of 64 patients were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by the end of 2020, while, simultaneously, the COVID-19 prevalence in the city of Malatya ranged from 7.8% (polymerase chain reaction-based diagnosis) to 9.2% (total diagnosis).

Patient interviews and evaluation of medical records revealed that these four patients did not manifest any severe COVID-19 symptoms despite their substantial comorbidities, and they did not require hospitalization. Consequently, despite a low number of samples, we determined a lower frequency of COVID-19 among the patients who had a prior eCoV infection, and the results of this study support the previous findings that people with a prior eCoV infection develop a milder case of COVID-19.

While there has been tremendous growth in the variety, availability, and sophistication of the types of respiratory viral tests, there may have been less critical thought and discussion among frontline clinicians about the clinical utility and specific indications for testing. We summarize the rationale historically used to support respiratory virus testing in children, with a review of the supporting evidence. We outline potential considerations and limitations of the various types of respiratory viral tests and suggest some clinical indications where viral testing may play an important role in clinical management. Observations The main value of testing for viruses in children who present with a respiratory tract infection is to differentiate between viral and bacterial infections, hopefully facilitating clinical decision making regarding further investigations and the need for antibiotics. We have highlighted commonly cited rationale used to support testing and the generally poor evidence on which to base this rationale. In addition, difficulties with interpretation of respiratory viral testing results include somewhat poor diagnostic test characteristics for some tests, uncertainty regarding true positives and causation of illness, delay in receiving the test result, and the incidence of concurrent bacterial infections or the presence of multiple viruses. We have given some examples of clinical scenarios where respiratory viral testing results could be expected to contribute to more appropriate clinical management decisions.

Pleural fluid cytology, biochemical tests and even pleural fluid cell block studies may fail to yield a diagnosis in certain cases. Medical thoracoscopy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of unexplained pleural effusions. However, access to medical thoracoscopy may be limited, particularly in developing countries. Also, certain patients may not be fit to undergo the procedure because of medical conditions. An ultrasound-guided pleural biopsy is an option in such conditions. The present study is intended to compare the diagnostic yield and complications of both methods of pleural biopsy in undiagnosed exudative pleural effusion under a randomized controlled trial. Method After fulfilling all the inclusion criteria, participants were randomized to either ultrasound-guided closed pleural biopsy or thoracoscopic-guided pleural biopsy groups. The primary outcome was to compare the diagnostic yield of ultrasound-guided Tru-Cut? (Newtech Medical Devices, Faridabad, India) closed pleural biopsy versus thoracoscopic pleural biopsy, and the secondary outcomes were to compare the complications rate, duration of the procedure, and hospital stay in the patients undergoing ultrasound-guided pleural biopsy versus thoracoscopic pleural biopsy, and predictors of a positive biopsy result in both groups. Result A total of 118 patients with pleural effusion were screened; 39 of them who were eligible, randomized into the ultrasound group (20 patients) and the thoracoscopic group (19 patients). The median age of participants was 53.5 (50-58) years and 55 (45-64) years in the ultrasound and thoracoscopic groups, respectively. Pleural fluid cell count, protein, adenosine deaminase (ADA), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were similar in both groups, although pleural fluid glucose was low in the ultrasound group. Diagnostic yield was 90% (18/20) and 94.7% (18/19) in the ultrasound and thoracoscopic groups, respectively, which was statistically non-significant (p=0.963). The median duration of hospital stay was 9.5 (5.3-27) days and 15 (12-22) days in ultrasound and thoracoscopic groups respectively. The thoracoscopic group had a more prolonged stay compared to the ultrasound group, but it was statistically non-significant (p=0.09). The duration of the procedure was significantly longer in the thoracoscopic group 90 (85-105) minutes, in comparison to ultrasound 47.5 (41.3-55) minutes (p=0.001). No major complications were seen in both groups. Subcutaneous emphysema was the most common complication in the thoracoscopic group (10%), followed by hemorrhage (5.3%), and respiratory failure (5.3%). Hypotension was the only complication in the ultrasound group (5%). The rate of complications was significantly higher in the thoracoscopic group (p<0.01). Conclusion Ultrasound-guided closed pleural biopsy is as good as thoracoscopic pleural biopsy in undiagnosed exudative pleural effusion. It was associated with a shorter procedure duration, a shorter hospital stay, and fewer complications as compared to thoracoscopic biopsy. Both the procedures were safe in experienced hands and a hospital setup, but the thoracoscopic pleural biopsy was associated with complications.","output":"Comparison of Diagnostic Yield and Complications in Ultrasound-Guided Closed Pleural Biopsy Versus Thoracoscopic Pleural Biopsy in Undiagnosed Exudative Pleural Effusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Many family practitioners prescribe antibiotics for patients with upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) to meet patients' expectations. We evaluated the impact of providing brief tablet-based information about antibiotic treatment of URTIs on patients' expectations for antibiotics and on family practitioners' antibiotic-prescribing behavior. METHODS We performed a 3-arm randomized controlled trial among patients presenting with URTIs at 2 urban family practices in Auckland, New Zealand, during winter 2018. Participants were randomly allocated to view a presentation about the futility of antibiotic treatment of URTIs, the adverse effects associated with antibiotics, or the benefits of healthy diet and exercise (active control), immediately before their consultation. Before and after viewing the presentations, participants used a Likert scale to rate the strength of their belief that antibiotics are effective for treating URTIs and of their desire to be prescribed an antibiotic. Patients reported whether an antibiotic had been prescribed, and pharmacy dispensing records were reviewed to determine whether an antibiotic was dispensed. RESULTS Participants who viewed either the futility or the adverse effects presentation had greater reductions in their expectations to receive antibiotics than the control group. The mean reduction (95% CI) was 1.1 (0.8-1.3) for the futility group, 0.7 (0.4-0.9) for the adverse effects group, and 0.1 (0-0.3) for the control group (Cohen d = 0.7; P <.001). There was no significant difference among the 3 groups with regard to antibiotic prescribing (P = .84) or dispensing (P = .43).

It can be classified into primary HLH, often inherited, or secondary which is triggered by non-genetic causes, such as chronic immunosuppression, malignancy or infection.Primary HLH is more frequently observed in infants, however, secondary HLH is more commonly observed in adults. Diagnosis is often delayed, most likely due to the rarity of the condition and is usually prompted by serological abnormalities, including hyperferritinaemia, organ and bone marrow dysfunction.Treatment options are limited; however, the Royal Free Hospital has observed a number of secondary HLH cases who were successfully treated with steroids and anakinra. Methods A retrospective search of clinic letters and patient records was undertaken using electronic care records. We also searched through pharmacy records of patients treated with anakinra at the Royal Free Hospital. Patients with a documented diagnosis of HLH prior to March 2020 who had been referred to Rheumatology were included. We excluded patients after March 2020 due to patients with COVID-19 having similar overlap of symptoms and biomarkers as those with HLH. We identified key demographic details, laboratory, pathology investigations,the course of hospital admission, primary diagnosis and follow-up data. The diagnosis was confirmed withan H-score and bone marrow biopsy where possible. Results We identified nine adult cases with adocumented diagnosis of HLH whohad been admitted to the Royal Free Hospitaland referred to Rheumatology.

The predominant underlying pathology was adultonsetStills disease(78%), with the remaining cases being secondary to HIV (22%). Bone marrow aspirate was performed in all patients and 78% of patients aspirated had bone marrowappearances in keeping with HLH.Ferritin levels varied from 532 micrograms/Lto 93309 micrograms/L with a median ferritin of 5045.5 micrograms/L.H-Scores were variable witha median score of 171.5 (96-238).All patients received steroids as part of their treatment. Anakinra (interleukin-1 receptor antagonist) was delivered intravenously(6/9) or subcutaneously (3/9). Conclusion We present data from nine cases of HLH treated with anakinra who survived their admission and have been subsequently followed up in clinic.

Methods: : We recruited 1827 Chinese adolescents ( M age = 17.78  1.94 years, 55.5% female) to participate a cross-sectional survey. Participants completed a series of questionnaires, including the scales of cultural tightness, risk perception of COVID-19 pandemic, perceived protection efficacy, anxiety and depression. A latent moderated structural equations model was used to analyse the mediating and moderating effects of risk perception regarding COVID-19, cultural tightness and perceived protection efficacy on psychological disorders. Results: : The results showed that greater risk perception of COVID-19 predicted greater psychological disorders, however cultural tightness moderated this positive relationship. The increase in psychological disorders with risk perception regarding COVID-19 was less pronounced among people who lived in tighter cultural areas. In addition, this moderating effect of cultural tightness was further mediated by perceived protection efficacy;that is, tight culture protects against psychological disorders by enhancing perceived protection efficacy. Conclusion: This study enriched the theoretical framework of cultural tightness and indicated its importance in the field of mental health and health policies. It also emphasized the importance of tight culture as a protective factor against psychological disorders in case of COVID-19 outbreaks, providing valuable practical insight into psychological prevention for COVID-19 outbreaks.","output":"What Protects Us Against the COVID-19 Threat?

Tocilizumab was applied and intended to target both COVID-19 and RA. However, disease of this patient aggravated after usage of tocilizumab. After the discussion of a multiple disciplinary team (MDT) including rheumatologists, antimicrobial treatments were applied to target the potential opportunistic infections (Pneumocystis jirovecii and Aspergillus fumigatus), which were authenticated several days later via high throughput sequencing. As an important cytokine in immune responses, IL-6 can be a double-edged sword: interference in the IL-6-IL-6 receptor signaling may save patients from cytokine release storm (CRS), but can also weaken the anti-infectious immunity, particularly in rheumatic patients, who may have received a long-term treatment with immunosuppressive/modulatory agents. Thus, we suggest careful considerations before and close monitoring in the administration of tocilizumab in rheumatic patients with COVID-19. Besides tocilizumab, several disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) can also be applied in the treatment of COVID-19. Therefore, we also reviewed and discussed the application of these DMARDs in COVID-19 condition.

In particular, surveillance of infectious diseases such as influenza has demonstrated high correlations between the number of social media posts mentioning the disease and the number of patients who went to the hospital and were diagnosed with the disease. However, the prevalence of some diseases, such as allergic rhinitis, cannot be estimated based on the number of patients alone. Specifically, individuals with allergic rhinitis typically self-medicate by taking over-the-counter (OTC) medications without going to the hospital. Although allergic rhinitis is not a life-threatening disease, it represents a major social problem because it reduces peoples quality of life, making it essential to understand its prevalence and peoples motives for self-medication behavior. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the relationship between the number of social media posts mentioning the main symptoms of allergic rhinitis and the sales volume of OTC rhinitis medications in Japan. METHODS: We collected tweets over 4 years (from 2017 to 2020) that included keywords corresponding to the main nasal symptoms of allergic rhinitis: sneezing, runny nose, and stuffy nose. We also obtained the sales volume of OTC drugs, including oral medications and nasal sprays, for the same period. We then calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between time series data on the number of tweets per week and time series data on the sales volume of OTC drugs per week. RESULTS: The results showed a much higher correlation (r=0.8432) between the time series data on the number of tweets mentioning stuffy nose and the time series data on the sales volume of nasal sprays than for the other two symptoms. There was also a high correlation (r=0.9317) between the seasonal components of these time series data. CONCLUSIONS: We investigated the relationships between social media data and behavioral patterns, such as OTC drug sales volume. Exploring these relationships can help us understand the prevalence of allergic rhinitis and the motives for self-care treatment using social media data, which would be useful as a marketing indicator to reduce the number of out-of-stocks in stores, provide (sell) rhinitis medicines to consumers in a stable manner, and reduce the loss of sales opportunities. In the future, in-depth investigations are required to estimate sales volume using social media data, and future research could investigate other diseases and countries.","output":"Exploring Relationships Between Tweet Numbers and Over-the-counter Drug Sales for Allergic Rhinitis: Retrospective Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia makes significant impact both physically and psychologically. One month after the President of the Republic of Indonesia announced about the COVID-19 patient cases, the Indonesian Child Protection Commission data during April 2020, depicted that 76.7% of children were not happy to participate in distance learning because 81.8% were only given assignments by the teacher and 73.2% felt they had a heavy task and had a short period of time to complete. This reaction is an indicator of the childrens anxiety about distance learning. The anxiety that occurs in these students is assumed to depend on their social support and emotional maturity. When students get optimal family support and are able to control their emotions in the face of a pandemic, they can reduce anxiety in facing online learning. The subjects of this study were 202 junior high and high school students. The results showed that social support and emotional maturity simultaneously affect anxiety in online learning (Freg = 45.066, p = 0.00 <0.01).

We use a basic epidemiological model, a SEIR-model, that is calibrated to roughly resemble the COVID-19 pandemic, and we assume that individuals that become infected or are isolated on average lose a share of their productivity. An early quarantine postpones but does not alter the course of the pandemic at a cost that increases in the duration and the extent of the quarantine. For quarantines at later stages of the pandemic there is a trade-off between lowering the peak level of infectious people on the one hand and minimizing fatalities and economic losses on the other hand. A longer quarantine dampens the peak level of infectious people and also reduces the total number of infected persons but increases economic losses. Both the peak level of infectious individuals and the total share of the population that will have been infected are U-shaped in relation to the share of the population in quarantine, while economic costs increase in this share. In particular, a quarantine covering a moderate share of the population leads to a lower peak, fewer deaths and lower economic costs, but it implies that the peak of the pandemic occurs earlier.","output":"Assessing the consequences of quarantines during a pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We are reporting a case of Acute Post-Infectious Flaccid paralysis also commonly known as Guillain-Barr Syndrome (GBS) in a patient with confirmed COVID-19 infection GBS often occurs following an infectious trigger which induces autoimmune reaction causing damage to peripheral nerves So far, only 8 cases have been described in association with COVID-19 This is the first to be described in Tanzaniain an African Child, and probably the first in the continent This report is presented for clinicians to be aware and for the medical fraternity to look into this unusual presentation which may shed some more light on possible pathways of the pathogenesis and clinical manifestations We recommend that the presentation of GBS with acute respiratory distress should warrant extra precaution and a testing for COVID-19 especially when the symptoms of COVID-19 are protean","output":"Guillain- Barr syndrome associated with COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes COVID-19 disease.

Indeed, not every member of a population may own a cell phone or have a DCT app installed and enabled. We present KHOVID to fulfill the combined goal of manual contact-tracing interoperability and DCT user privacy. At KHOVID's core is a privacy-friendly mechanism to encode user trajectories using geolocation data. Manual contact tracing data can be integrated through the same geolocation format. The accuracy of the geolocation data from DCT is improved using Bluetooth proximity detection, and we propose a novel method to encode Bluetooth ephemeral IDs.

Maternity care disruptions have been surveyed, but not those related to vulnerable small newborns. We aimed to survey reported disruptions to small and sick newborn care worldwide and undertake thematic analysis of healthcare providers experiences and proposed mitigation strategies. METHODS: Using a widely disseminated online survey in three languages, we reached out to neonatal healthcare providers. We collected data on COVID-19 preparedness, effects on health personnel and on newborn care services, including kangaroo mother care (KMC), as well as disruptors and solutions. RESULTS: We analysed 1120 responses from 62 countries, mainly low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Preparedness for COVID-19 was suboptimal in terms of guidelines and availability of personal protective equipment. One-third reported routine testing of all pregnant women, but 13% had no testing capacity at all. More than 85% of health personnel feared for their own health and 89% had increased stress. Newborn care practices were disrupted both due to reduced care-seeking and a compromised workforce. More than half reported that evidence-based interventions such as KMC were discontinued or discouraged. Separation of the motherCbaby dyad was reported for both COVID-positive mothers (50%) and those with unknown status (16%). Follow-up care was disrupted primarily due to families fear of visiting hospitals (~73%). CONCLUSION: Newborn care providers are stressed and there is lack clarity and guidelines regarding care of small newborns during the pandemic. There is an urgent need to protect life-saving interventions, such as KMC, threatened by the pandemic, and to be ready to recover and build back better.","output":"Small and sick newborn care during the COVID-19 pandemic: global survey and thematic analysis of healthcare providers voices and experiences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":": The worldwide response to the current COVID-19 pandemic has been focused on how to prevent the disease and to protect the high-risk patient from a potentially lethal infection.

Several protective mechanisms operate during gestation to correct the harmful effects of anti-fetal immunity and to support a healthy pregnancy outcome. Pregnancy is characterized by gross alterations in endocrine functions. Progesterone is indispensable for pregnancy and humans, and it affects immune functions both directly and via mediators. The progesterone-induced mediator - PIBF - acts in favor of Th2-type immunity, by increasing Th2 type cytokines production. Except for implantation and parturition, pregnancy is characterized by a Th2-dominant cytokine pattern. Progesterone and the orally-administered progestogen dydrogesterone upregulate the production of Th2-type cytokines and suppress the production of Th1 and Th17 cytokine production in vitro. This is particularly relevant to the fact that the Th1-type cytokines TNF- and IFN- and the Th17 cytokine IL-17 have embryotoxic and anti-trophoblast activities. These cytokine-modulating effects and the PIBF-inducing capabilities of dydrogesterone may contribute to the demonstrated beneficial effects of dydrogesterone in recurrent spontaneous miscarriage and threatened miscarriage. IL-17 and IL-22 produced by T helper cells are involved in allograft rejection, and therefore could account for the rejection of paternal HLA-C-expressing trophoblast. Th17 cells (producing IL-17 and IL-22) and Th22 cells (producing IL-22) exhibit plasticity and could produce IL-22 and IL-17 in association with Th2-type cytokines or with Th1-type cytokines. IL-17 and IL-22 producing Th cells are not harmful for the conceptus, if they also produce IL-4. Another important protective mechanism is connected with the expansion and action of regulatory T cells, which play a major role in the induction of tolerance both in pregnant women and in tumour-bearing patients. Clonally-expanded Treg cells increase at the feto-maternal interface and in tumour-infiltrating regions. While in cancer patients, clonally-expanded Treg cells are present in peripheral blood, they are scarce in pregnancy blood, suggesting that fetal antigen-specific tolerance is restricted to the foeto-maternal interface. The significance of Treg cells in maintaining a normal materno-foetal interaction is underlined by the fact that miscarriage is characterized by a decreased number of total effector Treg cells, and the number of clonally-expanded effector Treg cells is markedly reduced in preeclampsia. In this review we present an overview of the above mechanisms, attempt to show how they are connected, how they operate during normal gestation and how their failure might lead to pregnancy pathologies.","output":"Cytokines, Hormones and Cellular Regulatory Mechanisms Favoring Successful Reproduction."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this nationwide study was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on stroke hospitalization rates, patient characteristics and 30-day case fatality rates. METHODS: All hospitalizations for stroke from January to June of each year from 2017 to 2020 were selected using International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, codes I60 to I64 in the national hospital discharge database. Patient characteristics and management were described according to three time periods: pre-lockdown, lockdown, and post-lockdown. Weekly incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were computed to compare time trends in the rates of patients hospitalized for stroke as well as in-hospital and 30-day case fatality rates between the years 2017-2019 and 2020. RESULTS: In 2020, between weeks 1 and 24, 55,308 patients were hospitalized for stroke in France. IRRs decreased by up to 30% for all age groups, sex, and stroke types during the lockdown compared to the period 2017-2019. Patients hospitalized during the second and third weeks of the lockdown had higher in-hospital case fatality rates compared to 2017-2019. In-hospital case fatality rates increased by almost 60% in patients aged under 65 years. Out-of-hospital 30-day case fatality rates increased between weeks 11 and 15 among patients who returned home after their hospitalization. Important changes in care management were found, including fewer stroke patients admitted to resuscitation units, more admitted to stroke care units, and a shorter mean length of hospitalization.

Phased reopening began at West Virginia University (WVU) Medicine on May 25, 2020. While preparing for transition, concern was raised regarding potential for more employee exposures to persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In West Virginia (WV), we did not get the predicted surge of SARS-CoV-2. Current cumulative percent positivity for SARS-CoV-2 PCR in WV is 2332 positives of 133,142 tests (1.75%). We provided appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), including controlled air purifying respirators for all healthcare workers (HCW) caring for persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 from the beginning. Policies requiring masks for all HCW and patients took effect on March 27, 2020 and April 29, 2020, respectively. We hypothesized that due to appropriate PPE use there would be no difference in SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity in HCW working in high versus low risk areas. METHODS: Serum samples from 1042 randomly selected HCW across 4 WVU Medicine hospitals, ranging from 170 to 690 beds with 121 cumulative SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients at the time of the study, were tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG between May 26, 2020 and June 5, 2020. Physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists were characterized as high or low risk based on work location. Environmental services (EVS) workers were included but not risk-stratified. A questionnaire was used to obtain information on demographics, chronic medical conditions, symptoms, and exposures. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 IgG was positive in 9 of 1042 (0.86%) randomly selected HCW. Seroprevalence was lower in high risk 5/835 (0.60%) versus low risk 4/176 (2.27%) group. This was not statistically significant. No EVS workers tested positive 0/31 (0%). Of 9 HCW who tested positive, 2 had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 PCR. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence in a large sample of HCW across 4 WVU Medicine hospitals was low (0.86%). Low seroprevalence among HCW in high risk areas may be related to appropriate PPE use. Seroprevalence in HCW not caring for patients with COVID-19 could be from community or other inadvertent exposure. DISCLOSURES: All Authors: No reported disclosures","output":"501.

Thus, they have become one of the keys to controlling the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Common examples, including N95 masks, surgical masks, and face coverings, are passive devices that minimize the spread of suspended pathogens by inserting an aerosol-filtering barrier between the users nasal and oral cavities and the environment. However, the filtering process does not adapt to changing pathogen levels or other environmental factors, which reduces its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. This paper addresses the limitations of passive masks by proposing ADAPT, a smart IoT-enabled active mask. This wearable device contains a real-time closed-loop control system that senses airborne particles of different sizes near the mask by using an on-board particulate matter (PM) sensor. It then intelligently mitigates the threat by using mist spray, generated by a piezoelectric actuator, to load nearby aerosol particles such that they rapidly fall to the ground. The system is controlled by an on-board micro-controller unit (MCU) that collects sensor data, analyzes it, and activates the mist generator as necessary. A custom smartphone application enables the user to remotely control the device and also receive real-time alerts related to recharging, refilling, and/or decontamination of the mask before reuse.

Alternative devices for airway protection have been developed that can be used by untrained personnel, by those with less experience, and for when ETI is not possible. The main goals of our study were to evaluate the success rate and speed of insertion of different supraglottic airway devices and to determine whether the devices could be properly inserted under simulated critical conditions. METHODS Fifty medical students used an airway simulation trainer (Laerdal SimMan 3G) to assess the success rate and time used to insert seven different supraglottic airway devices under simulated physiologic and pathologic conditions in two different runs. RESULTS Although all airway devices could be inserted without problems, only the Combitube and the EasyTube could be successfully inserted in simulations of trismus, limited mobility of the cervical spine, or a combination of pathologic conditions such as trismus plus limited mobility of the spine and trismus plus tongue edema. The insertion time was significantly longer with LMA Unique, Fastrach, and I-Gel devices in both the first and second runs. CONCLUSION The Combitube and the EasyTube were most easily inserted under simulated conditions such as trismus, limited mobility of the cervical spine, and combined pathologic conditions. Although all devices are useful for establishing an airway by nontrained medical students in standard simulations, we suggest that the Combitube and the EasyTube may offer advantages in difficult airway situations.","output":"Feasibility and speed of insertion of seven supraglottic airway devices under simulated airway conditions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emergence of a new coronavirus causes a serious concern whether this can be stopped at all.

In India, suspected cases were screened for SARS-CoV-2 as per the advisory of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The objective of this study was to characterize SARS-CoV-2 sequences from three identified positive cases as on February 29, 2020. METHODS: Throat swab/nasal swab specimens for a total of 881 suspected cases were screened by E gene and confirmed by RdRp (1), RdRp (2) and N gene real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions and next-generation sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis, molecular characterization and prediction of B- and T-cell epitopes for Indian SARS-CoV-2 sequences were undertaken. RESULTS: Three cases with a travel history from Wuhan, China, were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2. Almost complete (29,851 nucleotides) genomes of case 1, case 3 and a fragmented genome for case 2 were obtained. The sequences of Indian SARS-CoV-2 though not identical showed high (~99.98%) identity with Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus (accession number: NC 045512). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Indian sequences belonged to different clusters. Predicted linear B-cell epitopes were found to be concentrated in the S1 domain of spike protein, and a conformational epitope was identified in the receptor-binding domain. The predicted T-cell epitopes showed broad human leucocyte antigen allele coverage of A and B supertypes predominant in the Indian population. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The two SARS-CoV-2 sequences obtained from India represent two different introductions into the country. The genetic heterogeneity is as noted globally. The identified B- and T-cell epitopes may be considered suitable for future experiments towards the design of vaccines and diagnostics. Continuous monitoring and analysis of the sequences of new cases from India and the other affected countries would be vital to understand the genetic evolution and rates of substitution of the SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Full-genome sequences of the first two SARS-CoV-2 viruses from India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) primarily affects the lungs but can involve any organ. The medical community is struggling to cope with the critical illness associated with the disease. On top of that, patients who have recovered from COVID-19 have presented with complications such as thrombotic episodes in various organs both during and after being infected with SARS-CoV-2. A COVID-19-associated prothrombotic state has been mentioned in multiple recent research articles. The role of anticoagulants is debatable, because even after receiving them prophylactically, many patients have experienced thrombotic episodes. The situation, therefore, represents a challenge to the medical community. CASE REPORT We report on a COVID-19-associated prothrombotic state in a 65-year-old man with no history of comorbid illness. Initially, he presented with right-sided weakness and was found to have had an acute ischemic stroke. Urgent imaging after the stroke revealed changes on electrocardiography that were remarkable for left bundle branch block. The patient's elevated cardiac enzyme levels correlated with a silent acute myocardial infarction (MI). His echocardiogram revealed a left ventricular (LV) thrombus. He was managed with a multidisciplinary approach involving Neurology, Cardiology, and Medicine. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19-associated prothrombotic episodes involving arterial and venous systems have been reported in the literature. But concomitant stroke, acute MI, and LV thrombus rarely have been documented. The role of prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation is still unclear because even when patients are on these drugs, they continue to develop thrombotic episodes. Indeed, further studies are required to develop a standard management plan for what can be a fatal situation.","output":"The Role of Anticoagulation in Post-COVID-19 Concomitant Stroke, Myocardial Infarction, and Left Ventricular Thrombus: A Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is much discussion among clinicians, epidemiologists, and public health experts about why case fatality rate from COVID-19 in Italy (at 13.3% as of April 20, 2020, versus a global case fatality rate of 6.9%) is considerably higher than estimates from other countries (especially China, South Korea, and Germany). In this article, we propose several potential explanations for these differences. We suggest that Italys overall and relative case fatality rate, as reported by public health authorities, is likely to be inflated by such factors as heterogeneous reporting of coronavirus-related fatalities across countries and the iceberg effect of under-testing, yielding a distorted view of the global severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also acknowledge that deaths from COVID-19 in Italy are still likely to be higher than in other equally affected nations due to its unique demographic and socio-economic profile.

We sought to learn how employers made these decisions, what information sources they used, what information they wanted, and to what extent they worked with or used information from their local health department. METHODS: We conducted qualitative, semistructured interviews with 26 employers in Washington State, from August through October 2020. Employers were recruited from 7 counties (4 urban and 3 rural) that were experiencing either higher or lower COVID-19 case rates than Washington State overall. RESULTS: Employers relied heavily on national government resources to make decisions about how to operate their businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Few employers had relationships with or turned to their local health departments for information or support. Employers wanted information about COVID-19 safety that was specific to their business operations and industry. Employers also described the emotional toll of COVID-19 and the challenge of trying to make high-stakes decisions with rapidly evolving information. CONCLUSION: Small employers showed little awareness of their local health departments and the information and assistance they could provide. Local health departments could increase their visibility and build relationships with small employers by partnering with them on value-added services such as workplace health promotion.

Norovirus RNA replication in supernatants and cell lysates were quantified by RT-qPCR. RNA expression levels of immune-related genes were profiled using PCR arrays. The secreted protein levels of shortlisted upregulated genes were measured in supernatants using analyte-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Productive norovirus replications were achieved in three (75%) out of four inoculations. The two most upregulated immune-related genes were CXCL10 (93-folds) and IFI44L (580-folds). Gene expressions of CXCL10 and IFI44L were positively correlated with the level of norovirus RNA replication (CXCL10: Spearmans r = 0.779, p < 0.05; IFI44L: r = 0.881, p < 0.01). The higher level of secreted CXCL10 and IFI44L proteins confirmed their elevated gene expression. The two genes have been reported to be upregulated in norovirus volunteer challenges and natural human infections by other viruses.

However, the conditions faced by specific populations vary according to social, structural and environmental factors, including stigma and discrimination, criminalization, social and economic safety nets and the local epidemiology of HIV and COVID-19, which determine risk of exposure and vulnerability to adverse health outcomes, as well as the ability to comply with measures such as physical distancing. This commentary identifies common vulnerabilities and cross-cutting themes in terms of the impacts of COVID-19 on key populations before addressing issues and concerns specific to particular populations. DISCUSSION: Cross-cutting themes include direct impacts such as disrupted access to essential medicines, commodities and services such as anti-retroviral treatment, HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis, opioid agonist treatment, viral load monitoring, HIV and sexually transmitted infections testing, condoms and syringes. Indirect impacts include significant collateral damage arising from prevention measures which restrict human rights, increase or impose criminal penalties, and expand police powers to target vulnerable and criminalized populations. Significant heterogeneity in the COVID-19 pandemic, the underlying HIV epidemic and the ability of key populations to protect themselves means that people who inject drugs and sex workers face particular challenges, including indirect impacts as a result of police targeting, loss of income and sometimes both. Geographical variations mean that transgender people and men who have sex with men in regions like Africa and the middle east remain criminalized, as well as stigmatized and discriminated against, increasing their vulnerability to adverse outcomes in relation to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Disruptions to both licit and illicit supply chains, loss of income and livelihoods and changes in behaviour as a result of lockdowns and physical distancing have the potential to exacerbate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on key populations. While these impacts will vary significantly, human-rights approaches to COVID-19 emergency laws and public health prevention measures that are population-specific and sensitive, will be key to reducing adverse health outcomes and ensuring that no one is left behind.","output":"COVID-19, HIV and key populations: cross-cutting issues and the need for population-specific responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We explored child sibling relationship qualities during the COVID-19 pandemic in a Chinese setting.

High energy proton beam therapy commenced in the UK National Health Service in 2018. Heavier charged particles have potential advantages over protons by delivering more dose in the Bragg peak, with a sharper penumbra, lower oxygen dependence and increased biological effectiveness. However, they also require more costly equipment including larger gantries to deliver the treatment. There are significant uncertainties in the modelling of relative biological effectiveness and the effects of the fragmentation tail which can deliver dose beyond the Bragg peak. These effects need to be carefully considered especially in relation to long-term outcomes.In 2019, a group of clinicians, clinical scientists, engineers, physical and life scientists from academia and industry, together with funding agency stakeholders, met to consider how the UK should address new technologies for RT, especially the use of heavier charged particles such as helium and carbon and new modes of delivery such as FLASH and spatially fractionated radiotherapy (SFRT).There was unanimous agreement that the UK should develop a facility for heavier charged particle therapy, perhaps constituting a new National Ion Research Centre to enable research using protons and heavier charged particles. Discussion followed on the scale and features, including which ions should be included, from protons through helium, boron, and lithium to carbon, and even oxygen. The consensus view was that any facility intended to treat patients must be located in a hospital setting while providing dedicated research space for physics, preclinical biology and clinical research with beam lines designed for both in vitro and in vivo research. The facility should to be able to investigate and deliver both ultra-high dose rate FLASH RT and SFRT (GRID, minibeams etc.).

Objective: The purpose of our study was to assess the value of a simple questionnaire to guide and further improve pooling strategies for SARS-CoV-2 laboratory testing. Methods: Pharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 testing were obtained from healthcare and police staff, hospital inpatients, and nursing home residents in the southwestern part of Germany. We designed a simple questionnaire, which included questions pertaining to a suggestive clinical symptomatology, recent travel history, and contact with confirmed cases to stratify an individual's pre-test probability of having contracted COVID-19. The questionnaire was adapted repeatedly in face of the unfolding pandemic in response to the evolving epidemiology and observed clinical symptomatology. Based on the response patterns, samples were either tested individually or in multi-sample pools. We compared the pool positivity rate and the number of total PCR tests required to obtain individual results between this questionnaire-based pooling strategy and randomly assembled pools. Findings: Between March 11 and July 5, 2020, we processed 25,978 samples using random pooling (n = 6,012; 23.1%) or questionnaire-based pooling (n = 19,966; 76.9%).

Nevertheless, the exact number of infected ones could not be measured due to the lack of comprehensive testing. In this paper, first of all, we will investigate the relation of transmission of COVID-19 with age by observing timed data in multiple countries. Then, we compare the COVID-19 CFR with the age-demography data. and as a result, we have proposed a method for estimating a lower bound for the number of positive cases by using the reported data on the oldest age group and the regions' population age-distributions. The proposed estimation method improved the expected similarity between the age-distribution of positive cases and regions' populations. Thus, using the publicly accessible data for several developed countries, we show how the improvement of testing over the course of several months has made it clear for the community that different age groups are equally prone to becoming COVID positive. The result shows that the age demography of COVID-19 gets similar to the age-demography of the population, together with the reduction of CFR over time. In addition, countries with less CFR have more similar COVID-19's age-distribution, which is caused by more comprehensive testing, than ones who have higher CFR. This leads us to a better estimation for positive cases in different testing strategies. Having knowledge of this fact helps policymakers enforce more effective policies for controlling the spread of the virus.","output":"Can age-distribution be an indicator of the goodness of COVID-19 testing?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Exploring the relationship between diabetes mellitus targets and DPP4 of the receptor of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) through a protein interaction network to provide new perspective for clinical medication. Methods: : Diabetes mellitus targets were obtained from GeneCards database. Targets with a relevance score exceeding 20 were included, and DPP4 protein was added manually. The initial protein interaction network was obtained through String. The targets directly related to DPP4 were selected as the final analysis targets. Importing them into String again to obtain the protein interaction network. Module identification, GO analysis and KEGG pathway analysis were carried out respectively. The impact of DPP4 on the whole network was analyzed by scoring the module where it located. Results: : 43 DPP4-related proteins were finally selected from the diabetes mellitus targets and three functional modules were found by the cluster analysis. Module 1 was involved in insulin secretion and glucagon signaling pathway, module 2 and module 3 were involved in signaling receptor binding. The scoring results showed that LEP and apoB in module 1 were the highest, and the scores of INS, IL6 and ALB of cross module associated proteins of module 1 were the highest. Conclusions: : DPP4 is widely associated with key proteins in diabetes mellitus.

In this scenario, the fundamental aim of the study was to reproduce a disease model inducing vitamin D deficiency and atheromatosis in ApoE-/- mice and then to evaluate the impact of this vitamin D status on the onset/progression of atheromatosis, focusing on plaque formation and instability. Methods and Results In our murine disease model, vitamin D deficiency was achieved by 3 weeks of vitamin D deficient diet along with intraperitoneal paricalcitol injections, while atheromatosis by western-type diet. Under these experimental conditions, vitamin D deficient mice developed more unstable atheromatous plaques with reduced or absent fibrotic cap. Since calcium and phosphorus metabolism and also cholesterol and triglycerides systemic concentration were not affected by vitamin D level, our results highlighted the role of vitamin D deficiency in the formation/instability of atheromatous plaque and, although further studies are needed, suggested a possible intervention with vitamin D to prevent or delay the atheromatous disease.

Here we show that the adenovirus-vector-based vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, which encodes the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, is immunogenic in mice and elicites a robust humoral and cell-mediated response. This response was predominantly mediated by type-1 T helper cells, as demonstrated by the profiling of the IgG subclass and the expression of cytokines. Vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (using either a prime-only or a prime-boost regimen) induced a balanced humoral and cellular immune response of type-1 and type-2 T helper cells in rhesus macaques. We observed a significantly reduced viral load in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lower respiratory tract tissue of vaccinated rhesus macaques that were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 compared with control animals, and no pneumonia was observed in vaccinated SARS-CoV-2-infected animals. However, there was no difference in nasal shedding between vaccinated and control SARS-CoV-2-infected macaques.

KIBS themselves have had to adapt their working practices considerably, to reduce face-to-face interaction with clients and within teams collaborating on projects. Adaptation is easier for those whose tasks that are relatively standardized and codified, and it remains to be seen how far a shift to such activities - and away from the traditional office-based venues of activity - is retained as firms recover from the crisis.

Older age is associated with increasing mortality. However, morbidity and mortality could possibly be reduced when accurate and aggressive treatment is provided. This study investigated age-related morbidity and mortality in polytrauma including age-related decisions in initial injury management and withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy (WLST). METHODS: A 6.5-year prospective cohort study included consecutive severely injured trauma patients admitted to a Level-1 Trauma Center ICU. Demographics, data on physiology, resuscitation, MODS/ARDS, and infectious complications were prospectively collected. Patients were divided into age subgroups (< 25, 25C49, 50C69, and  70 years) to make clinically relevant comparisons. RESULTS: 391 patients (70% males) were included with median ISS of 29 (22C36), 95% sustained blunt injuries. There was no difference in injury severity, resuscitation, urgent surgeries, nor in ventilator days, ICU-LOS, and H-LOS between age groups. Adjusted odds of MODS, ARDS and infectious complications were similar between age groups. 47% of patients  70 years died, compared to 10C16% in other age groups (P < 0.001). WLST increased with older age, contributing to more than half of deaths  70 years. TBI was the most common cause of death and decision for treatment withdrawal in all age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Patients  70 years had higher mortality risk even though injury severity and complication rates were similar to other age groups.

An association with cerebrovascular diseases, especially cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), has been reported among these patients. The objective of the present study was to identify risk factors for CVT as well as its presentation and outcome in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This is a multicenter and multinational observational study. Ten centers in 4 countries (Pakistan, Egypt, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates) participated in this study. The study included patients (aged >18 years) with symptomatic CVT and recent COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Twenty patients (70% men) were included. Their mean age was 42.4 years, with a male-to-female ratio of 2.3:1. Headache (85%) and seizures (65%) were the common presenting symptoms, with a mean admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13. CVT was the presenting feature in 13 cases (65%), while 7 patients (35%) developed CVT while being treated for COVID-19 infection. Respiratory symptoms were absent in 45% of the patients. The most common imaging finding was infarction (65%), followed by hemorrhage (20%). The superior sagittal sinus (65%) was the most common site of thrombosis. Acute inflammatory markers were raised, including elevated serum D-dimer (87.5%), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (69%), and C-reactive protein (47%) levels. Homocysteine was elevated in half of the tested cases. The mortality rate was 20% (4 patients). A good functional outcome was seen in the surviving patients, with a mean modified Rankin Scale score at discharge of 1.3. Nine patients (45%) had a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-1 at discharge. CONCLUSION: COVID-19-related CVT is more common among males at older ages when compared to previously reported non-COVID-19-related CVT cases. CVT should be suspected in COVID-19 patients presenting with headache or seizures. Mortality is high, but functional neurological outcome is good among survivors.","output":"Cerebral Venous Thrombosis Associated with COVID-19 Infection: An Observational, Multicenter Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE This study examines the effect of antihypertensive drugs on ACE2 and Angiotensin II levels in hypertensive COVID-19 patients. INTRODUCTION Hypertension is a common comorbidity among severe COVID-19 patients. ACE2 expression can be modulated by antihypertensive drugs such as ACEis and ARBs, which may affect COVID-19's prognosis. BB and CCB reduce mortality, according to some evidence. Their effect on circulating levels of ACE2 and angiotensin II, as well as the severity of COVID-19, is less well studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS The clinical data were collected from 200 patients in four different antihypertensive medication classes (ACEi, ARB, BB, and CCB). Angiotensin II and ACE2 levels were determined using standard ELISA kits. ACE2, angiotensin II, and other clinical indices were evaluated by linear regression models. RESULTS Patients on ACEi (n = 57), ARB (n = 68), BB (n = 15), or CCB (n = 30) in this study had mild (n = 76), moderate (n = 76), or severe (n = 52) COVID-19. ACE2 levels were higher in COVID-19 patients with severe disease (p = 0.04) than mild (p = 0.07) and moderate (p = 0.007). The length of hospital stay is correlated with ACE2 levels (r = 0.3, p = 0.003). Angiotensin II levels decreased with severity (p = 0.04). Higher ACE2 levels are associated with higher CRP and D-dimer levels. Elevated Angiotensin II was associated with low levels of CRP, D-dimer, and troponin. ACE2 levels increase with disease severity in patients taking an ARB (p = 0.01), patients taking ACEi, the degree of disease severity was associated with a decrease in angiotensin II. BB patients had the lowest disease severity. CONCLUSION We found different levels of soluble ACE2, and angiotensin II are observed among COVID-19 patients taking different antihypertensive medications and exhibiting varying levels of disease severity. COVID-19 severity increases with elevated ACE2 levels and lower angiotensin II levels indicating that BB treatment reduces severity regardless of levels of ACE2 and angiotensin II.","output":"Soluble ACE2 and angiotensin II levels are modulated in hypertensive COVID-19 patients treated with different antihypertension drugs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the level of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) risk perceptions in Indonesia and characterize predictors of perceptions.

Methods: We enrolled 949 patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who were admitted to hospital between July 24, 2021 and September 30, 2021. Clinical deterioration after admission was compared between casirivimab-imdevimab users (n = 314) and non-users (n = 635). Results: The casirivimab-imdevimab users were older (P < 0.0001), had higher body temperature ( 38C) (P < 0.0001) and greater rates of history of cigarette smoking (P = 0.0068), hypertension (P = 0.0004), obesity (P < 0.0001), and dyslipidemia (P < 0.0001) than the non-users. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that receiving casirivimab-imdevimab was an independent factor for preventing deterioration (odds ratio 0.448;95% confidence interval 0.263-0.763;P = 0.0023).

Weed management is one of the target practices to evolve cropping systems with decreased impact on the environment. While softened management will lead to increased weeds/crops coexistence, it is of importance to assess the relative benefits and drawbacks of new practices. Among the potential drawbacks of weeds/crops coexistence, disease risk may increase if weeds are hosting pathogens. In this study, we assessed the potential of weeds for hosting pathogenic generalist fungi known to translate into disease in crops. We first describe prevalence in fields after harvest and relate prevalence to species characteristics and communities. Then, we directly test the idea that weeds serve as inoculums sources during cropping with a natural experiment. This study highlights variation in host skill among feral weeds for Colletotrichum species, including potential congeneric sub-specialization on different weeds within communities. Last, prevalence within fields was more correlated to focal crop inoculation rates compared to local weed load, but there was a significant correlation effect with prevalence on weeds in the vicinity of fields, suggesting that weeds are mediating disease levels at the local scale, too. Results pointed to the importance of weed host skill in disease risk yet open the door to the potential control of pathogens via targeted weed management.","output":"Weeds as Pathogen Hosts and Disease Risk for Crops in the Wake of a Reduced Use of Herbicides: Evidence from Yam (Dioscorea alata) Fields and Colletotrichum Pathogens in the Tropics."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Numerous digital tools to self-assess visual acuity have been introduced. The recent COVID-19 pandemic underlined the need for high-quality remote care. This review gives a current overview of digital tools for remotely assessing visual function and reports on their accuracy. METHODS We searched the databases of Embase and Pubmed, and systematically reviewed the literature, conforming to PRISMA guidelines. Two preliminary papers were added from medRxiv.org. The main outcome was the agreement of the digital tools with conventional clinical charts, as expressed by mean differences and 95% limits of agreement (95% LoA). RESULTS Seventeen publications included studies reported on 13 different digital tools. Most of the tools focus on distance visual acuity. The mean differences of the digital tools ranged from - 0.08 to 0.10 logMAR, when compared to traditional clinical assessments. The 95% LoA differed considerably between studies: from  0.08 logMAR to  0.47 logMAR, though the variability was less pronounced for higher visual acuities. CONCLUSION The low mean differences between digital visual acuity assessments and reference charts suggest clinical equivalence, though the wide 95% LoA identify a lower precision of digital self-assessments. This effect diminishes in individuals with better visual acuities, which is a common feature of visual acuity assessments. There is great potential for the digital tools to increase access to eye care and we expect the accuracy of the current tools to improve with every iteration in technology development.","output":"Digital Tools for the Self-Assessment of Visual Acuity: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We demonstrate a highly integrated microfluidic chip with the function of DNA amplification.

As a result, a set of technical notes and research paved the way for many other studies and the potential behind FES-assisted cycling has been consolidated. However, engineering research needs instrumented devices to support novel developments and enable precise assessment. Therefore, some researchers struggle to develop their own FES-assisted devices or find it challenging to implement their instrumentation using commercial devices, which often limits the implementation of advanced control strategies and the possibility to connect different types of sensor. In this regard, we hypothesize that it would be advantageous for some researchers in our community to enjoy access to an entire open-source FES platform that allows different control strategies to be implemented, offers greater adaptability and power capacity than commercial devices, and can be used to assist different functional activities in addition to cycling. Hence, it appears to be of interest to make our proprietary electrical stimulation system an open-source device and to prove its capabilities by addressing all the aspects necessary to implement a FES cycling system. The high-power capacity stimulation device is based on a constant current topology that allows the creation of biphasic electrical pulses with amplitude, width, and frequency up to 150 mA, 1000 s, and 100 Hz, respectively. A mobile application (Android) was developed to set and modify the stimulation parameters of up to eight stimulation channels. A proportional-integral controller was implemented for cadence tracking with the aim to improve the overall cycling performance. A volunteer with complete paraplegia participated in the functional testing of the system. He was able to cycle indoors for 45 min, accomplish distances of more than 5 km using a passive cycling trainer, and pedal 2400 m overground in 32 min. The results evidenced the capacity of our FES cycling system to be employed as a cycling tool for individuals with spinal cord injury.

We demonstrate the veracity of the KMES using independent data from the Covid 19 pandemic and derive many previously unknown and useful analytical expressions for diagnosing and managing an epidemic. These include new expressions for the viral load, the final size, the effective reproduction number, and the time to the peak in infections.

Implicit in the use of the SIR approximation are the beliefs that there is no closed form solution to the more complex integro-differential equations, that the approximation adequately reproduces the dynamics of the integro-differential equations, and that herd immunity always exists. However, as we explicate in this manuscript, the KMES demonstrates that the SIR models are not adequate representations of the integro-differential equations, and herd immunity is not guaranteed.

To better understand how cetaceans have adapted to this virus-rich environment, we compared cetacean virus-responsive genes to those from terrestrial mammals. We identified virus-responsive gene sequences in seven species of cetaceans, which we compared with orthologous sequences in seven terrestrial mammals. As a result of evolution analysis using the branch model and the branch-site model, 21 genes were selected using at least one model. IFN-, an antiviral cytokine expressed at mucous membranes, and its receptor IFNAR1 contain cetacean-specific amino acid substitutions that might change the interaction between the two proteins and lead to regulation of the immune system against viruses. Cetacean-specific amino acid substitutions in IL-6, IL-27, and the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1 are also predicted to alter the mucosal immune response of cetaceans. Since mucosal membranes are the first line of defense against the external environment and are involved in immune tolerance, our analysis of cetacean virus-responsive genes suggests that genes with cetacean-specific mutations in mucosal immunity-related genes play an important role in the protection and/or regulation of immune responses against viruses.

We estimated the effects of tax and welfare reforms from 2010/2011 to 2021/2022 on LE and inequalities in LE in Scotland. METHODS: We applied a published estimate of the cumulative income impact of the reforms to the households within Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) quintiles. We estimated the impact on LE by applying a rate ratio for the impact of income on mortality rates (by age group, sex and SIMD quintile) and calculating the difference between inflation-only changes in benefits and the reforms. RESULTS: We estimated that changes to household income resulting from the reforms would result in an additional 1041 (+3.7%) female deaths and 1013 (+3.8%) male deaths. These deaths represent an estimated reduction of female LE from 81.6 years to 81.2 years (-20 weeks), and male LE from 77.6 years to 77.2 years (-23 weeks). Cuts to benefits and tax credits were modelled to have the most detrimental impact on LE, and these were estimated to be most severe in the most deprived areas. The modelled impact on inequalities in LE was widening of the gap between the most and least deprived 20% of areas by a further 21 weeks for females and 23 weeks for males.

Access and adherence to government guidelines was an issue for many due to language and digital barriers. Reinforcement from trusted community and religious leaders encouraged adherence. Points of support such as food banks were vital in ensuring essential supplies during the pandemic. Many could not afford or have access to masks and sanitisers. CONCLUSION: The study highlights the perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ethnic minority communities. Government agencies and public health agencies need to integrate with the community, and community leaders can enable dissemination of key messages to deliver targeted yet sensitive public health advice which incorporates cultural and religious practices. Addressing the root causes of disparities is imperative to mitigate current and future pandemics.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on ethnic minority communities: a qualitative study on the perspectives of ethnic minority community leaders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The use of a remote specimen collection strategy employing a kit designed for unobserved self-collection for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR can decrease the use of PPE and exposure risk. To assess the impact of unobserved specimen self-collection on test performance, we examined results from a SARS-CoV-2 qualitative RT-PCR test for self-collected specimens from participants in a return-to-work screening program and assessed the impact of a pooled testing strategy in this cohort. METHODS: Self-collected anterior nasal swabs from employee return to work programs were tested using the Quest Diagnostics SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR EUA. The Ct values for the N1 and N3 N-gene targets and a human RNase P (RP) gene control target were tabulated. For comparison, we utilized Ct values from a cohort of HCP-collected specimens from patients with and without COVID-19 symptoms. RESULTS: Among 47,923 participants, 1.8% were positive. RP failed to amplify for 13/115,435 (0.011%) specimens. The median (IQR) Cts were 32.7 (25.0-35.7) for N1 and 31.3 (23.8-34.2) for N3. Median Ct values in the self-collected cohort were significantly higher than those of symptomatic, but not asymptomatic patients. Based on Ct values, pooled testing with 4 specimens would have yielded inconclusive results in 67/1,268 (5.2%) specimens but only a single false-negative result. CONCLUSIONS: Unobserved self-collection of nasal swabs provides adequate sampling for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing. These findings alleviate concerns of increased false negatives in this context. Specimen pooling could be used for this population as the likelihood of false negative results is very low due when using a sensitive, dual-target methodology.","output":"Performance of Unobserved Self-Collected Nasal Swabs for Detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR Utilizing a Remote Specimen Collection Strategy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 31-year-old male with no comorbidities presented with chest discomfort and shortness of breath following SARS-CoV-2 infection Primary viral myocarditis was confirmed with the aid of cardiac biomarkers and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging Herein, we detail his clinical presentation, management and highlight the role of CMR in viral myocarditis","output":"Focal myocarditis in a young male with SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Crisis management in the context of public institutions is particularly important, due to the extremely large possible impact of the consequences of systemic crises on society as a whole.

Materials and method A test-negative case-control study was conducted. Variables related to personal and vaccination history were considered. Although the epidemiological definition of the case varied over time, the reference definition was that corresponding to 31/01/2020 in Spain. A bivariate and multivariate analysis was performed. Results The sample included 188 patients, of which 63 were cases and 125 controls. The results show that obesity increases the risk 2.4-fold of suffering this infection (IC 95% 1,301C4,521) and ARA-2 increases it 2.2-fold (95% CI 1,256C6,982). On the other hand, anti-pneumococcal vaccination of 13 serotypes showed results close to statistical significance (OR = 0.4; 95% CI 0.170C1,006).

We know that other than its uses as disinfectant, well documented by the literature since the beginning of the past century, the more recent medical use of ozone in several pathologies as described by the international literature is still poor investigated. Furthermore, following its clinical uses with excellent clinical responses on several heterogeneous diseases and pain, it is now clear that the biological activity of this gas is mediated by graded responses to the mild oxidative stress induced after its application. Thus, the ancestral environment of our cells, whose energy production is strictly bind to oxygen burn, may be mediated by common defenses probably linked to the ubiquitous signaling pathway mediated by Nrf2. Moreover, after the first description of the oxidative stress in the 1970s and the discovery of Nrf2 as transcription factor in 1994, we could observe a rapid growth of the literatures regarding its function as master regulator of a myriad of cellular processes and its association to a multiple pattern of diseases including aging.

Currently, there are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs to treat COVID-19. In the absence of effective treatment, off-label drug use, in lieu of evidence from published randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials, is common in COVID-19. Although it is vital to treat affected patients with antiviral drugs, there is a knowledge gap regarding the use of anti-inflammatory drugs in these patients. Recent Findings: Colchicine trials to combat inflammation in COVID-19 patients have not received much attention. We await the results of ongoing colchicine randomized controlled trials in COVID-19, evaluating colchicine's efficacy in treating COVID-19. Summary: This review gives a spotlight on colchicine's anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties and why colchicine may help fight COVID-19. This review summarizes colchicine's mechanism of action via the tubulin-colchicine complex. Furthermore, it discussed how colchicine interferes with several inflammatory pathways, including inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis, adhesion, and mobilization; disruption of superoxide production, inflammasome inhibition, and tumor necrosis factor reduction; and its possible antiviral properties. In addition, colchicine dosing and pharmacokinetics, as well as drug interactions and how they relate to ongoing, colchicine in COVID-19 clinical trials, are examined.","output":"Colchicine in COVID-19: an Old Drug, New Use"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM To identify strategies that increase hospital bed capacity, material resources, and available nurse staffing during a national pandemic. BACKGROUND The COVID-19 outbreak resulted in an influx of acutely ill patients requiring critical care. The volume and acuity of this patient population increased the demand for care and stretched hospitals beyond their capacity. While increasing hospital bed capacity and material resources are crucial, healthcare systems have noted one of the greatest limitations to rapid expansion has been the number of available medical personnel, particularly those trained in emergency and critical care nursing. EVALUATION Program evaluation occurred on a daily basis with hospital throughput, focusing on logistics including our ability to expand bed volume, resource utilization, and the ability to meet staffing needs. CONCLUSION This article describes how a quaternary care hospital in New York City prepared for the COVID-19 surge in patients by maximizing and shifting nursing resources to its most impacted services, the emergency department (ED) and the intensive care units (ICUs). A tier-based staffing model and rapid training were operationalized to address nurse-staffing shortages in the ICU and ED, identifying key factors for swift deployment.

It requires a rigorous methodology. We have developed a model for COVID-19 that can be verified and then adapted to future pandemics by defining those elements of the model that are constant and those that will need to be modified for a new epidemic.A piloting exercise in respect of 17 countries and their performance during the second half of 2020 allows for a set of comparative observations.

In addition to vaccination and antibiotics, immune regulation through microbial intervention has emerged in recent anti-SP infection research. This study investigated the therapeutic effect of a combination of live Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, and Bacillus (CBLEB), a widely used probiotic drug, on SP infection in rats. METHODS: An immunocompromised SP-infection rat model was established by intraperitoneal injection of cyclophosphamide and nasal administration of SP strain ATCC49619. Samples from SP-infected, SP-infected and CBLEB-treated, and healthy rats were collected to determine blood indicators, serum cytokines, gut microbiota, faecal and serum metabolomes, lung- and colon-gene transcriptions, and histopathological features. RESULTS: CBLEB treatment alleviated weight loss, inflammation, organ damage, increase in basophil percentage, red cell distribution width, and RANTES levels and decrease in total protein and albumin levels of immunocompromised SP-infection rats. Furthermore, CBLEB treatment alleviated dysbiosis in gut microbiota, including altered microbial composition and the aberrant abundance of opportunistic pathogenic bacterial taxa such as Eggerthellaceae, and disorders in gut and serum metabolism, including altered metabolomic profiles and differentially enriched metabolites such as 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol in faeces and L-tyrosine in serum. The transcriptome analysis results indicated that the underlying mechanism by which CBLEB fights SP infection is mainly attributed to its regulation of immune-related pathways such as TLR and NLR signalling in the lungs and infection-, inflammation- or metabolism-related pathways such as TCR signalling in the colon.

Mean differences and relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were aggregated using random effects models. RESULTS: Eight retrospective cohort studies and one cohort prospective cohort study with data on of 4,920 patients with COVID\\\\19 were eligible. Comparing BMI  25 vs <25 kg/m(2), the RRs (95% CIs) of severe illness and mortality were 2.35 (1.43\\\\3.86) and 3.52 (1.32\\\\9.42), respectively. In a pooled analysis of three studies, the RR (95% CI) of severe illness comparing BMI > 35 vs <25 kg/m(2) was 7.04 (2.72\\\\18.20).

METHODOLOGY: This was a retrospective chart review of patients who were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus by Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing. Data extracted from patients' case files included patient demographics, presenting symptoms, provisional diagnoses, and outcomes of hospitalisation. Descriptive variables were summarized; proportions were compared using Chi-square tests, and independent predictors of mortality were assessed using multivariate regression analysis. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: There were a total of 61 patients with positive RT-PCR testing: mean age  SD (minimum - maximum) was 53.0  18.5 (5 months - 90) years.

Rurality is an important determinant of health that may influence receipt of evidence-based alcohol-related care. In a large, national sample of Veterans Health Administration (VA) patients with AUD with documented and non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, or non-Hispanic White race/ethnicity, we examine whether meeting national Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) quality measures for specialty addictions care and receiving evidence-based medications for AUD differs across patients living in urban, large rural, and small rural areas. Methods: VA electronic health record data were used to identify all patients with AUD documented in Fiscal Year 2012. Rurality was measured using a three-category rural and urban commuting area (RUCA) classification linked to patient zip code. Logistic regression models with clustered standard errors-iteratively adjusted for hypothesized confounders-were used to estimate the likelihood and marginal probabilities of receiving care for patients living in small and large rural areas, relative to urban areas. Primary outcomes included HEDIS initiation (any visit within 14 days of initial AUD visit after a 60-day period of no treatment), HEDIS engagement (2 or more AUD visits within 30 days of HEDIS initiation visit) and having any filled prescription for AUD medications (naltrexone, disulfiram, acamprosate, or topiramate). Results: For all outcomes, patients living in large and small rural areas had a lower likelihood of receiving evidence-based AUD treatment than patients living in urban areas (all p-values < 0.05); differences in marginal probabilities across groups were relatively small. Conclusions: In this national sample of VA patients with AUD, those living in more rural areas were less likely to receive evidence-based treatment for AUD than those living in urban areas.

The proposed respiratory-space clustering can separate echoes, even when people are located close to each other. In addition, the proposed method can be applied when the number of targets is unknown and can accurately estimate the number and positions of people. We perform multiple experiments involving five or seven participants to verify the performance of the proposed method, and quantitatively evaluate the estimation accuracy for the number of people and the respiratory intervals. The experimental results show that the average root-mean-square error in estimating the respiratory interval is 196 ms using the proposed method.

In collaboration with a multi-disciplinary team in Kenya, we aimed to establish the first evidence-based guidelines for the management of routine procedure-related neonatal pain that consider low-resource hospital settings. METHODS We did a systematic review by searching MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and CENTRAL databases for studies published from Jan 1, 1953, to March 31, 2019. We included data from randomised controlled trials using heart rate, oxygen saturation (SpO2), premature infant pain profile (PIPP) score, neonatal infant pain scale (NIPS) score, neonatal facial coding system score, and douleur aigu? du nouveau-n scale score as pain outcome measures. We excluded studies in which neonates were undergoing circumcision or were intubated, studies from which data were unextractable, or when pain was scored by non-trained individuals. We did a narrative synthesis of all studies, and meta-analysis when data were available from multiple studies comparing the same analgesics and controls and using the same outcome measures. 17 Kenyan health-care professionals formed our clinical guideline development panel, and we used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework and the panel's knowledge of the local health-care context to guide the guideline development process.

We found a moderate level of certainty for the superiority for expressed breastmilk over placebo or no intervention (SMDs were -046 [95% CI -087 to -005] in heart rate and 048 [020 to 075] in SpO2). Therefore, the panel recommended that breastfeeding should be given as first-line analgesic treatment, initiated at least 2 min pre-procedure. Given contextual factors, for neonates who are unable to breastfeed, 1-2 mL of expressed breastmilk should be given as first-line analgesic, or 1-2 mL of oral sugar (10% concentration) as second-line analgesic. The panel also recommended parental presence during procedures with adjunctive provision of skin-to-skin care, or non-nutritive sucking when possible. INTERPRETATION We have generated Kenya's first neonatal analgesic guidelines for routine procedures, which have been adopted by the Kenyan Ministry of Health, and have shown a framework for clinical guideline development that is applicable to other low-income and middle-income health-care settings.

There are both empirical and normative questions at stake here. The empirical questions pertain to the available level of evidence that healthcare professionals would rather not be left alone with their 'clinical judgments' to make triage decisions, and to the accounts of distributive justice that doctors and healthcare professionals rely on, when making triage decisions. The normative questions pertain to how this empirical evidence should inform guidelines on how prioritisation decisions are made in a context of emergency, and who gets to have the authority to do so.

Increasing odds of in-hospital death is associated with older age following COVID-19 infection. Importantly, it seems older patients with comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), in particular IHD, diabetes and hypertension, are at the highest risk of mortality following COVID-19 infection. The evidence is sparse on the optimal care of older patients with ACS with lack of robust randomised controlled trials. In this setting, with the serious threat imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic in the context of rapidly evolving knowledge with much unknown, it is important to weigh the risks and benefits of treatment strategies offered to older patients. In cases where risks outweigh the benefits, it might not be an unreasonable option to treat such patients with a conservative or a palliative approach. Further evidence to elucidate whether invasive management is beneficial in older patients with ACS is required out-with the COVID-19 pandemic.

The aim of the present study was to compare the soft tissue biocompatibility of MgCa0.8 and commonly used surgical steel in vivo. METHODS A biodegradable magnesium calcium alloy (MgCa0.8) and surgical steel (S316L), as a control, were investigated. Screws of identical geometrical conformation were implanted into the tibiae of 40 rabbits for a postoperative follow up of two, four, six and eight weeks. The tibialis cranialis muscle was in direct vicinity of the screw head and thus embedded in paraffin and histologically and immunohistochemically assessed. Haematoxylin and eosin staining was performed to identify macrophages, giant cells and heterophil granulocytes as well as the extent of tissue fibrosis and necrosis. Mouse anti-CD79 and rat anti-CD3 monoclonal primary antibodies were used for B- and T-lymphocyte detection. Evaluation of all sections was performed by applying a semi-quantitative score. RESULTS Clinically, both implant materials were tolerated well. Histology revealed that a layer of fibrous tissue had formed between implant and overlying muscle in MgCa0.8 and S316L, which was demarcated by a layer of synoviocyte-like cells at its interface to the implant. In MgCa0.8 implants cavities were detected within the fibrous tissue, which were surrounded by the same kind of cell type. The thickness of the fibrous layer and the amount of tissue necrosis and cellular infiltrations gradually decreased in S316L. In contrast, a decrease could only be noted in the first weeks of implantation in MgCa0.8, whereas parameters were increasing again at the end of the observation period. B-lymphocytes were found more often in MgCa0.8 indicating humoral immunity and the presence of soluble antigens. Conversely, S316L displayed a higher quantity of T-lymphocytes. CONCLUSIONS Moderate inflammation was detected in both implant materials and resolved to a minimum during the first weeks indicating comparable biocompatibility for MgCa0.8 and S316L. Thus, the application of MgCa0.8 as biodegradable implant material seems conceivable. Since the inflammatory parameters were re-increasing at the end of the observation period in MgCa0.8 it is important to observe the development of inflammation over a longer time period in addition to the present study.","output":"Evaluation of the soft tissue biocompatibility of MgCa0.8 and surgical steel 316L in vivo: a comparative study in rabbits."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Steen Ethelberg and his colleagues at the State Serum Institute in Copenhagen mined data from polymerase chain reaction tests, which are the gold-standard method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection, conducted in Denmark (C H Hansen et al FORMER SENATOR WILL LEAD NASA US President Joe Biden has appointed Bill Nelson, a former Democratic senator from Florida, as the new head of NASA Nelson is a strong supporter of conventional space-flight programmes, including the Space Launch System (SLS), NASA's long-delayed effort to build a heavy-lift rocket to carry astronauts beyond Earth orbit","output":"News in brief"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) can cause various extraintestinal infections in poultry, resulting in massive economic losses in poultry industry. In addition, some avian E. coli strains may have zoonotic potential, making poultry a possible source of infection for humans. Due to its extreme genetic diversity, this pathotype remains poorly defined. This study aimed to investigate the diversity of colibacillosis-associated E. coli isolates from Central European countries with a focus on the Czech Republic. RESULTS: Of 95 clinical isolates subjected to preliminary characterization, 32 were selected for whole-genome sequencing. A multi resistant phenotype was detected in a majority of the sequenced strains with the predominant resistance to -lactams and quinolones being associated with TEM-type beta-lactamase genes and chromosomal gyrA mutations respectively. The phylogenetic analysis confirmed a great diversity of isolates, that were derived from nearly all phylogenetic groups, with predominace of B2, B1 and C phylogroups. Clusters of closely related isolates within ST23 (phylogroup C) and ST429 (phylogroup B2) indicated a possible local spread of these clones. Besides, the ST429 cluster carried bla(CMY-2, ? 59) genes for AmpC beta-lactamase and isolates of both clusters were generally well-equipped with virulence-associated genes, with considerable differences in distribution of certain virulence-associated genes between phylogenetically distant lineages. Other important and potentially zoonotic APEC STs were detected, incl. ST117, ST354 and ST95, showing several molecular features typical for human ExPEC. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the concept of local spread of virulent APEC clones, as well as of zoonotic potential of specific poultry-associated lineages, and highlight the need to investigate the possible source of these pathogenic strains.","output":"Genomic analysis of Escherichia coli strains isolated from diseased chicken in the Czech Republic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Carbohydrate arrays are a new technology developed for high-throughput evaluation of interactions between carbohydrates and proteins, cells or viruses.

The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is targeting the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and mostly causes a respiratory illness. Although acquired and resistance immunity is one of the most important aspects of alleviating the trend of the current pandemic; however, there is still a big gap of knowledge regarding the infection process, immunopathogenesis, recovery, and reinfection. AIM OF REVIEW: To answer the questions regarding the potential and probability of reinfection in COVID-19 infected cases or the efficiency and duration of SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced immunity against reinfection we critically evaluated the current reports on SARS-CoV-2 immunity and reinfection with special emphasis on comparative studies using animal models that generalize their finding about protection and reinfection. Also, the contribution of humoral immunity in the process of COVID-19 recovery and the role of ACE2 in virus infectivity and pathogenesis has been discussed. Furthermore, innate and cellular immunity and inflammatory responses in the disease and recovery conditions are reviewed and an overall outline of immunologic aspects of COVID-19 progression and recovery in three different stages are presented. Finally, we categorized the infected cases into four different groups based on the acquired immunity and the potential for reinfection. KEY SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS OF REVIEW: In this review paper, we proposed a new strategy to predict the potential of reinfection in each identified category. This classification may help to distribute resources more meticulously to determine: who needs to be serologically tested for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, what percentage of the population is immune to the virus, and who needs to be vaccinated.","output":"Recovery scenario and immunity in COVID-19 disease: A new strategy to predict the potential of reinfection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the second pandemic of the twenty-first century, with over one-hundred million infections and over two million deaths to date. It is a novel strain from the Coronaviridae family, named Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2); the 7th known member of the coronavirus family to cause disease in humans, notably following the Middle East Respiratory syndrome (MERS), and Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (SARS). The most characteristic feature of this single-stranded RNA molecule includes the spike glycoprotein on its surface. Most patients with COVID-19, of which the elderly and immunocompromised are most at risk, complain of flu-like symptoms, including dry cough and headache. The most common complications include pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and cardiovascular manifestations. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is mainly via respiratory droplets, either directly from the air when an infected patient coughs or sneezes, or in the form of fomites on surfaces. Maintaining hand-hygiene, social distancing, and personal protective equipment (i.e., masks) remain the most effective precautions. Patient management includes supportive care and anticoagulative measures, with a focus on maintaining respiratory function. Therapy with dexamethasone, remdesivir, and tocilizumab appear to be most promising to date, with hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, ritonavir, and interferons falling out of favour. Additionally, accelerated vaccination efforts have taken place internationally, with several promising vaccinations being mass deployed. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, countries and stakeholders have taken varying precautions to combat and contain the spread of the virus and dampen its collateral economic damage.

AM technologies apply a diversity of feedstocks, including plastic, metallic, and ceramic particle powders with distinct size, shape, and surface chemistry. In addition, powders are often reused, which may change the particles physicochemical properties and by that alter their toxic potential. The AM production technology commonly relies on a laser or electron beam to selectively melt or sinter particle powders. Large energy input on feedstock powders generates several byproducts, including varying amounts of virgin microparticles, nanoparticles, spatter, and volatile chemicals that are emitted in the working environment; throughout the production and processing phases. The micro and nanoscale size may enable particles to interact with and to cross biological barriers, which could, in turn, give rise to unexpected adverse outcomes, including inflammation, oxidative stress, activation of signaling pathways, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity. Another important aspect of AM-associated risks is emission/leakage of mono- and oligomers due to polymer breakdown and high temperature transformation of chemicals from polymeric particles, both during production, use, and in vivo, including in target cells. These chemicals are potential inducers of direct toxicity, genotoxicity, and endocrine disruption. Nevertheless, understanding whether AM particle powders and their byproducts may exert adverse effects in humans is largely lacking and urges comprehensive safety assessment across the entire AM lifecyclespanning from virgin and reused to airborne particles. Therefore, this review will detail: 1) brief overview of the AM feedstock powders, impact of reuse on particle physicochemical properties, main exposure pathways and protective measures in AM industry, 2) role of particle biological identity and key toxicological endpoints in the particle safety assessment, and 3) next-generation toxicology approaches in nanosafety for safety assessment in AM. Altogether, the proposed testing approach will enable a deeper understanding of existing and emerging particle and chemical safety challenges and provide a strategy for the development of cutting-edge methodologies for hazard identification and risk assessment in the AM industry.","output":"Particle Safety Assessment in Additive Manufacturing: From Exposure Risks to Advanced Toxicology Testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Investigators in China and the US have described an association between odd of Sars-CoV-2 infection and ABO blood groups, results converging to a higher rate of infection among type A and lower in type O subjects These data were reinforced by an elegant study that employed a genome-wide association approach, and identified a region on chromosome 9 with frequency misbalance between severe Covid-19 patients and healthy blood donors, corresponding to the ABO locus Authors went further in showing that the SNPs leading to the A blood group phenotype were more frequent in patients while the O blood group was rarer, the opposite seen among blood donors, both cohorts from Italy and Spain Objective: To evaluate the frequency of ABO blood groups among patients submitted to Covid-19 testing at Dasa laboratories Methods: Up to June 22nd 2020, 196,897 and 256,471 qPCR and serological tests respectively were performed at Dasa Patients tested in parallel for ABO blood groups were identified (n = 6,457) qPCR C Samples were collected by nasopharynx and oropharynx swabbing and further transported in 3 mL saline RNA was extracted on the QIASYmphony automated platform and 5 L of eluate was directly added to a RT-PCR mixture containing primers and probe targeting the viral envelope gene in addition to RNAseP as a cellular control Serology C Blood was drawn and transported to Dasa central lab where the following commercial kits were used: Euroimmun IgA/IgG EIA or Maglumi IgG/IgM CLIA ABO typing C Phenotyping was performed by hemagglutination on the Wadiana automated system Statistical analysis C The Chi-square test was used to estimate if the proportion of individuals infected differed significantly between blood group types Results: Among all patients submitted to Sars-CoV-2 testing, we identified 6,457 that had a concomitant ABO blood group typing result, being 4,353 tested by qPCR and 2,275 tested for COVID-19 antibodies, while 171 did both We also retrieved historical ABO blood group typing data from our records, representing 1,813,237 patients Approximately 30% of all patients have one or more laboratory markers indicating previous or current SARS-CoV-2 infection, irrespective of the blood group Additional analysis was performed restricting to A and O blood group types, as these were previously implicated in susceptibility and protection to SARS-CoV-2 infection There was not a statistically significant difference between these groups, as well as for the other blood groups Discussion Though we did observe a small trend for a higher frequency of type A subjects and a lower of type O among confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, our data failed to reproduce the skewed frequency of ABO blood group types reported on the Chinese and American populations The strength of our work is the large number of COVID-19 suspects evaluated We have limited access to clinical records so we didnt attempt to correlate ABO blood groups and disease severity Further studies are necessary to elucidate whether blood groups indeed modulate the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and, if proven, clarify the mechanisms leading to this differential response","output":"Lack of Association between Abo Blood Groups and Susceptibility to Sars-cov-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the result of an infection with the new virus, SARS-CoV-2, is rapidly spreading worldwide.

Brown Norway rats were sensitized to ovalbumin and challenged three times to evoke airway remodelling. The effect of poly I:C on the ovalbumin-induced airway inflammation and structural changes was assessed from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and histological findings. The expression of cytokines and chemokines was evaluated by real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR and ELISA. Ovalbumin-challenged animals showed an increased number of total cells and eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid compared with PBS-challenged controls. Ovalbumin-challenged animals treated with poly I:C showed an increased number of total cells and neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid compared with those without poly I:C treatment. Ovalbumin-challenged animals showed goblet cell hyperplasia, increased airway smooth muscle mass, and proliferation of both airway epithelial cells and airway smooth muscle cells. Treatment with poly I:C enhanced these structural changes. Among the cytokines and chemokines examined, the expression of interleukins 12 and 17 and of transforming growth factor-(1) in ovalbumin-challenged animals treated with poly I:C was significantly increased compared with those of the other groups.

Several regions managed to handle the pandemic more successfully than others in terms of life loss, while ongoing heated debates as to the right course of action for battling COVID-19 have divided the academic community as well as public opinion. To this direction, in this paper, an autoregressive COVID-19 prediction model with heterogeneous explanatory variables for Greece is proposed, taking past COVID-19 data, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), and Google query data as independent variables, from the day of the first confirmed caseFebruary 26thto the day before the announcement for the quarantine measures softeningApril 24th. The analysis indicates that the early measures taken by the Greek officials positively affected the flattening of the epidemic curve, with Greece having recorded significantly decreased COVID-19 casualties per million population and managing to stay on the low side of the deaths over cases spectrum. In specific, the prediction model identifies the 7-day lag that is needed in order for the measures results to actually show, i.e., the optimal time-intervention framework for managing the diseases spread, while our analysis also indicates an appropriate point during the disease spread where restrictive measures should be applied. Present results have significant implications for effective policy making and in the designing of the NPIs, as the second wave of COVID-19 is expected in fall 2020, and such multidisciplinary analyses are crucial in order to understand the evolution of the Daily Deaths to Daily Cases ratio along with its determinants as soon as possible, for the assessment of the respective domestic health authorities policy interventions as well as for the timely health resources allocation.","output":"Exploring the role of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in flattening the Greek COVID-19 epidemic curve"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Quasispecies theory is providing a solid, evolving conceptual framework for insights into virus population dynamics, adaptive potential, and response to lethal mutagenesis. The complexity of mutant spectra can influence disease progression and viral pathogenesis, as demonstrated using virus variants selected for increased replicative fidelity. Complementation and interference exerted among components of a viral quasispecies can either reinforce or limit the replicative capacity and disease potential of the ensemble. In particular, a progressive enrichment of a replicating mutant spectrum with interfering mutant genomes prompted by enhanced mutagenesis may be a key event in the sharp transition of virus populations into error catastrophe that leads to virus extinction. Fitness variations are influenced by the passage regimes to which viral populations are subjected, notably average fitness decreases upon repeated bottleneck events and fitness gains upon competitive optimization of large viral populations. Evolving viral quasispecies respond to selective constraints by replication of subpopulations of variant genomes that display higher fitness than the parental population in the presence of the selective constraint. This has been profusely documented with fitness effects of mutations associated with resistance of pathogenic viruses to antiviral agents. In particular, selection of HIV-1 mutants resistant to one or multiple antiretroviral inhibitors, and the compensatory effect of mutations in the same genome, offers a compendium of the molecular intricacies that a virus can exploit for its survival.

It's of utmost importance to diagnose COVID-19 in Infected patients at the earliest, to avoid further complications. RT-PCR, the gold standard method is routinely used for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. Yet, this method comes along with few limitations such as its time-consuming nature, a scarcity of trained manpower, sophisticated laboratory equipment and the possibility of false positive and negative results. Physicians and global health care centers use CT scan as an alternate for the diagnosis of COVID-19. But this process of detection too, might demand more manual work, effort and time. Thus, automating the detection of COVID-19 using an intelligent system has been a recent research topic, in the view of pandemic. This will also help in saving the physician's time for carrying out further treatment. In this paper, a hybrid learning model has been proposed to identify the COVID-19 infection using CT scan images.

In February 2013, a kidney recipient with no reported exposures to potentially rabid animals died from rabies 18 months after transplantation. OBJECTIVES To investigate whether organ transplantation was the source of rabies virus exposure in the kidney recipient, and to evaluate for and prevent rabies in other transplant recipients from the same donor. DESIGN Organ donor and all transplant recipient medical records were reviewed. Laboratory tests to detect rabies virus-specific binding antibodies, rabies virus neutralizing antibodies, and rabies virus antigens were conducted on available specimens, including serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and tissues from the donor and the recipients. Viral ribonucleic acid was extracted from tissues and amplified for nucleoprotein gene sequencing for phylogenetic comparisons. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Determination of whether the donor died from undiagnosed rabies and whether other organ recipients developed rabies. RESULTS In retrospect, the donor's clinical presentation (which began with vomiting and upper extremity paresthesias and progressed to fever, seizures, dysphagia, autonomic dysfunction, and brain death) was consistent with rabies. Rabies virus antigen was detected in archived autopsy brain tissue collected from the donor. The rabies viruses infecting the donor and the deceased kidney recipient were consistent with the raccoon rabies virus variant and were more than 99.9% identical across the entire N gene (1349/1350 nucleotides), thus confirming organ transplantation as the route of transmission. The 3 other organ recipients remained asymptomatic, with rabies virus neutralizing antibodies detected in their serum after completion of postexposure prophylaxis (range, 0.3-40.8 IU/mL). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Unlike the 2 previous clusters of rabies virus transmission through solid organ transplantation, there was a long incubation period in the recipient who developed rabies, and survival of 3 other recipients without pretransplant rabies vaccination. Rabies should be considered in patients with acute progressive encephalitis of unexplained etiology, especially for potential organ donors. A standard evaluation of potential donors who meet screening criteria for infectious encephalitis should be considered, and risks and benefits for recipients of organs from these donors should be evaluated.","output":"Raccoon rabies virus variant transmission through solid organ transplantation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Olfactory disorders are one of the characteristic symptoms of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), which causes infection and inflammation of the upper and lower respiratory tract.

We treated five patients with mild COVID-19 at an isolation facility using Kampo medicine, depending on their symptoms. Patients with the olfactory disorder presented with a blocked nose, nasal discharge or taste impairment. Physical examination using Kampo medicine showed similar findings, such as a red tongue with red spots and sublingual vein congestion, which presented as blood stasis and inflammation;thus, we prescribed the Kampo medicine, kakkontokasenkyushin'i.

During recent decades, climate change has become a severe issue globally. To our understanding, the impact of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) on CO(2) emissions has not been thoroughly studied in the environment-energy literature. To overcome this research gap, this study explores the link between EPU, CO(2) emissions, foreign direct investment (FDI), and renewable energy for the panel of four East Asian economies, namely, China, Japan, South Korea, and Singapore, from 1997 to 2020. We used second-generation econometric estimations to confirm cross-sectional dependence, cointegration, and stationarity among the selected variables. This study finds that economic policy uncertanity (EPU), trade, and GDP have a positive correlation with carbon emissions. However, FDI and renewable energy consumption boost the quality of the environment of East Asian economies. The outcomes of the DumitrescuCHurlin panel causality estimation revealed two-way association between CO(2) and economic policy uncertainty, CO(2) and energy consumption, CO(2) and economic growth, and CO(2) and trade. Afterward, we use the FMOLS estimations for robustness check. Based on the inclusive outcomes, we draw substantial suggestions for decision-makers and urge them to consider the potential negative effects of EPU on CO(2) emissions policies. In addition to this, if policymakers seek to simultaneously control EPU and CO(2) emissions, they should work out for alternate ways such as the use of green technology related to energy, foreign capital investment, and renewable energy consumption to mitigate CO(2) emissions.","output":"The impact of economic policy uncertainty on carbon emissions: evaluating the role of foreign capital investment and renewable energy in East Asian economies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Efficient strategies for testing large numbers of patients must be developed to limit the spread of COVID-19.

In this study, we use a hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate the age-specific COVID-19 attributable deaths over time in the United States. The model is specified by a novel non-parametric spatial approach, a low-rank Gaussian Process (GP) projected by regularised B-splines. We show that this projection defines a new GP with attractive smoothness and computational efficiency properties, derive its kernel function, and discuss the penalty terms induced by the projected GP. Simulation analyses and benchmark results show that the spatial approach performs better than standard B-splines and Bayesian P-splines and equivalently well as a standard GP, for considerably lower runtimes. The B-splines projected GP priors that we develop are likely an appealing addition to the arsenal of Bayesian regularising priors. We apply the model to weekly, age-stratified COVID-19 attributable deaths reported by the US Centers for Disease Control, which are subject to censoring and reporting biases. Using the B-splines projected GP, we can estimate longitudinal trends in COVID-19 associated deaths across the US by 1-year age bands. These estimates are instrumental to calculate age-specific mortality rates, describe variation in age-specific deaths across the US, and for fitting epidemic models. Here, we couple the model with age-specific vaccination rates to show that lower vaccination rates in younger adults aged 18-64 are associated with significantly stronger resurgences in COVID-19 deaths, especially in Florida and Texas. These results underscore the critical importance of medically able individuals of all ages to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in order to limit fatal outcomes.","output":"Regularised B-splines projected Gaussian Process priors to estimate time-trends of age-specific COVID-19 deaths related to vaccine roll-out (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The main purpose and research question of the study are to compare the efficacy of high-security closed versus open devices for human oocytes' vitrification. METHODS: A prospective randomized study was conducted. A total of 737 patients attending the Infertility and IVF Unit at S.Orsola University Hospital (Italy) between October 2015 and April 2020 were randomly assigned to two groups. A total of 368 patients were assigned to group 1 (High-Security Vitrification&#8482; - HSV) and 369 to group 2 (Cryotop? open system). Oocyte survival, fertilization, cleavage, pregnancy, implantation, and miscarriage rate were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were observed on survival rate (70.3% vs. 73.3%), fertilization rate (70.8% vs. 74.9%), cleavage rate (90.6% vs. 90.3%), pregnancy/transfer ratio (32.0% vs. 31.8%), implantation rate (19.7% vs. 19.9%), nor miscarriage rates (22.1% vs. 21.5%) between the two groups.

We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of azithromycin in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. METHODS: In this randomised, controlled, open-label, adaptive platform trial (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy [RECOVERY]), several possible treatments were compared with usual care in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 in the UK. The trial is underway at 176 hospitals in the UK. Eligible and consenting patients were randomly allocated to either usual standard of care alone or usual standard of care plus azithromycin 500 mg once per day by mouth or intravenously for 10 days or until discharge (or allocation to one of the other RECOVERY treatment groups). Patients were assigned via web-based simple (unstratified) randomisation with allocation concealment and were twice as likely to be randomly assigned to usual care than to any of the active treatment groups. Participants and local study staff were not masked to the allocated treatment, but all others involved in the trial were masked to the outcome data during the trial. The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. The trial is registered with ISRCTN, 50189673, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04381936. FINDINGS: Between April 7 and Nov 27, 2020, of 16 442 patients enrolled in the RECOVERY trial, 9433 (57%) were eligible and 7763 were included in the assessment of azithromycin. The mean age of these study participants was 653 years (SD 157) and approximately a third were women (2944 [38%] of 7763). 2582 patients were randomly allocated to receive azithromycin and 5181 patients were randomly allocated to usual care alone. Overall, 561 (22%) patients allocated to azithromycin and 1162 (22%) patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio 097, 95% CI 087C107; p=050). No significant difference was seen in duration of hospital stay (median 10 days [IQR 5 to >28] vs 11 days [5 to >28]) or the proportion of patients discharged from hospital alive within 28 days (rate ratio 104, 95% CI 098C110; p=019).

The orthopaedic and trauma units have rescheduled their activities to help SARS-CoV-2 units, but trauma patients require also treatment, and no standardized protocols have been established. METHODS: A single-centre cross-sectional study was performed in a tertiary hospital. Two different periods of time were analyzed: a two week period of time in March 2019 (pre-SARS-CoV-2) and the same period in March 2020 (SARS-CoV-2 pandemic time). Outpatient's data, emergency activity, surgical procedures, and admissions were evaluated. Surgeons' and patient's opinion was also evaluated using a survey. RESULTS: A total of ~ 16k (15,953) patients were evaluated. Scheduled clinical appointments decreased by ~ 22%. Urgent consultations and discharge from clinics also descended (~ 37% and ~ 20% respectively). Telemedicine was used in 90% of outpatient clinical evaluations. No elective surgical procedures during SARS-CoV-2 time were scheduled, and subtracting the effect of elective surgeries, there was a reduction of inpatient surgeries, from ~ 85% to ~ 59%. Patients delayed trauma assistance more than 48 hours in 13 cases (35%). Pre-operative admission for hip fractures decreased in ten hours on average. Finally, surveys stated that patients were more in favour than surgeons were to this new way to evaluate orthopaedic and trauma patients based strongly on telemedicine. CONCLUSION: Detailed protocols should be standardized for surgical departments during the pandemic.

The objective of the study was to assess changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and mental health in children and adolescents and to identify the associated risk and resource factors during the pandemic. METHODS: A nationwide longitudinal survey was conducted with two waves during the pandemic (May/June 2020 and December 2020/January 2021). In total, n = 1923 children and adolescents aged 7 to 17 years and their parents participated (retention rate from wave 1 to wave 2: 85%). The self-report and parent-proxy surveys assessed HRQoL (KIDSCREEN-10), mental health problems (SDQ with the subscales emotional problems, conduct problems, hyperactivity, and peer problems), anxiety (SCARED), depressive symptoms (CES-DC, PHQ-2) and psychosomatic complaints (HBSC-SCL). Mixed model panel regression analyses were conducted to examine longitudinal changes in mental health and to identify risk and resource factors. RESULTS: The HRQoL of children and adolescents decreased during the pandemic, and emotional problems, peer-related mental health problems, anxiety, depressive and psychosomatic symptoms increased over time, however the change in global mental health problems from wave 1 to wave 2 was not significant, and some changes were negligible. Socially disadvantaged children and children of mentally burdened parents were at particular risk of impaired mental health, while female gender and older age were associated with fewer mental health problems. A positive family climate and social support supported the mental health of children and adolescents during the pandemic. DISCUSSION: Health promotion, prevention and intervention strategies could support children and adolescents in coping with the pandemic and protect and maintain their mental health.

However, managing anticoagulation is one of the most challenging aspects of care in patients requiring mechanical circulatory support. Effective anticoagulation is even more difficult in pediatric patients due to the smaller size of their blood vessels, increased turbulent flow, and developmental hemostasis. Recently, viscoelastic testing (VET) has been used as a qualitative measure of anticoagulation efficacy in patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and ventricular assist devices (VAD). Thromboelastography (TEG?) and thromboelastometry (ROTEM?) provide a global qualitative assessment of hemostatic function from initiation of clot formation with the platelet-fibrin interaction, platelet aggregation, clot strength, and clot lysis.

The common cold (CC) is usually caused by a viral infection. Antibiotics are often prescribed unnecessarily for it, although no evidence exists for any benefit in the CC. Effective alternatives are needed. Objective ? The study intended to evaluate the efficacy of 7630, a proprietary extract of Pelargonium sidoides, the active ingredient in umckaloabo, compared with a placebo for the treatment of the CC. Design ? This was a prospective, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, phase 3 clinical trial (RCT), with an adaptive group-sequential design with 2 parts, both of which were 2-arm trials. The first used a standard dose (SD) of 3  30 drops per day of the active medication and the second used a high dose (HD) of 3  60 drops per day of the active medication, against 3  30 drops per day and 3  60 drops per day of a placebo, respectively. Setting ? The study took place in 8 outpatient departments affiliated with hospitals. Participants ? For the entire study, 207 adults with predefined cold symptoms that had been present for 24 to 48 h prior were included in the study, with 103 participating in the SD part and 104 participating in the HD part. Intervention ? In the HD part, as covered in this article, the intervention group received treatment with 3  60 drops per day of the active medication and the control group received a placebo (control group), for a maximum period of 10 d. Outcome Measures ? The primary outcome measure was the sum of differences in the cold intensity score (CIS) from day 1 to day 3 and from day 1 to day 5, defined as the sum of the symptom intensity differences (SSID). The criteria for the secondary outcome, efficacy, were (1) diverse response criteria according to the total CIS; (2) changes in individual CIS symptoms; (3) changes in further cold-relevant symptoms; (4) ability to work; (5) activity level; (6) general well-being; (7) health-related quality of life-the EuroQol questionnaire with 5 dimensions (EQ-5D), including the visual analogue scale EQ-VAS; (8) time until onset of treatment effect; (9) treatment outcome; and (10) satisfaction with treatment. Results ? From baseline to day 5, the mean CIS decreased by 11.2  4.8 points for the 7630 group and 6.3  4.7 points for the control group. The mean SSID was 16.0  7.6 points for the control group (P < .0001). After 10 d, 90.4% of the group receiving the active medication and 21.2% of the control group were clinically cured (P < .0001). In the treatment group, participants' inability to work was significantly lower, with a mean duration of 6.4  1.6 d vs 8.3  2.1 d for the control group (P < .0001), and treatment outcome-complete recovery or major improvement-was significantly better at day 5 for the active treatment group compared with the control group (P < .0001). Mild-to-moderate adverse events-all nonserious-occurred in 15.4% of those receiving active treatment vs in 5.8% for the control group. Conclusions ? The active medication is an effective, well tolerated, and safe treatment for the CC.

We conducted a systematic review of all published papers on IIAs in the English literature using MEDLINE and SCOPUS database from January 1950 to June 2017.

Diagnostic strategies available to identify or rule out current infection, or to identify people in need of care escalation, or to test for past infection and immune response have become available, to reduce household and community transmission. We highlight a Cochrane review, published in September 2020, on the assessment of diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care antigen and molecular-based tests to determine current SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: the authors of the Cochrane review searched multiple electronic databases for studies, which assessed SARS-CoV-2 infection with a diagnostic test. Eligible participants for the review included people with suspected current SARS-CoV-2 infection, known to have, or not to have COVID-19 infection, or where tests were used to screen for infection. RESULTS: the authors included 18 studies of point-of-care tests conducted in various parts of the world, with none from Africa. The review shows that there is considerable variability in sensitivity and specificity of the antigen tests. The review also shows that molecular tests had less variability in sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSION: the review suggests that the current evidence is not strong enough to determine the usefulness of point-of-care tests in all settings. However, the benefits are likely to be more noticeable in countries, like Africa where community transmission is high.

One of the primary measures for controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection is an accurate assay for its diagnosis. SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR kits suffer from some limitations, including false-negative results in the clinic. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of a rapid antibody test kit for COVID-19 diagnosis. METHODS: The nuclear capsid protein (N) and spike protein 1 (S1) fragments of SARS-CoV-2 were expressed in Escherichia coli, and rapid antibody-based tests for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection were developed. To evaluate their clinical applications, the serum from COVID-19 patients, suspected COVID-19 patients, recovering COVID-19 patients, patients with general fever or pulmonary infection, doctors and nurses who worked at the fever clinic, and health professionals was analyzed by the rapid antibody test kits. The serum from patients infected with Mycoplasma pneumoniae and patients with respiratory tract infection was further analyzed to test its cross-reactivity with other respiratory pathogens. RESULTS: A 47 kDa N protein and 67 kDa S1 fragment of SARS-CoV-2 were successfully expressed, purified, and renatured. The rapid antibody test with recombinant N protein showed higher positive rate than the rapid IgM antibody test with recombinant S1 protein. Clinical evaluation showed that the rapid antibody test kit with recombinant N protein had 88.56 % analytical sensitivity and 97.42 % specificity for COVID-19 patients, 53.48 % positive rate for suspected COVID-19 patients, 57.14 % positive rate for recovering COVID-19 patients, and 0.5?0.8 % cross-reactivity with other respiratory pathogens. The analytical sensitivity of the kit did not significantly differ in COVID-19 patients with different disease courses (p < 0.01).

However, it is widely accepted that human behavior can exhibit history-dependence as a consequence of learned experiences. This history-dependence is similar to hysteresis effects that have been well-studied in control theory. To illustrate the importance of history-dependence for epidemic theory, we study dynamics of a variant of the SIRS model where individuals exhibit lazy-switch responses to prevalence dynamics. The resulting model, which includes the Preisach hysteresis operator, possesses a continuum of endemic equilibrium states characterized by different proportions of susceptible, infected and recovered populations. We discuss stability properties of the endemic equilibrium set and relate them to the degree of heterogeneity of the adaptive response. Our results support the argument that public health responses during the emergence of a new disease can have long-term consequences for subsequent management efforts.

OBJECTIVES: Provide a review of the research literature, propose hypotheses, and therapies based on the potential link between testosterone (T) and COVID-19 induced mortality in elderly men. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A search of publications in academic electronic databases, and government and public health organization web sites on T, aging, inflammation, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) due to coronavirus (CoV) 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and COVID-19 disease state and outcomes was performed. RESULTS: The link between T, the immune system, and male aging is well-established, as is the progressive decline in T levels with aging. In women, T levels drop before menopause and variably increase with advanced age. Elevated IL-6 is a characteristic biomarker of patients infected with COVID-19 and has been linked to the development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Thus far, half of the admitted COVID-19 patients developed ARDS, half of these patients died, and elderly male patients have been more likely to develop ARDS and die. Low T is associated with ARDS. These data suggest that low T levels may exacerbate the severity of COVID-19 infection in elderly men. It may also stand to reason that normal T levels may offer some protection against COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, present in high levels in the testis. CONCLUSION: At present, it is not known whether low T levels in aging hypogonadal males create a permissive environment for severe responses to COVID-19 infection or if the virus inhibits androgen formation.

The DOLPHIN trial was designed to demonstrate the added value of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of beta-lactam and fluoroquinolones in critically ill patients in the ICU. METHODS: A multi-centre, randomised controlled trial (RCT) was designed to assess the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of model-based TDM of beta-lactam and fluoroquinolones. Four hundred fifty patients will be included within 24 months after start of inclusion. Eligible patients will be randomly allocated to either study group: the intervention group (active TDM) or the control group (non-TDM).

From 1950 to 2015, 130,494 human rabies cases were reported in Mainland China with an average of 1977 cases per year. It is estimated that 95% of these human rabies cases are due to dog bites. The purpose of this article is to provide a review about the models, results, and simulations that we have obtained recently on studying the transmission of rabies in China. We first construct a basic susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered (SEIR) type model for the spread of rabies virus among dogs and from dogs to humans and use the model to simulate the human rabies data in China from 1996 to 2010. Then we modify the basic model by including both domestic and stray dogs and apply the model to simulate the human rabies data from Guangdong Province, China. To study the seasonality of rabies, in Section 4 we further propose a SEIR model with periodic transmission rates and employ the model to simulate the monthly data of human rabies cases reported by the Chinese Ministry of Health from January 2004 to December 2010. To understand the spatial spread of rabies, in Section 5 we add diffusion to the dog population in the basic SEIR model to obtain a reactionCdiffusion equation model and determine the minimum wave speed connecting the disease-free equilibrium to the endemic equilibrium. Finally, in order to investigate how the movement of dogs affects the geographically inter-provincial spread of rabies in Mainland China, in Section 6 we propose a multi-patch model to describe the transmission dynamics of rabies between dogs and humans and use the two-patch submodel to investigate the rabies virus clades lineages and to simulate the human rabies data from Guizhou and Guangxi, Hebei and Fujian, and Sichuan and Shaanxi, respectively.

To meet patient specific capabilities, injection forces need to be characterized. We address the open question of whether tissue resistance significantly contributes to overall injection forces, especially for large injection volumes. METHODS Subcutaneous tissue resistance was systematically quantified for injection volumes up to 11 mL depending on viscosity (1-20 mPas) and injection rates (0.025-0.2 mL/s) using G?ttingen Minipigs as the animal model. The contribution of an artificially applied external force at the injection site simulating autoinjector needle cover depression was tested between 2.5-7.5 N. RESULTS Tissue resistance reached average values of ~120 mbar for injection volumes up to 11 mL independent of viscosity and injection rate, and maximum values of 300 mbar were determined. Artificially applied external forces led to higher values, independent of the absolute applied force - maximum values of 1 bar were obtained when injecting 4.5 mL of the 20 mPas solution at an injection rate of 0.1 mL/s with the application of an artificial 5 N force, corresponding to ~450 mbar. All conditions yield defined injection sites suggesting tissue resistance is defined by mechanical properties of the subcutaneous tissue.

Here, we explored for the first time the antimicrobial ability and mechanisms of a wide spectrum of representative pathogens ranging from bacteria (Escherichia coli), to viruses (human adenoviruses) and spores (Bacillus subtilis spores) by g-C3N4/Vis system with the assistance of two common oxidants (H2O2 and PMS), especially in a comparative perspective. Pristine g-C3N4 could achieve a complete inactivation of bacteria (5-log) within 150 min, but displayed negligible antimicrobial activity against human viruses and spores (< 0.5-log). Fortunately, simple addition of oxidants into the system could greatly enhance the inactivation of bacteria (5-log with PMS within 120 min) and human viruses (2.6-log with H2O2 within 150 min). Roles of reactive oxygen species were found to be quite different in the disinfection processes, depending on both types of chemical oxidants and microbial pathogens. Additionally, disinfection efficiency could be facilely and effectively improved by statistical optimization of two important operating factors (i.e., catalyst loading and oxidant addition). Selection of added oxidants was determined by not only the target pathogen but also the water matrix.

Moreover, the relevant target genes of OP were obtained by searching the DisGeNET database. Second, the Venn diagram was drawn to obtain the PA-OP common targets, and the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and drug-component-target (D-C-T) network were constructed by Cytoscape software. Finally, the GO functional annotation and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of common targets were performed using the Metascape online tool.

The PPI network of 82 common targets indicated that the top 5 nodal targets, including PIK3CA, MAPK1, ESR1, AKT1, and SRC, were strongly associated with other proteins. The D-C-T network suggested that the active components with high degree of connectivity include Prostaglandin E1, 17-Beta-Estradiol, Alpha-Estradiol, and Estrone. Furthermore, the GO enrichment analysis revealed that the biological process categories were dominated by response to peptide, cellular response to lipid, regulation of MAPK cascade, and so on.

A prominent example, central to our current understanding of epidemic spread, is the basic reproductive number, R(0), which is defined as the mean number of infections caused by an infected individual in a susceptible population(3,4). Population estimates of R(0) can obscure considerable individual variation in infectiousness, as highlighted during the global emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by numerous superspreading events in which certain individuals infected unusually large numbers of secondary cases(5,6,7,8,9,10). For diseases transmitted by non-sexual direct contacts, such as SARS or smallpox, individual variation is difficult to measure empirically, and thus its importance for outbreak dynamics has been unclear(2,10,11). Here we present an integrated theoretical and statistical analysis of the influence of individual variation in infectiousness on disease emergence. Using contact tracing data from eight directly transmitted diseases, we show that the distribution of individual infectiousness around R(0) is often highly skewed. Model predictions accounting for this variation differ sharply from average-based approaches, with disease extinction more likely and outbreaks rarer but more explosive. Using these models, we explore implications for outbreak control, showing that individual-specific control measures outperform population-wide measures. Moreover, the dramatic improvements achieved through targeted control policies emphasize the need to identify predictive correlates of higher infectiousness. Our findings indicate that superspreading is a normal feature of disease spread, and to frame ongoing discussion we propose a rigorous definition for superspreading events and a method to predict their frequency.

During virus infection, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level excessively rises. LDH is a cytosolic enzyme and the serum level increases as the cell break down. When anaerobic conditions develop, lactate formation increases from pyruvate. Cell pH is regulated by very complex mechanisms. When lactate increases in the extracellular area, this symporter carries lactate and H+ ion into the cell, and the intracellular pH quickly becomes acidic. Paradoxically, Na+/H+ exchanger activation takes place. While H+ ion is thrown out of the cell, Na+ and Ca+2 enter the cell. When Na+ and Ca+2 increase in the cell, the cells swell and die. Dapagliflozin is a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor. Dapagliflozin has been reported to reduce lactate levels by various mechanisms. Also, it reduces oxygen consumption in tissues and causes the use of glucose in the aerobic pathway, thereby reducing lactate production. A lactate decrease in the environment reduces the activation of lactate/H+ symporter. Thus, the H ion pumping into the cell by this symporter is reduced and the cytosolic pH is maintained. Dapagliflozin also directly inhibits NHE. Thus, Na+ and Ca+2 flow to the cell are inhibited. Dapagliflozin provides the continuation of the structure and functions of the cells.

Aetiologies were categorized as patient specific (psychiatric, physical inactivity, endocrinopathies/metabolic and dietary non-compliance) and operation specific. Weight regain following bariatric surgery varies according to duration of follow-up and the bariatric surgical procedure performed. The underlying causes leading to weight regain are multi-factorial and related to patient- and procedure-specific factors.

However, contradictory findings have been reported regarding the impact of glycaemic control on COVID-19 outcome. The aim of this meta-analysis was to explore the impact of hospital pre-admission or at-admission values of HbA1c on COVID-19 mortality or worsening in patients with diabetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase and Scopus up to 30th December 2020. Eligibility criteria for study selection were the following: (1)enrolling patients with any form of diabetes mellitus and hospitalized for COVID-19 and (2) reporting data regarding HbA1c values before infection or at hospital admission in relation to COVID-19 mortality or worsening. Descriptive statistics, HbA1c values, odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios were extracted from seven observational studies and generic inverse variance (random effects) of OR was used to estimate the effect of HbA1c on COVID-19 outcome. RESULTS: HbA1c was linearly associated with an increased COVID-19 mortality or worsening when considered as a continuous variable (OR 1.01 [1.01, 1.01]; p < 0.00001). Similarly, when analysing studies providing the number of events according to the degree of glycaemic control among various strata, a significantly increased risk was observed with poor glycaemic control (OR 1.15 [1.11, 1.19]; p < 0.00001), a result corroborated by sensitivity analysis.

In 2017, the International Commission of Radiation Protection (ICRP) published additional guidelines and recommendations to provide clarity in the protocol used in DRLs establishment. With the continuing evolvement of technology, optimization of examinations and updates in guidelines and recommendations, DRLs should be revised at regular intervals. This systematic review aims to provide an update and identify a more consistent protocol in the methodologies used to establish DRLs.

The sensing results about the spectrum are directly proportional to the performance of the network. In CRN, the final result about the available spectrum is decided by combing the local sensing results. The presence or participation of attackers in the network leads to false decisions and the performance of the network will be degraded. In this work, an optimized artificial neural network (ANN) based aggressor classification algorithm is proposed. The performance of ANN improved by using the Immune plasma optimization (IPO) algorithm which is inspired by human immune system response for COVID-19 disease. Results indicate that the proposed IP optimized ANN produces better results in terms of attacker detection accuracy, energy, packet delivery ratio and delay of the network.

OBJECTIVES. To examine the potential role of IHC stain for T-box transcription factor (Tpit) in the classification of our series of pituitary adenomas and to update our screening panel as necessary. DESIGN. We collected 157 pituitary adenomas from 2 institutions and included these in tissue microarrays. Immunostains for Tpit were scored in a blinded fashion using the Allred system. Adenomas were assigned to a gold standard class based on IHC pattern followed by application of available clinical and serologic information. Test characteristics were calculated. Correlation analyses, cluster analyses, and classification tree analyses were used to see whether IHC staining patterns reliably reflected adenoma class. RESULTS. Of the cases collected, 147 (93.6%) had sufficient material for Tpit analysis. IHC stain for Tpit identified 8 null cell adenomas (all nonfunctioning clinically) as silent corticotrophs; Tpit stains showed better sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value than IHC for adrenocorticotropic hormone and cytokeratin CAM 5.2. Correlation analyses continued to show the expected relationships among IHC stains. Cluster analyses showed grouping of adenomas into clinically consistent groups. Classification tree analysis underscored the central role of transcription factor IHC stains, including Tpit, in adenoma classification. CONCLUSIONS. Substitution of Tpit stain for the adrenocorticotropic hormone stain improves our prior algorithm by reducing the number of false-negatives and false-positives. As a result, fewer adenomas are classified as null cell adenoma, and more adenomas are classified as silent corticotroph adenoma.","output":"The Role of T-box Transcription Factor in a Pituitary Adenoma Diagnostic Algorithm."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present review is aimed at the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) and exergames in the prevention of falls among the elderly Falls become a significant problem in the aging population and lead to psychological, social, and physical impairment Prevention of falls is crucial to the well-being of the elderly population and is one of the challenges of contemporary rehabilitation Recently, in view of the threat of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, contactless methods of rehabilitation, including telerehabilitation, appear as valuable rehabilitation tools This review is based on the PRISMA guidelines and was carried out in five databases: PubMed, Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and PEDro Twenty-one randomized controlled trials, focused on the application of VR and exergames in the prevention of falls, were included This review suggests that VR training in rehabilitation appears to be a promising complement to traditional techniques of physiotherapy to improve specific physical outcomes VR and exergames could be considered as a complement of standard physiotherapy and its possible continuation at home for elderly However, further high-quality studies, with carefully designed protocols and proper blinding, are needed","output":"Virtual Reality Rehabilitation and ExergamesPhysical and Psychological Impact on Fall Prevention among the ElderlyA Literature Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Despite the tremendous negative consequences of substances on the health and well-being of adolescents, studies continue to report the high rates of substance use among adolescents.

Our approach is motivated by the current COVID-19 pandemic. The main hypothesis is the existence of two populations of susceptible persons, one which obeys confinement and for which the infection rate does not exceed 1, and a population which, being non confined for various imperatives, can be substantially more infective. The model, initially formulated as a differential system, is discretised following a specific procedure, the discrete system serving as an integrator for the differential one. Our model is calibrated so as to correspond to what is observed in the COVID-19 epidemic, for the period from February 19 to April 16. Several conclusions can be reached, despite the very simple structure of our model. First, it is not possible to pinpoint the genesis of the epidemic by just analysing data from when the epidemic is in full swing. It may well turn out that the epidemic has reached a sizeable part of the world months before it became noticeable. Concerning the confinement scenarios, a universal feature of all our simulations is that relaxing the lockdown constraints leads to a rekindling of the epidemic. Thus, we sought the conditions for the second epidemic peak to be lower than the first one. This is possible in all the scenarios considered (abrupt or gradualexit, the latter having linear and stepwise profiles), but typically a gradual exit can start earlier than an abrupt one. However, by the time the gradual exit is complete, the overall confinement times are not too different. From our results, the most promising strategy is that of a stepwise exit. Its implementation could be quite feasible, with the major part of the population (perhaps, minus the fragile groups) exiting simultaneously, but obeying rigorous distancing constraints.","output":"Confinement Strategies in a Simple SIR Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ultrasound (US) can modify the plant growth and development.

METHODS Data were obtained from medical records. Outcome measures were level of oxygen therapy, discharge and death. Patients were followed up until 21 April 2020. RESULTS 108 patients were included. 34 (31%) died in hospital or were discharged for palliative care. 43% of patients aged over 65 died. The commonest comorbidities were hypertension (49; 45%) and diabetes (25; 23%). Patients who died were older (mean difference SEM, 13.763.12 years; p<0.0001) with a higher NEWS2 score (median 6, IQR 2.5-7.5 vs median 2, IQR 2-6) and worse renal function (median differences: urea 2.7 mmol/L, p<0.01; creatinine 4 mol/L, p<0.05; eGFR 14 mL/min, p<0.05) on admission compared with survivors.

Out of 31 studies included, 16 studies applied AI for drug repurposing, whereas 10 studies utilized AI for novel drug discovery. Only four studies used AI technology for vaccine development, whereas one study generated stable antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.

METHODS: An institutional review boardCexempt survey was distributed to emergency medicine housestaff in May 2020, and submissions were accepted through August 2020. RESULTS: Out of 104 residents and fellows, 64 responded to our survey (a 61.5% response rate). Out of 64 responders, 27 (42%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Most residents experienced symptoms that are consistent with COVID-19; however, few received polymerase chain reaction testing. Out of 27 housestaff with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, 18 (67%) experienced fever and chills, compared with 8 out of 34 housestaff (24%) without SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Of the 27 housestaff with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, 19 (70%) experienced loss of taste and smell, compared with 2 out of 34 housestaff (6%) without SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Both fever and chills and loss of taste and smell were significantly more commonly experienced by antibody-positive compared to antibody-negative housestaff (P=.002 and <.001, respectively).

Early in the pandemic, contact tracing apps generated significant enthusiasm due to their potential for automating tracing and reducing transmission rates, while enabling targeted confinement strategies. However, while surveys demonstrate public interest in using such apps, their actual uptake remains limited. Their social acceptability is challenged by issues around privacy, fairness, and effectiveness, among other concerns. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to (1) examine the extent to which design and implementation considerations for contact tracing apps are detailed in the available literature, focusing on aspects related to participatory and responsible eHealth innovation, and (2) synthesize recommendations that support the development of successful COVID-19 contact tracing apps and related eHealth technologies. METHODS: Searches were performed on five databases and articles were selected based on eligibility criteria. Papers pertaining to the design, implementation and/or acceptability of contact tracing apps were included. Articles published since 2019, written in English or French and for which the full articles were available were considered eligible for analysis. To assess the scope of the knowledge found in the current literature, we used three complementary frameworks: (1) the Holistic Framework to Improve the Uptake and Impact of eHealth Technologies, (2) the Montreal Model and (3) the Responsible Innovation in Health (RIH) Assessment Tool. RESULTS: A total of 63 articles qualified for the final analysis. Less than half of the selected articles cited the need for a participatory process (40%), which nonetheless was the most frequently referenced item of the Framework to Improve the Uptake and Impact of eHealth Technologies. In regard to the Montreal Model, stakeholder consultation was the most frequently described level of engagement in the development of contact tracing apps (38%), while collaboration and partnership were cited the least (3%). As for the RIH framework, all the articles (100%) addressed population health, whereas only 2% covered environmental considerations. CONCLUSIONS: Most studies lacked fundamental aspects of eHealth development and implementation. Our results demonstrate that stakeholders of COVID-19 contact tracing apps lack important information to be able to critically appraise this eHealth innovation.

Comparative sequence analysis indicated that, like its coronavirus homologs, 3CL(pro) has a three-domain organization and is flanked by hydrophobic domains. The putative 3CL(pro) domain including flanking regions (pp1a residues 2793 to 3143) was fused to the Escherichia coli maltose-binding protein (MBP) and, when expressed in E. coli, was found to possess N-terminal autoprocessing activity that was not dependent on the presence of the 3CL(pro) C-terminal domain. N-terminal sequence analysis of the processed protein revealed that cleavage occurred at the location (2827)LVTHE downward arrow VRTGN(2836). The trans-processing activity of the purified recombinant 3CL(pro) (pp1a residues 2832 to 3126) was used to identify another cleavage site, (6441)KVNHE downward arrow LYHVA(6450), in the C-terminal pp1ab region.

Taking employees of defense suppliers for the Ministry of National Defense, Taiwan, as empirical subjects, 226 employees proceeded with our 20-week (4 h per week, for a total of 80 h) experimental teaching research. The research results reveal that: (1) online character education would affect learning motivation, (2) online character education would affect the perception of integrity, and (3) learning motivation presents significantly positive effects on the perception of integrity. Our results suggest that online character education and discussion is expected to help defense suppliers cultivate good social interaction skills and character to build harmonious interpersonal relationships.","output":"Effects of Defense Suppliers Practice of Online Character Education on the Employees Learning Motivation and Perception of Integrity During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeThe purpose of this article was to identify factors impacting burnout, resilience and quality of life in rural career firefighters.

Due to this trend, the prevalence of Internet addiction disorder (IAD) may have increased within this group. This study examined the prevalence of IAD and its correlates among clinically stable adolescents with psychiatric disorders in China during the COVID-19 outbreak. Method: A multi-center, cross-sectional study was carried out between April 29 and June 9, 2020 in three major tertiary mental health centers in China. IAD and depressive symptoms were assessed using the Internet Addiction Test (IAT) and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), respectively. Results: A total of 1,454 adolescent psychiatric patients were included in final analyses. The prevalence of IAD was 31.2% (95% CI: 28.8C33.6%) during the COVID-19 pandemic. A multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that poor relationships with parents (P < 0.001, OR = 2.34, 95%CI: 1.49C3.68) and elevated total PHQ-9 scores (P < 0.001, OR = 1.19, 95%CI: 1.16C1.21) were significantly associated with higher risk for IAD while longer daily physical exercise durations (P = 0.04, OR = 0.67, 95%CI: 0.46C0.98) and rural residence (P = 0.003, OR = 0.62, 95%CI: 0.46C0.85) were significant correlates of lower risk for IAD. Conclusions: IAD was common among adolescent patients with clinically stable psychiatric disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic; regular physical exercise, healthy relationships with parents and fewer symptoms of depression were associated with lower risk within this population.","output":"Prevalence of Internet Addiction Disorder and Its Correlates Among Clinically Stable Adolescents With Psychiatric Disorders in China During the COVID-19 Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Until very recently, distance education, including digital science labs, served a rather small portion of postsecondary students in the United States and many other countries.

However, due to differences in national health, social security and occupational safety and health systems, the content, capacity, coverage and provisions of OHS vary considerably across national contexts. Obtaining a better understanding in terms of such similarities and variations internationally is essential as such comparative information can help inform evidenced-based decision-making on OHS at both policy and practice levels. This paper therefore reviews and analyses the key policies, standards and approaches in OH systems and services, using both academic and grey literature, across 12 industrialised countries (Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, The Netherlands, Poland, United Kingdom and the United States of America). It provides a detailed overview and categorization of OHS in these selected countries in terms of the legal and policy context, organisation and financing and coverage and staffing while specifically discussing variations aimed at psychosocial risk management and the promotion of mental health and well-being at work.

Few studies have investigated the durability of these changes. OBJECTIVES The objective of this paper is to investigate changes in sex hormones, sexual functioning, and relevant psychosocial constructs over 4 years in women who underwent bariatric surgery. SETTING The setting is a prospective cohort of 106 women from the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery consortium. METHODS Changes in sex hormones were assessed by blood assay. Sexual functioning, quality of life (QOL), body image, depressive symptoms, and marital adjustment were assessed by psychometric measures. RESULTS Women lost on average (95% confidence interval) 32.3% (30.4%, 34.3%) at postoperative year 3 and 30.6% (28.5%, 32.8%) at postoperative year 4. Compared to baseline, women experienced significant changes at 4 years in all hormones assessed, except estradiol. Women reported significant improvements in sexual functioning (i.e., arousal, desire, and satisfaction) through year 3, but these changes were not maintained through year 4. Changes in relationship quality followed a similar pattern. Improvements in physical aspects of QOL, body image, and depressive symptoms were maintained through 4 years. CONCLUSIONS Improvements in reproductive hormones and physical aspects of QOL, body image, and depressive symptoms were maintained 4 years after bariatric surgery.

Still, deficient computer skills and the perception of a higher workload prevented them from perceiving their own improved performance in the new teaching environment. Students were mainly concerned about issues to do with their future professional career and studies, and experienced boredom, anxiety and frustration.

Students were also more satisfied with the role played by hospitals and universities during the epidemic compared to the government and banks. The findings also show that students with selected socio-demographic characteristics (male, part-time, first level, applied sciences, lower living standard, from Africa or Asia) were generally more strongly affected by the pandemic since they were significantly less satisfied with their academic work/life.

Canine distemper (CDV) was suspected to be responsible for the decline of the Santa Catalina Island fox, so knowledge of infectious disease exposure in the remaining island fox populations was urgently needed. This study reviewed previous pathogen exposure in island foxes and investigated the current threat by conducting a serologic survey of foxes on all islands and sympatric feral cats on three islands from 2001 to 2003 for antibodies against canid pathogens. Before the decline, foxes had evidence of exposure to CDV, canine adenovirus (CAV), canine parvovirus (CPV), and Toxoplasma, with exposure to these five pathogens differing greatly by island. Exposure to canine coronavirus (CCV), canine herpesvirus (CHV), and Leptospira was rare. In 2001C2003, wild-born foxes had evidence of exposure to CDV (5.2C32.8%) on 5 of 6 islands, CPV (28C100%) and CAV (4.7C100%) on five islands, and Toxoplasma gondii (2.3C15.4%) on four islands. Exposure to CCV, CHV and Leptospira was less common. Sharing of infectious agents between sympatric foxes and feral cats appeared minimal, but CDV exposure was detected in two cats on Santa Catalina Island. Domestic dogs have historically been present on the islands, but it is not known if canine diseases can be maintained in fox populations without the continual presence of dogs.

Moreover, we will be the first to include cost-effectiveness for this intervention. Based on previous evidence of the In Balance intervention in pre-frail older adults, we expect this intervention to be (cost-)effective after implementation-related adjustments on the target population and duration of the intervention. METHODS: This study is a single-blinded, multicenter randomized controlled trial. The target sample will consist of 256 community-dwelling non-frail and pre-frail adults of 65 years or older with an increased risk of falls. The intervention group receives the In Balance intervention as it is currently widely implemented in Dutch healthcare, which includes an educational component and physical exercises. The physical exercises are based on Tai Chi principles and focus on balance and strength. The control group receives general written physical activity recommendations. Primary outcomes are the number of falls and fall-related injuries over 12 months follow-up. Secondary outcomes consist of physical performance measures, physical activity, confidence, health status, quality of life, process evaluation and societal costs. Mixed model analyses will be conducted for both primary and secondary outcomes and will be stratified for non-frail and pre-frail adults.

In neurosurgery, for example, the simultaneous use of 2 instruments through the same endoscopic shaft remains a difficult feat. It is, however, very challenging to manufacture steerable instruments of the requisite small diameter. We present a new technique to produce such instruments by means of laser cutting. Only 3 coaxial tubes are used. The middle tube has a cutting pattern that allows the steering forces to be transmitted from the proximal to the distal end. In this way the steering part is concealed in the wall of the tube. Large diameter articulated instruments such as for laparoscopy might benefit from the excellent tip stability provided by the same economical technology. METHOD Coaxial nitinol tubes are laser-cut with a Rofin Stent Cutter in a specific pattern. The 3 tubes are assembled by sliding them over one another, forming a single composite tube. In a surgical simulator, the neurosurgical microinstruments and laparoscopic needle drivers were evaluated on surgical convenience. RESULTS Simultaneous use of 2 neurosurgical instruments (1.5 mm diameter) through the same endoscopic shaft proved to be very intuitive. The tip of the steerable laparoscopic instruments (10 mm diameter) could resist a lateral force of more than 20 N. The angle of motion for either instrument was at least 70 in any direction.

In this respect, the evaluation of shape complementarity at molecular interfaces is one of the main factors to be considered.

We relied on a method we recently developed, which employs the 2D Zernike descriptors, to characterize investigated regions with an ordered set of numbers summarizing the local shape properties. Collected a structural dataset of antibody-antigen complexes, we applied this method and we statistically distinguished, in terms of shape complementarity, pairs of interacting regions from non-interacting ones. Thus, we set up a novel computational strategy based on \\\\textit{in-silico} mutagenesis of antibody binding site residues. We developed a Monte Carlo procedure to increase the shape complementarity between the antibody paratope and a given epitope on a target protein surface. We applied our protocol against several molecular targets in SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, known to be indispensable for viral cell invasion. We, therefore, optimized the shape of template antibodies for the interaction with such regions. As the last step of our procedure, we performed an independent molecular docking validation of the results of our Monte Carlo simulations. We can therefore evaluate if the chemical properties of the introduced residues are compatible with the target region.","output":"Shape Complementarity Optimization of Antibody-Antigen Interfaces: the Application to SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has promoted adaptations in diagnostic algorithms We explored the feasibility and accuracy of delayed phase (DP) chest computed tomography (CT) performed immediately after brain CT perfusion (CTP) for the identification of thrombotic complications and myocardial fibrosis among patients admitted with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) Methods: Since July, we have incorporated the use of low dose chest CT scans using a spectral CT scanner in all patients admitted with AIS, encouraging acquisitions, five min after brain CTP All scans were non gated and comprised low dose chest CT scans, without additional contrast Using virtual monochromatic imaging and iodine maps, we evaluated the presence of thrombotic complications, myocardial late enhancement, and myocardial extracellular volume (ECV), as a surrogate of edema and interstitial fibrosis Results: We included 22 patients The mean age was 66 219 6 years In 5 patients, a cardioembolic (CE) source was later identified by transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), [left atrial appendage (LAA) thrombus, n=1], transthoracic echocardiogram with agitated saline injection (patent foramen ovale n=2), or by EKG (atrial fibrillation) Seven patients further underwent either TEE or cardiac CT to identify CE sources DP non gated chest CT had a sensitivity and specificity of 100% to identify CE sources, 1 LAA thrombus correctly detected Chest CT identified pulmonary thromboembolism (PE), later confirmed with CT angiography Chest CT identified myocardial late enhancement in 16 patients (80% in CE vs 71% in non CE, p=0 68), myocardial fat in 1, and coronary calcification in 77% [with 2 62 2 vs 3 83 6 coronary calcified segments in CE vs non CEstrokes, p=0 36) The mean ECV was 354% in CE vs 326% in non CE strokes (p=0 17) The 2patients with a positive PCR test for COVID-19 showed evidence of myocardial late iodineenhancement, and incremented ECV of the septal wall (38% and 40%, respectively) Conclusions: In this pilot study, DP, non ECG gated, low dose chest CT scan performed 5 min afterbrain CTP with a spectral scanner;enabled straightforward identification of CE sources amongpatients with AIS This approach allowed detection of PE and myocardial injury","output":"Identification of cardioembolic sources and myocardial injury in acute ischemic stroke with delayed-phase, low-dose chest ct by means of a dual-layer spectral ct scanner"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The restrictions implemented by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have reawakened discussion surrounding the use of telemedicine in routine clinical practice 1 Nursing home residents have emerged as a particularly vulnerable group, not only with respect to the virus itself, but to the effects of social distancing2 and disruption to the services in place to support them In working to stop the spread of COVID-19 within their facilities, many homes have found it difficult to sustain the non-pharmacological mainstays of management of delirium and behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia 2 Telemedicine, a proposed solution to these difficulties, has been demonstrated to be both valid and acceptable to patients with dementia and care home staff3 but it does not appear to be part of routine practice in the UK 4 We therefore aimed to determine nursing homes capacity and enthusiasm for telepsychiatry assessments The failure to adopt telepsychiatry may therefore be more closely related to factors within mental health services, such as our access to appropriate equipment, than those within nursing homes","output":"Are UK care homes ready for the telemedicine revolution?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] The SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein is located at the outermost perimeter of the viral envelope and is the first component of the virus to make contact with surrounding interfaces.

This presented clinicians with a new challenge in risk stratification of patients with dyspnoea due to suspected COVID19. This review searched existing literature to identify existing modalities to remotely assess patients with acute respiratory distress, which can be adapted for the COVID-19 pandemic and in future similar situations. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of Medline, Embase and Medrxiv for studies of the remote assessment of dyspnoea in acute respiratory disorders in adults/children. The study was registered on PROSPERO (ID: CRD42020202292): 3014 abstracts were screened independently by two reviewers and 32 studies were progressed to full text screening. RESULTS: Five studies were selected for review, including 1317 patients. Two studies assessed video consultation, two assessed telephone related triage tools, and one study assessed an online triage tool for dyspnoea. In one study, video consultation was found to have 83% sensitivity for diagnosing severe respiratory distress in comparison to face-to-face assessment. The online triage tool was found to have 87.5% sensitivity for detecting dyspnoea requiring emergency level care. CONCLUSION: A range of successful remote risk stratification tools and clinical features were identified for assessing dyspnoea severity which can be adapted to COVID-19 and future pandemics to assess respiratory distress via telemedicine. These findings will influence development of comprehensive evidence-based tools to assess dyspnoea which will reduce resource strain during current/future pandemics.

METHODS: To account for health consequences, we estimated mortality for HCWs and present a cost-effectiveness and return on investment (ROI) analysis using a decision-analytic model with Bayesian multivariate sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo simulation. Data sources included inputs from the World Health Organization Essential Supplies Forecasting Tool and the Imperial College of London epidemiologic model. RESULTS: An investment of $9.6 billion USD would adequately protect HCWs in all LMICs. This intervention would save 2,299,543 lives across LMICs, costing $59 USD per HCW case averted and $4,309 USD per HCW life saved. The societal ROI would be $755.3 billion USD, the equivalent of a 7,932% return. Regional and national estimates are also presented. DISCUSSION: In scenarios where PPE remains scarce, 70C100% of HCWs will get infected, irrespective of nationwide social distancing policies. Maintaining HCW infection rates below 10% and mortality below 1% requires inclusion of a PPE scale-up strategy as part of the pandemic response. In conclusion, wide-scale procurement and distribution of PPE for LMICs is an essential strategy to prevent widespread HCW morbidity and mortality.

METHODS: We analysed data from the COVID-19 surveillance database of the Oromia Regional Health Bureau. We included all reverse transcription-PCR-confirmed cases reported from the region between 13 March and 13 September 2020. RESULTS: COVID-19 was confirmed in 8955 (5.5%) of 164 206 tested individuals. The test positivity rate increased from an average of 1.0% in the first 3 months to 6.3% in August and September. About 70% (6230) of the cases were men; the mean age was 30.0 years (SD=13.3), and 90.5% were <50 years of age. Only 64 (0.7%) of the cases had symptoms at diagnosis. Cough was the most common among symptomatic cases reported in 48 (75.0%), while fever was the least. Overall, 4346 (48.5%) have recovered from the virus; and a total of 52 deaths were reported with a case fatality rate of 1.2%. However, we should interpret the reported case fatality rate cautiously since in 44 (84.6%) of those reported as COVID-19 death, the virus was detected from dead bodies. CONCLUSION: Despite the steady increase in the number of reported COVID-19 cases, Ethiopia has so far avoided the feared catastrophe from the pandemic due to the milder and asymptomatic nature of the disease. However, with the current pattern of widespread community transmission, the danger posed by the pandemic remains real.

Methods: A retrospective study was conducted at PAR to evaluate patients with acute STEMI admitted over an 8-week period during the initial COVID-19 outbreak. This study group was compared to patients admitted during the corresponding period in 2019. The primary endpoint of this study was defined as a composite of sustained ventricular arrhythmia, congestive heart failure (CHF) with pulmonary congestion, and/or in-hospital mortality. Results: This study cohort was composed of 64 patients with acute STEMI;30 patients (46.9%) were hospitalized during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients with STEMI in both the COVID-19 and control groups had similar comorbidities, Killip classification score, and clinical presentations.

The pain started after a sudden trunk rotation and right arm flexion movement with a crack. There was tenderness to palpation and crepitation over the left upper ribs. Computed tomography identified a non-displaced fracture line in the anterior aspect of the left 4th rib. After kinesiotaping and activity restriction, pain alleviated. CONCLUSION: Pacemaker implantation might have caused shoulder dysfunction and pectoral tightness resulting in reduced flexibility of the trunk. Consequently, a reaching motion of the arm with a trunk rotation might have directed rotational force vectors towards the osteopenic left 4th rib causing a fragility fracture.

Social media offers opportunities for empowerment, information, and connection while also showing links with depression, high-risk behavior, and harassment. As this medium rapidly integrates into interpersonal interactions, incorporation of social media assessment into the psychiatric evaluation warrants attention. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic and containment measures (ie, social distancing) led to increased dependence on social media, allowing an opportunity to assess the adaptation of psychiatric interviews in response to sociocultural changes. OBJECTIVE: The first aim of this study was to evaluate if general psychiatry residents and child and adolescent psychiatry fellows assessed social media use as part of the clinical interview. Second, the study examined whether changes were made to the social media assessment in response to known increase of social media use secondary to social distancing measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: As part of a quality improvement project, the authors surveyed general psychiatry residents and child psychiatry fellows in a university-based training program (n=21) about their assessment of social media use in patient evaluations. Soon after the survey closed, stay-at-home orders related to the COVID-19 pandemic began. A subsequent survey was sent out with the same questions to evaluate if residents and fellows altered their interview practices in response to the dramatic sociocultural changes (n=20). RESULTS: Pre-COVID-19 pandemic survey results found that 10% (2/21) of respondents incorporated social media questions in patient evaluations. In a follow-up survey after the onset of the pandemic, 20% (4/20) of respondents included any assessment of social media use. Among the 15 participants who completed both surveys, there was a nonsignificant increase in the likelihood of asking about social media use (2/15, 13% vs 4/15, 27%, for pre- and during COVID-19, respectively; McNemar (2)(1)=0.25, P=.617, Cohen d=0.33). CONCLUSIONS: These small survey results raise important questions relevant to the training of residents and fellows in psychiatry. The findings suggest that the assessment of social media use is a neglected component of the psychiatric interview by trainees. The burgeoning use and diversity of social media engagement warrant scrutiny with respect to how this is addressed in interview training. Additionally, given minimal adaptation of the interview in the midst of a pandemic, these findings imply an opportunity for improving psychiatric training that incorporates adapting clinical interviews to sociocultural change.","output":"Rates of Assessment of Social Media Use in Psychiatric Interviews Prior to and During COVID-19: Needs Assessment Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Womens entrepreneurship is increasingly important for creating new jobs and contributing to the social and economic growth of their societies, yet the interplay and nuances of womens entrepreneurship and culture are currently understudied.

This paper investigates to what extent spatial morphology at different scales (node, community and global network) influences the use of public space by micromobility. An axial map and corresponding network for Lisbons walkable and open public space, and data from e-scooters parking locations, is used as case study. Relevant metrics and their correlations (intelligibility, accessibility, permeability and local dimension) for the quantitative characterization of spatial morphology properties are described and computed for Lisbons axial map. Communities are identified based on the network topological structure in order to investigate how these properties are affected at different scales in the case study. The resulting axial line clustering is compared via the variation of information metric with the clustering obtained from e-scooters proximity. The results obtained enable to conclude that the space syntax properties are scale dependent in Lisbons pedestrian network. On the other hand both the correlation between these properties, the number of scooters and the variation of information between clusters indicate that the spatial morphology is not the only factor influencing micromobility. Through the comparative analysis between the main properties of the public space network of Lisbon and data collected from e-scooters locations in a timeframe, centrality becomes a dynamic concept, relying not only on the static topological properties of the urban network, but also on other quantitative and qualitative factors, since the flows operating on the network will operate several transformations on the spatial network properties through time, uncovering spatiotemporal dynamics.","output":"Unfolding the dynamical structure of Lisbons public space: space syntax and micromobility data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The lung airways are constantly exposed to inhaled toxic substances, resulting in cellular damage that is repaired by local expansion of resident bronchiolar epithelial club cells. Disturbed bronchiolar epithelial damage repair lies at the core of many prevalent lung diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, and lung cancer. However, it is still not known how bronchiolar club cell energy metabolism contributes to this process. Here, we show that adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), the rate-limiting enzyme for intracellular lipolysis, is critical for normal club cell function in mice. Deletion of the gene encoding ATGL, Pnpla2 (also known as Atgl), induced substantial triglyceride accumulation, decreased mitochondrial numbers, and decreased mitochondrial respiration in club cells. This defect manifested as bronchiolar epithelial thickening and increased airway resistance under baseline conditions. After naphthalene?induced epithelial denudation, a regenerative defect was apparent. Mechanistically, dysfunctional PPAR lipid-signaling underlies this phenotype because (a) ATGL was needed for PPAR lipid-signaling in regenerating bronchioles and (b) administration of the specific PPAR agonist WY14643 restored normal bronchiolar club cell ultrastructure and regenerative potential.

To maintain control of infection while also reducing disruption to populations, there is a need to understand what combination of measures-including novel digital tracing approaches and less intensive physical distancing-might be required to reduce transmission. We aimed to estimate the reduction in transmission under different control measures across settings and how many contacts would be quarantined per day in different strategies for a given level of symptomatic case incidence. METHODS: For this mathematical modelling study, we used a model of individual-level transmission stratified by setting (household, work, school, or other) based on BBC Pandemic data from 40a??162 UK participants. We simulated the effect of a range of different testing, isolation, tracing, and physical distancing scenarios. Under optimistic but plausible assumptions, we estimated reduction in the effective reproduction number and the number of contacts that would be newly quarantined each day under different strategies. RESULTS: We estimated that combined isolation and tracing strategies would reduce transmission more than mass testing or self-isolation alone: mean transmission reduction of 2% for mass random testing of 5% of the population each week, 29% for self-isolation alone of symptomatic cases within the household, 35% for self-isolation alone outside the household, 37% for self-isolation plus household quarantine, 64% for self-isolation and household quarantine with the addition of manual contact tracing of all contacts, 57% with the addition of manual tracing of acquaintances only, and 47% with the addition of app-based tracing only. If limits were placed on gatherings outside of home, school, or work, then manual contact tracing of acquaintances alone could have an effect on transmission reduction similar to that of detailed contact tracing. In a scenario where 1000 new symptomatic cases that met the definition to trigger contact tracing occurred per day, we estimated that, in most contact tracing strategies, 15a??000-41a??000 contacts would be newly quarantined each day. INTERPRETATION: Consistent with previous modelling studies and country-specific COVID-19 responses to date, our analysis estimated that a high proportion of cases would need to self-isolate and a high proportion of their contacts to be successfully traced to ensure an effective reproduction number lower than 1 in the absence of other measures. If combined with moderate physical distancing measures, self-isolation and contact tracing would be more likely to achieve control of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 transmission.

Little is known on dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 serology in African settings. Here, we aimed to characterize the longitudinal antibody response profile to SARS-CoV-2 in Ethiopia. METHODS: In this prospective study, a total of 102 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled. We obtained 802 plasma samples collected serially. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were determined using four lateral flow immune-assays (LFIAs), and an electrochemiluminescent immunoassay. We determined longitudinal antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 as well as seroconversion dynamics. RESULTS: Serological positivity rate ranged between 12%-91%, depending on timing after symptom onset. There was no difference in positivity rate between severe and non-severe COVID-19 cases. The specificity ranged between 90%-97%. Agreement between different assays ranged between 84%-92%. The estimated positive predictive value (PPV) for IgM or IgG in a scenario with seroprevalence at 5% varies from 33% to 58%. Nonetheless, when the population seroprevalence increases to 25% and 50%, there is a corresponding increases in the estimated PPVs. The estimated negative-predictive value (NPV) in a low seroprevalence scenario (5%) is high (>99%). However, the estimated NPV in a high seroprevalence scenario (50%) for IgM or IgG is reduced significantly to 80% to 85%. Overall, 28/102 (27.5%) seroconverted by one or more assays tested, within a median time of 11 (IQR: 9C15) days post symptom onset. The median seroconversion time among symptomatic cases tended to be shorter when compared to asymptomatic patients [9 (IQR: 6C11) vs. 15 (IQR: 13C21) days; p = 0.002]. Overall, seroconversion reached 100% 5.5 weeks after the onset of symptoms. Notably, of the remaining 74 COVID-19 patients included in the cohort, 64 (62.8%) were positive for antibody at the time of enrollment, and 10 (9.8%) patients failed to mount a detectable antibody response by any of the assays tested during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal assessment of antibody response in African COVID-19 patients revealed heterogeneous responses. This underscores the need for a comprehensive evaluation of seroassays before implementation.

OBJECTIVES: To describe circulation patterns of HCoVs -OC43, -229E, -NL63 and -HKU1 in the US. STUDY DESIGN: We reviewed real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test results for HCoV-OC43, -229E, -NL63 and -HKU1 reported to The National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) by U.S. laboratories from July 2014CJune 2017. We calculated the total number of tests and percent positive by week. For a subset of HCoV positive submissions with age and sex of the patient available, we tested for differences in age and sex across the four HCoV species using Chi Square and Kruskal Wallace tests. RESULTS: 117 laboratories reported 854,575 HCoV tests; 2.2% were positive for HCoV-OC43, 1.0% for HCoV-NL63, 0.8% for HCoV-229E, and 0.6% for HCoV-HKU1. The percentage of positive tests peaked during December C March each year. No significant differences in sex were seen across species, although a significant difference in age distribution was noted. CONCLUSIONS: Common HCoVs may have annual peaks of circulation in winter months in the US, and individual HCoVs may show variable circulation from year to year.

METHODS: We distributed an online survey via social media in June 2020 open to any UK healthcare worker. The primary outcome measure was symptoms of burnout measured using the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI). Secondary outcomes of depression, anxiety, distress and subjective measures of stress were also recorded. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with burnout, depression, anxiety and distress. RESULTS: A total of 539 persons responded to the survey; 90% female, 53% nurses.

This was the first dengue outbreak in this area of inland China, and 172 cases were reported. METHODS: To verify the causative agent of this outbreak and characterise the viral genes, the genes encoding the structural proteins C/prM/E of viruses isolated from local residents were sequenced followed by mutation and phylogenetic analysis. Recombination, selection pressure, potential secondary structure and three-dimensional structure analyses were also performed. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all epidemic strains were of the cosmopolitan DENV-2 genotype and were most closely related to the Zhejiang strain (MH010629, 2017) and then the Malaysia strain (KJ806803, 2013). Compared with the sequence of DENV-2SS, 151 base substitutions were found in the sequences of 89 isolates; these substitutions resulted in 20 non-synonymous mutations, of which 17 mutations existed in all samples (two in the capsid protein, six in the prM/M proteins, and nine in the envelope proteins). Moreover, amino acid substitutions at the 602nd (E322:Q  H) and 670th (E390: N  S) amino acids may have enhanced the virulence of the epidemic strains. One new DNA binding site and five new protein binding sites were observed. Two polynucleotide binding sites and seven protein binding sites were lost in the epidemic strains compared with DENV-2SS. Meanwhile, five changes were found in helical regions. Minor changes were observed in helical transmembrane and disordered regions. The 429th amino acid of the E protein switched from a histamine (positively charged) to an asparagine (neutral) in all 89 isolated strains. No recombination events or positive selection pressure sites were observed. To our knowledge, this study is the first to analyse the genetic characteristics of epidemic strains in the first dengue outbreak in Hunan Province in inland China.

As this demand fell elective operating subsequently increased. This saw the introduction of the ?Cold Pathway? at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in line with Public Health England guidelines;the first urology patients being admitted on 14 May 2020. This requires patients to undergo a 14-day self-isolation period, which many find difficult, with a negative COVID-19 swab 48 h prior to their operation.Aims:This article examines whether any differences exist in patient outcomes related to COVID-19 since implementation of the Cold Pathway and the significance of this to the 14-day self-isolation rule.Methods:Urology patients electively operated on between 23 March 2020?3 July 2020 were included. A combination of electronic records and telephone consultations were used to obtain data regarding a pre-selected set of questions.Results:One hundred and ninety-six patients were included. Seventy-eight patients were admitted prior to the introduction of the Cold Pathway and 118 after this point. Of patients analysed prior to the implementation of the Cold Pathway, one required ongoing hospital treatment as a result of potentially obtaining COVID-19 from in-patient admission. Of the 78 patients, 14 isolated prior to their procedure. Post-implementation, 118 patients were examined. Despite claiming to have complied with self-isolation instructions at admission, 45 patients admitted retrospectively to not complying at all or only partially. One patient developed COVID-19 3 weeks post-operatively.Discussion:We have shown no difference in outcomes, in relation to COVID-19, when comparing those admitted pre- and post-Cold Pathway implementation. Many patients describe difficulty in following this isolation period. In conjunction with falling national and local levels of COVID-19 positive cases, we have therefore adopted a more pragmatic approach to patient isolation with the ability to perform operations based on clinical need and individual patient circumstances.Level of evidence:This is a cohort study of patients undergoing elective urological surgery at the Royal Berkshire Hospital.","output":"Evidence and rationale for a pragmatic approach to pre-operative isolation prior to elective urological surgery during the de-escalation phase of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 caused major changes in private and public arenas. Individuals were forced to reorganise their daily lives in response to the restrictive measures imposed by governments. The redistribution of gender roles and the responsibility for care provides an example of the reconfigurations that took place during the pandemic. This article sheds light on the implications of the pandemic for gender inequalities by exploring how care work was reconfigured as women and men sought to protect family members and navigated risks of infection. The study is based on qualitative data C interviews and observations C gathered in an interdisciplinary medical anthropology project. In the article, the authors focus on seven cases selected from a larger corpus to illustrate how reconfigurations of the gendered division of care work within families shifted during the pandemic as men assumed greater moral responsibility for safeguarding family members, without infringing the norms of masculinity. The first part of the article explores the intensification of care activities during lockdown for women living in the Canton de Vaud in Switzerland. The second part centres on the moral responsibility and duty for women and men to protect family members from viral exposure. The results from the study confirm not only that most care activities continued to be delegated to female family members, but also that mens roles evolved. While their safeguarding role can be understood as a new form of caring for men, the findings suggest that it was essentially crisis specific and did not challenge masculinity norms. The extent to which this reconfiguration of gender roles might have a longer-term impact on gender inequalities remains to be seen. Meanwhile, these observations could have important implications for policies aimed at mitigating the medium and long-term effects of the pandemic on gender inequality.","output":"Caring During COVID-19: Reconfigurations of Gender and Family Relations During the Pandemic in Switzerland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We performed a prospective survey on the adverse reactions following the first dose of two types of vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in healthcare workers (HCWs) in South Korea. METHODS: HCWs at a tertiary referral hospital in Seoul, South Korea, received a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) or an mRNA-based vaccine (BNT162b2) between March 5 and March 26, 2021. The HCWs were asked to report adverse reactions through a mobile self-report questionnaire for three days after vaccination. RESULTS: A total of 7,625 HCWs received the first dose of ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 vaccine during the study period. Of them, 5,866 (76.9%) HCWs (ChAdOx1, n = 5,589 [95.3%]; BNT162b2, n = 277 [4.7%]) participated at least once in the survey, of whom 77% were female and 86% were younger than 50 years. The overall adverse reaction rate was 93% in the ChAdOx1 group and 80% in the BNT162b2 group (P < 0.001). Both local and systemic reactions were more commonly reported in the ChAdOx1 group, and the difference was larger in systemic reactions such as fever and fatigue. In the ChAdOx1 group, the incidence of adverse reactions was significantly higher in females and those in the younger age groups, while the BNT162b2 group showed such difference according to age. CONCLUSION: In our prospective survey, vaccine-associated adverse reactions were more commonly reported in the ChAdOx1 group than in the BNT162b2 group.

Our studies on the organization of the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) have shown that the structure of these viruses is more complex. Different electron microscopy techniques, including cryomicroscopy of vitrified viruses, revealed the existence of an internal core, most probably icosahedral, in TGEV virions. Disruption of these cores induced the release of elongated ribonucleoprotein complexes. Ultrastructural analysis of freeze-substituted TGEV-infected swine testis (ST) cells showed characteristic intracellular budding profiles as well as two types of virions. While large virions with an electron-dense internal periphery are seen at perinuclear regions, smaller viral particles exhibiting compact internal cores of poligonal contours are more abundant in areas closer to the plasma membrane of the cell.

STIs and bloodborne viruses (BBVs) are over-represented in people experiencing broader health inequalities, which include those with mild learning disabilities. Self-managed care, including self-sampling for STIs/BBVs, is increasingly commonplace, requiring agency and health literacy. To inform the development of a partner notification trial, we explored barriers and facilitators to correct use of an STI/BBV self-sampling pack among people with mild learning disabilities. METHODS: Using purposive and convenience sampling we conducted four interviews and five gender-specific focus groups with 25 people (13 women, 12 men) with mild learning disabilities (July-August 2018) in Scotland. We balanced deductive and inductive thematic analyses of audio transcripts to explore issues associated with barriers and facilitators to correct use of the pack. RESULTS: All participants found at least one element of the pack challenging or impossible, but welcomed the opportunity to undertake sexual health screening without attending a clinic and welcomed the inclusion of condoms. Reported barriers to correct use included perceived overly complex STI/BBV information and instructions, feeling overwhelmed and the manual dexterity required for blood sampling. Many women struggled interpreting anatomical diagrams depicting vulvovaginal self-swabbing. Facilitators included pre-existing STI/BBV knowledge, familiarity with self-management, good social support and knowing that the service afforded privacy. CONCLUSION: In the first study to explore the usability of self-sampling packs for STI/BBV in people with learning disabilities, participants found it challenging to use the pack. Limiting information to the minimum required to inform decision-making, 'easy read' formats, simple language, large font sizes and simpler diagrams could improve acceptability. However, some people will remain unable to engage with self-sampling at all. To avoid widening health inequalities, face-to-face options should continue to be provided for those unable or unwilling to engage with self-managed care.","output":"How can we make self-sampling packs for sexually transmitted infections and bloodborne viruses more inclusive?

The study also examined whether the changes in daily occupations were associated with health-related quality of life (HrQOL). Methods: Between the spring and early fall of 2020, 69 persons with MS and 95 healthy adults completed an online survey that included measurements of 26 activities of daily life. For each activity, participants reported whether they continued to perform the activity (with or without adjustments), whether they stopped, or started to perform the activity during the pandemic. Social support, HrQOL, and demographics, including financial distress were also obtained. Results: Participants with MS and healthy adults both reduced the number of activities performed during the pandemic. Healthy adults continued to do more activities with and without adjustments compared with participants with MS. In both groups, better HrQOL was associated with the number of activities participants continued to do with and without adjustments, and worse HrQOL with the number of activities they stopped doing. Conclusions: Fewer persons with MS engaged in everyday occupations than healthy adults following the COVID-19 pandemic. The ability to maintain occupational engagement and to participate in social and daily activities is important for maintaining high HrQOL in both groups.

Up until now, there are no corresponding data for university policlinics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: With the help of the data of the clinic's electronic medical record system (IS-H/i.s.h.med from SAP, Cerner Corporation, North Kansas City, MO, United States of America and SAP SE, Walldorf, Germany) and the time recording and management software TimeElement (Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany), which was codeveloped at our clinic, all patient contacts of the COVID-19 shutdown were evaluated over a period of approximately 7 weeks from 18 March 2020 to 8 May 2020 and compared with the same period in 2019. In addition, quarterly revenues for the first and second quarters of 2019 and 2020 were put into perspective via SAP. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 period the total number of patient contacts was reduced by 59.5% compared to the previous year. The number of lockdown period cases decreased by 74.8% compared to the same period in 2019. In particular, the university outpatient/self-paying sector recorded the largest number of lost patient contacts with a reduction to 17.2% of the 2019 baseline. The reduced patient contacts and case numbers resulted in a significant financial loss of at least ?a?218,000. Via TimeElement there was a 69.4% decrease in all special diagnostic services, with visual field examinations in particular also reduced by 75.3%.

Pediatricians should be aware of such presentation, the clinical course, the management modalities, and inform parents and caregivers about common signs and symptoms. Anakinra may consider as effective second agent in (IVIG and steroid-refractory pediatric cases).","output":"Refractory Multi-inflammatory Syndrome in a two weeks old neonate with COVID-19 Treated Successfully with Intravenous Immunoglobulin, Steroids and Anakinra"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Age and inflammation are powerful drivers of cardiovascular disease. With the growing recognition that traditional cardiovascular risk factors are not fully accurate predictors of cardiovascular disease, recent studies have revealed the prevalence of positive selection of somatic cell mutations in hematopoietic stem cells in the elderly population, which can cause clonal hematopoiesis. Interestingly, clonal hematopoiesis is not only associated with cancer and death, but also closely related to the risk of increased cardiovascular disease due to mutations in TET2, DNMT3A, ASXL1, and JAK2. However, the mechanism of the interaction of clonal hematopoiesis and cardiovascular disease is only partially understood. In mice, somatic mutations have led to significantly increased expression of inflammatory genes in innate immune cells, which may explain the relationship between mutations and cardiovascular disease. Here, we further discuss the association between inflammatory signaling, clonal hematopoiesis, and cardiovascular disease,and using two hypotheses to propose a feedback loop between inflammatory signaling and clonal hematopoiesis for getting insight into the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases in depth. Therapies targeting mutant clones or increased inflammatory mediators may be useful for ameliorating the risk of cardiovascular disease.","output":"A feedback loop: Interactions between Inflammatory Signals and Clonal Hematopoiesis in Cardiovascular Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has shaken the world to its core and has provoked an overnight exodus of developers that normally worked in an office setting to working from home. The magnitude of this shift and the factors that have accompanied this new unplanned work setting go beyond what the software engineering community has previously understood to be remote work. To find out how developers and their productivity were affected, we distributed two surveys (with a combined total of 3,634 responses that answered all required questions) -- weeks apart to understand the presence and prevalence of the benefits, challenges, and opportunities to improve this special circumstance of remote work. From our thematic qualitative analysis and statistical quantitative analysis, we find that there is a dichotomy of developer experiences influenced by many different factors (that for some are a benefit, while for others a challenge). For example, a benefit for some was being close to family members but for others having family members share their working space and interrupting their focus, was a challenge. Our surveys led to powerful narratives from respondents and revealed the scale at which these experiences exist to provide insights as to how the future of (pandemic) remote work can evolve.","output":"A Tale of Two Cities: Software Developers Working from Home During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Regulatory convergence and cooperation among medical product regulatory authorities are essential to delivering safe and efficacious products quickly to patients. The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the urgent need for streamlined regulatory approval processes-which can be achieved in part through regulatory convergence and cooperation-both to accelerate availability of COVID-19 vaccines, treatments and diagnostics and to maintain the availability of the existing medical products unrelated to COVID-19. METHODS: The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Life Sciences Innovation Forum (LSIF) established the Regulatory Harmonization Steering Committee (RHSC) in 2008 to advance regulatory convergence among APEC's 21 member economies. Key performance indicators (KPIs) were developed in 2018 to measure convergence. RESULTS: This paper reports survey results collected from KPI tracking in March 2020 from medical product regulatory authorities in all 21 APEC economies concerning areas of regulatory practice in which they could converge and cooperate. For example, from 2008 to 2020, there was a 14.3% increase in the number of APEC member economy regulatory authorities sharing Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) Certificates and a 28% increase in the number of regulatory authorities accepting multisite licenses in that same period. In addition, this paper explores how APEC economies could realize a maximum level of regulatory convergence and cooperation. CONCLUSIONS: Convergence efforts within APEC can accelerate availability of medical products including that related to COVID-19 vaccines, treatments and diagnostics, while maintaining the availability of the existing medical products unrelated to COVID-19 vaccines and treatment. New KPIs and capability building are to be considered to enable a new era of innovation ushered in by COVID-19.","output":"Measuring Progress of Regulatory Convergence and Cooperation Among Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Member Economies in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a massive disruption in the way traditional higher education institutions deliver their courses Unlike transitions from face-to-face teaching to blended, online or flipped classroom in the past, changes in emergency remote teaching Ca temporary shift of instructional delivery to an alternate remote delivery mode due to crisis circumstancesC happen suddenly and in an unplanned way This study analyzes the move to emergency remote teaching at [Center and Institution Blinded for Review], and the impact of organizational aspects related to unplanned change, instruction-related variables Cclass size, synchronous/asynchronous deliveryC and digital supporting technologies used, on students academic performance Using quantitative data about student grades across all (N=43) courses of a bachelors degree programme in Telecommunication Engineering and qualitative data from a questionnaire delivered to all (N=43) course coordinators, the research also compares the academic results of students during the COVID-19 pandemic with those of previous years The results of this case study show an increase in students academic performance in emergency remote teaching, and support the idea that organizational factors may contribute to successful implementation of emergency remote teaching;the analysis does not find differences across courses with different class sizes or delivery modes The study further explores possible explanations for the results of the analysis, considering organizational, individual and instruction-related aspects","output":"Emergency Remote Teaching and Students Academic Performance in Higher Education during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A phenotypic plethora of exclusively cutaneous adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) with COVID\\\\19 vaccines have been described.

The purpose of our study was to study cases of CMV DNAemia noted after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in our thoracic organ transplant recipients. Methods Between March 1, 2021, and June 30, 2021, we identified 7 cases of CMV infection in thoracic organ transplant recipients within 30 days of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. Descriptive statistics was used to study these cases. Results Our findings are summarized in the table. Of our patients, 3 were lung recipients, 3 were heart recipients while one was a dual heart-kidney recipient. Three patients received the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine while others received the BNT162b2 (Pfizer) vaccine. Age ranged from 42 to 73 years. Two of the lung transplant recipients and one heart recipient were CMV high-risk status (Donor+/Recipient-), while the others were recipient-seropositive for CMV. The median time to PCR detection of CMV DNAemia from the second dose of mRNA vaccine was 16 days with a range of 4 days to 30 days. None of these recipients had post-transplant CMV infection detected previously. All patients were off antiviral prophylaxis and on their standard immunosuppressive regimen at the time of vaccination. Symptoms were variable but ranged from asymptomatic to acute respiratory failure. However, all patients had resolution of CMV DNAemia by the censor date with a range of 7 days to 45 days. Therapy included reduction of immunosuppression, intravenous ganciclovir, and oral valganciclovir. The median peak CMV DNA PCR in the cohort was 15,900 IU/ml with a range of 272 IU/ml to 175,973 IU/ml. None of the recipients developed IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in response to vaccination. There were no documented cases of COVID-19 in these transplant recipients. Conclusion CMV DNAemia after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in solid organ transplant recipients may be an under-recognized phenomenon. Although the risk-benefit assessment strongly favors COVID-19 vaccination, due to the greater risk of adverse events with COVID-19 infection care teams should consider active monitoring for CMV disease activity in these patients. In some cases, CMV prophylaxis may be warranted depending on patients risk profile. Our findings warrant study in a larger prospective study.","output":"Cytomegalovirus Infection Following Vaccination for COVID-19 in Thoracic Organ Transplant Recipients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The understanding of the impact of COVID\\\\19 in patients with cancer is evolving, with need for rapid analysis. AIMS: This study aims to compare the clinical and demographic characteristics of patients with cancer (with and without COVID\\\\19) and characterize the clinical outcomes of patients with COVID\\\\19 and cancer. METHODS AND RESULTS: Real\\\\world data (RWD) from two health systems were used to identify 146 702 adults diagnosed with cancer between 2015 and 2020; 1267 COVID\\\\19 cases were identified between February 1 and July 30, 2020. Demographic, clinical, and socioeconomic characteristics were extracted. Incidence of all\\\\cause mortality, hospitalizations, and invasive respiratory support was assessed between February 1 and August 14, 2020. Among patients with cancer, patients with COVID\\\\19 were more likely to be Non\\\\Hispanic black (NHB), have active cancer, have comorbidities, and/or live in zip codes with median household income <$30 000. Patients with COVID\\\\19 living in lower\\\\income areas and NHB patients were at greatest risk for hospitalization from pneumonia, fluid and electrolyte disorders, cough, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure and were more likely to receive hydroxychloroquine. All\\\\cause mortality, hospital admission, and invasive respiratory support were more frequent among patients with cancer and COVID\\\\19. Male sex, increasing age, living in zip codes with median household income <$30 000, history of pulmonary circulation disorders, and recent treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors or chemotherapy were associated with greater odds of all\\\\cause mortality in multivariable logistic regression models. CONCLUSION: RWD can be rapidly leveraged to understand urgent healthcare challenges.

For this purpose, we aimed to determine the effects of BNT162b2 (BNT) and CoronaVac (CV) boosters on the humoral and cellular immunity of individuals who had two doses of CV vaccination. METHODS: The study was conducted in three centers (Koc University Hospital, Istanbul University Cerrahpasa Hospital, and Istanbul University, Istanbul Medical School Hospital) in Istanbul, Turkey. Individuals who had been previously immunized with two doses of CV and no history of COVID\\\\19 were included. The baseline blood samples were collected 3C5 months after the second dose of CV. Follow\\\\up blood samples were taken 1 and 3 months after administration of third doses of CV, or one dose of BNT boosters. Neutralizing antibody titers were measured by plaque reduction assay. The CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, effector CD4+CD38+CD69+ T cell, and effector CD8+CD38+CD69+ T cell ratios were determined by flow cytometry. The intracellular IFN\\\\ and IL\\\\2 responses were measured by ELISpot assay. RESULTS: We found a 3.38\\\\fold increase in neutralizing antibody geometric mean titers (NA GMT, 78.69) 1 month after BNT booster and maintained at the third month (NA GMT, 80). Nevertheless, in the CV booster group, significantly lower NA GMT than BNT after 1 month and 3 months were observed (21.44 and 28.44, respectively) (p < .001). In the ELISpot assay, IL\\\\2 levels after BNT were higher than baseline and CV booster (p < .001) while IFN\\\\ levels were significantly higher than baseline (p < .001). The CD8+CD38+CD69+ and CD4+CD38+CD69+ T cells were stimulated predominantly in the third month of the BNT boosters. CONCLUSION: The neutralizing antibody levels after 3 months of the BNT booster were higher than the antibody levels after CV in fully vaccinated individuals. On the contrary, ratio of the effector T cells increased along with greater IFN\\\\ activation after BNT booster. By considering the waning immunity, we suggest a new booster dose with BNT for the countries that already had two doses of primary CV regimens.","output":"Effect of BTN162b2 and CoronaVac boosters on humoral and cellular immunity of individuals previously fully vaccinated with CoronaVac against SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2: A longitudinal study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vitiligo is an autoimmune disease in which there is a progressive depigmentation due to the loss of melanocytes in epidermis.

To follow the strict directives given by the government, the businesses have to implement a cost-effective approach to ensure that all its employers wear a face mask and help to control the spread of coronavirus. The proposed solution consists of an automatic face mask detection system that eliminates the need of an employee at the entrance. The working model detects a face mask in every person by analysing each frame of the video and alert through security mail when the mask is not detected. Our proposed system is designed using the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) model for mask detection and image subtraction technique to recognise the faces with mask. The scope of the project pertains to avoid the entry of unauthorized people into an organization by recognizing the face despite the presence of a mask. The model shows an accuracy of 99.82% on a custom dataset.

Nevertheless, the long-term burden and sequels of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system is still unknown. Purpose: To evaluate the long-term impact of COVID-19 on left ventricular function in patients with severe clinical presentation requiring intensive care hospitalization. Methods: This was a single-center observational, prospective study which included patients requiring admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to COVID-19 infection from January to November 2020. All discharged patients were contacted to perform a clinical, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic evaluation and those who accepted were included on the protocol. Baseline and clinical characteristics were collected from clinical reports. For the global longitudinal strain (GLS) analysis all patients with significant wall motion abnormalities and valvular cardiopathy were excluded. Statistical analysis was performed with Mann-Whitney and a safety cut-off was established with ROC curve analysis. Results: A total of 43 patients were included (mean age 64  12, 67.4% males). During SARS-COV2 infection 49% presented with severe ARDS and 51% with moderate, 35% required invasive mechanical ventilation, 14% noninvasive mechanical ventilation and 52% with high nasal flow cannula. On the follow-up analysis, fatigue was the most reported in symptom (52% patients) and the majority did not present other signs or symptoms suggestive of heart failure, with the mean NT-proBNP of 49  389 pg/dL. The standard ECG and echocardiogram did not show significant changes with a mean LVEF of 58  7.8 and mean TAPSE of 21  4. The strain analysis showed low value of GLS (mean GLS of -17.14  2.36) for a reference cut-off of -18%, suggesting subclinical left ventricular dysfunction in this subset of patients with preserved ejection fraction. Maximum CPR values during ICU did not correlate either with the extent of disease evolvement in CT (p= NS) or ARDS severity (p= NS). Nevertheless, maximum CPR correlated significantly with GLS reduction (R = 0.44, p = 0.019). A CPR value higher than iger30mg/ dL had 100% specificity for GLS reduction and a cut-off of 14gm/dL reported a sensitivity of 65% and specificity pf 75% for reduction in GLS. Conclusion: In our study, we reported subclinical impairment in left ventricular function detected with global longitudinal strain after serious infection with SARS-COV2. The detected myocardial dysfunction was related with higher inflammatory as expressed by CPR values. Longterm monitoring of these patients should be undertaken in order to timely detect late complications.","output":"Long term left ventricular impairment after SARS-COV2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In het vorige hoofdstuk hebben we gezien dat de mens zich tegen velerlei soorten prikkels kan beschermen door middel van ontstekings- of immuunreacties.

Among them, activated neutrophil- (PMN-) induced tissue injury and epithelial cell apoptosis mediated lung damage represent two potentially important candidate pathomechanisms that have been put forward. Several approaches have been undertaken to test these hypotheses, with substantial success in the treatment of experimental forms of ALI. With this in mind, we will summarize these two current hypotheses of ALI briefly, emphasizing the role of apoptosis in regulating PMN and/or lung epithelial cell responses.

An understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease is necessary for an effective treatment. Laboratory investigations play an important role in the diagnosis as well as treatment of this infectious disease. Hematological parameters demonstrate alterations during the progression of nCOVID-19 infection. Of these, many are indicative of extremely poor clinical outcome. Hematological findings like leukopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and coagulation-related abnormalities are the most common manifestations. The aim of this study was to assess the dynamic profile and clinical implications of hematological and immunological parameters among nCOVID-19 infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was designed after categorizing patients suffering from COVID-19 into three groups: (a) Group I; (b) Group II and (c) Group III or severe critical patients. Hematological and immunological parameters of neutrophilic and white blood cell counts, d-dimer levels, hemoglobin levels, immunoglobulin G (IgG) and M (IgM) levels and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were assessed. Statistical analysis using KruskalCWallis test was used. RESULTS: Normal white blood cell and neutrophil count among COVID-19 patients was seen. However, median values in Group II (P < 0.01) and Group III (P < 0.0001) were found to show significantly higher values when compared to Group I. A significant (P < 0.01) decrease in lymphocytic counts was found among severe and critical patients. Hemoglobin level was found to demonstrate higher decrease (P < 0.01) among severe and critical patients. Platelet count was found in normal range in all COVID-19 patients. Routine coagulation tests revealed increased fibrinogen (P < 0.01) and d-dimer levels (P < 0.0001) in severe and critical patients. Normal proportions of total CD3+ and CD4 + T lymphocytes were observed in COVID-19. However, CD8 + T lymphocytes proportion was found to be decreased (P-value < 0.05). Immunoglobulin G levels among Groups II and III patients were found to be lower when compared with Group I (P < 0.001). No statistical significance was observed between the groups in IgM levels. Plasma IL-6 levels were found to show progressive rise among Groups II and III patients (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Analysis of hematological and immunological parameters profiles in COVID-19 patients may help in deciphering the clinical progression of patients suffering from COVID-19 disease.

Previous studies have demonstrated the potential of Internet-based surveillance such as Google Dengue Trends (GDT) in supplementing current epidemiological methods for predicting future dengue outbreaks and patterns. With this, our study has two objectives: (1) assess the temporal relationship of weekly GDT and dengue incidence in Metropolitan Manila from 2009C2014; and (2) examine the health-seeking behavior based on dengue-related search queries of the population. The study collated the population statistics and reported dengue cases in Metropolitan Manila from respective government agencies to calculate the dengue incidence (DI) on a weekly basis for the entire region and annually per city. Data processing of GDT and dengue incidence was performed by conducting an adjustment and scaling procedures, respectively, and further analyzed for correlation and cross-correlation analyses using Pearsons correlation. The relative search volume of the term dengue and top dengue-related search queries in Metropolitan Manila were obtained and organized from the Google Trends platform. Afterwards, a thematic analysis was employed, and word clouds were generated to examine the health behavior of the population. Results showed that weekly temporal GDT pattern are closely similar to the weekly DI pattern in Metropolitan Manila. Further analysis showed that GDT has a moderate and positive association with DI when adjusted or scaled, respectively. Cross-correlation analysis revealed a delayed effect where GDT leads DI by 1C2 weeks. Thematic analysis of dengue-related search queries indicated 5 categories namely; (a) dengue, (b) sign and symptoms of dengue, (c) treatment and prevention, (d) mosquito, and (e) other diseases. The majority of the search queries were classified in signs and symptoms which indicate the health-seeking behavior of the population towards the disease.

Data regarding the impact of the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak on parental psychology are currently lacking. The aim of the present study was to assess parenting stress during the COVID-19 pandemic in Greece. METHODS: An Internet e-survey was conducted adhering to CHERRIES guidelines of the EQUATOR network and released from 16 March to 22 March 2020, using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Revised Impact of Event Scale (IES-R). A convenience sample of 1105 Greek parents of children with or without chronic or severe underlying disorders was enrolled, identified by a network of collaborating paediatricians across the country, and invited via personal emails. RESULTS: The participation rate was 91.6% and the completion rate was 100%. A total of 178 (16.1%) of the participants had children with underlying disorders (198 affected children in total). Parents of children with underlying disorders had significantly higher stress levels than those of healthy children (PSS 21.22  5.06 vs 19.02  6.85, p <0.001; IES-R 40.71  11.58 v. 35.86  12.69, p <0.001), particularly those caring for children with cardiovascular or respiratory disorders, or immunodeficiencies. The presence of children with underlying disorders was a strong predictor of PSS and IES-R scores, independently of parental sex, age, education and place of residence. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of COVID-19 outbreak on parental stress is substantial, and those caring for children with underlying disorders are more profoundly affected. Pending the global socioeconomic rebooting after the pandemic, the possible short- and long-term consequences of parental stress should not be ignored. As for other vulnerable groups, accurate health information and resources for psychological support should be provided to parents, especially those caring for children with underlying disorders.","output":"Parents under siege: the psychological impact of COVID-19 outbreak on children's caregivers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND There are limited data on femoropopliteal artery stent thrombosis (ST), which is a serious adverse outcome of peripheral artery interventions.

ST was more likely to occur in men (96.3% versus 82.2%; P=0.026) and to have an initial intervention for chronic total occlusions (88.5% versus 64.0%; P=0.01). There was no significant difference in ST between drug-coated and bare-metal stents (4.4% versus 3.4%; P=0.55), but the rate of ST was significantly higher with self-expanding covered stent grafts compared with bare-metal stents (10.6% versus 3.4%; P=0.02). ST was significantly associated with an increased risk of 12-month major adverse limb events (hazard ratio, 4.99; 95% confidence interval, 2.31-10.77; P<0.001) compared with no ST. On multivariate analysis, treatment of chronic total occlusion lesions (odds ratio, 3.46; 95% confidence interval, 0.98-12.20; P=0.05) and in-stent restenosis lesions (odds ratio, 5.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.83-15.32; P=0.002) were independently associated with an increased risk of ST.

We retrospectively reviewed serological evaluations drawn during the follow-up of severe or critical laboratory-proven COVID-19 patients hospitalized at a large academic hospital. Specific IgG titers were measured using a chemiluminescent assay targeting anti-spike and anti-nucleocapsid protein IgG. The influence of time, demographic factors, clinical and paraclinical characteristics, and COVID-19 therapeutics on IgG levels were assessed through linear regression using a mixed-effect model, and delay until IgG negativation through a Weibull regression model. The cohort included 116 patients with a total of 154 IgG measurements drawn at a median of 79 days after diagnosis. IgG antibodies were increased with age (p = 0.005) and decreased significantly over time (p = 0.0002). Using elapsed time and age as covariates, we demonstrated higher IgG levels in patients with a higher body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.0026) and lower IgG levels in immunocompromised patients (p = 0.032). A high BMI was further found to delay and immunodeficiency to hasten significantly seronegativation, whereas no significant effect was observed with corticosteroids. These data highlight the waning over time of IgG antibodies after severe or critical COVID-19. Age, BMI, and immunosuppression also appear to influence the IgG kinetics, while short-term corticotherapy does not. Those data improve the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 serology while further research should determine the determinants of long-term seroprotection.","output":"Determinants of IgG antibodies kinetics after severe and critical COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a disease caused by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), is a particular threat to old people. At the end of March 2020, the first and so far largest outbreak of the disease occurred in a retirement home in Hamburg. Methods: Analysis of procedures in dealing with a residential unit affected by SARS-CoV-2, accommodating a risk group of 60 seniors with dementia is presented as well as a detailed presentation of post-mortem examination results of all 8 deceased tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Results: Out of 60 residents, 39 were infected by SARS-CoV-2. Due to preventive procedures it was possible to stop further spreading of the infection to other residential areas. In all 8 fatal cases, the autopsy diagnosis was death due to COVID-19. Autopsies revealed all COVID-19 patients to have a fatal (broncho)pneumonia and signs of relevant pre-existing cardiac, renal and pulmonary conditions in all cases. In 75% (na?= 6) of the cases a fresh venous thrombosis was found. In 66.7% (na?= 4) of the cases thrombotic events were combined with peripheral pulmonary artery thromboembolisms. Conclusion: The cohort of SARS-CoV-2 infected residents of a nursing home is characteristic for clinical and epidemiological features of the new coronavirus disease. Due to a centralized evaluation of all fatalities at the Institute of Legal Medicine in Hamburg, a detailed examination of all deceased positive for SARS-CoV-2 was possible. Thereby, increased case fatality rates of approximately 20% could in all cases be assigned to a relevant number of pre-existing comorbidities of multiple organ systems, which was consistent with the clinical data available.","output":"Der erste COVID-19-Hotspot in einer Hamburger Senioreneinrichtung: Pr?ventionskonzept, Letalit?t und Obduktionsbefunde./ [The first COVID-19 hotspot in a retirement home in Hamburg]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Various surgical societies constantly update their recommendations in order to adapt surgical activity on current Pandemic conditions.

Monitoring progress through serial sero-surveys, particularly at household level, in densely populated urban communities can provide insights in areas where testing is non-uniform. Methods Two serial cross-sectional household surveys were performed in April (phase 1) and June (phase 2) 2020 each in a low- (District Malir) and high-transmission (District East) area of Karachi, Pakistan. Household were selected using simple random sampling (Malir) and systematic random sampling (East). Individual participation rate from consented households was 82.3% (1000/1215 eligible) in phase 1 and 76.5% (1004/1312 eligible) in phase 2. All household members or their legal guardians answered questions related to symptoms of Covid-19 and provided blood for testing with commercial Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay targeting combined IgG and IgM. Seroprevalence estimates were computed for each area and time point independently. Given correlation among household seropositivity values, a Bayesian regression model accounting for household membership, age and gender was used to estimate seroprevalence. These estimates by age and gender were then post-stratified to adjust for the demographic makeup of the respective district. The household conditional risk of infection was estimated for each district and its confidence interval were obtained using a non-parametric bootstrap of households. Findings Post-stratified seroprevalence was estimated to be 0.2% (95% CI 0-0.7) in low-and 0.4% (95% CI 0 - 1.3) in high-transmission areas in phase 1 and 8.7% (95% CI 5.1-13.1) in low- and 15.1% (95% CI 9.4 -21.7) in high-transmission areas in phase 2, with no consistent patterns between prevalence rates for males and females. Conditional risk of infection estimates (possible only for phase 2) were 0.31 (95% CI 0.16-0.47) in low- and 0.41(95% CI 0.28-0.52) in high-transmission areas. Of the 166 participants who tested positive, only 9(5.4%) gave a history of any symptoms. Interpretation A large increase in seroprevalence to SARS-CoV-2 infection is seen, even in areas where transmission is reported to be low. Mostly the population is still seronegative. A large majority of seropositives do not report any symptoms. The probability that an individual in a household is infected, given that another household member is infected is high in both the areas. These results emphasise the need to enhance surveillance activities of COVID-19 especially in low-transmission sites and provide insights to risks of household transmission in tightly knit neighbourhoods in urban LMIC settings.","output":"Serial population based serosurvey of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in a low and high transmission area of Karachi, Pakistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We conducted a systematic review and a meta-analysis to assess the association of anticoagulants and their dosage with in-hospital all-cause mortality in COVID-19 patients.

Data were combined using the general variance-based method on the effect estimate for each study. Separate meta-analyses according to type of COVID-19 patients (hospitalized or intensive care unit [ICU] patients), anticoagulants (mainly heparin), and regimens (therapeutic or prophylactic) were conducted.

The majority of studies were of good quality; however, 34% did not distinguish heparin from other anticoagulants. Meta-analysis on 25,719 hospitalized COVID-19 patients showed that anticoagulant use was associated with 50% reduced in-hospital mortality risk (pooled risk ratio [RR]: 0.50, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.40-0.62; I 2: 87%). Both anticoagulant regimens (therapeutic and prophylactic) reduced in-hospital all-cause mortality, compared with no anticoagulation.

Prison staff and prison residents should be considered a priority. Prison staff are essential workers and absenteeism should be minimized to enable safe and decent regimes. They play a pivotal role in SARS-CoV2 transmission within prison, contributing to disease spread. Prison residents are characterized by high burden of underlying disease, including non-communicable diseases. Furthermore, it is difficult to effectively protect prison populations by means of infection prevention and control and non-pharmaceutical measures, due to the constraints of the prison system. Methods Evidence on the inclusion of prison population within national SARS-CoV2 vaccination plans, level of implementation and models of vaccine delivery in prison settings is being collected through a questionnaire developed and disseminated within the European research project Reaching the hard-to-reach: Increasing access and vaccine uptake among prison population in Europe -RISE-Vac. Results and discussion There are notable differences between countries across Europe regarding inclusion in and priority attributed to prison residents and staff within national vaccination plans. Several challenges have been identified for the implementation of SARS-CoV2 vaccination programs in prison. Conclusions Suboptimal healthcare delivery and information systems with poor links to community systems are a major issue to overcome to ensure accurate and timely monitoring of vaccination. Prison residents are highly heterogeneous when it comes to age, ethnicity, level of education and health literacy. Ensuring their meaningful engagement is key to high vaccine uptake.

The location and properties of the FPs in the spike (S) glycoproteins of different coronaviruses (CoV) have not yet been determined. Through amino acid sequence analysis of S proteins of representative CoVs, we identified a common region as a possible FP (pFP) that shares the characteristics of FPs of class I viral fusion proteins, including high Ala/Gly content, intermediate hydrophobicity, and few charged residues. To test the hypothesis that this region contains the CoV FP, we systemically mutated every residue in the pFP of Middle East respiratory syndrome betacoronavirus (MERS-CoV) and found that 11 of the 22 residues in the pFP (from G953 to L964, except for A956) were essential for S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and virus entry. The synthetic MERS-CoV pFP core peptide (955IAGVGWTAGL964) induced extensive fusion of liposome membranes, while mutant peptide failed to induce any lipid mixing. We also selectively mutated residues in pFPs of two other -CoVs, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Although the amino acid sequences of these two pFPs differed significantly from that of MERS-CoV and each other, most of the pFP mutants of SARS-CoV and MHV also failed to mediate membrane fusion, suggesting that these pFPs are also the functional FPs. Thus, the FPs of 3 different lineages of -CoVs are conserved in location within the S glycoproteins and in their functions, although their amino acid sequences have diverged significantly during CoV evolution. IMPORTANCE Within the class I viral fusion proteins of many enveloped viruses, the FP is the critical mediator of fusion of the viral envelope with host cell membranes leading to virus infection. FPs from within a virus family, like influenza viruses or human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV), tend to share high amino acid sequence identity. In this study, we determined the location and amino acid sequences of the FPs of S glycoproteins of 3 -CoVs, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and MHV, and demonstrated that they were essential for mediating cell-cell fusion and virus entry. Interestingly, in marked contrast to the FPs of influenza and HIV, the primary amino acid sequences of the FPs of -CoVs in 3 different lineages differed significantly. Thus, during evolution the FPs of -CoVs have diverged significantly in their primary sequences while maintaining the same essential biological functions. Our findings identify a potential new target for development of drugs against CoVs.","output":"Identification of the Fusion Peptide-Containing Region in Betacoronavirus Spike Glycoproteins."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anecdotal reports and clinical observations have recently emerged suggesting a relationship between COVID-19 disease and stroke, highlighting the possibility that infected individuals may be more susceptible to cerebrovascular events.

MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the data of patients who had a renal tumor in a solitary kidney, and underwent renal cryoablation and partial nephrectomy between December 2000 and January 2012. Renal tumor complexity was categorized into 3 groups by R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry score as low (4 to 6), intermediate (7 to 9) and high (10 to 12). All baseline demographic data, perioperative parameters and followup data including renal function were collected. Comparisons were made among similar tumor complexities. RESULTS In the renal cryoablation and partial nephrectomy groups 29 patients (43 tumors) and 33 patients were identified, respectively. In all renal tumor complexities, renal cryoablation provided a better perioperative outcome in terms of median operative time, estimated blood loss, transfusion, hospital stay and complications. The median change in serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate was slightly greater in the partial nephrectomy group. However, the differences were not statistically significant for any of the tumor complexities. Three patients (10%) in the renal cryoablation group and 2 (6%) in the partial nephrectomy group required long-term dialysis. CONCLUSIONS In patients with solitary kidneys, renal cryoablation is associated with superior perioperative outcomes compared to partial nephrectomy.

Eleven male basketball players performed a Y-shaped agility test, 5 m and 20 m sprints, a 505 Agility test, squat, countermovement and drop jumps, and simple and two-choice reaction time tests. The results revealed a significant relationship between the time in Y-shaped agility test and 5 m sprint time (r = 0.795, p = 0.003, R2 = 0.632), 20 m sprint time (r = 0.676, p = 0.022, R2 = 0.457), and reactive strength index (r = ?0.619, p = 0.042, R2 = 0.383), but not with simple and choice-based reaction times.

The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a potential target for treatment of COVID-19 due to its critical role in maturation of viral proteins and subsequent viral replication. Conceptually and technically, targeting therapy against Mpro is similar to target therapy to treat cancer. Previous studies show that GC376, a broad-spectrum dipeptidyl Mpro inhibitor, efficiently blocks the proliferation of many animal and human coronaviruses including SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). Due to the conservation of structure and catalytic mechanism of coronavirus main protease, repurposition of GC376 against SARS-CoV-2 may be an effective way for the treatment of COVID-19 in humans. To validate this conjecture, the binding affinity and IC50 value of Mpro with GC376 was determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay, respectively. The results showed that GC376 binds to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro tightly (KD = 1.6 M) and efficiently inhibit its proteolytic activity (IC50 = 0.89 M). We also elucidate the high-resolution structure of dimeric SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in complex with GC376. The cocrystal structure showed that GC376 and the catalytic Cys145 of Mpro covalently linked through forming a hemithioacetal group and releasing a sulfonic acid group. Because GC376 is already known as a broad-spectrum antiviral medication and successfully used in animal, it will be a suitable candidate for anti-COVID-19 treatment.","output":"Structural basis of SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibition by a broad-spectrum anti-coronaviral drug."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Albeit primarily a disease of respiratory tract, the 2019 coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) has been found to have causal association with a plethora of neurological and neuropsychological effects.

Although evidence analysing immediate effects is expanding, repercussions following lockdown measures remain poorly understood. This systematic review aims to analyse biopsychosocial consequences after lockdown measures end according to short, medium, and long-term impacts. Methods: PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were searched from inception to January 12, 2021. Reference lists were manually reviewed. Eligible studies analysed biopsychosocial functioning after lockdown measures secondary to recent infectious outbreaks ended. Lockdown measures were defined as quarantine, isolation, workplace or educational closures, social or physical distancing, and national or local closure of public institutions deemed non-essential. Studies exclusively researching outcomes during lockdown measures, examined infectious participants, or analysed lockdown measures not pertaining to an infectious outbreak were excluded. Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed bias with a third resolving discrepancies. Data was extracted from published reports with further information requested from authors where necessary. The mixed methods appraisal tool assessed study quality, languages were restricted to English, German, Italian, and French and narrative synthesis was applied. Results: Of 5149 identified studies, 40 were eligible for inclusion. Psychological distress, economic repercussions, social, biological, and behavioural ramifications were observed. Short to medium-term effects comprised reactions relating to early trauma processing whereas medium to long-term repercussions manifested in maladaptive behaviours and mental health deterioration. Increased alcohol intake, stigmatisation, and economic effects were also identified consequences. High-risk groups included health care workers, children, elderly, inpatients, those with pre-existing psychiatric diagnoses, and socially isolated individuals. Conclusions: Supporting vulnerable groups and offering education, workplace modifications, financial, and social assistance may mitigate negative repercussions. Establishing a rapid and comprehensive evidence base appraising the efficacy of such interventions and identifying areas for development is essential. This review was limited by study heterogeneity and lack of randomisation in available literature. Given the unprecedented nature and progression of COVID-19, the relevance of previous outcomes remains uncertain.

Increasing emphasis has been put on individuals personal development, since they play key mediating roles in organisations work practices.

In order to illuminate this, the article draws on the learning experiences of two workers with different roles at two points in time across different workplaces. The author argues that individual learning involves a complex interaction of individual positions, identities and agency towards learning. This complexity is relational and interrelated with the workplace learning culture, which is why learning is different for individuals in different workplaces and even for the same person in the same workplace when occupying different roles.","output":"Learning journey: Conceptualising change over time as a dimension of workplace learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An unusual brownish pigmentation of the pelvis and lower limbs in infants which can be easily removed with a towel, to reappear after a few hours was described The arcane clarifies when a manufacturer of baby cleaning wipes withdrew a lot from the market, holding it responsible for the phenomenon","output":"An unusual pseudomelanosis in toddlers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current COVID-19 pandemic has shown that, decision-making authorities lack tools that would allow them to make informed decisions on the introduction of quarantine measures related to either holdingor canceling mass events in buildings.

This article describes the mathematical basic principles aimed at creating a software package for assessing the likelihood of contracting a viral infection transmitted by airborne droplets in massively occupied buildings. Evaluation of the likelihood of COVID-19 infection in public places is possible based on a joint analysis of the results of the people movement simulation, air circulation and the spread of aerosols from a carrier of the infection, taking into account the applied methods of protection (masks, ventilation). It is required to develop methods for assessing the danger of COVID-19 infection from a carrier of the virus and the methods of protection used (masks, ventilation) in specific public places. Simultaneously, the movement of people in accordance with the mode of operation, air movement (including ventilation systems) and the spread of respiratory aerosols needs to be accounted for. ?

Arguably, the primary value of medical imaging for COVID-19 lies rather on patient prognosis. Radiological images can guide physicians assessing the severity of the disease, and a series of images from the same patient at different stages can help to gauge disease progression. Based on these premises, a simple method based on lung-pathology features for scoring disease severity from Chest X-rays is proposed here. As the primary contribution, this method shows to be correlated to patient severity in different stages of disease progression comparatively well when contrasted with other existing methods. An original approach for data selection is also proposed, allowing the simple model to learn the severity-related features. It is hypothesized that the resulting competitive performance presented here is related to the method being feature-based rather than reliant on lung involvement or compromise as others in the literature. The fact that it is simpler and interpretable than other end-to-end, more complex models, also sets aside this work. As the data set is small, bias-inducing artifacts that could lead to overfitting are minimized through an image normalization and lung segmentation step at the learning phase. A second contribution comes from the validation of the results, conceptualized as the scoring of patients groups from different stages of the disease. Besides performing such validation on an independent data set, the results were also compared with other proposed scoring methods in the literature. The expressive results show that although imaging alone is not sufficient for assessing severity as a whole, there is a strong correlation with the scoring system, termed as MAVIDH score, with patient outcome.","output":"MAVIDH Score: A COVID-19 Severity Scoring using Chest X-Ray Pathology Features"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective This study was aimed to describe the hospitalization and early postpartum psychological experience for asymptomatic obstetric patients tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) as part of a universal testing program and report the impact of this program on labor and delivery health care workers' job satisfaction and workplace anxiety. Study Design This is a cohort study of asymptomatic pregnant women who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing between April 13, 2020 and April 26, 2020. Semistructured interviews were conducted via telephone at 1 and 2 weeks posthospitalization to assess maternal mental health. Depression screening was conducted using the patient health questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2). An online survey of labor and delivery health care workers assessed job satisfaction and job-related anxiety before and during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as employees' subjective experience with universal testing. Patient and employee responses were analyzed for recurring themes. Results A total of 318 asymptomatic women underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing during this 2-week period. Six of the eight women (75%) who tested positive reported negative in-hospital experiences secondary to perceived lack of provider and partner support and neonatal separation after birth. Among the 310 women who tested negative, 34.4% of multiparous women reported increased postpartum anxiety compared with their prior deliveries due to concerns about infectious exposure in the hospital and lack of social support. Only 27.6% of women, tested negative, found their test result to be reassuring. Job satisfaction and job-related anxiety among health care workers were negatively affected. Universal testing was viewed favorably by the majority of health care workers despite concerns about delays or alterations in patient care and maternal and neonatal separation. Conclusion Universal testing for SARS-CoV-2 in obstetric units has mixed effects on maternal mental health but is viewed favorably by labor and delivery employees. Ongoing evaluation of new testing protocols is paramount to balance staff and patient safety with quality and equality of care. Key Points: Women with SARS-CoV-2 had a negative hospital experience.

Physical rehabilitation plays a fundamental role for stroke patients to recover mobility and improve quality of life. This process is costly, considering that patients must attend face-to-face rehabilitation sessions in hospitals or rehabilitation centers. Plus, there is a lack of specialized medical staff, who are usually insufficient to properly address the growing number of stroke patients that need physical rehabilitation. This situation has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, as some of the human resources have been devoted to fight against the pandemic, and the physical presence of rehabilitation patients in hospitals has been severely limited. This paper proposes PhyRe Up!, a novel remote rehabilitation system that uses mixed reality and gamification techniques. PhyRe Up! has been devised for stroke patients to perform therapeutic exercises at home, with great precision, and with the potential supervision of clinicians. The system aims to increase the patient's motivation as well as maintaining the quality of performance for the exercises, similar to the obtained levels when attending face-to-face sessions with therapists. The underlying architecture combines declarative, procedural, and conditional knowledge to manage the rehabilitation process, which offers flexibility and scalability to enhance the capabilities of the proposed system. Experimental results highlight how the combination of mixed reality and gamification significantly influences the accuracy of rehabilitation exercises previously defined by therapists. Particularly, the conducted experiments in the first validation phase of PhyRe Up! shows that our proposal drastically reduces the intermediate steps required to complete an exercise thanks to the provided visual feedback. The accuracy with which the patient performs the assessed exercise for the first time is greater than when using traditional rehabilitation techniques.","output":"PhyRe Up!

Simulation provides a safe setting in which to evaluate a new checklist. The objective of this study was to determine if the use of a novel peri-intubation checklist would decrease practitioners rates of omission of tasks during simulated airway management scenarios. METHODS: Fifty-four emergency medicine (EM) practitioners from two academic centers were randomized to either their usual approach or use of our checklist, then completed three simulated airway management scenarios. A minimum of two assessors documented the number of tasks omitted and the time until definitive airway management. Discrepancies between assessors were resolved by single assessor video review. Participants also completed a post-simulation survey. RESULTS: The average percentage of omitted tasks over three scenarios was 45.7% in the control group (n = 25) and 13.5% in the checklist group (n = 29)an absolute difference of 32.2% (95% CI 27.8, 36.6%).

To manipulate probe value, one item was indicated as more valuable than the rest prior to encoding (i.e., worth more notional points), or all items were indicated as equally valuable. To guide refreshing, in some trials, two arrows were presented during maintenance, each arrow cueing the spatial location of one item. Participants were told to \\"think of\\" (i.e., refresh) the cued item. If value boosts are driven by attentional refreshing, cueing an item to be refreshed should enhance performance for items that are of low or equal value, but not items of high value, as these items would be refreshed regardless of the cue.

We hypothesized that senescent cells (SnCs) play a central role in this age-associated pathology in part due to their expression of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which may prime SnCs to inflammatory stimulation. To test this hypothesis, we examined the expression of various inflammatory cytokines and chemokines at the levels of gene transcription and protein production in various SnCs in vitro in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interleukin-1 (IL1), and tumor necrosis factor  (TNF) stimulation. We found that SnCs not only expressed higher basal levels of various inflammatory cytokines and chemokines as a manifestation of the SASP, but more importantly exhibited hyper-activation of the induction of a variety of inflammatory mediators in response to LPS, IL1 and TNF stimulation as compared with non-SnCs. This senescence-associated hyper-activation is likely mediated in part via the p38MAPK (p38) and NFB pathways because LPS stimulation elicited significantly higher levels of p38 phosphorylation and NFB p65 nuclear translation in SnCs when compared to their non-senescent counterparts and inhibition of these pathways with losmapimod (a p38 specific inhibitor) and BMS-345541 (a selective NFB inhibitor) attenuated LPS-induced expression of IL6, TNF, CCL5, and IL1 mRNA in SnCs.

Cancer immunotherapy represents the most promising treatment strategy due to its high efficacy and selectivity and lower side effects compared with traditional treatment. The identification of tumor T cell antigens is one of the most important tasks for antitumor vaccines development and molecular function investigation. Although several machine learning predictors have been developed to identify tumor T cell antigen, more accurate tumor T cell antigen identification by existing methodology is still challenging. METHODS: In this study, we used a non-redundant dataset of 592 tumor T cell antigens (positive samples) and 393 tumor T cell antigens (negative samples). Four types feature encoding methods have been studied to build an efficient predictor, including amino acid composition, global protein sequence descriptors and grouped amino acid and peptide composition. To improve the feature representation ability of the hybrid features, we further employed a two-step feature selection technique to search for the optimal feature subset. The final prediction model was constructed using random forest algorithm. RESULTS: Finally, the top 263 informative features were selected to train the random forest classifier for detecting tumor T cell antigen peptides. iTTCA-RF provides satisfactory performance, with balanced accuracy, specificity and sensitivity values of 83.71%, 78.73% and 88.69% over tenfold cross-validation as well as 73.14%, 62.67% and 83.61% over independent tests, respectively.

The hospital management decided to initiate the work-from-home arrangement as a non-pharmaceutical intervention of handling the spread of the disease amongst its employees. Fatima Almur, the Information Technology Director in Al-Ain Hospital, asked the Application Support Manager, Aysha Shahwan, to deploy some IT tools significant for remote support to patient care within two weeks. Shahwan faced significant challenges in deploying the IT tools in two weeks given the diverse workforce, with the majority of them having limited knowledge in operating the tools, and hence, their apprehension in the usefulness of the tools. Besides, Shahwan had to deploy some advanced tools for easy and secured access to the electronic health record, telemedicine and telecommuting using mobile phones, tablets or PCs. The deployment of these advanced tools would be jeopardised by employee acceptance and consequent dwindling productivity.

However, vaccine protectionism by wealthy nations has limited progress towards vaccine sharing goals. For example, as of April 2022 only ~20% of the population in Africa has received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose. Here we use a two-nation coupled epidemic model to evaluate optimal vaccine-sharing policies given a selfish objective: in which countries with vaccine stockpiles aim to minimize fatalities in their own populations. Despite the selfish objective, we find it is often optimal for a donor nation to share a significant fraction of its vaccine stockpile. Mechanistically, sharing a vaccine stockpile reduces the intensity of outbreaks in the recipient nation, in turn reducing travel-associated incidence in the donor nation. This effect is intensified as vaccination rates decrease and epidemic coupling increases. Despite acting selfishly, vaccine sharing by a donor nation significantly reduces transmission and fatalities in the recipient nation. Moreover, we find that there are hybrid sharing policies that have a negligible effect on fatalities in the donor nation compared to the optimal policy while significantly reducing fatalities in the recipient nation.

Alkbh8 modifies tRNA selenocysteine (tRNASec) to translationally regulate the production of glutathione peroxidases (Gpx's) and other selenoproteins, with Gpx enzymes known to play protective roles during APAP toxicity. We demonstrate that APAP increases toxicity and markers of damage, and decreases selenoprotein levels in Alkbh8 deficient mouse livers, when compared to wildtype. APAP also promotes large scale reprogramming of many RNA marks comprising the liver tRNA epitranscriptome including: 5-methoxycarbonylmethyluridine (mcm5U), isopentenyladenosine (i6A), pseudouridine (), and 1-methyladenosine (m1A) modifications linked to tRNASec and many other tRNA's. Alkbh8 deficiency also leads to wide-spread epitranscriptomic dysregulation in response to APAP, demonstrating that a single writer defect can promote downstream changes to a large spectrum of RNA modifications. Our study highlights the importance of RNA modifications and translational responses to APAP, identifies writers as key modulators of stress responses in vivo and supports the idea that the epitranscriptome may play important roles in responses to pharmaceuticals.","output":"Epitranscriptomic Reprogramming Is Required to Prevent Stress and Damage from Acetaminophen."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The final speaker, B Peter Hartwig b , film producer from Babelsberg, reflected on the impact of his fiction film \\"System Crasher\\" (2019), which has raised awareness of problems in the German childcare and therapy system.

Thus, when the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic started, TCM was officially incorporated as a strategy by the National Health Commission (NHC) for the treatment of COVID-19 infection. TCMs were used to treat COVID-19 and had a significant effect on alleviating symptoms, delaying disease progression, improving the cure rate, and reducing the mortality rate in China. Therefore, Chinas National Health Commission officially approved Qingfei Paidu decoction, Xuanfei Baidu decoction, Huashi Baidu decoction, Lianhua Qingwen capsules, Jinhua Qinggan granules, and Xuebijing for COVID-19 treatment. This review evaluates and summarizes the use of TCMs against infectious diseases and the composition, clinical efficacy, and mechanisms of the NHC-approved three Chinese medicines and three Chinese recipes for COVID-19 treatment. The three Chinese medicines and three Chinese recipes have been demonstrated to be highly effective against COVID-19, but there is a lack of in vivo or in vitro evidence. Most of the available data related to the potential mechanism of the three Chinese medicines and three Chinese recipes is based on virtual simulation or prediction, which is acquired via molecular docking and network pharmacology analysis. These predictions have not yet been proven. Therefore, there is a need for high-quality in vivo and in vitro and clinical studies by employing new strategies and technologies such as genomics, metabolomics, and proteomics to verify the predicted mechanisms of these drugs effects on COVID-19.","output":"Composition, Clinical Efficiency, and Mechanism of NHC-Approved Three Chinese Medicines and Three Chinese Recipes for COVID-19 Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Differences in obtaining a vaccine vary based on a multitude of factors including perceptions of vaccine safety, efficacy and willingness to pay (WTP). This study focuses on parent perceptions toward a vaccine for COVID-19 including their WTP decisions for their children and themselves. A mixed methods design using a cross-sectional survey was used to assess the perceptions of US parents, with children under 18, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was administered online in November 2020 and 584 final responses were collected. The questionnaire consisted of approximately 37 closed and open-ended questions regarding personal background information;awareness, knowledge, and experience of the virus;perception toward vaccines and COVID-19;and the contingent valuation of a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. WTP was found to be higher for children and a direct relationship between the number of children and WTP was observed. Parents were willing to pay US$228-$291 for a vaccine for themselves and US$243-US$321 for their children. A positive impact on WTP was found with self-reported parent health status but not children. The findings of this study have important implications for policy programs which require detailed cost-benefit analyses.

Left unmanaged, uncoordinated charging of electric vehicles (EVs) at increased levels of penetration will amplify existing peak loads, potentially outstripping the grid's capacity to reliably meet demand. In this paper, we report findings from the OptimizEV Project - a real-world pilot study in Upstate New York exploring a novel approach to coordinated residential EV charging. The proposed coordination mechanism seeks to harness the latent flexibility in EV charging by offering EV owners monetary incentives to delay the time required to charge their EVs. Each time an EV owner initiates a charging session, they specify how long they intend to leave their vehicle plugged in by selecting from a menu of deadlines that offers lower electricity prices the longer they're willing to delay the time required to charge their EV. Given a collection of active charging requests, a smart charging system dynamically optimizes the power being drawn by each EV in real time to minimize strain on the grid, while ensuring that each customer's car is fully charged by its deadline. Under the proposed incentive mechanism, we find that customers are frequently willing to engage in optimized charging sessions, allowing the system to delay the completion of their charging requests by more than eight hours on average. Using the flexibility provided by customers, the smart charging system was shown to be highly effective in shifting the majority of EV charging loads off-peak to fill the night-time valley of the aggregate load curve. Customer opt-in rates remained stable over the span of the study, providing empirical evidence in support of the proposed coordination mechanism as a potentially viable\\"non-wires alternative\\"to meet the increased demand for electricity driven growing EV adoption.","output":"Achieving Reliable Coordination of Residential Plug-in Electric Vehicle Charging: A Pilot Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: During the COVID pandemic, many hospitals had to mobilize reinforcement healthcare workers, especially in intensive care (ICUs). We investigated the perceptions and experiences of reinforcement workers deployed to ICUs, and the impact of deployment on their personal and professional lives. METHODS: For this qualitative study, a random sample of 30 reinforcement workers was drawn from 4 centres participating in the larger PsyCOVID-ICU study. Individual semi-structured interviews were held, recorded, transcribed and analyzed by thematic analysis. RESULTS: Thirty interviews were performed from April to May 2021 (22 nurses, 2 anesthesiology nurses, 6 nurses aides). Average age was 36.89.5 years; 7 participants had no ICU experience. Four major themes emerged, namely: (1) Difficulties with integration, especially for those with no ICU experience; (2) lack of training; (3) difficulties with management, notably a feeling of insufficient communication; (4) Mental distress relating to the unusual work and fear of contaminating their entourage. CONCLUSION: Healthcare workers deployed as reinforcements to ICUs at the height of the pandemic had a unique experience of the crisis, and identified important gaps in organisation and preparation.

To better understand the purpose, and pressures and constraints for designing new ED facilities, we developed an abstraction hierarchy model as part of a work domain analysis (WDA) from the cognitive work analysis (CWA) framework. The abstraction hierarchy provides a model of the structure of the ED, encompassing the core objects, processes, and functions relating to key values and the ED's overall purpose. METHODS Reviews of relevant national and state policy, guidelines, and protocol documents applicable to care delivery in the ED were used to construct a WDA. The model was validated through focus groups with ED clinicians and subsequently validated using a series of WDA prompts. RESULTS The model shows that the ED system exhibits extremely interconnected and complex features. Heavily connected functions introduce vulnerability into the system with function performance determined by resource availability and prioritization, leading to a trade-off between time and safety priorities. CONCLUSIONS While system processes (e.g., triage, fast-track) support care delivery in ED, this delivery manifests in complex ways due to the personal and disease characteristics of patients and the dynamic state of the ED system. The model identifies system constraints that create tension in care delivery processes (e.g., electronic data entry, computer availability) potentially compromising patient safety.

Vaccination in the setting of transplantation is a complex issue. Owing to the chronic immunocompromised state in a transplant recipient, the immunogenicity of the vaccines is expected to be attenuated. Immunizing pretransplant patients will also be a challenge, as chronic kidney disease is also an immunocompromised state causing a lower seroconversion rate. The protective immune response generated is also expected to fade earlier. Enumerable psychosocial barriers exist regarding vaccine acceptance and a tender bond between health care providers and patients is essential for the smooth conduct of the vaccination program. The tolerability and safety profile of different available vaccines are reassuring in the general population but more data are needed in transplant communities. In addition, the efficacy data of COVID-19 vaccines are derived from the general population and preliminary reports in transplant patients have shown weakened immune response to vaccination. As of May 2021, Indian government advisories have approved three vaccines: COVIDSHIELD, COVAXIN, and Sputnik. Hence, research on vaccine efficacy with different vaccine constituents, dosing, and intervals is necessary for an effective protocol for vaccination in transplantation. ? 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

However, production challenges, supply shortages and unequal global reach, together with an increased number of breakthrough infections due to waning of immunity and the emergence of new variants of concern (VOC), have prolonged the pandemic. To boost the immune response, several heterologous vaccination regimes have been tested and have shown increased antibody responses compared to homologous vaccination. Here we evaluated the effect of mRNA vaccine booster on immunogenicity in individuals who had been vaccinated with two doses of inactivated vaccines. MethodsThe levels of specific antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein from wild-type virus and the Beta, Delta and Omicron variants were measured in healthy individuals who had received two doses of homologous inactivated (BBIBP-CorV or CoronoVac) or mRNA (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273) vaccines, and in donors who were given an mRNA vaccine boost after two doses of either vaccine. Pre-vaccinated healthy donors, or individuals who had been infected and subsequently received the mRNA vaccine were also included as controls. In addition, specific memory B and T cell responses were measured in a subset of samples. ResultsA booster dose of an mRNA vaccine significantly increased the specific antibody response to the wild-type and VOCs including Omicron (by 14-fold), in individuals who had previously received two doses of inactivated vaccines. The levels of specific antibodies in the heterologous vaccination group were similar to those in individuals receiving a third dose of homologous mRNA vaccines or boosted with mRNA vaccine after natural infection. Furthermore, this heterologous vaccination regime significantly improved the specific memory B and T cell responses. ConclusionsHeterologous prime-boost immunization with inactivated vaccine followed by an mRNA vaccine boost markedly increased the levels of specific antibodies and B and T cell responses and may thus increase protection against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants including Omicron.","output":"Heterologous vaccination with inactivated and mRNA vaccines increases B and T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"TV serials are a popular source of entertainment.

Economic rationale suggests that the decision on which workers are fired should depend on productivity-related individual factors. However, from hiring situations we know that discriminationi.e., decisions driven by characteristics unrelated to productivityis widespread in Western labor markets. Drawing on representative survey data on forced layoffs and short-time work collected in Germany between April and December 2020, this study highlights that discrimination against immigrants is also present in firing situations. The analysis shows that employees with a migration background are significantly more likely to lose their job than native workers when otherwise healthy firms are unexpectedly forced to let go of part of their workforce, while firms make more efforts to substitute firing with short-time working schemes for their native workers. Adjusting for detailed job-related characteristics shows that the findings are unlikely to be driven by systematic differences in productivity between migrants and natives. Moreover, using industry-specific variation in the extent of the economic downturn, I demonstrate that layoff probabilities hardly differ across the less affected industries, but that the gap between migrants and natives increases with the magnitude of the shock. In the hardest-hit industries, job loss probability among migrants is three times higher than among natives. This confirms the hypothesis that firing discrimination puts additional pressure on the immigrant workforce in times of crisis.","output":"Firing discrimination: Selective labor market responses of firms during the COVID-19 economic crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Orbitocerebral impalement by inanimate objects is a relatively uncommon event.

Our data suggested that the wild-type and L84S variant ORF8 structures are highly stable over a wide temperature range. Both proteins displayed an aggregated conformation at higher temperature that reverted when the temperature was decreased to room temperature. Moreover, ORF8 precipitated at acidic pH and this precipitation was reversed when the solution pH was shifted to neutral.

Many screening efforts utilize the CDC RT-PCR based assay which targets two regions of the novel Coronavirus nucleocapsid gene. The standard approach of testing each person individually, however, poses a financial burden to these institutions and is therefore a barrier to using testing for re-opening. Pooling samples from multiple individuals into a single test is an attractive alternate approach that promises significant cost savings - however the of specificity and sensitivity of such approaches needs to be assessed prior to deployment. To this end, we conducted a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of analyzing samples in pools of eight by the established RT-PCR assay. Participants (1,576) were recruited from amongst the Tufts University community undergoing regular screening. Each volunteer provided two swabs, one analyzed separately and the other in a pool of eight.

We conclude that pooling eight samples does not negatively impact the specificity or sensitivity of the RT-PCR assay and suggest that his approach can be utilized by institutions seeking to reduce surveillance costs.","output":"Pooling for SARS-CoV2 Surveillance: Validation and Strategy for Implementation in K-12 Schools"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) is an excellent candidate to regulate remyelination based on its proposed actions in oligodendrocyte lineage cell development in conjunction with its involvement in CNS regeneration. To assess the potential for FGF2 to play a role in remyelination, we examined the expression pattern of FGF2 and FGF receptors (FGFRs) in an experimental demyelinating disease with extensive remyelination. Adult mice were intracranially injected with murine hepatitis virus strain A\\\\59 (MHV\\\\A59) to induce focally demyelinated spinal cord lesions that spontaneously remyelinate, with corresponding recovery of motor function. Using kinetic RT\\\\PCR analysis of spinal cord RNA, we found significantly increased levels of FGF2 mRNA transcripts, which peaked during the initial stage of remyelination. Analysis of tissue sections demonstrated that increased levels of FGF2 mRNA and protein were localized within demyelinated regions of white matter, including high FGF2 expression associated with astrocytes. The expression of corresponding FGF receptors was significantly increased in lesion areas during the initial stage of remyelination. In normal and lesioned white matter, oligodendrocyte lineage cells, including progenitors and mature cells, were found to express multiple FGFR types (FGFR1, FGFR2, and/or FGFR3). In addition, in lesion areas, astrocytes expressed FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3. These findings indicate that, during remyelination, FGF2 may play a role in directly regulating oligodendrocyte lineage cell responses and may also act through paracrine or autocrine effects on astrocytes, which are known to synthesize other growth factors and immunoregulatory molecules that influence oligodendrocyte lineage cells.

In addition, evidence supports that this relationship is causal. However, the mechanisms through which RSV contributes to asthma development are not understood. The INSPIRE (Infant Susceptibility to Pulmonary Infections and Asthma Following RSV Exposure) study objectives are to: 1) characterize the host phenotypic response to RSV infection in infancy and the risk of recurrent wheeze and asthma, 2) identify the immune response and lung injury patterns of RSV infection that are associated with the development of early childhood wheezing illness and asthma, and 3) determine the contribution of specific RSV strains to early childhood wheezing and asthma development. This article describes the INSPIRE study, including study aims, design, recruitment results, and enrolled population characteristics. METHODS/DESIGN: The cohort is a population based longitudinal birth cohort of term healthy infants enrolled during the first months of life over a two year period. Respiratory infection surveillance was conducted from November to March of the first year of life, through surveys administered every two weeks. In-person illness visits were conducted if infants met pre-specified criteria for a respiratory illness visit. Infants will be followed annually to ages 3-4 years for assessment of the primary endpoint: wheezing illness. Nasal, urine, stool and blood samples were collected at various time points throughout the study for measurements of host and viral factors that predict wheezing illness. Nested case-control studies will additionally be used to address other primary and secondary hypotheses. DISCUSSION: In the INSPIRE study, 1952 infants (48% female) were enrolled during the two enrollment years and follow-up will continue through 2016. The mean age of enrollment was 60 days. During winter viral season, more than 14,000 surveillance surveys were carried out resulting in 2,103 respiratory illness visits on 1189 infants. First year follow-up has been completed on over 95% percent of participants from the first year of enrollment. With ongoing follow-up for wheezing and childhood asthma outcomes, the INSPIRE study will advance our understanding of the complex causal relationship between RSV infection and early childhood wheezing and asthma.","output":"Objectives, design and enrollment results from the Infant Susceptibility to Pulmonary Infections and Asthma Following RSV Exposure Study (INSPIRE)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pengasuhan anak usia dini masih banyak dikendalikan nenek Pada masa pandemi COVID-19, nenek merupakan lansia rentan terinfeksi sehingga dituntut mampu mencegah penularan untuk dirinya sendiri dan cucunya Pencegahan penularan COVID-19 sama antara lansia, orang dewasa dan anak-anak Nenek berperan mendampingi cucunya agar terhindar dari penularan COVID-19 Jenis penelitian kualitatif Partisipan dalam penelitian ini nenek yang mengasuh cucunya karena ibunya bekerja sebanyak 25 orang Penelitian di Kecamatan wilayah pesisir pantai Kabupaten Probolinggo, Jawa Timur Analisis dengan triangulasi dan tematik analisis Hasil penelitian menunjukkan nenek mampu untuk membangun proses interaksi yang berlangsung terus menerus kepada cucunya tentang pencegahan COVID-19 Diperlukan kerja sama antara semua pihak baik dari nenek pengasuh, orang tua dari anak, tenaga kesehatan dan semua pihak agar pencegahan terhadap penularan COVID-19 efektif baik kepada anak-anak","output":"Cara Asuh Nenek Pada Anak Usia Dini Di Masa Pandemi COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Dendritic cells (DCs) play a key role in the host defence against inhaled pathogens. However, the phenotype of blood DCs in patients with acute respiratory infections is unknown. OBJECTIVE To investigate the number and the expression of function-associated molecules of blood DCs in patients with acute infectious pneumonia. METHODS Sixteen patients with acute pneumonia and 19 controls without pneumonia were included in the study. The number as well as the expression of function-associated molecules of myeloid DCs (mDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) were analysed in peripheral blood using four-colour flow cytometry. RESULTS Elevated concentrations of procalcitonin (median: 0.55 ng/ml) and the rapid response to antibiotic treatment suggested a bacterial origin of the pneumonia in the patients. Total mDC (median: 27% of the controls) and pDC counts (median: 53% of the controls) were markedly reduced in patients with pneumonia, as compared to the controls. Percentages of blood mDCs, but not pDCs, were negatively correlated with serum concentrations of C-reactive protein. Patients with pneumonia were characterised by a significantly increased expression of Fc gamma receptors (CD32 and CD64) on mDCs and the Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) on pDCs.

We compared the baseline serum iron indices (iron, ferritin, total iron\\\\binding capacity [TIBC], unsaturated iron\\\\binding capacity and percentage transferrin saturation) between CAM cases and COVID\\\\19 controls. Additionally, we performed a multivariate logistic regression analysis to assess whether any iron indices are associated with CAM. RESULTS: We enrolled 28 CAM cases (mean age 53.6 years old; 78.6% men) and 26 controls (mean age 57.2 years old; 73.1% men).

The mean serum iron values (33 vs. 45 g/dl, p = .03) and TIBC (166.6 vs. 201.6 g/dl, p = .003) were significantly lower in CAM cases than controls. On multivariate analysis, we found a lower TIBC (odds ratio [OR] 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95C0.99) and diabetes mellitus (OR 5.23; 95% CI, 1.21C22.68) to be independently associated with CAM after adjusting for serum iron, ferritin and glucocorticoid therapy. The case fatality rate of CAM was 73.9%. The iron indices were not significantly different between CAM survivors and non\\\\survivors.

The rabbit is an established animal model accepted by the FDA for studies of cardiovascular disease, lipid metabolism, the development of anticoagulants, testing of bone implants, and the development of treatments for infectious diseases such as HIV. The purpose of this study was to investigate the New Zealand White (NZW) Rabbit model as a model of acute radiation exposure because of its established similarity to human vascular, immune, and coagulation responses.Materials & Methods: Two sequential studies were performed in a total of 81 male NZW rabbits, 16-20 weeks of age. All animals underwent clinical observations and peripheral blood analyses following a single dose of 0, 6,7,8,8.5, 9, or 10 Gy of total body irradiation via a 6 MV Linear accelerator photon source on Day 0. Animals were treated with timed release fentanyl patch (Day 0-30), subcutaneous hydration (Day 1, Study 2 only), and oral sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim 30mg/kg once daily (Days 3-30) and were followed for 30 days or to time of mortality.Results: Study 1 revealed the estimated LD30, -50, -70, and -90 with 95% confidence intervals (CI) at 30 days to be 6.7 (CI:5.9-7.4) , 7.3 (CI:6.7-7.8), 7.9 (CI: 7.3-8.4), and 8.8 (CI: 7.9-9.7) Gy respectively. In study 2, a survey of blood coagulation and biochemical parameters were performed over time and necropsy. Complete blood counts taken from animals exposed to 7, 8, or 10 Gy, demonstrated dose-dependent depletion of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and platelets. Platelet counts recovered to baseline levels in survivors by Day 30, whereas lymphocyte and neutrophil counts did not. Decedent animals demonstrated Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and lymphopenia at time of death; 64% of the decedents experienced a 30% or greater drop in hematocrit. Decedent animals demonstrated more than 100% increases from serum baseline levels of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, and triglyceride levels at the time of death whereas survivors on average demonstrated modest or no elevation.Conclusion: This NZW rabbit model demonstrates dose-dependent depletion of hematopoietic parameters. The LD50/30 of 7.8 Gy (95% CI: 6.6-8.4) with supportive care appears to be close to the ranges reported for rhesus macaques (5.25-7.44 Gy) and humans (6-8 Gy) with supportive care. These findings support the utility of the NZW rabbit model for further mechanistic investigation of acute radiation exposure and medical countermeasure testing.","output":"The New Zealand White Rabbit Animal Model of Acute Radiation Syndrome: Hematopoietic and Coagulation-based Parameters by Radiation Dose Following Supportive Care."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Major depressive disorder is a debilitating mental illness and a leading cause of global disease burden. While many etiological factors have been identified, social stress is a highly prevalent causative factor for the onset of depression. Unfortunately, rates of depression continue to increase around the world, and the recent COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated this mental health crisis. Though several therapeutic strategies are available, nearly 50% of patients who receive treatment never reach remission. The exact mechanisms by which social stress exposure promotes the development of depression are unclear, making it challenging to develop novel and more effective therapeutics. However, accumulating evidence points to a role for stress-induced neuroinflammation, particularly in treatment-resistant patients. Moreover, recent evidence has expanded the concept of the pathogenesis of depression to mitochondrial dysfunction, suggesting that the combined effects of social stress on mitochondria and inflammation may synergize to facilitate stress-related depression. In this chapter, we review evidence for neuroinflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of social stress-induced depression and discuss these in the context of novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of depression.","output":"Neuroinflammation and Mitochondrial Dysfunction Link Social Stress to Depression."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted healthcare services around the world, which may have serious implications for the prognosis of patients with acute cardiovascular disease. We conducted a systematic review to assess the extent to which health services related to the care and management of acute cardiovascular events have been impacted during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: PubMed, MedRxiv and Google Scholar were searched for observational studies published up to August 12, 2020 for studies that assessed the impact of the pandemic on the care and management of people with acute CVD. RESULTS: In total, 27 articles were included. Of these, 16 examined the impact on acute coronary syndromes (ACS), eight on strokes, one on ACS and strokes, and 2 on other types of CVD. When comparing the COVID-19 period to non-COVID-19 periods, eleven studies observed a decrease in ACS admissions ranging between 40 and 50% and five studies showed a decrease in stroke admissions of between 12 and 40%. Four studies showed a larger reduction in non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions (NSTEMI) compared to ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMI). A decrease in the number of reperfusion procedures, a shortening in the lengths of stay at the hospital, and longer symptom-to-door times were also observed. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a substantial decrease in the rate of admissions for acute CVD, reductions in the number of procedures, shortened lengths of stay at the hospital and longer delays between the onset of the symptoms and hospital treatment.

Since the housing sector was caught with a high level of unsold housing stock to the economic slowdown emerging in the second half of 2018, housing price bubble speculations have increased even more, especially for the Istanbul market. In this period, housing loan interest reduction campaigns were implemented by the government through state banks to stimulate the housing demand, and a probable collapse in the housing market was prevented. On the other hand, house prices continued to rise during this period due to the stimulated demand.

The first analysis on monthly data is performed by using housing price index, housing rent index, consumer prices index, stock market index, return on government debt securities, USD/TRY exchange rates, BIST price index, monthly deposit interest rates, mortgage interest rates and consumer confidence index, and the second analysis on quarterly data is carried out by adding building construction cost index and GDP data to the previous dataset. In the first analysis, the bubble formations differ regionally and periodically and disappeared toward the end of 2019 in some districts, while in the second analysis, the housing bubble formations have a more common and continuous appearance.

While large-scale quarantine has been the most successful short-term policy, it is unsustainable over long periods as it exerts enormous costs on societies. As a result, governments which have been able to partially control the spread of the disease have been deciding to reopen businesses. However, the WHO has warned about the risks of re-opening prematurely, as is playing out in some countries such as Spain, France and various states in the US such as California, Florida, Arizona, and Texas. Thus, it is urgent to consider a flexible policy that limits transmission without requiring large scale and damaging quarantines.

The traditional outpatient model can lead to patients in disease remission being seen more frequently than necessary and with missed opportunity to capture disease flares. A remote monitoring service (RMS) was co-designed with RA patients which uses SMS communication to deliver the Rheumatoid Arthritis Impact of Disease (RAID) tool on a monthly basis whilst offering patients 2-way text message contact outside of hospital-based care. Methods Access to hospital-based rheumatology care was dramatically restricted during the COVID-19 pandemic. 126 patients engaged with the remote monitoring service between January 2019 to September 2020 were sent a satisfaction survey in October 2020. The survey used a combination of 5-point Likert scales and open questions to rate confidence in statements focused on four aspects of the RMS during the COVID-19 pandemic: 1. managing data 2. managing flares 3. managing me 4. managing appointments. Results 48.4% (61/126) patients responded to the survey. Managing data: 93.4% of patients who responded to the question strongly agreed/agreed data was safe and used for the purpose of care. 91.8% strongly agreed/agreed RAID responses were reviewed by the RMS monthly. 90.1% strongly agreed/agreed the RMS would contact them to review care if needed. Managing flares: 85.9% strongly agreed/agreed they could text into the RMS if having a flare of their condition. 75.4% strongly agreed/agreed they received the care needed using the RMS. 61.41% patient strongly agreed/agreed using the RMS helped manage flares better than before using the service. Managing me: 74.0% strongly agreed/agreed the RMS had made access to care easier. 82.0% strongly agreed/agreed the RMS helped them to feel looked after outside of hospital care. 72.0% strongly agreed/agreed the RMS looked after emotional well-being as well as physical health. 80.0% strongly agreed/agreed the RMS helped them to feel cared for during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Managing appointments: 43.8% strongly agreed/agreed rheumatology appointments were not always when needed. 39.6% strongly agreed/agreed they would consider deferring an appointment if well as an appointment approached. 79.2% strongly agreed/agreed they would be offered an appointment when needed. 72.9% strongly agreed/agreed a telephone or video consultation is an acceptable alternative to attending a hospital appointment.

In the alphavirus structural polyprotein, -1PRF is coordinated by a slippery sequence in the transcript, an RNA stem-loop, and a conformational transition in the nascent polypeptide chain. To characterize each of these effectors, we measured the effects of 4,530 mutations on -1PRF by deep mutational scanning. While most mutations within the slip-site and stem-loop disrupt -1PRF, mutagenic effects upstream of the slip-site are far more variable.

There is currently no hydroxychloroquine dosage regimen for pediatrics with COVID-19 infections. We aimed to determine the optimal dosage regimen needed to rapidly achieve pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PKPD) targets for virological clearance in pediatrics. A 10,000-subject Monte Carlo simulation was performed to calculate probabilities of efficacy and safety attainment, using allometrically scaled PKPD targets based on published adult pharmacokinetic studies. Allometric scaling of hydroxychloroquine clearance was also performed. The simulation predicted the probability of target attainment (PTA) of each dosage regimen to achieve an 80% PTA and 80% cumulative fraction of response, with <10% PTA for toxicity. The loading dosage of 6 mg/kg/dose, four times daily for 2 days, was found to provide rapid virological clearance with a high PTA (92.2%) within 2 days of treatment. Maintenance dosage of 3.25 mg/kg/dose, three times daily for the next 8 days, achieved the appropriate plasma hydroxychloroquine level until treatment cessation, with a PTA >80%. As to safety, this dosage regimen achieved a PTA <10% of the safety target, giving a probability of cardiotoxicity of <0.01%. The optimal hydroxychloroquine regimen is the loading dosage of 6 mg/kg/dose, four times daily for 2 days, followed by maintenance dosage of 3.25 mg/kg/dose, three times daily, on days 3C10. This regimen achieves virological clearance of COVID-19 and low cardiotoxicity in pediatrics.

Compared with Dex, HT-15 shows less transactivation potency that is associated with the main adverse effects of synthetic GCs, and no cross activities with other nuclear receptors. Furthermore, HT-15 exhibits very weak inhibition on the ratio of OPG/RANKL. Therefore, it may reduce the side effects induced by normal GCs.

While iodine is vital for maternal thyroid function and fetal development, selenium contributes to the regulation of thyroid function and thyroid autoimmunity. This study aimed to assess the consumption of iodine- and selenium-containing products by women of reproductive age and the iodine and selenium nutritional status of pregnant women in Latvia. Materials and Methods: Population health survey (2010C2018) data were used to characterize dietary habits in women of reproductive age. Additionally, 129 pregnant women in the first trimester were recruited; they completed a questionnaire and were tested for thyroid function, urinary iodine concentration (UIC), and serum selenium and selenoprotein P levels. Results: The use of some dietary sources of iodine (e.g., milk and dairy products) and selenium (e.g., bread) has decreased in recent years. Less than 10% of respondents reported the use of iodized salt. The use of supplements has become more common (reported by almost 50% of respondents in 2018). Dietary habits were similar in pregnant women, but the use of supplements was even higher (almost 70%). Nevertheless, most supplements used in pregnancy had insufficient contents of iodine and selenium. Thyroid function was euthyreotic in all women, but 13.9% of participants had a thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO-ab) level above 60 IU/mL. The median UIC (IQR) was 147.2 (90.0C248.1) g/gCr, and 52.8% of pregnant women had a UIC below 150 g/gCr.

Screening of SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools revealed that the nucleocapsid (N) protein induced an immunodominant response in HLA-B7+ COVID-19-recovered individuals that was also detectable in unexposed donors.

We therefore used gel-stabilized gradient systems to cultivate microaerophilic Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria from karstic paddy soil to investigate their capacity for Fe(II) oxidation, carbon fixation, and As sequestration. Stable isotope probing demonstrated the assimilation of inorganic carbon at a maximum rate of 8.02 mmol C m-2 d-1.

Adding As(III) decreased the diversity of functional bacteria involved in carbon fixation, the relative abundance of predicted carbon fixation genes, and the amount of carbon fixed. Although the rate of Fe(II) oxidation was also lower in the presence of As(III), over 90% of the As(III) was sequestered after oxidation.

To limit new infectious outbreaks, the transdisciplinary 'One Health' solution incorporating 'Health in All Policy' involving all stakeholders especially environmental health and social sciences is being advocated (Figure 1). Conclusion: Savings and investments should be made by everyone to meet the unexpected. Stigmatization and prejudice among individuals in the world should be discouraged. Special attention should be paid to the elderly, as their immune system is weak. Health and safety precautions such as physical distancing and health hygiene etiquettes should be considered as part of life. Global experience teaches that containment steps and active tracing of contacts are effective to minimize the economic burden of disease and enhance knowledge of disease processes, health issues, disease emergence, and re-emergence. These lessons will help us to battle future pandemics.","output":"What COVID-19 has taught the world"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: To estimate influenza-associated excess mortality rates (EMRs) in Chongqing from 2012 to 2018.Methods: We obtained weekly mortality data for all-cause and four underlying causes of death (circulatory and respiratory disease (CRD), pneumonia and influenza (P&I), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and ischemic heart disease (IDH)), and influenza surveillance data, from 2012 to 2018. A negative-binomial regression model was used to estimate influenza-associated EMRs in two age groups (<65 years and 65 years).Results: It was estimated that an annual average of 10025 influenza-associated deaths occurred in Chongqing, corresponding to 5.2% of all deaths. The average EMR for all-cause death associated with influenza was 33.5 (95% confidence interval (CI): 31.5-35.6) per 100 000 persons, and in separate cause-specific models we attributed 24.7 (95% CI: 23.3-26.0), 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7-0.8), 8.5 (95% CI: 8.1-9.0) and 5.0 (95% CI: 4.7-5.3) per 100 000 persons EMRs to CRD, P&I, COPD and IDH, respectively. The estimated EMR for influenza B virus was 20.6 (95% CI: 20.3-21.0), which was significantly higher than the rates of 5.3 (95% CI: 4.5-6.1) and 7.5 (95% CI: 6.7-8.3) for A(H3N2) and A(H1N1) pdm09 virus, respectively. The estimated EMR was 152.3 (95% CI: 136.1-168.4) for people aged 65 years, which was significantly higher than the rate for those aged <65 years (6.8, 95% CI: 6.3-7.2).Conclusions: Influenza was associated with substantial EMRs in Chongqing, especially among elderly people. Influenza B virus caused a relatively higher excess mortality impact compared with A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2).

However, handful studies have focused on questions that with limited vaccine capacity ether boosting high-risk workers first or prioritizing susceptible normal individuals is optimal, and vaccinating how many people can lead us to the goal of herd immunity. In this study we aimed to explore the conclusions of such two problems with consideration of non-pharmacological interventions including mandatory quarantine for international entrants, keeping social distance and wearing masks. MethodsBy implementing the corresponding proportion of individuals who remain infectious after four lengths of quarantine strategies to the novel population-stratified model, we quantified the impact of such measures on optimizing vaccine prioritization between high-risk workers and normal populations. Furthermore, by setting the hypothetical COVID-19 transmission severity (reproduction number, R0) to the level of the most contagious COVID-19 variant (B.1.617.2, delta variant, R0 = 5.0), we separately estimated the threshold vaccine coverage of five countries (China, United States, India, South Africa and Brazil) to reach herd immunity, with and without the consideration of interventions including wearings masks and keeping social distance. At last, the sensitive analysis of essential parameter settings was performed to examine the robustness of conclusions. ResultsFor Chinese scenarios considered with moderate hypothetical transmission rate (R0 = 1.15-1.8), prioritizing high-risk workers the booster dose reached lower cumulative infections and deaths if at least 7-days of quarantine for international travelers is maintained, and the required screening time to remain such vaccinating strategy as optimal increased from 7-days to 21-days with the transmission severity. Although simply maintaining at least 7-days quarantine can lead to over 69.12% reduction in total infections, the improvement of longer quarantine strategies was becoming minimum and the least one was 2.28% between the 21 and the 28-days of quarantine. Besides, without the vaccination program, the impact of such measures on transmission control dropped significantly when R0 exceeded 1.5 and reached its minimal level when R0 equal to 2.5. On the other hand, when we combat the delta variant, the threshold vaccine coverage of total population to reach herd immunity lay within 74%-89% (corresponding to the vaccine efficiency from 70% to 50%), and such range decreased to 71%-84% if interventions including wearing mask and keeping social distance were implemented. Furthermore, Results of other countries with 85% vaccine efficiency were estimated at 79%, 91%, 94% and 96% for South Africa, Brazil, India and United States respectively. ConclusionsNon-pharmacological interventions can substantially affect booster vaccination prioritization and the threshold condition to reach herd immunity. To combat the delta variant, restrictions need to be integrated with mass vaccination so that can reduce the transmission to the minimum level, and the 21-days might be the suggested maximum quarantine duration according to the cost-effectiveness. Besides, by implementing interventions, the requirement to reach herd immunity can be lower in all countries. Lastly, the following surveillance after vaccination can help ensure the real-time proportion of vaccinated individuals with sufficient protection.","output":"Impact of non-pharmacological interventions on COVID-19 boosting vaccine prioritization and vaccine-induced herd immunity: a population-stratified modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Change Process in Psychotherapy During Troubling Times invites readers to consider what it is psychotherapists do that leads to change.

Most studies have focused on in-hospital mortality; however, mortality after discharge also increases in COVID-19 patients. AIMS: Examining the effect of PMU on all-cause mortality, including the post-discharge period. METHODS: Patients with diabetes who were hospitalised in 2020 due to COVID-19 were included in the study. They were divided into two groups: those with a history of metformin use (MF( +)) and those without such history (MF( ?)). Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed at a ratio of 1:1 for age and sex. COX regression analyses were used to demonstrate risk factors for mortality. RESULTS: We investigated 4103 patients hospitalised for COVID-19. After excluding those without diabetes or with chronic liver/kidney disease, we included the remaining 586 patients, constituting 293 women (50%) with an overall mean age of 66  11.9 years. After PSM analysis, the in-hospital and post-discharge mortality rates were higher in the MF( ?) group though not significantly different. However, overall mortality was higher in the MF( ?) group (51 (42.5%) vs. 35 (29.2%), p = 0.031). For overall mortality, the adjusted HR was 0.585 (95% CI: 0.371 ? 0.920, p = 0.020) in the MF( +) group. CONCLUSION: PMU is associated with reducing all-cause mortality. This effect starts from the in-hospital period and becomes more significant with the post-discharge period. The main limitations were the inability to evaluate the compliance with metformin and the effects of other medications due to retrospective nature.","output":"Preadmission usage of metformin and mortality in COVID-19 patients including the post-discharge period"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corridors are expected to increase species dispersal in fragmented habitats. However, it remains unclear how the quality of corridors influences the dispersal process, and how it interacts with corridor length and width. Here we investigate these factors using a small-scale laboratory system where we track the dispersal of the model organism Collembola Folsomia candida. Using this system, we study the effects of corridor length, width, and quality on the probability of dispersal, net movement, body size of dispersers, and the rate of change in population size after colonization. We show that corridor quality positively affected dispersal probability, net movement, and the rate of change in population size in colonised patches. Moreover, corridor quality significantly affected the size of dispersers, with only larger individuals dispersing through poor quality corridors. The length and width of corridors affected both the rate at which populations increased in colonised patches and the net number of individuals which dispersed, suggesting that these physical properties may be important in maintaining the flow of individuals in space. Our results thus suggest that corridor quality can have an important role in determining not only the probability of dispersal occurs but also the phenotypes of the individuals which disperse, with concomitant effects on the net movement of individuals and the rate of change in population size in the colonised patches.","output":"Corridor quality affects net movement, size of dispersers, and population growth in experimental microcosms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 crisis has posed newer challenges in cancer care with reports of disruption in treatment plans coming from across the world Massive deluge of COVID-19 incidence in western countries along with the increased risk of fatal complications for active cancer patients made it difficult for cancer patients to maintain continuity of care In India, a countrywide stringent lockdown has prevented a massive exposure to the population Here we present a retrospective analysis of the impact of COVID-19 crisis on the deliberations of online multidisciplinary tumour boards in past 8 weeks Methods: We analyzed 342 tumour board cases where an opinion was provided between 2nd week of March & 3rd week of May 2020 Disease characteristics like primary tumour type, stage, and ECOG PS were recorded A keyword search for COVID-19, Coronavirus, lockdown, treatment delay was performed on the reports to understand if these were mentioned by oncologists during the deliberations We tried to look for any recommendations for deviation from standard treatment or postponement of treatment on account of the COVID situation in the reports Results: Of the 342 cases, 48 patients were diagnosed with haematological malignancies & rest were solid tumors 213 cases were being treated with curative intent, 92 patients were being treated with palliative intent & 37 cases had just completed staging evaluation and no treatment was started We noted that the tumour board recommended a deviation from standard treatment protocol only for 18 cases on account of COVID-19 The rest of 324 cases received a recommendation to continue the standard treatment protocol for their disease condition The reasons recorded for protocol deviation included patients with oral cavity cancer, metastatic cancer with poor performance status, and patients with multiple comorbidities where they feared a higher risk of complications Conclusions: Majority of oncologists in India prefer standard treatment recommendations in their decisions This could be due to two main factors, a lower infection rate and a much lower case fatality rate (3 4%) from COVID-19 infection as compared to western countries Still treatments have been delayed not due to change in protocols but due to the lockdown Legal entity responsible for the study: The authors Funding: Has not received any funding Disclosure: A K Jotwani, R Jain: Leadership role, Shareholder/Stockholder/Stock options: R S Goud: Shareholder/Stockholder/Stock options, Full/Part-time employment: R Vaghmare;R Rajan: Full/Part-time employment: T Poovaiah: Shareholder/Stockholder/Stock options, Full/Part-time employment:","output":"Impact of COVID-19 crisis on multidisciplinary tumour board treatment decisions: A cohort analysis from India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current circumstances cause by the COVID-19 force primary care doctors to find out new ways to guarantee the health care of our type 2 diabetes patients.

However, the way Meritocracy has been conceptualized and operationalized in experimental studies has advanced in significant ways. As a result, a variety of paradigms arose to understand the social consequences of Meritocracy for intergroup relations; in particular, to understand the adverse consequences of Meritocracy for disadvantaged group members. The present research seeks to understand whether there is strong support for the idea that (manipulated) Meritocracy disproportionally affects members of low status groups, and also to understand which specific components of this norm have been successfully manipulated and to what consequences. And this is particularly important given the recent call for greater transparency in how the success of experimental manipulations is reported. Thus, we carried out a systematic review examining the content of different prime tasks, summarizing prime manipulation checks' effectiveness, and analyzing whether priming Meritocracy leads to less favorable orientations toward low status groups. Results across 33 studies revealed that despite the existing differences in the components highlighted, the salience of any of the Meritocracy dimensions facilitates the use of internal causal attributions, negative evaluations and stereotyping toward low status groups, affecting negatively decisions involving low-status group members, particularly in specific domains, as organizational contexts.

METHODS: An electronic questionnaire which assessed changes in body weight, dietary habits, and physical activity of Saudi Arabias adult population (n = 2255) during the COVID-19 quarantine was distributed on social media between June and July 2020. To test the differences between changes in dietary and physical activity behaviors in relation to changes in body weight a Chi-square test was used. RESULTS: Over 40 and 45% of participants reported eating and snacking more, respectively, which led to weight gain in around 28%. Most participants reported that they consumed home-cooked (73%) and healthy meals (47%), while only 7% reported that they consumed foods from restaurants. Feelings of boredom and emptiness (44%) and the availability of time for preparing meals (40%) were the main reasons for changing dietary habits.

The objective of this study is to examine this change and draw useful conclusions. METHODS: We collected data retrospectively of all patients who attended outpatient clinics and who were operated at our institute under the department of neurosurgery from October 23, 2019, to August 23, 2020. These data were then divided into two groups (pre-COVID period and during the COVID pandemic) and compared. RESULTS: Out of the 388 surgeries performed, 284 surgeries were performed during the pre-COVID period, and 104 surgeries were performed during the COVID pandemic. During this ongoing COVID pandemic, the total number of surgeries performed by the department of neurosurgery decreased significantly by 63.38%, the proportion of routine surgeries performed decreased from 50.35% to 19.23% and the proportion of minor cases increased from 19.72% to 30.77%. The Outpatient Clinic Workflow decreased by 72.3% as compared to the pre-COVID period, and the perioperative COVID-19 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction positive incidence in our neurosurgical patients was 11.71%. CONCLUSION: This paper highlights the drastic reduction in the operative workflow and the outpatient clinic workflow during the ongoing corona pandemic which will have significant collateral damages in the long run. We will have to strike the right balance between providing our patients with the best medical treatment while limiting the spread of the COVID-19 infection.","output":"Effect of coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on case volume, spectrum, and perioperative coronavirus disease 2019 incidence in neurosurgical patients: An experience at a tertiary care center in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: While pharmacists in other countries have broad independent prescribing privileges, pharmacists in the United States are making progress. Pharmacist prescriptive authority in the U.S. occurs on a continuum with four identified models: patient-specific collaborative prescribing through collaborative practice agreements (CPAs), population-specific prescribing through CPAs, statewide protocols, and class-specific prescribing. States have implemented pharmacist prescriptive authority across this spectrum. As approximately 90% of Americans reside within two miles of a community pharmacy, prescriptive authority of pharmacists leads to improved public health access points and outcomes. Objective: This paper is intended to provide insight into the current landscape of pharmacist prescriptive authority in the United States through 2019 in order to provide historical context and identify opportunities for state policy considerations. This was done through a review of published literature, national professional association resources, individual state pharmacy practice acts, and state legislation and regulations. Conclusion: Significant variability regarding what medications pharmacists can prescribe exists per state statutes. According to data collected from the National Alliance of State Pharmacy Associations (NASPA), 147 bills related to pharmacist provider status were introduced in 39 states during the 2019 legislative session. The interest in pharmacist prescribing stems from current and future challenges within the U.S. health care system: access to care, cost of care, and the anticipated shortage of physicians. The challenge to standardize prescriptive authority across states presents a unique opportunity for future considerations. This article is protected by copyright.

Our previous studies have shown that CD66 binds specifically to at least three carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) superfamily members, ie, CEA itself, nonspecific cross-reacting antigen (NCA), and CGM1, but not to CGM6 (NCA-95). In this report, we show that CD66 will also identify the biliary glycoproteins (BGP). A full-length cDNA for the BGPc molecule (a cytoplasmic splice variant of BGPa) was isolated by expression cloning using the CD66 MoAbs. This protein has an identical extracellular and transmembrane sequence to BGPa with one N-terminal IgV like domain, three IgC-like extracellular domains (A1, B1, and A2), plus a transmembrane domain, but the cytoplasmic domain is spliced by 53 nucleotides. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction experiments show that this splice variant can be detected in colonic carcinoma cell lines, in primary colonic adenocarcinomas, and in myeloid and B-cell lines to varying degrees. Quantitative analyses of BGPc RNA expression by RNase protection indicate that abundant levels occur only in the colonic, but not in the hematopoietic, cell lines tested. Studies presented here show that BGPc mediates homotypic adhesion and suggest that the cytoplasmic splicing does not alter the initial homotypic adhesion properties of BGPa.","output":"CD66 identifies the biliary glycoprotein (BGP) adhesion molecule: cloning, expression, and adhesion functions of the BGPc splice variant."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We have previously reported the fabrication of a polycaprolactone and hydroxyapatite composite scaffold incorporating growth factors to be used for bone regeneration.

Such case-control designs are intuitively appealing, but they have also been criticized for leading to inflated estimates of accuracy. METHODS We discuss similarities and differences between diagnostic and etiologic case-control studies, as well as the mechanisms that can lead to variation in estimates of diagnostic accuracy in studies with separate sampling schemes (\\"gates\\") for diseased (cases) and nondiseased individuals (controls). RESULTS Diagnostic accuracy studies are cross-sectional and descriptive in nature. Etiologic case-control studies aim to quantify the effect of potential causal exposures on disease occurrence, which inherently involves a time window between exposure and disease occurrence. Researchers and readers should be aware of spectrum effects in diagnostic case-control studies as a result of the restricted sampling of cases and/or controls, which can lead to changes in estimates of diagnostic accuracy. These spectrum effects may be advantageous in the early investigation of a new diagnostic test, but for an overall evaluation of the clinical performance of a test, case-control studies should closely mimic cross-sectional diagnostic studies.

To protect themselves from the defensive mechanisms of their respective hosts, helminths modulate their immune responses. This modulation has relevant clinical and epidemiological consequences, including the inhibition of inflammatory processes that characterize infection by other microorganisms. Severe Pneumocystis pneumonia is characterized by an intense inflammatory reaction that can lead to death. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is the main predisposing factor to the development of pneumocystosis. Although the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy has led to a notable decline in the incidence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-associated complications, pneumocystosis continues to be an important global health problem. Despite the high incidence of human immunodeficiency virus infection in the sub-Saharan region, the prevalence of Pneumocystis pneumonia there has been lower than expected. Several factors, or combinations thereof, may contribute to this evolution. Here, we hypothesize the possible role of helminth immune modulation as an important issue at play. On the other hand, and looking ahead, we believe that the immune modulation achieved by helminths may be an important factor to consider during the design and evaluation processes of vaccines against Pneumocystis jirovecii to be used in Sub-Saharan Africa. The requirements of a balanced triggering of different types of immune responses for controlling the infection produced by this microorganism, as observed during experiments in animal models, support this final consideration.","output":"Prevalence of Pneumocystosis in Sub-Saharan Africa and Helminth Immune Modulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Daydreaming is a normal cognitive phenomenon in which the individual experiences a temporary separation from reality during which contact with reality is compromised and, to some extent, replaced by a visionary fantasy. On the other hand, daydreaming can progress to a maladaptive state, known as maladaptive daydreaming. The aim of this study was to help understand the full scope of maladaptive daydreaming among medical students at the University of Khartoum, in Sudan, by displaying all maladaptive daydreaming-related statistics among studied population. An analytical cross-sectional university-based study was conducted during the academic year 2020C2021, using a total of 323 self-administered online questionnaires; the questionnaire containing the Arabic Version of Maladaptive Daydreaming Scale and other sociodemographic data were given by stratified random selection to undergraduate medical students at the University of Khartoum, in Sudan, between December and January 2021. RESULTS: 34.3% of medical students at the University of Khartoum have identified themselves as maladaptive daydreamers. More males were found to be maladaptive daydreamers when compared to female medical students. The average Maladaptive Daydreaming Scale score among medical students was found to be 33.6 (sd=22.3). No significant correlation was found between Maladaptive Daydreaming Scale score and gender, and there was a significant correlation between the MDS score and the academic class of medical students at University of Khartoum.

Influenza-related incidence data are limited in many countries in Africa despite established sentinel surveillance. This study aimed to address the information gap by estimating the burden and seasonality of medically attended influenza like illness in Ethiopia. METHOD: Influenza sentinel surveillance data collected from 3 influenza like illness (ILI) and 5 Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) sites from 2012 to 2017 was used for analysis. Descriptive statistics were applied for simple analysis. The proportion of medically attended influenza positive cases and incidence rate of ILI was determined using total admitted patients and catchment area population. Seasonality was estimated based on weekly trend of ILI and predicted threshold was done by applying the Moving Epidemic Method (MEM). RESULT: A total of 5715 medically attended influenza suspected patients who fulfills ILI and SARI case definition (77% ILI and 23% SARI) was enrolled. Laboratory confirmed influenza virus (influenza positive case) among ILI and SARI suspected case was 25% (1130/4426) and 3% (36/1289). Of which, 65% were influenza type A. The predominantly circulating influenza subtype were seasonal influenza A(H3N2) (n = 455, 60%) and Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (n = 293, 38.81%). The estimated mean annual influenza positive case proportion and ILI incidence rate was 160.04 and 52.48 per 100,000 population. The Incidence rate of ILI was higher in the age group of 15C44 years of age [Incidence rate (R) = 254.6 per 100,000 population, 95% CI; 173.65, 335.55] and 5C14 years of age [R = 49.5, CI 95%; 31.47, 130.43].

Scientific evidence has associated harmful health effects to indoor air hazards recognizing the existence of a vital concern in public health sector. Thus the assessment of human exposure to biological aerosols and droplets indoor became an imperative requirement of investigation. Environmental bioburden assessment of viruses relies in both culture-dependent approaches that comprise classical methodologies, still prominent and vital in the field of modern biotechnology, and culture-independent approaches based on nucleic acid amplification techniques, which are considered the gold standard in clinical virology. The main factor influencing indoor microbiology is the human being and their activities. Indoor environments to be considered are those regularly occupied by humans: residences, offices, schools, industrial buildings, health care facilities, farming activities and other settings occupied all the time, or in which occupant density is high. Its well known that approximately 60% of total human respiratory and gastrointestinal infections are acquired indoor, since viruses have a rapid spread in the community and can be transmitted easily, especially in crowded and poorly ventilated environments, causing high morbidity and decline in quality of life and productivity. Studies have shown that respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, influenza and parainfluenza virus, and human enterovirus infections may be associated with virus-induced asthma, leading to diseases such as pneumonia. Gastroenteritis infectious (about 3040% of cases) is attributable to viruses. Rotavirus, Astrovirus, Norwalk-like viruses and other caliciviruses are responsible for 48% of all reported outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this single-center, retrospective, observational study, the clinical and laboratory characteristics of 193 patients with severe covid-19 were collected. 48 patients with severe covid-19 had diabetes, and 145 patients (ie, the controls) did not have diabetes. A severe case was defined as including at least one of the following criteria: (1) Respiratory rate >30/min. (2) Oxygen saturation 93%. (3) PaO(2)/FiO(2)300 mm Hg. (4) Patients, either with shock or respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation, or combined with other organ failure, requiring admission to intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS: Of 193 patients with severe covid-19, 48 (24.9%) had diabetes. Compared with patients with severe covid-19 without diabetes, patients with diabetes were older, susceptible to receiving mechanical ventilation and admission to ICU, and had higher mortality. In addition, patients with severe covid-19 with diabetes had higher levels of leukocyte count, neutrophil count, high-sensitivity C reaction protein, procalcitonin, ferritin, interleukin (IL) 2 receptor, IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor , D-dimer, fibrinogen, lactic dehydrogenase and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide. Among patients with severe covid-19 with diabetes, more non-survivors were men (30 (76.9%) vs 9 (23.1%)). Non-survivors had severe inflammatory response, and cardiac, hepatic, renal and coagulation impairment. Finally, the Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed a trend towards poorer survival in patients with severe covid-19 with diabetes than patients without diabetes.

Conventional DNA methylation detection methods using sodium bisulphite treatment do not distinguish between methylated and hydroxymethylated forms of cytosine, meaning that past studies report a composite of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). To identify the distinct contributions of DNA methylation modifications to axonal regeneration, we collected spinal cord tissue after sharp injury from untreated adult F3 male rats with enhanced regeneration of injured spinal axons or controls, derived from folate- or water-treated F0 lineages, respectively. Genomic DNA was profiled for genome-wide 5hmC levels, revealing 658 differentially hydroxymethylated regions (DhMRs). Genomic profiling with whole genome bisulphite sequencing disclosed regeneration-related alterations in composite 5mC + 5hmC DNA methylation levels at 2,260 differentially methylated regions (DMRs). While pathway analyses revealed that differentially hydroxymethylated and methylated genes are linked to biologically relevant axon developmental pathways, only 22 genes harbour both DhMR and DMRs. Since these differential modifications were more than 60 kilobases on average away from each other, the large majority of differential hydroxymethylated and methylated regions are unique with distinct functions in the axonal regeneration phenotype. These data highlight the importance of distinguishing independent contributions of 5mC and 5hmC levels in the central nervous system, and denote discrete roles for DNA methylation modifications in spinal cord injury and regeneration in the context of transgenerational inheritance.","output":"DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation have distinct genome-wide profiles related to axonal regeneration."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Twenty years after the WSIS, even as multi-stakeholder governance models in the domain have been stripped of any claim to their democratic potential, global digital governance is in shambles.

As these rotations are so critical on both sides of the application process, the authors sought to identify the factors that influence subinternship experiences for plastic surgery applicants. METHODS A survey was used to collect information about demographics, the subinternship experience, and interview preferences. The survey was distributed to current plastic surgery interns and applicants who applied to Duke Plastic Surgery in the 2019/2020 application cycle. RESULTS One hundred forty-two responses were received (response rate, 35.2 percent). The mean number of subinternships completed was 4.47. The defining feature of respondents' best subinternship most often included engagement from faculty and residents, autonomy, and integration with the team. The worst feature of respondents' worst subinternship experience most often included a sense of disinterested or \\"malignant\\" residents and faculty, lacking operative/educational opportunities, and disorganization of the rotation. The majority of applicants (60.3 percent) would prefer to return for a standard interview day over interviewing while on rotation. CONCLUSIONS The subinternship experience remains a critical part of the applicant experience when applying to integrated plastic surgery residency programs. The experience on these rotations leaves a lasting impression that is highly variable and influences future recommendations to peers. Rotating students value inclusivity and case volume, and they take note of negative interactions they witness among residents and faculty.

Objectives To investigate pharmacists and pharmacy students awareness and source of their information regard the management of the coronavirus pandemic, and their perspective of their role during this emergent situation. Methods This descriptive cross-sectional online survey study was conducted in Jordan during the COVID-19 outbreak (from 15 to 30 March 2020). A validated online questionnaire addressing participants' current awareness about epidemics/pandemics and COVID-19, source of information and their perspectives of their role. Data were analyzed using statistical package for social science (SPSS). Results Participants (n = 726) had a mean age of 26.9 (8.0) years with 71.9% females. Pharmacy students made 35.3% of the sample while the rest were pharmacists. Only 54.3% of participants believed that they got enough education about epidemics/pandemics, and 94.6% of them follow on the latest coronavirus updates on treatments, and that is mainly from the media (59.5%) followed by the World Health Organization reports (58.7%) and then the published researches (57%). Awareness score (out of 20) of pharmacists (n = 470) was significantly higher (p < 0.001) than that of students (n = 256). Better Awareness scores were also associated with higher age of participants, graduating from a public versus a private university, and attending more educational workshops. Conclusion The majority of pharmacists and pharmacy students reported that they have a major role in the management of epidemics/pandemics through the community pharmacies but the majority follow on the latest coronavirus updates from the media.

In this study, we developed a duplex, SYBR Green I-based real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to enable the simultaneous detection of DuCV and NGPV. The assay readily distinguished between the two viruses, based on their different melting temperatures (Tm), where the Tm for DuCV was 80a?C and that for NGPV was 84.5a?C. Other non-target duck viruses that were tested did not show melting peaks. The detection limit of the duplex assay was 101 copies/L for both viruses. This method exhibited high repeatability and reproducibility, and both the inter-assay and intra-assay variation coefficients were <1.6%. Thirty-one fecal samples were collected for clinical testing using real-time PCR analysis, and the results were confirmed using sequencing. The rate of co-infection was 6.5%, which was consistent with the sequencing results. This duplex real-time PCR assay offers advantages over other tests, such as rapid, sensitive, specific, and reliable detection of both viruses in a single sample, which enables the quantitative detection of DuCV and NGPV in clinical samples.

Neurologists diagnose their sciatica patients primarily using a magnetic resonance imaging (89%). Selective diagnostic nerve blocks are considered useful by 81% of the neurologists. Neurologists primarily treat patients with pain medication, and 40% of them think epidural steroid injections are effective in 40-60% of injected patients. Twenty-nine percent of neurologists refer patients to a neurosurgeon after 4 months. Anesthesiologists consider a selective diagnostic nerve root block to have a higher diagnostic value than mapping.

The aim of this study is to compare commercially available sealants on their efficacy of preventing leakage in a validated mouse model for AL. METHODS Six sealants (Evicel, Omnex, VascuSeal, PleuraSeal, BioGlue, and Colle Chirurgicale Cardial) were applied around an anastomosis constructed with five interrupted sutures in mice, and compared with a control group without sealant. Outcome measures were AL, anastomotic bursting pressure, and death. RESULTS In the control group there was a 40% death rate with a 50% rate of AL. None of the sealants were able to diminish the rate of AL. Furthermore, use of the majority of sealants resulted in failure to thrive, increased rates of ileus, and higher mortality rates. CONCLUSIONS If sealing of a colorectal anastomosis could achieve a reduction of incidence of clinical AL, this would be a promising tool for prevention of leakage in colorectal surgery. In this study, we found no evidence that sealants reduce leakage rates in a mouse model for AL.

But the bioactive compounds and potential mechanisms of XBJ for COVID-19 prevention and treatment are unclear. This study aimed to examine the potential effector mechanisms of XBJ on COVID-19 based on network pharmacology. METHODS: We searched Chinese and international papers to obtain the active ingredients of XBJ. Then, we compiled COVID-19 disease targets from the GeneCards gene database and via literature searches. Next, we used the SwissTargetPrediction database to predict XBJs effector targets and map them to the abovementioned COVID-19 disease targets in order to obtain potential therapeutic targets of XBJ. Cytoscape software version 3.7.0 was used to construct a XBJ active-compound-potential-effector target network and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, and then to carry out network topology analysis of potential targets. We used the ClueGO and CluePedia plugins in Cytoscape to conduct gene ontology (GO) biological process (BP) analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) signaling pathway enrichment analysis of XBJs effector targets. We used AutoDock vina and PyMOL software for molecular docking. RESULTS: We obtained 144 potential COVID-19 effector targets of XBJ. Fourteen of these targets-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), albumin (ALB), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1), Caspase-3 (CASP3), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), MAPK8, prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), JUN, interleukin-2 (IL-2), estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), and MAPK14 had degree values > 40 and therefore could be considered key targets. They participated in extracellular signalCregulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1, ERK2) cascade, the T-cell receptor signaling pathway, activation of MAPK activity, cellular response to lipopolysaccharide, and other inflammation- and immune-related BPs. XBJ exerted its therapeutic effects through the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), nuclear factor -light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-B), MAPK, phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (Akt)-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), toll-like receptor (TLR), TNF, and inflammatory-mediator regulation of transient receptor potential (TRP) signaling pathways to ultimately construct a drug-ingredient-target-pathway effector network. The molecular docking results showed that the core 18 effective ingredients had a docking score of less than ? 4.0 with those top 10 targets. CONCLUSION: The active ingredients of XBJ regulated different genes, acted on different pathways, and synergistically produced anti-inflammatory and immune-regulatory effects, which fully demonstrated the synergistic effects of different components on multiple targets and pathways. Our study demonstrated that key ingredients and their targets have potential binding activity, the existing studies on the pharmacological mechanisms of XBJ in the treatment of sepsis and severe pneumonia, could explain the effector mechanism of XBJ in COVID-19 treatment, and those provided a preliminary examination of the potential effector mechanism in this disease.","output":"Examining the effector mechanisms of Xuebijing injection on COVID-19 based on network pharmacology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While it remains much too early to determine precisely how alcohol use might affect risk for or progression of COVID\\\\19, any efforts to connect the dots from past alcohol research would suggest it wise for nondrinkers and low\\\\risk drinkers to maintain that status during this public health crisis.

METHODS: We searched MEDLINE for secondary literature published between 2010 and 2021 on the use, efficacy, and appropriateness of digital health interventions for the delivery of mental health care. RESULTS: Of the 3022 records identified, 466 proceeded to full-text review and 304 met the criteria for inclusion in this study. A majority (52%) of research involved the treatment of substance use disorders, 29% focused on mood, anxiety, and traumatic stress disorders, and >5% for each remaining mental health conditions. Synchronous and asynchronous communication, computerized therapy, and cognitive training appear to be effective but require further examination in understudied mental health conditions. Similarly, virtual reality, mobile apps, social media platforms, and web-based forums are novel technologies that have the potential to improve mental health but require higher quality evidence.

In this scenario, healthcare students can act as reliable information providers. This study aimed to assess the knowledge and perception about COVID-19 among medical and allied health science students. Methods: A web-based cross sectional survey was conducted during February and March 2020. A 24-item survey was developed and randomly distributed among the study population. Descriptive statistics was applied to represent participant characteristics and Chi-square test was used to evaluate the level of association among variables with a significance level of p < 0.01. Results: Total, 97.95% (715/730) participants completed the survey. High proportion of students were from pharmacy (45.73%) followed by medical (22.52%), physiotherapy, nursing and dental background. Majority of participants were having adequate knowledge while about 18% had partial knowledge about the symptoms of severe COVID-19 cases. Students have shown a positive perception of COVID-19 prevention and control while few invalid responses related to the use of herbal medicines or garlic were noted. About 50% had rightly stated that, the antibiotics and vaccine are not effective in COVID-19 infection at present. Conclusion: As the COVID-19 cases are rapidly increasing worldwide, it is essential to improve the knowledge and beliefs among general public to prevent its spread.

Maternal anxiety during pregnancy is a common environmental challenge for the fetus, causing changes in DNA methylation. Here, we determined the mediating role of DNA methylation and the moderating role of offspring sex on the association between maternal anxiety and childrens behavioral measures. In 83 motherCchild dyads, maternal anxiety was assessed in each trimester of pregnancy when the child was four years of age. Childrens behavioral measures and childrens buccal DNA methylation levels (NR3C1, IGF2/H19 ICR, and LINE1) were examined. Higher maternal anxiety during the third trimester was associated with more methylation levels of the NR3C1. Moderating effects of sex on the association between maternal anxiety and methylation were found for IGF2/H19 and LINE1 CpGs. Mediation analysis showed that methylation of NR3C1 could buffer the effects of maternal anxiety on childrens behavioral measures, but this effect did not remain significant after controlling for covariates. In conclusion, our data support an association between maternal anxiety during pregnancy and DNA methylation. The results also underscore the importance of sex differences and timing effects.

Disease-modifying therapies exist to treat some types of MPS; however, they are not curative, underscoring the need to identify and evaluate co-interventions that optimize functioning, participation in preferred activities, and quality of life. A Canadian pediatric MPS registry is under development and may serve as a platform to launch randomized controlled trials to evaluate such interventions. To promote the standardized collection of patient/family-reported and clinical outcomes considered important to patients/families, health care providers (HCPs), and policymakers, the choice of outcomes to include in the registry will be informed by a core outcome set (COS). We aim to establish a patient-oriented COS for pediatric MPS using a multi-stakeholder approach. METHODS In step 1 of the six-step process to develop the COS, we will identify relevant outcomes through a rapid literature review and candidate outcomes survey. A two-phase screening approach will be implemented to identify eligible publications, followed by extraction of outcomes and other pre-specified data elements. Simultaneously, we will conduct a candidate outcomes survey with children with MPS and their families to identify outcomes most important to them. In step 2, HCPs experienced in treating patients with MPS will be invited to review the list of outcomes generated in step 1 and identify additional clinically relevant outcomes. We will then ask patients/families, HCPs, and policymakers to rate the outcomes in a set of Delphi Surveys (step 3), and to participate in a subsequent consensus meeting to finalize the COS (step 4). Step 5 involves establishing a set of outcome measurement instruments for the COS. Finally, we will disseminate the COS to knowledge users (step 6). DISCUSSION The proposed COS will inform the choice of outcomes to include in the MPS registry and, more broadly, promote the standardized collection of patient-oriented outcomes for pediatric MPS research. By involving patients/families from the earliest stage of the research, we will ensure that the COS will be relevant to those who will ultimately benefit from the research.

Thus, female predisposition to pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) is an inevitable topic. To better understand the nature of sexual differentiation in the pulmonary circulation, and how heritable factors, in vivo- and/or in vitro-altered estrogen circumstances and changes in the live environment work in concert to discern the sex bias, this chapter reviews pulmonary events characterized by sex-different features, concomitant with exploration of how alterations of genetic expression and estrogen metabolisms trigger the female-predominant pathological signaling. We address the following: PAH (Sect.7.2) is characterized as an estrogenic promotion of its incidence (Sect. 7.2.2), as a function of specific germline mutations, and as an estrogen-elicited protection of its prognosis (Sect.7.2.1). More detail is provided to introduce a less recognized gene of Ephx2 that encodes soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) to degrade epoxyeicosatrienic acids (EETs). As a susceptible target of estrogen, Ephx2/sEH expression is downregulated by an estrogen-dependent epigenetic mechanism. Increases in pulmonary EETs then evoke a potentiation of PAH generation, but mitigation of its progression, a phenomenon similar to the estrogen-paradox regulation of PAH. Additionally, the female susceptibility to chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (Sect. 7.3) and asthma (Sect.7.4), but less preference to COVID-19 (Sect. 7.5), and roles of estrogen in their pathogeneses are briefly discussed.","output":"Roles of Genetic Predisposition in the Sex Bias of Pulmonary Pathophysiology, as a Function of Estrogens : Sex Matters in the Prevalence of Lung Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the absence of an approved vaccine, developing effective SARS-CoV-2 antivirals is essential to tackle the current pandemic health crisis due to the COVID-19 spread.

While the coronaviruses in these species have all been in coronavirus Group 3, as for the better known coronaviruses of the domestic fowl (infectious bronchitis virus [IBV], in Gallus gallus), turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) and pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), there is experimental evidence to suggest that birds are not limited to infection with Group 3 coronaviruses. In China coronaviruses have been isolated from peafowl (Pavo), guinea fowl (Numida meleagris; also isolated in Brazil), partridge (Alectoris) and also from a non-gallinaceous bird, the teal (Anas), all of which were being reared in the vicinity of domestic fowl. These viruses were closely related in genome organization and in gene sequences to IBV. Indeed, gene sequencing and experimental infection of chickens indicated that the peafowl isolate was the H120 IB vaccine strain, while the teal isolate was possibly a field strain of a nephropathogenic IBV. Thus the host range of IBV does extend beyond the chicken. Most recently, Group 3 coronaviruses have been detected in greylag goose (Anser anser), mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos) and pigeon (Columbia livia). It is clear from the partial genome sequencing of these viruses that they are not IBV, as they have two additional small genes near the 3' end of the genome. Twenty years ago a coronavirus was isolated after inoculation of mice with tissue from the coastal shearwater (Puffinus puffinus). While it is not certain whether the virus was actually from the shearwater or from the mice, recent experiments have shown that bovine coronavirus (a Group 2 coronavirus) can infect and also cause enteric disease in turkeys. Experiments with some Group 1 coronaviruses (all from mammals, to date) have shown that they are not limited to replicating or causing disease in a single host. SARS-coronavirus has a wide host range. Clearly there is the potential for the emergence of new coronavirus diseases in domestic birds, from both avian and mammalian sources. Modest sequence conservation within gene 1 has enabled the design of oligonucleotide primers for use in diagnostic reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions, which will be useful for the detection of new coronaviruses.","output":"Coronaviruses in poultry and other birds."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the widespread vaccination against COVID-19, people began to resume regional tourism.

The new donor vigilance system was implemented on 1 January 2020 and we here present the results from the first year of registration. MATERIALS AND METHODS AR categories, severity level and imputability score were defined based on the definitions from the International Society of Blood Transfusion, AABB and the European Commission directive 2005/61/EC, respectively. RESULTS Across all severity levels, AR in Danish blood donors were found to be rare (1498 per 100,000 donations). Only 0.2% of the registered reactions were classified as serious (2.7 per 100,000 donations). Large regional differences were seen in the registration of citrate reactions and haematomas. CONCLUSION Significant differences across regions in what to categorize as an AR were persistent even when including a severity score in the reporting. The Danish Haemovigilance Committee will commence a national work to align the definitions but suggests that this matter is raised to an international level as part of the current work to agree upon definitions for assessment of donor AR.","output":"The new donor vigilance system in Denmark reveals regional differences in adverse reactions supposedly caused by variation in the registration."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report here that glycyrrhizic acid (GL), a component of licorice root (Glycyrrhiza radix), is active against EBV replication in superinfected Raji cells in a dose-dependent fashion.

We compared increases in overdose deaths during the pandemic in Norway and the United States, two countries in the top 10 for per-capita overdose mortality, yet with very different approaches to the pandemic, healthcare and drug policy. METHODS: We examined monthly overdoses in 2020 versus baseline rates (the monthly average across 2017-2019). We compared excess overdose mortality to shifts in human mobility and social interaction, measured using cellphone-based mobility data, an indicator of the societal response to the pandemic. RESULTS: Both the US and Norway saw large magnitude exacerbations in overdose mortality during the pandemic-related lockdowns, reaching 46.8% and 57.0% above baseline, respectively. Maximum increases occurred 2-3 months after peak reductions in mobility, suggesting lagged mechanisms. While overdose mortality returned to baseline relatively quickly in Norway, rates remained elevated in the US to the end of 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Spikes in overdose mortality in both contexts may relate to disruptions in healthcare access and the drug supply becoming more potent. Norway's quicker return to baseline may reflect more robust access to harm reduction and addiction-related healthcare services. Nevertheless, it is notable that even in Norway - with universal access to high-quality services, low COVID-19 rates, and a highly effective public health infrastructure - a greater than 50% spike in overdose deaths was still seen at the onset of lockdown measures.

Here we report the identification of hepatitis C virus NS5A inhibitors Pibrentasvir and Ombitasvir as SARS-CoV-2 exonuclease inhibitors. In the presence of Pibrentasvir, RNAs terminated with the active forms of the prodrugs Sofosbuvir, Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Molnupiravir and AT-527 were largely protected from excision by the exonuclease, while in the absence of Pibrentasvir, there was rapid excision.

Recently, we have demonstrated CFTR expression in the brain, the spinal cord and the sympathetic ganglia. This study aims to investigate the expression and distribution of CFTR in the ganglia of the human gastrointestinal tract. Fresh tissue and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded normal gastrointestinal tract samples were collected from eleven surgical patients and five autopsy cases. Immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, laser-assisted microdissection and nested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction were performed. Expression of CFTR protein and mRNA was detected in neurons of the ganglia of all segments of the human gastrointestinal tract examined, including the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, appendix, colon and rectum. The extensive expression of CFTR in the enteric ganglia suggests that CFTR may play a role in the physiology of the innervation of the gastro-intestinal tract. The presence of dysfunctional CFTRs in enteric ganglia could, to a certain extent, explain the gastrointestinal symptoms frequently experienced by CF patients.","output":"Expression of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator in Ganglia of Human Gastrointestinal Tract"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Stroke is the leading cause of disability and mortality in the world, but the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke (IS) is not completely clear and treatments are limited. Mounting evidence indicate that neovascularization is a critical defensive reaction to hypoxia that modulates the process of long-term neurologic recovery after IS. Angiogenesis is a complex process in which the original endothelial cells in blood vessels are differentiated, proliferated, migrated, and finally remolded into new blood vessels. Many immune cells and cytokines, as well as growth factors, are directly or indirectly involved in the regulation of angiogenesis. Inflammatory cells can affect endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and activation by secreting a variety of cytokines via various inflammation-relative signaling pathways and thus participate in the process of angiogenesis. However, the mechanism of inflammation-mediated angiogenesis has not been fully elucidated. Hence, this review aimed to discuss the mechanism of inflammation-mediated angiogenesis in IS and to provide new ideas for clinical treatment of IS.","output":"Inflammation-Mediated Angiogenesis in Ischemic Stroke"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article deals with the issue of Euroscepticism and Atlanticscepticism in France which has become extremely relevant due to the withdrawal of the UK from the EU In 2016-2017 Frexit seemed to be a real alternative for France, as this idea was supported by Marine Le Pen, a right-wing politician, who took part in the second round of the 2017 French presidential elections However, nowadays the most powerful French Eurosceptic politicians and parties, including Jean-Luc Melenchon, the leader of the left-wing party Unbowed France (La France Insoumise), Marine Le Pen and her National Rally (Rassemblement national), are not campaigning for the withdrawal from the EU On the contrary, they support the transformation of the EU based on neoliberal principles The author pays special attention to the approaches of the French Eurosceptics highlighting the fact that the French Eurosceptics are also Atlanticsceptics There is an objective reason for this: the European integration cannot be reshaped without a reconsideration of Euro-Atlantic cooperation The crisis of the modern world-system accompanied by the US crisis of hegemony threatens the Washington Consensus, which has reaffirmed the commitment of different countries, including the EU-members, to the neoliberal social and economic course Applying the world-systems analysis, the author comes to the conclusion that the concepts of alternative Europe requires Atlanticscepticism or even Anti-Atlanticism Moreover, the current crisis opens new prospects for the French Eurosceptics who also support Atlantic Scepticism The issue of Euroscepticism becomes even more acute in the context of the world economic crisis and coronavirus pandemic","output":"French Eurosceptics in the Context of World-Systems Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Achieving changes to education practices and structures is a significant issue facing reformers internationally, and researchers have confronted how such changes, and the conditions for these, might be conceptualized. These issues resonate particularly as researchers grapple with imagining a post-COVID-19 landscape where social and educational norms may change. Tyack and Tobin, in their 1994 article The Grammar of Schooling: Why has it been so hard to change? argued that several features of the American education system are so persistent as to warrant being understood as the grammar of schooling. In this article, we reconceptualize this grammar by taking seriously Tyack and Tobins insistence that grammar organises meaning. Starting here, we argue that what they took to be grammatical features are the products and not the producers of meaning. We draw on the cases of the United States and England to argue that four international discourses have performed this meaning-making work: industrialization; welfarism; neoliberalism and neoconservatism. These are the grammars of schoolingand of society. Their discursive products, including age grading and sorting into subjects are, we suggest, lexical features that express the grammar. We use lexical features to explain the multi-directional interplay between discourse and educational feature: the lexical may endure longer than the grammatical, changes to which may be effected and/or legitimated through appealing to a lexical feature. We conclude by outlining key implications for realizing and conceptualizing educational change, including for a post-COVID-19 landscape.","output":"Thinking with lexical features to reconceptualize the grammar of schooling: Shifting the focus from school to society"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Accurate and rapid assessment of the healing status of a wound in a simple and noninvasive manner would enable clinicians to diagnose wounds in real time and promptly adjust treatments to hasten the resolution of nonhealing wounds. Histologic and biochemical characterization of biopsied wound tissue, which is currently the only reliable method for wound assessment, is invasive, complex to interpret, and slow. Here we demonstrate the use of Raman microspectroscopy coupled with multivariate spectral analysis as a simple, noninvasive method to biochemically characterize healing wounds in mice and to accurately identify different phases of healing of wounds at different time-points. Raman spectra were collected from \\"splinted\\" full thickness dermal wounds in mice at 4 time-points (0, 1, 5, and 7 days) corresponding to different phases of wound healing, as verified by histopathology. Spectra were deconvolved using multivariate factor analysis (MFA) into 3 \\"factor score spectra\\" (that act as spectral signatures for different stages of healing) that were successfully correlated with spectra of prominent pure wound bed constituents (i.e., collagen, lipids, fibrin, fibronectin, etc.) using non-negative least squares (NNLS) fitting. We show that the factor loadings (weights) of spectra that belonged to wounds at different time-points provide a quantitative measure of wound healing progress in terms of key parameters such as inflammation and granulation. Wounds at similar stages of healing were characterized by clusters of loading values and slowly healing wounds among them were successfully identified as \\"outliers\\". Overall, our results demonstrate that Raman spectroscopy can be used as a noninvasive technique to provide insight into the status of normally healing and slow-to-heal wounds and that it may find use as a complementary tool for real-time, in situ biochemical characterization in wound healing studies and clinical diagnosis.","output":"Raman spectroscopy enables noninvasive biochemical characterization and identification of the stage of healing of a wound."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mutations may diminish vaccine-induced protective immune responses, particularly as antibody titers wane over time.

The coronavirus crisis has affected many sectors in Romania, some companies diminishing or even ceasing their activity. Making forecasts of the unemployment rate has a fundamental impact and importance on future social policy strategies. The aim of the paper is to comparatively analyze the forecast performances of different univariate time series methods with the purpose of providing future predictions of unemployment rate. In order to do that, several forecasting models (seasonal model autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA), self-exciting threshold autoregressive (SETAR), HoltCWinters, ETS (error, trend, seasonal), and NNAR (neural network autoregression)) have been applied, and their forecast performances have been evaluated on both the in-sample data covering the period January 2000CDecember 2017 used for the model identification and estimation and the out-of-sample data covering the last three years, 2018C2020. The forecast of unemployment rate relies on the next two years, 2021C2022. Based on the in-sample forecast assessment of different methods, the forecast measures root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percent error (MAPE) suggested that the multiplicative HoltCWinters model outperforms the other models. For the out-of-sample forecasting performance of models, RMSE and MAE values revealed that the NNAR model has better forecasting performance, while according to MAPE, the SARIMA model registers higher forecast accuracy. The empirical results of the DieboldCMariano test at one forecast horizon for out-of-sample methods revealed differences in the forecasting performance between SARIMA and NNAR, of which the best model of modeling and forecasting unemployment rate was considered to be the NNAR model.","output":"Comparative Analysis of Different Univariate Forecasting Methods in Modelling and Predicting the Romanian Unemployment Rate for the Period 2021C2022"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant morbidity and mortality worldwide.

Here, we solved the crystal structure of three spike-derived peptides presented by three different HLA molecules, and determined the stability of the overall peptideCHLA complexes formed.

Clinical and pre-clinical studies demonstrated that RAAS-blocking agents can be safely used during a SARS-CoV-2 infection but it is unknown if DPP-4 inhibitors or SGLT2-blockers may promote COVID-19 by increasing the host viral entry enzymes ACE2 and TMPRSS2. METHODS: We investigated telmisartan, linagliptin and empagliflozin induced effects on renal and cardiac expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and key enzymes involved in RAAS (REN, AGTR2, AGT) under high-salt conditions in a non-diabetic experimental 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6 Nx) model. In the present study, the gene expression of Ace2, Tmprss2, Ren, Agtr2 and Agt was assessed with qRT-PCR and the protein expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 with immunohistochemistry in the following experimental groups: Sham + normal diet (ND) + placebo (PBO); 5/6Nx + ND + PBO; 5/6Nx + high salt-diet (HSD) + PBO; 5/6Nx + HSD + telmisartan; 5/6Nx + HSD + linagliptin; 5/6Nx + HSD + empagliflozin. RESULTS: In the kidney, the expression of Ace2 was not altered on mRNA level under disease and treatment conditions. The renal TMPRSS2 levels (mRNA and protein) were not affected, whereas the cardiac level was significantly increased in 5/6Nx rats. Intriguingly, the elevated TMPRSS2 protein expression in the heart was significantly normalized after treatment with telmisartan, linagliptin and empagliflozin. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that there is no upregulation regarding host factors potentially promoting SARS-CoV-2 virus entry into host cells when the SGLT2-blocker empagliflozin, telmisartan and the DPP4-inhibitor blocker linagliptin are used. The results obtained in a preclinical, experimental non-diabetic kidney failure model need confirmation in ongoing interventional clinical trials.","output":"Regulation of SARS CoV-2 host factors in the kidney and heart in rats with 5/6 nephrectomyeffects of salt, ARB, DPP4 inhibitor and SGLT2 blocker"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Virus isolation and accurate characterization plays a crucial role in the rapid identification of the causative agents of infectious disease outbreaks especially if the causative viruses are novel where no pre-existing diagnostic reagents would be available.

Further virus sequence alignment analysis showed evidences for virus mutation happening at primers binding sites. ConclusionsThe inconsistency in the RT-PCR results for JPN-N1, JPN-N2, CDC-N1, and CDC-N2 primer-probe sets could be attributed to differences in virus mutation at primers binding site as observed in sequence analysis.

Most current at-home HF management protocols include paper guidelines or exploratory health applications that lack rigor and validation at the level of the individual patient. We report on a novel triage methodology that uses machine learning predictions for real-time detection and assessment of exacerbations. Medical specialist opinions on statistically and clinically comprehensive, simulated patient cases were used to train and validate prediction algorithms. Model performance was assessed by comparison to physician panel consensus in a representative, out-of-sample validation set of 100 vignettes. Algorithm prediction accuracy and safety indicators surpassed all individual specialists in identifying consensus opinion on existence/severity of exacerbations and appropriate treatment response. The algorithms also scored the highest sensitivity, specificity, and PPV when assessing the need for emergency care.

This virus affects mainly the respiratory system, but the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is also a target, meanwhile SARS-CoV-2 was already detected in oesophagus, stomach, duodenum, rectum, and in fecal samples from COVID-19 patients. Prolonged GIT manifestations in COVID-19, mainly the diarrhea, were correlated with decreased richness and diversity of the gut microbiota, immune deregulation and delayed SARS-CoV-2 clearance. So, the bidirectional interactions between the respiratory mucosa and the gut microbiota, known as gut-lung axis, are supposed to be involved in the healthy or pathologic immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. In accordance, the intestinal dysbiosis is associated with increased mortality in other respiratory infections, due to an exacerbated inflammation and decreased regulatory or anti-inflammatory mechanisms in the lungs and in the gut, pointing to this important relationship between both mucosal compartments. Therefore, since the mucous membranes from the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts are affected, in addition to dysbiosis and inflammation, it is plausible to assume that adjunctive therapies based on the modulation of the gut microbiota and re-establishment of eubiosis conditions could be an important therapeutic approach for constraining the harmful consequences of COVID-19. Then, in this review, we summarized studies showing the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in the gastrointestinal system and the related digestive COVID-19 manifestations, in addition to the literature demonstrating nasopharyngeal, pulmonary and intestinal dysbiosis in COVID-19 patients.

Considering sex hormones, luteinizing hormone and prolactin levels were higher among those recovered with a significant MD (95% CI) of 3.47 (1.59, 5.35)U l(?1) and 3.21 (1.71, 4.72)ng ml(?1) respectively. CONCLUSION: We found that COVID-19 affects both semen parameters and sexual hormones. However, the mechanism for testicular involvement remains doubtful.

Millions of people have been infected and hundreds of thousands have succumbed to the virus. Research regarding the coronavirus pandemic is published every day. However, there is limited discourse regarding societal perception. Thus, this paper examines blame attribution concerning the origin and propagation of the coronavirus crisis according to public perception. Specifically, data were extracted from the social media platform Twitter concerning the coronavirus during the early stages of the outbreak and further investigated using thematic analysis. The findings revealed the public predominantly blames national governments for the coronavirus pandemic. In addition, the results documented the explosion of conspiracy theories among social media users regarding the virus' origin. In the early stages of the pandemic, the blame tendency was most frequent to conspiracy theories and restriction of information from the government, whilst in the later months, responsibility had shifted to political leaders and the media. The findings indicate an emerging government mistrust that may result in disregard of preventive health behaviours and the amplification of conspiracy theories, and an evolving dynamic of blame. This study argues for a transparent, continuing dialogue between governments and the public to stop the spread of the coronavirus.","output":"Perceptions of blame on social media during the coronavirus pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the socio-economic burden imposed on the Chinese healthcare system during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was used to investigate how COVID-19 impacted health and medical costs in China. Data were derived from a subdivision of the Centers for Disease control and Prevention of China. METHODS: We prospectively collected information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the designated hospitals to determine the cost of public health care and hospitalisation due to COVID-19. We estimated the resource use and direct medical costs associated with public health. RESULTS: The average costs, per case, for specimen collection and nucleic acid testing (NAT [specifically, polymerase chain reaction {PCR}]) in low-risk populations were $29.49 and $53.44, respectively; however, the average cost of NAT in high-risk populations was $297.94 per capita. The average costs per 1000 population for epidemiological surveys, disinfectant, health education and centralised isolation were $49.54, $247.01, $90.22 and $543.72, respectively. A single hospitalisation for COVID-19 in China cost a median of $2158.06 ($1961.13-$2325.65) in direct medical costs incurred only during hospitalisation, whereas the total costs associated with hospitalisation of patients with COVID-19 were estimated to have reached nearly $373.20 million in China as of 20, May, 2020. The cost of public health care associated with COVID-19 as of 20, May, 2020 ($6.83 billion) was 18.31 times that of hospitalisation. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the magnitude of resources needed to treat patients with COVID-19 and control the COVID-19 pandemic.

A nasopharyngeal wash was obtained at enrollment and studied by direct fluorescence assay and polymerase chain reaction for nine different types of virus. A sample of 134 patients was obtained, median age 2.9 years (0.1-11.2 y). Respiratory viruses were detected in 73.9% (99/134) with a coinfection rate of 30.3% (30/99). Rhinovirus was the most frequent virus (53/134; 39.6%), followed by influenza (33/134; 24.6%) and respiratory syncytial virus (8/134; 13.4%). Antibiotic prescription rate was 39.6% (53/134) and 69.8% (37/53) were considered inappropriate. Patients with influenza infection received antibiotics inappropriately in a greater proportion of cases when compared to respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus infections (p = 0.016).

The aim of this study was to investigate and evaluate uROR as a quality indicator. Methods: The case records of pediatric patients who underwent reoperation within the 30-day period after primary surgery, from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. The primary outcome of the study was the rate of uROR as a quality indicator in pediatric surgery. Secondary outcomes were indications for primary and secondary surgery, types and management of complications, factors that led to uROR, length of hospital stay, duration of surgery and anesthesia, and starting time of surgery. Results: A total of 3982 surgical procedures, under general anesthesia, were performed during the three-year study period (2018, n = 1432; 2019, n = 1435; 2020, n = 1115). Elective and emergency surgeries were performed in 3032 (76.1%) and 950 (23.9%) patients, respectively. During the study period 19 (0.5%) pediatric patients, with the median age of 11 years (IQR 3, 16), underwent uROR within the 30-day postoperative period. The uROR incidence was 6 (0.4%), 6 (0.4%), and 7 (0.6%) for years 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively (p = 0.697). The incidence of uROR was significantly higher in males (n = 14; 73.7%) than in females (n = 5; 26.3%) (p = 0.002). The share of unplanned reoperations in studied period was 4.5 times higher in primarily emergency surgeries compared to primarily elective surgeries (p < 0.001). The difference in incidence was 0.9% (95% CI, 0.4C1.4). Out of children that underwent uROR within the 30-day period after elective procedures, 50% had American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score three or higher (p = 0.016). The most common procedure which led to uROR was appendectomy (n = 5, 26.3%) while the errors in surgical technique were the most common cause for uROR (n = 11, 57.9%). Conclusion: Unplanned reoperations within the 30-day period after the initial surgical procedure can be a good quality indicator in pediatric surgery.

We sought to determine the efficacy of early administration of anti-interleukin 6 therapy in reducing hospital mortality and progression to mechanical ventilation. METHODS: This was a retrospective chart review of 11,512 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 who were admitted to a New York health system from March to May 2020. Tocilizumab was administered to subjects at the nasal cannula level of oxygen support to maintain an oxygen saturation of >88%. The Charlson comorbidity index was used as an objective assessment of the burden of comorbidities to predict 10-year mortality. The primary outcome of interest was hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were progression to mechanical ventilation; the prevalence of venous thromboembolism and renal failure; and the change in C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and ferritin levels after tocilizumab administration. Propensity score matching by using a 1:2 protocol was used to match the tocilizumab and non-tocilizumab groups to minimize selection bias. The groups were matched on baseline demographic characteristics, including age, sex, and body mass index; Charlson comorbidity index score; laboratory markers, including ferritin, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein values; and the maximum oxygen requirement at the time of tocilizumab administration. Mortality outcomes were evaluated based on the level of oxygen requirement and the day of hospitalization at the time of tocilizumab administration. RESULTS: The overall hospital mortality was significantly reduced in the tocilizumab group when tocilizumab was administered at the nasal cannula level (10.4% vs 22.0%; P = .002). In subjects who received tocilizumab at the nasal cannula level, the progression to mechanical ventilation was reduced versus subjects who were initially on higher levels of oxygen support (6.3% vs 18.7%; P < .001). There was no improvement in mortality when tocilizumab was given at the time of requiring non-rebreather, high-flow nasal cannula, noninvasive ventilator, or invasive ventilator.

We previously demonstrated that PRV infection induces a specific and lethal inflammatory response, contributing to severe neuropathy in mice. So far, the mechanisms that initiate this neuroinflammation remain unknown. Using a mouse footpad inoculation model, we found that PRV infection rapidly and simultaneously induces high G-CSF and IL-6 levels in several mouse tissues, including the footpad, PNS and central nervous system (CNS) tissues. Interestingly, this global increase occurred before PRV had replicated in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) neurons and also was independent of systemic inflammation. These high G-CSF and IL-6 levels were not caused by neutrophil infiltration in PRV infected tissues, as we did not detect any neutrophils. Efficient PRV replication and spread in the footpad was sufficient to activate DRGs to produce cytokines. Finally, by using knockout mice, we demonstrated that TLR2 and IFN type I play crucial roles in modulating the early neuroinflammatory response and clinical outcome of PRV infection in mice. Overall, these results give new insights into the initiation of virus-induced neuroinflammation during herpesvirus infections.","output":"Alphaherpesvirus infection of mice primes PNS neurons to an inflammatory state regulated by TLR2 and type I IFN signaling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological data on COVID-19 infection in care homes are scarce. We analysed data from a large provider of long-term care for older people to investigate infection and mortality during the first wave of the pandemic. METHODS: Cohort study of 179 UK care homes with 9,339 residents and 11,604 staff. We used manager-reported daily tallies to estimate the incidence of suspected and confirmed infection and mortality in staff and residents. Individual-level electronic health records from 8,713 residents were used to model risk factors for confirmed infection, mortality, and estimate attributable mortality. RESULTS: 2,075/9,339 residents developed COVID-19 symptoms (22.2% [95% confidence interval: 21.4%; 23.1%]), while 951 residents (10.2% [9.6%; 10.8%]) and 585 staff (5.0% [4.7%; 5.5%]) had laboratory-confirmed infections. The incidence of confirmed infection was 152.6 [143.1; 162.6] and 62.3 [57.3; 67.5] per 100,000 person-days in residents and staff respectively. 121/179 (67.6%) care homes had at least one COVID-19 infection or COVID-19-related death. Lower staffing ratios and higher occupancy rates were independent risk factors for infection. 217/607 residents with confirmed infection died (case-fatality rate: 35.7% [31.9%; 39.7%]). Mortality in residents with no direct evidence of infection was two-fold higher in care homes with outbreaks versus those without (adjusted HR 2.2 [1.8; 2.6]). CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest many deaths occurred in people who were infected with COVID-19, but not tested. Higher occupancy and lower staffing levels were independently associated with risks of infection.

This study reports the point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection during testing conducted at sites serving people experiencing homelessness in Toronto during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also explored the association between site characteristics and prevalence rates. METHODS: The study included individuals who were staying at shelters, encampments, COVID-19 physical distancing sites, and drop-in and respite sites and completed outreach-based testing for SARS-CoV-2 during the period April 17 to July 31, 2020. We examined test positivity rates over time and compared them to rates in the general population of Toronto. Negative binomial regression was used to examine the relationship between each shelter-level characteristic and SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates. We also compared the rates across 3 time periods (T1: April 17CApril 25; T2: April 26CMay 23; T3: May 24CJune 25). RESULTS: The overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 8.5% (394/4657). Site-specific rates showed great heterogeneity with infection rates ranging from 0% to 70.6%. Compared to T1, positivity rates were 0.21 times lower (95% CI: 0.06C0.75) during T2 and 0.14 times lower (95% CI: 0.04C0.44) during T3. Most cases were detected during outbreak testing (384/394 [97.5%]) rather than active case finding. CONCLUSION: During the first wave of the pandemic, rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection at sites for people experiencing homelessness in Toronto varied significantly over time. The observation of lower rates at certain sites may be attributable to overall time trends, expansion of outreach-based testing to include sites without known outbreaks, and/or individual site characteristics.

Healthcare experts support the adoption of validated screening tools within primary care practice to identify and connect FI patients to healthy and affordable food resources. Yet, a lack of standard practices limits uptake. The purpose of this study was to understand program processes and outcomes of primary care focused FI screening initiatives that may guide wide-scale program implementation. METHODS: This was an embedded multiple case study of two primary care-focused initiatives implemented in two diverse health systems in Chicago and Suburban Cook County that routinely screened patients for FI and referred them to onsite food assistance programs. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and an iterative process were used to collect/analyze qualitative data through semi-structured interviews with N = 19 healthcare staff. Intended program activities, outcomes, actors, implementation barriers/facilitators and overarching implementation themes were identified as a part of a cross-case analysis. RESULTS: Programs outcomes included: the number of patients screened, identified as FI and that participated in the onsite food assistance program. Study participants reported limited internal resources as implementation barriers for program activities. The implementation climate that leveraged the strength of community collaborations and aligned internal, implementation climate were critical facilitators that contributed to the flexibility of program activities that were tailored to fill gaps in resources and meet patient and clinician needs. CONCLUSION: Highly adaptable programs and the healthcare context enhanced implementation feasibility across settings. These characteristics can support program uptake in other settings, but should be used with caution to preserve program fidelity.

OBJECTIVES: To describe and characterize the association of NCDs with the case-fatality rate (CFR) adjusted by age and sex in Mexican adults with a positive diagnosis for SARS-Cov-2. METHODS: We studied Mexican adults aged 20 years who tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 during the period from 28 February to 31 July 2020. The CFR was calculated and associations with history of NCDs (number of diseases and combinations), severity indicators and type of institution that treated the patient were explored. The relative risk (RR) of death was estimated using Poisson models and CFR was adjusted using logistic models. RESULTS: We analysed 406 966 SARS-Cov-2-positive adults. The CFR was 11.2% (13.7% in men and 8.4% in women). The CFR was positively associated with age and number of NCDs (p trend <0.001). The number of NCDs increased the risk of death in younger adults when they presented three or more NCDs compared with those who did not have any NCDs [RR, 46.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 28.2, 76.9 for women; RR, 16.5; 95% CI, 9.9, 27.3 for men]. Lastly, there was great heterogeneity in the CFR by institution, from 4.6% in private institutions to 18.9% in public institutions.

For State of Qatar, the mobility was decreased to all places except residential locations. Further, the comparison for traffic volumes and the number of crashes during the first wave of the pandemic indicated that the reduction in traffic volumes, major, and minor crashes was coupled with restrictive measures rather than COVID-19 incidences for both countries. Further, the traffic volumes showed a statistically significant inverse linear relationship with the stringency index for both countries during weekdays as well as weekends. These results suggest that the policy measures are key in governing movement restrictions and containing the spread of pandemic rather than the number of COVID-19 incidences.

This study explores the impact of ambient air pollutants, particular matter (PM), PM2.5 and PM10 on morbidity and mortality of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) globally. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, initially 492 research articles were identified through seven search engines containing Web of Science, Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, WHO COVID-19 literature, and Ovid databases by consuming keywords \\"Environmental pollution, Ambient air pollutants, particulate matter, PM2.5, PM10, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and COVID-19 pandemic\\". Finally, 26 original research publications were included for the analysis, and the remaining were excluded. These studies were originated from the United States of America (9), China (5), Italy (3), India (1), worldwide (1), and one study each from England, Spain, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Japan, and Iran. RESULTS: The analysis based on a worldwide dataset assembled the information from the global literature from December 2019 to September 30, 2021. The assessment for the various regions to a global extent was based on air pollutants and COVID-19 cases and deaths. Twenty- six studies met the selection criteria representing almost all over the world.

The kindergartens reopened on April 20, and the schools on April 27 and May 11 of 2020. The effect of these measures is largely unknown since the role of children in the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is still unclear. There are only a few studies of school closures as a separate intervention to other social distancing measures, and little research exists on the effect of school opening during a pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to model the effect of opening kindergartens and the schools in Norway in terms of a change in the reproduction number (R). A secondary objective was to assess if we can use the estimated R after school openings to infer the rates of transmission between children in schools. METHODS: We used an individual-based model (IBM) to assess the reopening of kindergartens and schools in two Norwegian cities, Oslo, the Norwegian capital, with a population of approximately 680 000, and Troms?, which is the largest city in Northern Norway, with a population of approximately 75 000. The model uses demographic information and detailed data about the schools in both cities. We carried out an ensemble study to obtain robust results in spite of the considerable uncertainty that remains about the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: We found that reopening of Norwegian kindergartens and schools are associated with a change in R of 0.10 (95%CI 0.04-0.16) and 0.14 (95%CI 0.01-0.25) in the two cities under investigation if the in-school transmission rates for the SARS-CoV-2 virus are equal to what has previously been estimated for influenza pandemics. CONCLUSION: We found only a limited effect of reopening schools on the reproduction number, and we expect the same to hold true in other countries where nonpharmaceutical interventions have suppressed the pandemic. Consequently, current R-estimates are insufficiently accurate for determining the transmission rates in schools. For countries that have closed schools, planned interventions, such as the opening of selected schools, can be useful to infer general knowledge about children-to-children transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Modelling suggests limited change in the reproduction number from reopening Norwegian kindergartens and schools during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has catalyzed the rapid adoption of telemedicine which encompasses synchronous and asynchronous interactions between patients and providers In order to facilitate this rapid deployment, there has been numerous regulatory changes to ensure caregivers can effectively communicate with patients during this time We illustrate a model where people, processes, and technology work together to address the comprehensive needs of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients We provide a template for how multidisciplinary, academic practices can implement a rapid shift to virtual management during the pandemic using existing infrastructure that can be widely adopted to care for patients with chronic diseases Telemedicine was incorporated into our entire practice, which encompasses neurology, rehabilitation, advanced practice providers, fellows, social work, and behavioral medicine Our patient satisfaction results remained stable across almost all domains when compared to survey results from our typical, in-office visits Our experience demonstrates telemedicine's transformative potential in successfully managing a multidisciplinary MS clinic during the time of a pandemic and outlines a potential path for other practices to follow","output":"Providing Person-Centered Care via Telemedicine in the Era of COVID-19 in Multiple Sclerosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background People who live with respiratory diseases like asthma are more likely at risk of serious illness. Spatial analytic techniques allow for discovering areas of concern and finding correlates of asthma prevalence. Objective There is growing interest in disentangling the impacts of socioeconomic and environmental factors on respiratory health, their spatial correlation, and the demographic profile of people at risk of respiratory diseases. It is important to know how people with asthma are geographically distributed and what social and environmental factors correlate with asthma. Thereby, the purpose of the study is to describe socioeconomic factors associated with asthma prevalence in Cook County, IL, and to identify the significant risks and the protective factors to control asthma. Data and Methods Data obtained from CDC 2018 SVI, ACS, the City of Chicago Data Portal, HealthData.gov, and ESRI. In this paper, we illustrate the usefulness of geospatial regression analysis in the analysis and presentation of spatially distributed asthma prevalence among the population with disabilities, minorities with the language barrier, nonwhite population, age 17 and younger, and age 65 and older in the census tracts of Cook County, IL where Chicago Metropolitan Area located. In addition, we map the spatial variation of asthma prevalence with variation in the tree canopy, access to medical centers, air quality, and household quality. Lastly, we used bivariate mapping to illustrate the spatial distributions of residential land use and tree covers. Results Our findings show a good correlation between asthma and socioeconomic and physical factors including age 17 and younger, age 65 and older, population with disabilities, a minority with the language barrier, tree canopy, access to medical centers, air quality, and household quality. The aged 65 and older, 17 and younger, and people with disabilities are found to have a higher asthma prevalence in areas around the industrial corridors in southeast and west sides of Cook County, IL.

The ability of conventional global coagulation tests to accurately reflect in vivo hypo- or hypercoagulability is questioned. The currently available evidence suggests that markedly increased D-dimers can be used in identifying COVID-19 patients who may need intensive care unit (ICU) admission and close monitoring or not. Viscoelastic methods (VMs), like thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM), estimate the dynamics of blood coagulation. The evaluation of coagulopathy by VMs in severe COVID-19 infection seems an increasingly attractive option. Available evidence supports that COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure suffer from severe hypercoagulability rather than consumptive coagulopathy often associated with fibrinolysis shutdown. However, the variability in definitions of both the procoagulant profile and the clinical outcome assessment, in parallel with the small sample sizes in most of these studies, do not allow the establishment of a clear association between the hypercoagulable state and thrombotic events. VMs can effectively provide insight into the pathophysiology of coagulopathy, detecting the presence of hypercoagulability in critically ill COVID-19 patients.

METHODS Patients with intracranial aneurysms treated with the PV at 10 international neurovascular centers were retrospectively analyzed. Patient and aneurysm characteristics, procedural parameters, complications, and the grade of occlusion were assessed. RESULTS 60 patients with 70 aneurysms (5.0% with acute hemorrhage, 90.0% located in the anterior circulation) were included. 82 PVs were implanted in 61 treatment sessions. The PV could be successfully implanted in all treatments. Additional coiling was performed in 18.6%, and in-stent balloon angioplasty (to enhance the vessel wall apposition) in 24.6%. Periprocedural technical complications occurred in 24.6% of the treatments, were predominantly FD deployment problems, and were all asymptomatic. The overall symptomatic complication rate was 8.2% and the neurological symptomatic complication rate was 3.3%. Only one symptomatic complication was device-related (perforator artery infarctions leading to stroke). After a mean follow-up of 7.1 months, the rate of complete aneurysm occlusion was 77.9%.

All-cause excess mortality provides an objective measure of the impact of the pandemic including both the direct and indirect effects. Our study considers the burden of mortality in the UK, Europe and the USA. We examine variation between countries, by age and sex. We explore the extent to which this variation is associated with COVID-19 case rates and other population characteristics. METHODS: The study is a secondary analysis of routine administrative population and mortality data. Weekly death occurrences and population estimates were obtained from Eurostat and national statistical agencies. Contextual information on COVID-19 case rates, population-level risk factors and healthcare were obtained from various open-source databases. Weekly age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) were calculated and presented relative to a baseline average from the preceding 5-year period. Relative cumulative (rc) ASMRs were then calculated to provide a comparable assessment of excess mortality at a point in time. RESULTS: Preliminary results show that, by end of the analysis period, England had an overall rcASMR of 10.09%. Higher excess mortality was identified for some countries (eg USA 14.58%) and lower - even below average mortality - for others (eg Norway -6.8%). Under 65 rcASMR showed substantial variation between countries. Cumulative COVID-19 case rates showed a moderate effect size (R2 = 0.51) when used to explain the proportion of variation observed between rcASMRs. Other population factors showed a smaller effect. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of mortality experienced between countries and populations over the COVID-19 pandemic period has shown significant variation. Factors which may have contributed to the position of some countries should be further explored in order to inform ongoing management of Covid-19 and future pandemic events.

Hence, vaccines targeting multiple SARS-CoV-2 proteins will offer broader protection and improve our preparedness to combat the pandemic. Objectives The study aimed to develop a novel vaccine strategy by combining a eukaryotic vector expressing multiple SARS-CoV-2 genes and Salmonella-mediated in vivo DNA delivery. Methods The eukaryotic vector was designed to function as a DNA-launched RNA replicon in a self-replicating and self-amplifying mRNA mechanism. By exploiting the self-cleaving peptide, P2A, we fused four SARS-CoV-2 targets, including receptor-binding domain (RBD), heptad repeat domain (HR), membrane protein (M) and epitopes of nsp13, in a single open reading frame. Western blot and immunofluorescence assays were used to determine protein expression. In mice, the vaccine's safety and immunogenicity were investigated. Results Western blot analysis revealed co-expression all four proteins from the vaccine construct, confirming the efficiency of Salmonella-mediated gene delivery and protein expression. The vaccine candidate was safe and elicited robust antigen-specific antibody titers in mice, and a recall response from splenocytes revealed induction of strong cell-mediated immunity. Flow cytometry demonstrated an increase in sub-populations of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with the highest CD4+ and CD8+ T cells recorded for HR and RBD, respectively. Overall, humoral and cellular immune response data suggested the induction of both Th1 and Th2 immunity with polarization towards an antiviral Th1 response. SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays exhibited potent neutralizing antibody titers in mouse immune sera. Conclusions The Salmonella bactofection ensured optimum in vivo gene delivery, and through a P2A-enabled efficient multicistronic expression, the vaccine candidate elicited potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune responses. These findings provide important insight into development of an effective multivalent vaccine to combat SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.","output":"Highly feasible immunoprotective multicistronic SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate blending novel eukaryotic expression and Salmonella bactofection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As of June 30, 2021, 33.5 million persons in the United States had received a diagnosis of COVID-19 (1). Although most patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, recover within a few weeks, some experience post-COVID-19 conditions. These range from new or returning to ongoing health problems that can continue beyond 4 weeks. Persons who were asymptomatic at the time of infection can also experience post-COVID-19 conditions. Data on post-COVID-19 conditions are emerging and information on rehabilitation needs among persons recovering from COVID-19 is limited. Using data acquired during January 2020-March 2021 from Select Medical* outpatient rehabilitation clinics, CDC compared patient-reported measures of health, physical endurance, and health care use between patients who had recovered from COVID-19 (post-COVID-19 patients) and patients needing rehabilitation because of a current or previous diagnosis of a neoplasm (cancer) who had not experienced COVID-19 (control patients). All patients had been referred to outpatient rehabilitation. Compared with control patients, post-COVID-19 patients had higher age- and sex-adjusted odds of reporting worse physical health (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.8), pain (aOR = 2.3), and difficulty with physical activities (aOR = 1.6). Post-COVID-19 patients also had worse physical endurance, measured by the 6-minute walk test? (6MWT) (p<0.001) compared with control patients. Among patients referred to outpatient rehabilitation, those recovering from COVID-19 had poorer physical health and functional status than those who had cancer, or were recovering from cancer but not COVID-19.

It is difficult to source reliable data on pediatric PSP, the management of which is based on guidelines for adult PSP; however, the rate of recurrence after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for pediatric PSP is reported to be higher. METHODS We reviewed retrospectively a collective total of 66 surgical cases of a first pneumothorax episode in 46 children under 16 years of age, who were treated at our hospital between February, 2005 and November, 2017. RESULTS The surgical cases were divided into two groups, depending on how the treated lesions were covered. In the dual-covering (DC) group, the PSP was covered by oxidized regenerated cellulose and polyglycolic acid (8 patients; 13 cases) and in the single-covering (SC) group, the PSP was covered by oxidized regenerated cellulose (38 patients; 53 cases). There was no incidence of recurrence after surgery in the DC group, but 17 cases (32.1%) of recurrence after surgery in the SC group. This difference was significant. CONCLUSION The DC method prevented the recurrence of PSP more effectively than the SC method after VATS in pediatric patients. Long-term follow-up after VATS for pediatric PSP is also important because of the risk of delayed recurrence.","output":"A novel dual-covering method in video-assisted thoracic surgery for pediatric primary spontaneous pneumothorax."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bread is a food that is commonly recognized as a very convenient type of food, but it is also easily prone to microbial attack. As a result of bread spoilage, a significant economic loss occurs to both consumers and producers. For years, the bakery industry has sought to identify treatments that make bread safe and with an extended shelf-life to address this economic and safety concern, including replacing harmful chemical preservatives. New frontiers, on the other hand, have recently been explored. Alternative methods of bread preservation, such as microbial fermentation, utilization of plant and animal derivatives, nanofibers, and other innovative technologies, have yielded promising results. This review summarizes numerous research findings regarding the bio-preservation of bread and suggests potential applications of these techniques. Among these techniques, microbial fermentation using lactic acid bacteria strains and yeast has drawn significant interest nowadays because of their outstanding antifungal activity and shelf-life extending capacity. For example, bread slices with Lactobacillus plantarum LB1 and Lactobacillus rossiae LB5 inhibited fungal development for up to 21 days with the lowest contamination score. Moreover, various essential oils and plant extracts, such as lemongrass oil and garlic extracts, demonstrated promising results in reducing fungal growth on bread and other bakery products. In addition, different emerging bio-preservation strategies such as the utilization of whey, nanofibers, active packaging, and modified atmospheric packaging have gained considerable interest in recent days.","output":"A Comprehensive Review on Bio-Preservation of Bread: An Approach to Adopt Wholesome Strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper analyses the impact of sign language legislation and its implementation and the public safety on the example of the Republic of Poland during the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2.

Previous studies have focused on antibodies targeting the head or stem domains, while other possible specificities are often not taken into account. To study such specificities, we developed a diverse set of HA-domain proteins based on an H1N1(pdm2009)-like influenza virus strain, including monomeric head and trimeric stem domain, as well as the full HA-trimer. These proteins were used to study the B cell and antibody responses in six healthy human donors. A large proportion of HA-trimer B cells bound exclusively to HA-trimer probe (54C77%), while only 8C18% and 9C23% were able to recognize the stem or head probe, respectively. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were isolated and three of these mAbs, targeting the different domains, were characterized in-depth to confirm the binding profile observed in flow cytometry. The head-directed mAb, targeting an epitope distinct from known head-specific mAbs, showed relatively broad H1N1 neutralization and the stem-directed mAb was able to broadly neutralize diverse H1N1 viruses. Moreover, we identified a trimer-directed mAb that did not compete with known head or stem domain specific mAbs, suggesting that it targets an unknown epitope or conformation of influenza virus HA. These observations indicate that the described method can characterize the diverse antibody response to HA and might be able to identify HA-specific B cells and antibodies with previously unknown specificities that could be relevant for vaccine design.","output":"Influenza A Virus Hemagglutinin Trimer, Head and Stem Proteins Identify and Quantify Different Hemagglutinin-Specific B Cell Subsets in Humans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"STUDY DESIGN A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. OBJECTIVE The aim was to examine whether posterior lumbar interbody fusion with cortical bone trajectory screw fixation (CBT-PLIF) is inferior to PLIF using traditional trajectory screw fixation (TT-PLIF) regarding early fusion status and whether the titanium-coated polyetheretherketone (PEEK) cage (TP cage) improves early fusion status compared with the same shape pure PEEK cage (P cage). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA We recently reported that the fusion rate was relatively lower after CBT-PLIF than after TT-PLIF, although no significant difference was found and that compared with the carbon PEEK cage, the TP cage significantly reduced the incidence of vertebral endplate cysts (cyst signs) and slightly improved the early fusion rate at 1 year after CBT-PLIF. MATERIALS AND METHODS The subjects were 37 patients undergoing TT-PLIF using P cages (TT-P group), 24 patients undergoing CBT-PLIF using P cages (CBT-P group), 32 patients undergoing TT-PLIF using TP cages (TT-TP group), and 20 patients undergoing CBT-PLIF using TP cages (CBT-TP group). On multiplanar reconstruction computed tomography at 6 months after surgery, cyst signs were evaluated and classified into diffuse or local cysts. Early fusion status was assessed using both dynamic plain radiographs and multiplanar reconstruction computed tomography at 1-year postoperatively. RESULTS The incidence of the diffuse cyst was 27.0% in the TT-P group, 29.2% in the CBT-P group, 25.0% in the TT-TP group and 25.0% in the CBT-TP group (P>0.05).

Background: The present study responds to public concerns that the COVID-19 pandemic might have triggered a backlash in gender equality. Method: Our descriptive analysis is based on pre-release data from the German Family Panel (pairfam;Wave 12) and its supplementary COVID-19 web-survey (n=3,108). Results: We observe no fundamental changes in established aggregate-level patterns of couples' division of labor, but some shift towards the extremes ('traditional' and \`role reversal') of the distribution. Regarding changes within couples, there is an almost equal split between those in which the female partner's share in housework and childcare increased and those in which it decreased. Particularly in previously more egalitarian arrangements, a substantial proportion of women is now more likely to be primarily responsible for everything. If male partners increased their relative contribution to housework and childcare, they rarely moved beyond the threshold of an equal split. Changes in employment hours were associated with adaptations of men's, but not women's, relative contribution to domestic and family responsibilities. Conclusion: Our findings neither support the notion of a 'patriarchal pandemic', nor do they indicate that the Corona crisis might have fostered macro-level trends of gender convergence.

The mechanism(s) by which this occurs remains unclear. Methods We investigated the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 at maternal-fetal interface in pregnant women who tested positive for the virus using RNA in situ hybridization (viral RNA), immunohistochemistry, and hematoxylin and eosin staining. To investigate whether viral infection alters the renin angiotensin system (RAS) in placenta which controls blood pressure, we treated human trophoblasts with recombinant Spike protein or a live modified virus with a vesicular stomatitis viral backbone expressing Spike protein (VSV-S). Findings Viral colonization was highest in maternal decidua, fetal trophoblasts, Hofbauer cells, and in placentas delivered prematurely. We localized SARS-CoV-2 to cells expressing Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and demonstrate that infected placentas had significantly reduced ACE2. In response to both Spike protein and VSV-S, cellular ACE2 decreased while Angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R) increased with concomitant increase in soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1(sFlt1). Viral infection decreased pro-angiogenic factors, AT2R and Placental growth factor, which competitively binds to sFlt1.

These knowledge gaps are relevant because cannabis' effects and health outcomes vary by cROA and the availability and perceptions of cROA (e.g., vaping devices) are changing. METHODS The Vaping In Buprenorphine-treated patients Evaluation (VIBE) cross-sectional survey assessed the prevalence and correlates of cannabis use and cROA among adults receiving buprenorphine MOUD from 02/20 to 07/20 at five community health centers in Massachusetts, a state with legal recreational and medical cannabis use. RESULTS Among the 92/222 (41%) respondents reporting past 30-day cannabis use, smoking was the most common cROA (75%), followed by vaping (38%), and eating (26%). Smoking was more often used as a single cROA vs. in combination others (p = 0.01), whereas vaping, eating, and dabbing were more often used in combination with another cROA (all p < 0.05). Of the 39% of participants reporting multiple cROA, smoking and vaping (61%), and smoking and eating (50%), were the most prevalent combinations. Nonwhite race (vs. white) and current cigarette smoking (vs. no nicotine use) were associated with past 30-day cannabis use in multiple logistic regression. CONCLUSIONS Prevalence of past 30-day cannabis use among individuals receiving buprenorphine MOUD in Massachusetts in 2020 was nearly double the prevalence of cannabis use in Massachusetts' adult general population in 2019 (21%).

The pandemic has resulted in the loss of thousands of lives, the collapse of businesses, indefinite closure of schools, and other activities resulting to the need for a new normal. Virologists, epidemiologists, and all other scientists are working round the clock to bring a stop to this ravaging disease. The virus which exhibits severe acute respiratory syndrome was first detected in Wuhan China towards the end of 2019, with a fatality rate of 2 to 3%. By the first week of May 2020, the infection rate stood at over 3.4 million confirmed cases, with more than 238,000 deaths across 215 countries.

The first category was improved self-care in the shadow of COVID-19 (Improving self-care due to fear of COVID-19, utilization of alternative strategies, and reinforcement of self-care beliefs). The second category was redefinition of support systems (need for a support system, seeking for alternative support systems, and changes in social interactions). The last category was barriers to treatment adherence (shortage of financial resources, need to adjust with working conditions, and mental conflicts). Conclusion: The results indicated that the COVID-19 threats encouraged the patients with CAD to adhere to their care principles.

METHODS: This is a multicenter prospective study of consecutive patients with concomitant COVID-19 and MI who underwent coronary angiography. Quantitative and qualitative coronary angiography were analyzed by two observers in an independent core lab. RESULTS: A total of 152 patients were included, of whom 142 (93.4%) had COVID-19 diagnosis confirmation. The median time between symptom onset and hospital admission was 5 (1-10) days. A total of 83 (54.6%) patients presented with ST-elevation MI. The median angiographic Syntax score was 16 (9.0-25.3) and 69.0% had multi-vessel disease. At least one complex lesion was found in 73.0% of patients, 51.3% had a thrombus containing lesion, and 57.9% had myocardial blush grades 0/1. The overall in-hospital mortality was 23.7%.

Materials and methods The authors provided a self-administered questionnaire to medical students to investigate their e-library adoption attitude during the COVID-19 crisis. The authors distributed 542 questionnaires, received 361 complete responses and analyzed the data through path modeling/partial least squares structural equations modeling technique (PLS-SEM) with the smart PLS software version 3.3.3. The structural equation-modelling tool permits the estimation of results. Results The main finding revealed that medical students have a positive and explicit approach to use the services available at the e-library. Technology use and online services helped students continue their educational needs in the advent of the current pandemic COVID-19. Attitude and subjective norms have significant influence and are strong predictors of intention. However, due to inadequate support for the government side, the perceived behavioural control has an insignificant impact on intention.

The detection of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene in bat astroviruses was confirmed in thirty-four bats across four bat species in Korea: twenty-five from Miniopterus fuliginosusi, one from Myotis macrodactylus, four from M. petax, and four from Rhinolophus ferrumequinum. The highest detection rates for astrovirus were found in Sunchang (61.5%, 8/13 bats), and in the samples collected in April (63.2%, 12/19 bats). The amino acid identity of astroviral sequences identified from bat samples was  46.6%. More specifically, the amino acid identity within multiple clones from individual bats was  50.8%. Additionally, the phylogenetic topology between astroviruses from different bat families showed a close relationship. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of the partial ORF2 sequence of bat astroviruses was found to have a maximum similarity of 73.3C74.8% with available bat astrovirus sequences.

Muco-obstructive lung diseases (MucOLDs) are characterised by the accumulation of hyper-concentrated mucus in the small airways, leading to persistent inflammation, infection and dysregulated protease activity. Although neutrophilic serine proteases, particularly neutrophil elastase, have been implicated in the propagation of inflammation and local tissue destruction, it is likely that the serine TLPs also contribute to various disease-relevant processes given the roles that a number of these enzymes play in the activation of both the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2).

By late January 2020, it was evident that COVID-19 was rapidly spreading and represented a national health emergency. In order to contain the spread of COVID-19, China adopted a centralized treatment plan by appointing designated hospitals in each region. Shantou Central Hospital is a Grade A Class A general hospital in Guangdong Province. It was appointed as a provincial COVID-19 designated treatment hospital on January 21, 2020, to provide all COVID-19-related treatments for the city of Shantou. The nursing department at Shantou Central Hospital is fully responsible for hospital nursing administration, nursing human resource management, nursing quality management, and all nursing tasks related to hospital medical care, nursing, teaching, scientific research, preventive healthcare, and so on. OBJECTIVE: To summarize the role of nursing management in transforming a general hospital into a designated hospital for treatment of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We undertook a series of nursing management measures in the strategic phase and the implementation phase. FINDINGS: Through a series of nursing management measures, all COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital were cured and discharged. All non-COVID-19 patients and staff hospitalized during the same period were not infected with the virus. During this period, our hospital completed 7,466 operations.

Nutritional requirements of three major bovine mastitis pathogens Escherichia coli (E. coli), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and Streptococcus uberis (S. uberis) were investigated in vitro. We used ultra-high temperature (UHT) treated milk with different contents of fat, protein, and carbohydrates to test the influence of the availability of various milk constituents on pathogen growth characteristics. Additionally, the bacterial growth was investigated under experimentally modified nutrient availability by dilution and subsequent supplementation with individual nutrients (carbohydrates, different nitrogen sources, minerals, and different types of B vitamins) either to milk or to a conventional medium (thioglycolate broth, TB). Varying contents of fat, protein or lactose did not affect bacterial growth with the exception of growth of S. uberis being promoted in protein-enriched milk. The addition of nutrients to diluted whole milk and TB partly revealed different effects, indicating that there are media-specific growth limiting factors after dilution. Supplementation of minerals to diluted milk did not affect growth rates of all studied bacteria. Bacterial growth in diluted whole milk was decreased by the addition of high concentrations of amino acids in S. aureus, and by urea and additional B vitamins in E. coli and S. aureus. The growth rate of S. uberis was increased by the addition of B vitamins to diluted whole milk. The present results demonstrate that growth-limiting nutrients differ among pathogen types.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS To chemically induce a chronic wound environment, we applied modified doses of catalase (3-amino-1,2,4-triazole; intraperitoneal 0.5 g/kg) and glutathione peroxidase (mercaptosuccinic acid; topical 300 mg/kg) inhibitors to the dorsal wounds of 11-week-old db/db mice. A cohort of these mice was treated with a collagen-glycosaminoglycan scaffold. Both groups were compared with Diabetic control mice. RESULTS This study successfully induced a chronic wound in 11-week-old db/db mice, with no animal deaths. The antioxidant enzyme treated groups showed delayed wound contraction and significantly higher levels of inflammatory tissue, collagen deposition, cellular proliferation and leukocyte infiltration than the Diabetic control group. Angiogenesis was significantly higher in the antioxidant enzyme treated groups, but the vessels were immature and friable. Scaffold engraftment was poor but appeared to promote blood vessel maturation. CONCLUSIONS Overall, the two in vivo groups treated with the antioxidant enzyme inhibitors appeared to be arrested in the inflammatory stage of wound healing, while the Diabetic control group progressed to the maturation phase and ultimately remodeling.

It manifests in some cases as increasing inflammation to even the onset of a cytokine storm and irreversible progression of acute respiratory syndrome, which is associated with the risk of death in patients. Thus, proactive anti-inflammatory therapy remains an open serious question in patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia, who still have signs of inflammation on days 7-9 of the disease: elevated C-reactive protein (CRP)&gt;60 mg/dL and at least two of the four clinical signs: fever &gt;37.5C; persistent cough; dyspnea (RR &gt;20 brpm) and/or reduced oxygen blood saturation &lt;94% when breathing atmospheric air. We designed the randomized trial: COLchicine versus Ruxolitinib and Secukinumab in Open-label Prospective Randomized Trial in Patients with COVID-19 (COLORIT). We present here data comparing patients who received colchicine with those who did not receive specific anti-inflammatory therapy. Results of the comparison of colchicine, ruxolitinib, and secukinumab will be presented later.Objective Compare efficacy and safety of colchicine compared to the management of patients with COVID-19 without specific anti-inflammatory therapy.Material and Methods Initially, 20 people were expected to be randomized in the control group. However, enrollment to the control group was discontinued subsequently after the inclusion of 5 patients due to the risk of severe deterioration in the absence of anti-inflammatory treatment. Therefore, 17 patients, who had not received anti-inflammatory therapy when treated in the MSU Medical Research and Educational Center before the study, were also included in the control group. The effects were assessed on day 12 after the inclusion or at discharge if it occurred earlier than on day 12. The primary endpoint was the changes in the SHOCS-COVID score, which includes the assessment of the patient's clinical condition, CT score of the lung tissue damage, the severity of systemic inflammation (CRP changes), and the risk of thrombotic complications (D-dimer) [1].Results The median SHOCS score decreased from 8 to 2 (p = 0.017), i.e., from moderate to mild degree, in the colchicine group. The change in the SHOCS-COVID score was minimal and statistically insignificant in the control group. In patients with COVID-19 treated with colchicine, the CRP levels decreased rapidly and normalized (from 99.4 to 4.2 mg/dL, p&lt;0.001). In the control group, the CRP levels decreased moderately and statistically insignificantly and achieved 22.8 mg/dL by the end of the follow-up period, which was still more than four times higher than normal. The most informative criterion for inflammation lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio (LCR) increased in the colchicine group by 393 versus 54 in the control group (p = 0.003). After treatment, it was 60.8 in the control group, which was less than 100 considered safe in terms of systemic inflammation progression. The difference from 427 in the colchicine group was highly significant (p = 0.003).The marked and rapid decrease in the inflammation factors was accompanied in the colchicine group by the reduced need for oxygen support from 14 (66.7%) to 2 (9.5%). In the control group, the number of patients without anti-inflammatory therapy requiring oxygen support remained unchanged at 50%. There was a trend to shorter hospital stays in the group of specific anti-inflammatory therapy up to 13 days compared to 17.5 days in the control group (p = 0.079). Moreover, two patients died in the control group, and there were no fatal cases in the colchicine group. In the colchicine group, one patient had deep vein thrombosis with D-dimer elevated to 5.99 g/mL, which resolved before discharge.Conclusions Colchicine 1 mg for 1-3 days followed by 0.5 mg/day for 14 days is effective as a proactive anti-inflammatory therapy in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and viral pneumonia. The management of such patients without proactive anti-inflammatory therapy is likely to be unreasonable and may worsen the course of COVID-19.

Hypotonic liquid exudation from the nasal surface detaches and drains the inflammatory cytokines and other contaminants towards the film where selected polymers bind and neutralize SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 and RBD protein as well as Covid-19 disease-specific key pro-inflammatory IL-6, TNF-, IL-10, IL-13, and GM-CSF cytokines. CONCLUSION: Minimizing the nasal surface concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines and viruses should help nasal mucosa repair and avoid immune stress. This nearly instant, simple, scientific, safe, and logical approach should help attenuate Covid-19 induced systemic inflammation at an early stage without being affected by viral S1 spike protein mutations.","output":"Anti-Inflammatory and Antiviral Osmotic Polymeric Film to Treat Covid-19 Early-Stage Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research from financial stress, disasters, pandemics, and other extreme events, suggests that behavioral health will suffer, including anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress symptoms. Furthermore, these symptoms are likely to exacerbate alcohol or drug use, especially for those vulnerable to relapse. The nature of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and vast reach of the virus, leave many unknows for the repercussions on behavioral health, yet existing research suggests that behavioral health concerns should take a primary role in response to the pandemic. We propose a 4-step services system designed for implementation with a variety of different groups and reserves limited clinical services for the most extreme reactions. While we can expect symptoms to remit overtime, many will also have longer-term or more severe concerns. Behavioral health interventions will likely need to change overtime and different types of interventions should be considered for different target groups, such as for those who recover from COVID-19, health-care professionals, and essential personnel; and the general public either due to loss of loved ones or significant life disruption.

However, relatively little is known about the extent to which individual differences in cognition are determined by domain-specific compared with domain-general cognitive abilities. We examined individual differences in learning speed of zebra finches across seven different tasks to determine the extent of domain-specific versus domain-general learning abilities, as well as the relationship between learning speed and learning generalization. Thirty-two zebra finches completed a foraging board experiment that included visual and structural discriminations, and then these same birds went through an acoustic operant discrimination experiment that required discriminating between different natural categories of acoustic stimuli. We found evidence of domain-general learning abilities as birds relative performance on the seven learning tasks was weakly repeatable and a principal components analysis found a first principal component that explained 36% of the variance in performance across tasks with all tasks loading unidirectionally on this component. However, the few significant correlations between tasks and high repeatability within each experiment suggest the potential for domain-specific abilities. Learning speed did not influence an individuals ability to generalize learning. These results suggest that zebra finch performance across visual, structural, and auditory learning relies upon some common mechanism; some might call this evidence of general intelligence(g), but it is also possible that this finding is due to other noncognitive mechanisms such as motivation.

In 2009, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) began clinical development of intravenous (IV) zanamivir and initiated a global Compassionate Use Program (CUP) in response to the evolving H1N1 global pandemic. The goal of the CUP was to provide zanamivir to critically ill patients with limited treatment options. METHODS: Zanamivir was administered to patients with suspected or confirmed influenza infection who were not suitable for other approved antiviral treatments. Reporting of serious adverse events (SAEs) was mandatory and recorded in the GSK safety database. A master summary tracking sheet captured requests and patient characteristics. A case report form was available for detailing medical conditions, dosing, treatment duration, and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: In total, 4,033 requests were made for zanamivir treatment of hospitalized patients from 38 countries between 2009 and 2019; 95% patients received zanamivir via the IV route. Europe had the highest number of requests (n = 3,051) followed by North America (n = 713). At least 20 patients were aged 6 months, of whom 12 were born prematurely. The GSK safety database included 466 patients with 1 SAE, of whom 374 (80%) had a fatal outcome. Drug-related SAEs were reported in 41 (11%) patients, including hepatic failure (n = 6 [2%]) and acute kidney injury (n = 5 [1%)].

Resumption of employment after lung transplantation is generally supported. In Switzerland, there are no data on long-term employment in people with cystic fibrosis undergoing lung transplantation. METHODS: In a single-centre, cross-sectional study at a Swiss university hospital, clinical data from lung transplant recipients with cystic fibrosis, covering the transplantation period from January 1996 to December 2016, were analysed retrospectively. The potential influence of pre-lung transplantation factors (age, sex, lung function, body mass index, six-minute walk test distance, lung transplantation wait list time, paid employment on the wait list, education, relationship status, housing situation) and post-lung transplantation factors (chronic allograft dysfunction [CLAD], dialysis, cancer diagnosis [except skin cancer]) on paid employment and work percentage after lung transplantation were investigated using mixed logistic and linear regression models. Descriptive analyses of paid employment were performed for various periods after lung transplantation (&lt;1, 1&ndash;3, 3&ndash;5, 5&ndash;10, &gt;10 years). Data are reported as odds ratios (ORs) or coefficients (&beta;) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Eighty-four subjects (46.4% female) with a mean &plusmn; SD age of 29.9 &plusmn; 8.4 years were included in the study. Mean wait time for lung transplantation was 42.7 &plusmn; 40.2 weeks.

In mixed logistic regression models, pre-lung transplantation paid employment (OR 24.03, 95% CI 6.08 to 164.39, p &lt;0.0001), academic education (OR 7.81, 95% CI 1.66 to 48.66, p = 0.01) and time post lung transplantation (on log scale, OR 5.81, 95% CI 3.15 to 12.78, p &lt;0.0001) were the main factors influencing post-lung transplantation paid employment status. In mixed linear regression models, pre-lung transplantation paid employment (&beta; = 21.40, 95% CI 10.98 to 31.81, p = 0.00014), academic education (&beta; = 12.54, 95% CI 0.48 to 24.55, p = 0.05) and time post lung transplantation (on log scale, &beta; = 8.96, 95% CI 6.17 to 11.82, p &lt;0.0001) were the main factors influencing work percentage post lung transplantation. No evidence for an influence of clinical factors such as CLAD, cancer or dialysis on post-lung transplantation employment and work percentage was found. CONCLUSION: Pre-transplant employment is the dominant factor influencing lung transplantation employment in people with cystic fibrosis.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed pediatric in-patients (< 6 years old) diagnosed with CAP in our hospital. We subdivided patients into four age groups (< 6 months, 6 months-1 year, 1C2 years, and 2C6 years). Their medical records, including demographic information, clinical features, laboratory findings, and chest radiographic reports, were reviewed and collected for further analysis. Univariate logistic regression analysis and stepwise regression analysis were applied to identify risk factors associated with severe CAP and ICU admission for overall patients and age-stratified subgroups. RESULTS: A total of 20,174 cases were initially included. Among them, 3309 (16.40%) cases were identified as severe CAP, and 2824 (14.00%) cases required ICU admission. Potential risk factors for severe CAP and ICU admission identified by univariate analysis included younger age, rural residency, premature birth, low birth weight (LBW), formula feeding, congenital heart disease (CHD), history of pneumonia or neonatal jaundice, patients with other health issues, certain symptoms (manifesting wheezing, dyspnea, cyanosis, but have no cough or fever), abnormal laboratory findings (abnormal levels of white blood cells, albumin, and C-reactive protein and RSV infection), and chest X-ray (odds ratio [OR] > 1 for all). CHD, low albumin, proteinuria, abnormal chest x-ray were independent risks factors across different age groups, whereas birth or feeding history, history of pneumonia, cyanosis or dyspnea on admission, and RSV infection were independent risk factors for only younger kids (< 1 year), and wheezing was an independent risk factor only for older children (2C5 years old). CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors predicting disease severity among children hospitalized with CAP vary with age.

STUDY DESIGN: Double-blind, prospective, randomized clinical trial. Setting: tertiary referral center. INTERVENTION(S): On hundred and twenty-six patients were randomized in 2 groups for cochlear implant surgery. Cases (n: 63) underwent simple mastoidectomy using an anteriorly pedicled osteoplastic flap for mastoid closure. In controls (n: 63), a traditional periosteal flap was used. Evaluation with the POSAS questionnaire was performed 1 year after surgery to assess surgical wound esthetics. Sixteen patients from each group had postoperative CT-scans and wideband tympanometry to assess mastoid aeration and middle ear absorbance. Gender and time after surgery were correlated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Evaluation of the quality of the surgical wound with the application of a questionnaire validated in the medical literature and translated into Portuguese language called POSAS, considering the perception of the blinded patient and doctor regarding the surgical technique proceeded. A lower POSAS score suggests better esthetics of the surgical wound. Secondary outcomes are volumetric measurement of aeration inside mastoid cavity using 3D computer tomography exam, which aims to analyze the influence of fibrocicatricial retraction in the surgical wound into the mastoid and the interference of its aeration volume in the absorption of sound in the middle ear, using the wideband tympanometry exam. RESULTS: The POSAS questionnaire in the Case group showed a lower level of local pain and itchiness, a skin color and thickness more similar to the surrounding skin and less irregularity and stiffness, with no influence from time after surgery and gender compared to the Control group. The median tomographic volume was 6.37 cc in the cases and 4.60 cc in controls. Wideband tympanometry showed general smaller sound absorbance in the Case group results, specially, at 1000 Hz frequency. No intraoperative or postoperative complications were observed with the osteoplastic flap. CONCLUSIONS: This technique is an effective and safe alternative to alleviate common problems of mastoid surgery for cochlear implantation. In addition to esthetic benefits, it has less interference in middle ear physiology of sound absorbance and less fibrous tissue into the mastoid cavity during the follow-up of more than 1 year.

The co-prescription of psychotropics with COVID-19 medication is not uncommon. Healthcare providers should be familiar with many Potential Drug-Drug Interactions (DDIs) between COVID-19 therapeutic agents and psychotropic drugs based on cytochrome P450 metabolism. This review comprehensively summarizes the current literature on DDIs between antiretroviral drugs and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, and psychotropics, including antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, and anxiolytics. Methods: Medical databases, including Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched to identify studies in English with keywords related to psychiatric disorders, medications used in the treatment of psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 medications. Results: There is a great potential for DDIs between psychiatric and COVID-19 medications ranging from interactions that are not clinically apparent (minor) to those that produce lifethreatening adverse drug reactions, or loss of treatment efficacy. The majority of interactions are pharmacokinetic interactions via the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Conclusion: DDIs are a major concern in the comorbidity of psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 infection resulting in the alteration of expected therapeutic outcomes. The risk of toxicity or lack of efficacy may occur due to a higher or lower plasma concentration of medications.

However, nationwide registries of BCCs are very rare and often extrapolation of the data was necessary to estimate the absolute number of diagnoses. Since September 2016, all histopathologically confirmed BCCs are registered in the Netherlands, due to developments in automatic notification and import in the Netherlands cancer registry. This offers the unique possibility to assess the nationwide population-based incidence of first and multiple BCC. OBJECTIVES The current study aims to assess nationwide incidence and trends of first and multiple BCC in the Netherlands and to predict incidence rates up to 2029. METHODS All patients with histopathologically confirmed BCC between 2001 and 2019 were selected from the population-based Netherlands Cancer Registry. Age-standardized incidence rates were calculated and trends were analyzed with use of the estimated annual percentage change. Prediction of BCC incidence rates up to 2029 was based on a regression model. RESULTS In total, 601,806 patients were diagnosed with a first BCC over the period 2001-2019. The age-standardized incidence rates for both men and women with a first BCC increased over these years from 158 to 304 and 124 to 274 per 100,000 person-years, respectively. For male and female patients aged between 30-39 years, decreases in annual incidences of -3.6% and -3.0% were found in recent years, respectively. For patients aged 50 years or older an ever increasing trend was found. A quarter of the patients with a first primary BCC developed one or more subsequent BCCs within three years. Increases in incidence of 30.4% (male) and 25.3% (female) is expected in the next 10 years. CONCLUSIONS BCC incidence doubled over the past decades. Trends seemed to stabilize in recent years for patients aged below 50 years. This might be a first sign of a decreasing trend. The incidence keeps rising in patients aged 50 years and older.

By February 15, 2020 in Wuhan, the total number of confirmed infection cases has reached 37 914, and the number of deaths has reached 1123, accounting for 56.9% of the total confirmed cases and 73.7% of the total deaths in China. People are eager to know when the epidemic will be completely controlled and when people's work and life will be on the right track. METHOD: In this study we analyzed the epidemic dynamics and trend of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan by using the data after the closure of Wuhan city till February 12, 2020 based on the SEIR modeling method. RESULTS: The optimal parameters were estimated as R(0) = 1.44 (interquartile range: 1.40-1.47), TI = 14 (interquartile range = 14-14) and TE = 3.0 (interquartile range = 2.8-3.1). Based on these parameters, the number of infected individuals in Wuhan city may reach the peak around February 19 at about 47 000 people. Once entering March, the epidemic would gradually decline, and end around the late March. It is worth noting that the above prediction is based on the assumption that the number of susceptible population N = 200 000 will not increase. If the epidemic situation is not properly controlled, the peak of infected number can be further increased and the peak time will be a little postponed. It was expected that the epidemic would subside in early March, and disappear gradually towards the late March.

Good leadership image in times of a health emergency is paramount to ensure public confidence in governments abilities to manage the crisis. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify types of image repair strategies utilized by the Malaysian government in their communication about COVID-19 in the media and analyze public responses to these messages on social media. METHODS: Content analysis was employed to analyze 120 media statements and 382 comments retrieved from Facebook pages of 2 mainstream newspapersBerita Harian and The Star. These media statements and comments were collected within a span of 6 weeks prior to and during the first implementation of Movement Control Order by the Malaysian Government. The media statements were analyzed according to Image Repair Theory to categorize strategies employed in government communications related to COVID-19 crisis. Public opinion responses were measured using modified lexicon-based sentiment analysis to categorize positive, negative, and neutral statements. RESULTS: The Malaysian government employed all 5 Image Repair Theory strategies in their communications in both newspapers. The strategy most utilized was reducing offensiveness (75/120, 62.5%), followed by corrective action (30/120, 25.0%), evading responsibilities (10/120, 8.3%), denial (4/120, 3.3%), and mortification (1/120, 0.8%). This study also found multiple substrategies in government media statements including denial, shifting blame, provocation, defeasibility, accident, good intention, bolstering, minimization, differentiation, transcendence, attacking accuser, resolve problem, prevent recurrence, admit wrongdoing, and apologize. This study also found that 64.7% of public opinion was positive in response to media statements made by the Malaysian government and also revealed a significant positive association (P=.04) between image repair strategies utilized by the Malaysian government and public opinion. CONCLUSIONS: Communication in the media may assist the government in fostering positive support from the public.

However, the impact of COVID-19 among patients with pre-existing liver disease remains ill-defined. METHODS: Data for CLD patients with SARS-CoV-2 were collected by two international registries. Comparisons were made with non-CLD patients with SARS-CoV-2 from a UK hospital network. RESULTS: Between 25th March and 8th July 2020, 745 CLD patients were reported from 29 countries including 386 with cirrhosis and 359 without. Mortality was 32% in patients with cirrhosis compared with 8% in those without (p<0.001). Mortality in cirrhosis patients increased according to Child-Turcotte-Pugh class (CTP-A (19%), CTP-B (35%), CTP-C (51%)) and the main cause of death was respiratory failure (71%). After adjusting for baseline characteristics, factors associated with death in the total CLD cohort were age (OR 1.02; 1.01-1.04), CTP-A (OR 1.90; 1.03-3.52), CTP-B (OR 4.14; 2.4-7.65), CTP-C cirrhosis (OR 9.32; 4.80-18.08) and alcohol related liver disease (ALD) (OR 1.79; 1.03-3.13). When comparing CLD versus non-CLD (n=620) in propensity-score-matched analysis there were significant increases in mortality with CTP-B +20.0% (8.8%-31.3%) and CTP-C cirrhosis +38.1% (27.1%-49.2%). Acute hepatic decompensation occurred in 46% of patients with cirrhosis, of which 21% had no respiratory symptoms. 50% of those with hepatic decompensation had acute-on-chronic liver failure. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest reported cohort of CLD and cirrhosis patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection to date. We demonstrate that baseline liver disease stage and ALD are independent risk factor for death from COVID-19.

The patient took the tension band wiring as the first choice because of the wide acceptance. But he worried about the complications. DIAGNOSES X-ray showed a transverse fracture of the left patella with an inferior pole occult fracture. INTERVENTIONS The patient was operated with a modified technique of the classic tension band wiring for patellar fractures. In our 4-step procedure, double tension cerclage wires were wrapped under the exposed ends of the Kirschner wires (K-wires) and the tendons in figure-of-8 fashion. The aim was to increase the biomechanical strength so that when one of the tension wires fail, the other one can hold the fragments together. OUTCOMES The patient recovered very well and without any complications. The patient was followed-up for 1 year and the fracture has united very well, with satisfying knee range of motion. LESSONS From this case study, we can detect the biomechanical advantages of our technique which can increase the stability of the fracture and that allows early functional exercise and additionally the micromotion at the fracture site has a beneficial effect of fracture union. Based on the perfect outcomes, our technique is worthy of clinical application.","output":"Modified tension band wiring of patellar fracture as a technique to minimize postoperative complications: A case report."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social inflation refers to steeply rising insurance rates due to social factors such as large jury awards and broader definitions of liability. This paper is the first to study the risk of social inflation and its economic consequences. Using a novel, hand-matched dataset that spans verdicts, financial statements, and insurance rate filings for commercial auto liability, I find that the number of verdicts and settlements exceeding $50 million has increased almost threefold from 2011 to 2019. To highlight the role of these nuclear awards in insurance pricing, I build a model of social inflation and show that social inflation risk has a double kick effect on insurance price through increased effective marginal cost and heightened required reserves. I then use both a case study and a triple-difference framework to illustrate the causal impact of social inflation risk on insurance rates. Finally, I discuss implications for insurers during the COVID-19 pandemic facing social inflation: the risks of retroactive modification and extended interpretation of existing insurance policies. Ultimately, I uncover an important new source of aggregate risk that affects the stability of the insurance sector and the economic activities that depend on it.","output":"Social Inflation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We examine the risk transmission from the COVID-19 to metal (precious and industrial) and energy markets using the BEKK-MGARCH model.

Because of high mutation and recombination rates, genome replication by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases leads to populations of closely related viruses that are generally referred to as quasispecies. Although standard (short-read) sequencing technologies allow to readily determine consensus sequences for these quasispecies, it is far more difficult to reconstruct large numbers of full-length haplotypes of (i) RNA virus genomes and (ii) subgenome-length (sg) RNAs comprised of noncontiguous genome regions that may be present in these virus populations. Here, we used a full-length, direct RNA sequencing (DRS) approach without any amplification step to characterize viral RNAs produced in cells infected with a human coronavirus representing one of the largest RNA virus genomes known to date. Results Using DRS, we were able to map the longest (~26 kb) contiguous read to the viral reference genome. By combining Illumina and nanopore sequencing, a highly accurate consensus sequence of the human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E genome (27.3 kb) was reconstructed. Furthermore, using long reads that did not require an assembly step, we were able to identify, in infected cells, diverse and novel HCoV-229E sg RNAs that remain to be characterized. Also, the DRS approach, which does not require reverse transcription and amplification of RNA, allowed us to detect methylation sites in viral RNAs. Our work paves the way for haplotype-based analyses of viral quasispecies by demonstrating the feasibility of intra-sample haplotype separation. We also show how supplementary short-read sequencing (Illumina) can be used to reduce the error rate of nanopore sequencing. Conclusions Even though a number of technical challenges remain to be addressed to fully exploit the potential of the nanopore technology, our work illustrates that direct RNA sequencing may significantly advance genomic studies of complex virus populations, including predictions on long-range interactions in individual full-length viral RNA haplotypes.","output":"Nanopore direct RNA sequencing reveals modification in full-length coronavirus genomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The response to the Covid-19 pandemic raises a question about the role of national curriculum frameworks in acquiring and applying knowledge about hygiene and prevention of disease.

We hypothesized there may be common features among the pathogen, environment, and host epidemiological triad that characterize an infectious disease black swan event. Using Los Alamos National Laboratorys tool, Analytics for Investigation of Disease Outbreaks, we investigated historical disease outbreak information and anomalous events for several infectious diseases. By studying 32 different infectious diseases and global outbreaks, we observed that in the past 20C30 years, there have been potential black swan events in the majority of infectious diseases analyzed. Importantly, these potential black swan events cannot be attributed to the first introduction of the disease to a susceptible host population. This paper describes our observations and perspectives and illustrates the value of broad analysis of data across the infectious disease realm, providing insights that may not be possible when we focus on singular infectious agents or diseases.

The main goal was to evaluate the prognostic role of quantitative assessment of the extent of lung damage for early mortality of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in cancer patients. Methods: We prospectively included consecutive cancer patients with recent onset of COVID-19 pneumonia assessed by chest CT between March 15, 2020, and April 20, 2020, and followed until May 1, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory test data and imaging findings were recorded. Quantitative chest CT assessment of COVID-19 pneumonia was based on the density distribution of lung lesions using a freely available software recently released (Myrian XP-Lung). The association between extent of lung damage and overall survival was studied by univariate and multivariate Cox analysis. The Uno C-index was used to assess the discriminatory value of the quantitative CT extent of lung damage. Results: Seventy cancer patients with chest CT evidence of COVID-19 were included. After a median follow-up of 25 days, 17 patients (24%) had died. The median quantitative chest CT extent of COVID-19 was 20% (IQR = 14C35, range = 3C59) for non-survivors vs. 10% (IQR = 6C15, range = 2C55) for survivors (p = 0.002). The extent of COVID-19 pneumonia was correlated with inpatient management (p = 0.003) and oxygen therapy requirements (p < 0.001). Independent factors associated with death were performance status (PS) 2 (HR = 3.9, 95% CI = [1.1C13.8] p = 0.04) and extent of COVID-19 pneumonia 30% (HR = 12.0, 95% CI = [2.2C64.4] p = 0.004).

METHODS: Data from 74,148 COVID\\\\19\\\\positive inpatients with at least one recorded glucose measurement during their inpatient episode were analysed for presence of pre\\\\existing diabetes diagnosis and any glucose values in the hyperglycaemic range (>180 mg/dl). RESULTS: Among patients with and without a pre\\\\existing diabetes diagnosis on admission, mortality was substantially higher in the presence of high glucose measurements versus all measurements in the normal range (70C180 mg/dl) in both groups (non\\\\diabetics: 21.7% vs. 3.3%; diabetics 14.4% vs. 4.3%). When adjusting for patient age, BMI, severity on admission and oxygen saturation on admission, this increased risk of mortality persisted and varied by diabetes diagnosis.

The combination is also used to treat high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes, especially TP53-mutated (TP53mut) cases in which responses to HMA alone are short-lived. In most patients (pts), however, myelosuppression from treatment leads to frequent Ven duration and/or dose-reductions, and/or cycle delays. An approach to decrease HMA-mediated myelosuppression but maintain S-phase dependent DNMT1-targeting, evaluated in a previous clinical trial (https://doi.org/10.1111/bjh.16281), is to administer noncytotoxic doses/concentrations of Dec (0.2 mg/kg;~5 mg/m 2) by a frequent-distributed schedule of 1X/week. An approach to decrease Ven mediated myelosuppression but maintain cooperation with HMA, shown in pre-clinical studies, is to administer a single-dose prior to HMA. Ven can depolarize mitochondrial membranes;mitochondrial membrane-potential is essential to function of the mitochondrial enzyme DHODH that produces cytidine/deoxycytidine that competes with HMA in cells. Thus, Ven prior to HMA dosing temporarily inhibits de novo pyrimidine synthesis, to counter a major mechanism of resistance to HMA in MDS/AML, without suppressing normal myelopoiesis (https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2020-143200). We conducted a retrospective analysis of all pts with TP53mut MDS or AML treated with weekly Ven and low-dose subcutaneous Dec at our institution. We analyzed the characteristics of these pts, response to therapy, and outcomes using standard descriptive statistics. Mutational testing was performed using a commercial next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel. Five pts, 3 male and 2 female, with TP53mut MDS or AML were treated with weekly Ven 400 mg on D1 and subcutaneous Dec 0.2 mg/kg on D2, administered weekly in 28 day cycles. Two pts had MDS (1 de novo, 1 treatment related) and 3 pts had AML (1 de novo, 2 secondary from prior MDS). Four pts (80%) received the treatment in frontline, all with poor performance status (PS), and 1 pt (20%) had R/R disease. Median age at diagnosis was 79 years [41-82]. The only young pt had prolonged severe cytopenias after 1 cycle Dec standard dosing during the peak of COVID-19 pandemic so was switched to this regimen. Of the 4 frontline treated pts, 2 pts had high-risk MDS, and 2 pts had adverse risk AML. The R/R pt had high-risk MDS transformed to AML that was refractory to 2 prior lines of therapy: standard Aza/Ven x5 cycles, then standard Vyxeos. Disease cytogenetics were complex in all pts. 60% (3/5) pts had sole TP53mut on NGS, with median variant allelic frequency (VAF) 48% [28-79]. 80% (4/5) pts were transfusion dependent prior to treatment. Median time to initiating therapy was 7 days from initial or refractory diagnosis [3-59] and median follow-up was 7.8 months (mo) [2.9-11.4]. The overall response rate (ORR) was 100%: 4/4 frontline pts had complete remissions (CR), and the 1 R/R pt achieved morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS). Median time to best response was 2.9 mo. 50% (2/4) pts became transfusion independent. 40% (2/5) pts lost their TP53mut at best response, and another 40% (2/5) pts had significant reductions (83% and 38%) in TP53 mut VAF. The regimen was well tolerated with no pts stopping therapy due to adverse effects (AE). AE included G3/G4 neutropenia (80%), G1 thrombocytopenia (40%), nausea (20%), fatigue (20%), lower extremity edema (20%), pneumonia (60%), and neutropenic fever (20%) with a median of 1 unplanned hospitalization per pt during follow-up. 60% (3/5) pts remain in CR on continued therapy for a median of 7.8 mo [7.2-9.4] thus far. One pt underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation, however, died 11.4 mo after conditioning due to transplant related mortality. The R/R pt died after being lost to follow-up 2.9 mo after therapy initiation. No pt had measurable relapse during follow-up. Combination weekly Ven with subcutaneous low-dose Dec is well tolerated yielding igh rates of clinical and molecular response in pts with TP53mut MDS/AML. Although small, this case-series extends previous clinical trial proof-of-activity of non-cytotoxic DNMT1-targeting to a high-risk, poor PS, historically chemorefractory patient population.

CASE PRESENTATION: Patients who presented to our center between March 2016 and March 2017 with symptoms and signs suggestive of thoracic myelopathy predominantly due to anterior pathologies such as ossification of the thoracic posterior longitudinal ligament, posterior bony spur, and thoracic disc herniation were evaluated in our study. The indications for surgical treatment were progressive neurological impairment and severe myelopathy (grade III or more on Nurick grade). Only those patients classified as grade III and above on American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) physical status scale were included in the study. All the cases were operated by a single surgeon by a posterior-only approach. We have used this technique in four patients with thoracic myelopathy due to combined or predominant anterior pathology. Postoperative imaging confirmed adequate decompression of the spinal cord. All the cases improved substantially in terms of clinical outcome.

Use of antivirals has given inconsistent results; thus systematic summaries of available evidence are required for any recommendations for treatment. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the use of antivirals for Covid-19. Methods: The databases we searched were-Medline, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL and Medrxiv. Title/abstract screening, full-text screening and data abstraction were carried out in duplicate by two researchers. Pooled effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel method of random effects for meta-analysis. Results: Twenty studies were found eligible for inclusion: 6 randomized controlled trials, 9 cohort studies and 5 case series. Moderate-quality evidence suggests a likely clinical benefit from the use of remdesivir in improving the number of recoveries (RR 1.18; 95% CI 1.07-1.31; I2 = 0%) and time to recovery in days (median -3.02; 95% CI -4.98 to -1.07; I2 = 97%). A possibility of lower mortality is suggested by low-quality evidence with remdesivir (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.40-1.37, I2 = 58%). Moderate-quality evidence suggests no certain benefit of using lopinavir/ritonavir for Covid-19 compared to arbidol, lopinavir/ritonavir combined with arbidol or other medications used as controls.

The method includes a treatment with proteinase K followed by heat inactivation (PK+HID method). We demonstrate that PK+HID improves the RT-qPCR performance in comparison to the heat-inactivation procedure. Moreover, we show that this extraction-free protocol can be combined with a variety of multiplexing RT-qPCR kits. The method combined with a multiplexing detection kit targeting N and ORF1ab viral genes showed a sensitivity of 0.99 and a specificity of 0.99 from the analysis of 106 positive and 106 negative clinical samples. In conclusion, PK+HID is a robust, fast and inexpensive procedure for extraction-free RT-qPCR determinations of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Extraction-free protocol combining Proteinase K and heat inactivation for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe rapid, label-free detection of Influenza A viruses using the first radial mode of oscillations of lead zirconate titanate (PZT) piezoelectric discs with a 2 mm radius and 100 m thickness fabricated from a piezoelectric membrane.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was shown to affect many organs and organ systems including the thyroid gland as these parts highly express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein, which functions as a receptor for initially entering the virus into the cells. Furthermore, some categories of the population including older people and persons with comorbidities are prone to be more vulnerable to COVID-19 and its complications. Recent reports showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection could cause Graves' disease (autoimmune hyperthyroidism) in post-COVID-19 patients. Factors that may boost the mortality risk of COVID-19 patients are not completely known yet and a clear perception of the group of vulnerable people is also essential. This review briefly summarizes the features of Graves' disease such as symptoms, risk factors, including environmental, genetic, immunological, and other factors, associated disorders, and therapeutic options. It comprehensively describes the recent advances in SARS-CoV-2-induced Graves' disease and the pivotal role of autoimmune factors in inducing the disease. The review also discusses the possible risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated COVID-19 in people with hyperthyroidism. Furthermore, it explains thyroid disease and its association with the severity of COVID-19.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 plays a pivotal role in inducing hyperthyroidism of Graves' disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the epidemiological features of the patients admitted to our emergency department (ED) during the COVID-19 pandemic in March, April, and May 2020, compare them with the patients in March, April, and May 2019, and to investigate the effect of various quarantine models. MATERIAL/METHODS: The records of 1206 eligible patients were reviewed. Age groups were divided according to their quarantine status. We recorded the reasons for patient presentation to the ED, the average number of patients in age groups according to quarantine days, and the problems reported by patients who presented to the ED according to quarantine days. RESULTS: We enrolled 3016 of 3123 patients. The mean age was 36.417.3 years in 2019 and 37.816.4 years during the pandemic period (P=0.031). While 73.1% of the ED presentations were due to ocular trauma in 2019, it decreased to 70.7% in 2020. The proportion of those who presented to the ED during the weekend was 30.6% in 2019, but decreased to 23.9% in 2020 (<0.001). While 84.8% of trauma patients were ages 19C64 years in 2019, this rate increased to 88.9% during the pandemic (P=0.067). Non-trauma emergencies were more common than trauma emergencies in both periods in those over the age of 65 years. During the pandemic period, admissions to the ED were decreased in the quarantined age groups (P=0.001).

METHODS: Volumetric airflow were measured to assess air change rate per hour by ventilation (ACHvent). Equivalent ventilation provided by the PAC (ACHpac) was calculated based on its clean air delivery rate. Concentrations of 0.3, 0.5 and 1.0 m aerosol particles were measured in 10 dental treatment rooms with various ventilation rates at baseline, after 5-min of incense burn, and after 30-min of observation with and without the PAC or ventilation system in operation. Velocities of aerosol removal were assessed by concentration decay constants for the 0.3 m particles with ventilation alone (Kn) and with ventilation and PAC (Kn+pac), and by times needed to reach 95 % and 100 % removal of accumulated aerosol particles. RESULTS: ACHvent varied from 3 to 45. Kn and Kn+pac were correlated with ACHvent (r = 0.90) and combined ACHtotal (r = 0.81), respectively. Accumulated aerosol particles could not be removed by ventilation alone within 30-min in rooms with ACHvent<15. PAC reduced aerosol accumulation and accelerated aerosol removal, and accumulated aerosols could be completely removed in 4 to 12-min by ventilation combined with PAC. Effectiveness of the PAC was especially prominent in rooms with poor ventilation. Added benefit of PAC in aerosol removal was inversely correlated with ACHvent. CONCLUSIONS: Aerosol accumulation may occur in dental treatment rooms with poor ventilation. Addition of PAC with a HEPA filter significantly reduced aerosol accumulation and accelerated aerosol removal.

Ceteris paribus, FDEs decreased by 1.3% when government expenditure on FDEs increased by 1%. (ii) By strengthening food safety standards and guiding enterprises to offer safer food, government can further improve FDEs. (iii) However, GI has a strong negative externality. Although GI alleviates FDEs in local areas, it aggravates FDEs in other areas. (iv) Compared with the eastern and coastal areas, the effects of GI on FDEs in the central, western, and inland areas are more significant. GI is conducive to ensuring Chinese health and equity. Policymakers should pay attention to two tasks in food safety regulation. Firstly, they should continue to strengthen GI in food safety issues, enhance food safety certification, and strive to ensure food safety.

We find that Native nations have more COVID-19 cases if they are located in states with a higher ratio of Trump supporters and reside in states with Republican governors. Where there is longstanding marginalization, measured by lack of clean water on tribal lands and health information in Native languages, we find more COVID-19 cases. Federal law enables non-members to flout tribal health regulations while on tribal lands, and correspondingly, we find that COVID-19 cases rise when non-members travel onto tribal lands.

We studied the characteristics and outcome of children with non-SARS HCoV acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI). Methods: This was a cross-sectional study from a tertiary care teaching hospital in eastern India. Results: Of 137 samples tested positive for respiratory viruses, 13 were due to HCoV (7 boys, median age: 2 years). Cough was the most common symptom, followed by breathing difficulty and fever. An underlying comorbid condition present in 38.4%. Co-infection with other viruses was seen in 69% of cases. Chest radiograph was abnormal in 69.3% of children. Antibiotics were administered in 53.8%. The median length of hospitalization was 5 d, irrespective of underlying disease. There was no mortality. Conclusions: HCoV is an uncommon but increasingly recognized cause of ALRI in hospitalized children. No severe illness was found in children with underlying comorbidities.

Interventions for chronic venous ulcers have evolved to painless, minimally invasive, office-based procedures performed under local anesthesia. Recent advances in the endovascular management of lower-extremity superficial venous insufficiency have the potential to significantly enhance initial and long-term management of these patients, as minimally invasive procedures provide faster recoveries and fewer procedural risks. Early intervention for venous insufficiency has been shown to significantly decrease long-term ulcer recurrence rates, and may increase healing of venous ulcers as well. PURPOSE The purpose of this review and algorithm is to enhance understanding of venous ulceration and its underlying causes. Venous anatomy and pathophysiology will be reviewed. The etiology of chronic venous ulceration will be examined. Current practice guidelines and clinical outcomes will be reviewed. The newest treatment options, including minimally invasive therapy will be described. The current literature will be reviewed. A new algorithm for treatment that integrates the endovascular treatment of venous insufficiency into the current standard care for venous leg ulceration will be proposed. METHOD A literature review was performed to review all current treatments for venous ulceration. Treatments that have Level I evidence (with a grade of recommendation of A or B) to support their use for venous leg ulceration were selected for incorporation into a new treatment algorithm. The level-of-evidence and strength-of-recommendation scheme used in the algorithm is based upon the system used by the Wound Healing Society in its chronic wounds clinical practice guidelines. CONCLUSION It is intended that this new algorithm and approach to treatment will improve the immediate care of venous leg ulcer patients, reduce recurrence rates, increase patient satisfaction, and potentially expedite initial wound healing in the outpatient wound clinic setting.","output":"Emerging treatment options for venous ulceration in today's wound care practice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite being nearly 10 months into the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, the definitive animal host for SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), the causal agent of COVID-19, remains unknown. Unfortunately, similar problems exist for other betacoronaviruses, and no vouchered specimens exist to corroborate host species identification for most of these pathogens. This most basic information is critical to the full understanding and mitigation of emerging zoonotic diseases. To overcome this hurdle, we recommend that host-pathogen researchers adopt vouchering practices and collaborate with natural history collections to permanently archive microbiological samples and host specimens. Vouchered specimens and associated samples provide both repeatability and extension to host-pathogen studies, and using them mobilizes a large workforce (i.e., biodiversity scientists) to assist in pandemic preparedness. We review several well-known examples that successfully integrate host-pathogen research with natural history collections (e.g., yellow fever, hantaviruses, helminths). However, vouchering remains an underutilized practice in such studies. Using an online survey, we assessed vouchering practices used by microbiologists (e.g., bacteriologists, parasitologists, virologists) in host-pathogen research. A much greater number of respondents permanently archive microbiological samples than archive host specimens, and less than half of respondents voucher host specimens from which microbiological samples were lethally collected. To foster collaborations between microbiologists and natural history collections, we provide recommendations for integrating vouchering techniques and archiving of microbiological samples into host-pathogen studies. This integrative approach exemplifies the premise underlying One Health initiatives, providing critical infrastructure for addressing related issues ranging from public health to global climate change and the biodiversity crisis.","output":"Preserve a Voucher Specimen!

The S glycoprotein is the major target for neutralizing antibodies elicited by natural infection and by vaccines. Approximately 35% of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein consists of carbohydrate, which can influence virus infectivity and susceptibility to antibody inhibition. We found that virus-like particles produced by coexpression of SARS-CoV-2 S, M, E, and N proteins contained spike glycoproteins that were extensively modified by complex carbohydrates. We used a fucose-selective lectin to purify the Golgi-modified fraction of a wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein trimer and determined its glycosylation and disulfide bond profile. Compared with soluble or solubilized S glycoproteins modified to prevent proteolytic cleavage and to retain a prefusion conformation, more of the wild-type S glycoprotein N-linked glycans are processed to complex forms. Even Asn 234, a significant percentage of which is decorated by high-mannose glycans on other characterized S trimer preparations, is predominantly modified in the Golgi compartment by processed glycans. Three incompletely occupied sites of O-linked glycosylation were detected. Viruses pseudotyped with natural variants of the serine/threonine residues implicated in O-linked glycosylation were generally infectious and exhibited sensitivity to neutralization by soluble ACE2 and convalescent antisera comparable to that of the wild-type virus. Unlike other natural cysteine variants, a Cys15Phe (C15F) mutant retained partial, but unstable, infectivity. These findings enhance our understanding of the Golgi processing of the native SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein carbohydrates and could assist the design of interventions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-one children presenting with AAP/suspected AAP were evaluated. Of these, 24 (29.6%) were included in the MIS-C group (MIS-C/g) and 57 were included in the suspected appendicitis group (S-A/g), which consisted of two subgroups: appendicitis group (A/g) and control observation group (CO/g). RESULTS: Comparing MIS-C/g, A/g, and CO/g, duration of abdominal pain (2.4, 1.5, 1.8 days), high-grade fever (38.8, 36.7, 37C), severe vomiting, and severe diarrhea were higher in MIS-C/g. Lymphocytes count (LC) was lower, while values of C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, and coagulopathy were higher in MIS-C/g (p < 0.05). The optimal cutoffs for the duration of abdominal pain was 2.5 days; the duration of fever, 1.5 days; peak value of fever, 39C; neutrophil count, 13,225  1,000 cell/MoL; LC, 600  1,000 cell/MoL; ferritin, 233 g/L; and D-dimer, 16.4 mg/L (p < 0.05).

Now, the spread of this virus is such that mortality has risen strongly in all cities of countries. Therefore, it is necessary to think of a solution to handle the disease by fast and timely diagnosis. This paper proposes a method that uses chest X-ray imagery to divide 2-4 classes into 7 different Scenarios, including Bacterial, Viral, Healthy, and COVID-19 classes. The aim of this study is to propose a method that uses chest X-ray imagery to divide 2-4 classes into 7 different Scenarios, including Bacterial, Viral, Healthy, and COVID-19 classes. METHODS: 6 different databases from chest X-ray imagery that have been widely used in recent studies have been gathered for this aim. A Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short Time Memory model is designed and developed to extract features from raw data hierarchically. In order to make more realistic assumptions and use the Proposed Method in the practical field, white Gaussian noise is added to the raw chest X-ray imagery. Additionally, the proposed network is tested and investigated not only on 6 expressed databases but also on two additional databases. RESULTS: On the test set, the proposed network achieved an accuracy of more than 90% for all Scenarios excluding Scenario V, i.e. Healthy against the COVID-19 against the Viral, and also achieved 99% accuracy for separating the COVID-19 from the Healthy group. The results showed that the proposed network is robust to noise up to 1 dB. It is worth noting that the proposed network for two additional databases, which were only used as test databases, also achieved more than 90% accuracy. In addition, in comparison to the state-of-the-art pneumonia detection approaches, the final results obtained from the proposed network is so promising. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed network is effective in detecting COVID-19 and other lung infectious diseases using chest X-ray imagery and can thus assist radiologists in making rapid and accurate detections.","output":"COVID-19 detection using chest X-ray images based on a developed deep neural network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Lobectomies done by video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) result in fewer complications and less pain and save total costs compared with the traditional approach. However, the majority of procedures are still performed via open thoracotomies, because VATS lobectomy is considered difficult to learn, requiring experience in open surgery, and causing complications in the initial phase of the learning curve. The aim of this study was to describe a training model appreciating patient safety during training and to explore the initial learning curve for a trainee rather inexperienced in open surgery. METHODS A trainee who had performed 14 lobectomies by thoracotomy was enrolled in a training programme at a high-volume VATS centre. The training model included courses and simulations followed by the selection of suitable patients operated on during close expert supervision. Data regarding time, a variety of quality indicators and complications were collected prospectively and compared with experts' performance. RESULTS Over 12 months, 29 of 214 VATS lobectomies were performed by the trainee. Twice, the supervisor had to finish the procedure due to technical difficulties. None of the operations were converted to open thoracotomy. Compared with experts, the trainee operated significantly slower [median 120 (range 74-160) vs 100 (range 42-255) min, P = 0.04]; had similar perioperative bleeding [median 100 (range 10-500) vs 50 (range 5-2500) ml, P = 0.79]; had earlier chest tube removal [median 1 (range 1-6) vs 2 (range 1-32) postoperative days, P < 0.001]; and reduced hospital stay [median 3 (range 1-10) vs 4 (range 1-41) days, P < 0.001].

Although a KCN-induced increase was recorded in the activity of -cyanoalanine synthase (-CAS) in rice tissues of both NH4+-fed and NO3--fed seedlings, the former showed a significantly greater assimilation rate for CN- than the latter. The addition of KCN decreased NO3- uptake and assimilation, whereas a negligible impact was observed in NH4+ treatments. Enzymatic assays showed a marked activities enhancement of glutamine synthetase (GS), glutamate synthase (GOGAT), and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) in NH4+-fed seedlings after KCN exposure. Similarly, the rises occurring in nitrate reductase (NR) and GDH activity in NO3--fed seedlings were also detected after 2-d exposure to KCN, whereas a significant reduction of GS and GOGAT activities was determined. The results suggest that although exogenous KCN at moderate or high concentrations caused repressively effects on biomass growth of both NH4+-fed and NO3--fed rice seedlings, the nontoxic concentration of KCN supplied can serve as a supplemental N source in plant nutrition and N metabolism.","output":"Assimilation of exogenous cyanide cross talk in Oryza sativa L. to the key nodes in nitrogen metabolism."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the recent US Food and Drug Administration approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, the United States has begun COVID-19 vaccine dissemination.

Methods This study evaluated freely accessible data, available online, and, therefore, did not require institutional review board approval. We assessed the numbers of radiological PhD candidates at Hanoi Medical University and the numbers of published Vietnamese radiological papers, from 2012 to 2019, indexed in the SCImago database. In addition, we evaluated the numbers of qualified radiological professors and associate professors employed at universities during the same period. We did not include nuclear medicine PhD and professorship candidates, in this study. The data are presented as bar and line charts. Results Following the enactment of 08/2017/TT-BGD?T and 37/2018/Q?-TTg, we observed that the numbers of radiological PhD and professorship candidates were significantly reduced. From 2012 to 2019, only one candidate qualified for appointment as a radiological professor. However, the number of radiological papers rose dramatically during the same time period. Conclusion The enactment of 08/2017/TT-BGD?T and 37/2018/Q?-TTg had strong impacts on the numbers of PhD and professorship candidates.

For those suffering from social anxiety, social distancing coincides with a tendency to avoid social interactions. We used this natural experiment imposed by a COVID-19 lockdown to examine how mandated low social exposure influenced socially anxious university students, and compared their anxiety to that of socially anxious students in preceding academic years with no social distancing. Methods: Ninety-nine socially anxious students were assessed for social anxiety symptoms at the beginning of the fall and spring semesters. Students from the 2019-2020 academic year (which included a lockdown followed by social distancing measures at the end of the fall semester) were compared to students from preceding years (2016-2019) on social anxiety levels. Results: Whereas social anxiety decreased in socially anxious students from the fall to the spring semester in the years preceding the pandemic, during the 2019-2020 academic year social anxiety levels remained high and unchanged. These results held when controlling for depressive symptoms and when analyzing social anxiety items that cannot be confounded with COVID-19-related anxiety.

METHODS: HPV testing was performed on women aged 16C109 years (mean age 44.03  9.25 years) from Shannan City in 2019 and 2020, which was implemented technically by gynecological examination, vaginal discharge smear microscopy, cytology, and HPV detection. The overall prevalence, age-specific prevalence, and genotype distribution were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 48,126 women received HPV testing, of which 3929 were detected human papillomavirus. The HPV-positive rate was 8.16% (3929/48,126), and the highest prevalence was in the  25-year-old age group (12.68%). After the age of 25, the prevalence rate decreased rapidly, and then slowly increased from 7.49% in the 46C55 age group to 9.82% in the  66 age group, showing a U-shaped pattern.

Tumor identification with fluorescence imaging could improve positive margin rates through demarcating location, size, and invasiveness of tumors. We investigated the technique's diagnostic accuracy in detecting tumors during BCS using intravenous indocyanine green (ICG) and a custom-built fluorescence camera system. METHODS In this single-center prospective clinical study, 40 recruited BCS patients were sub-categorized into two cohorts. In the first 'enhanced permeability and retention' (EPR) cohort, 0.25 mg/kg ICG was injected ~ 25 min prior to tumor excision, and in the second 'angiography' cohort, ~ 5 min prior to tumor excision. Subsequently, an in-house imaging system was used to image the tumor in situ prior to resection, ex vivo following resection, the resection bed, and during grossing in the histopathology laboratory to compare the technique's diagnostic accuracy between the cohorts. RESULTS The two cohorts were matched in patient and tumor characteristics. The majority of patients had invasive ductal carcinoma with concomitant ductal carcinoma in situ. Tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) in the angiography cohort was superior to the EPR cohort (TBR = 3.18  1.74 vs 2.10  0.92 respectively, p = 0.023). Tumor detection reached sensitivity and specificity scores of 0.82 and 0.93 for the angiography cohort and 0.66 and 0.90 for the EPR cohort, respectively (p = 0.1051 and p = 0.9099).

Therefore, it will be important to test the cross-reactivity of antibodies that have been previously generated against the surface spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV in order to aid research on the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show that an immunogenic domain in the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV S is highly conserved in multiple strains of SARS-CoV-2. Consistently, four murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against this immunogenic SARS-CoV fragment were able to recognise the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 expressed in a mammalian cell line. Importantly, one of them (mAb 1A9) was demonstrated to detect S in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing that mAbs targeting the S2 domain of SARS-CoV can cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 and this observation is consistent with the high sequence conservation in the S2 subunit.

While NTD mutations appear at first glance very diverse, they converge on the structure of the supersite. The mutations within the RBD, on the other hand, hone in on only a small number of key sites (K417, L452, E484, N501) that are allosteric control points enabling spike to escape neutralising antibodies while maintaining or even gaining Ace2-binding activity.

METHODS: COVID-19 cases, ICU admissions and mortality rate were correlated with severity of air pollution in the Italian regions. RESULTS: The highest number of COVID-19 cases were recorded in the most polluted regions with patients presenting with more severe forms of the disease requiring ICU admission. In these regions, mortality was two-fold higher than the other regions. CONCLUSIONS: From the data available we propose a double-hit hypothesis: chronic exposure to PM 2.5 causes alveolar ACE-2 receptor overexpression. This may increase viral load in patients exposed to pollutants in turn depleting ACE-2 receptors and impairing host defences. High atmospheric NO2 may provide a second hit causing a severe form of SARS-CoV-19 in ACE-2 depleted lungs resulting in a worse outcome.","output":"Severe air pollution links to higher mortality in COVID-19 patients: the double-hit hypothesis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Critically ill patients with COVID-19 are prone to develop severe acute kidney injury (AKI), defined as KDIGO (Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes) stages 2 or 3.

Methods: A retrospective monocenter study including adult patients with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure. The primary outcome was to identify the incidence and risk factors associated with severe AKI (KDIGO stages 2 or 3). Results: Overall, 110 COVID-19 patients were admitted. Among them, 77 (70%) required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), 66 (60%) received vasopressor support, and 9 (8.2%) needed extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Severe AKI occurred in 50 patients (45.4%). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, severe AKI was independently associated with age (odds ratio (OR) = 1.08 (95% CI (confidence interval): 1.03C1.14), p = 0.003), IMV (OR = 33.44 (95% CI: 2.20C507.77), p = 0.011), creatinine level on admission (OR = 1.04 (95% CI: 1.008C1.065), p = 0.012), and ECMO (OR = 11.42 (95% CI: 1.95C66.70), p = 0.007). Inflammatory (interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, and ferritin) or thrombotic (D-dimer and fibrinogen) markers were not associated with severe AKI after adjustment for potential confounders. Severe AKI was independently associated with hospital mortality (OR = 29.73 (95% CI: 4.10C215.77), p = 0.001) and longer hospital length of stay (subhazard ratio = 0.26 (95% CI: 0.14C0.51), p < 0.001).

Two distinct classes of host proteases have been implicated in the S protein activation step: cell-surface serine proteases, such as the cell-surface transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), and endosomal cathepsins, leading to entry through either the cell-surface route or the endosomal route, respectively. In cells expressing TMPRSS2, inhibiting endosomal proteases using non-specific cathepsin inhibitors such as E64d or lysosomotropic compounds such as hydroxychloroquine fails to prevent viral entry, suggesting that the endosomal route of entry is unimportant; however, mechanism-based toxicities and poor efficacy of these compounds confound our understanding of the importance of the endosomal route of entry. Here, to identify better pharmacological agents to elucidate the role of the endosomal route of entry, we profiled a panel of molecules identified through a high throughput screen that inhibit endosomal pH and/or maturation through different mechanisms. Among the three distinct classes of inhibitors, we found that inhibiting vacuolar-ATPase using the macrolide bafilomycin A1 was the only agent able to potently block viral entry without associated cellular toxicity. Using both pseudotyped and authentic virus, we showed that bafilomycin A1 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection both in the absence and presence of TMPRSS2. Moreover, synergy was observed upon combining bafilomycin A1 with Camostat, a TMPRSS2 inhibitor, in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 entry into TMPRSS2-expressing cells.

Soon after, it was declared as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. SARS-CoV-2 mainly infects the respiratory tract with different outcomes ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe critical illness leading to death. Different SARS-CoV-2 variants are emerging of which three have raised concerns worldwide due to their high transmissibility among populations. Objective: To study the prevalence of COVID-19 in the region of Nabatieh-South Lebanon during the past year and assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 variants and their effect on the spread of infection during times of lockdown. Methods: In our study, 37,474 nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected and analyzed for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus in suspected patients attending a tertiary health care center in South Lebanon during the period between 16 March 2020 and 21 February 2021. Results: The results demonstrated a variation in the prevalence rates ranging from less than 1% during full lockdown of the country to 8.4% upon easing lockdown restrictions and reaching 27.5% after the holidays and 2021 New Year celebrations. Interestingly, a new variant(s) appeared starting January 2021 with a significant positive association between the prevalence of positive tests and the percentage of the variant(s). Conclusions: Our results indicate that the lockdown implemented by the Lebanese officials was an effective intervention to contain COVID-19 spread. Our study also showed that lifting lockdown measures during the holidays, which allowed indoor crowded gatherings to occur, caused a surge in COVID-19 cases and rise in the mortality rates nationwide.

A retrospective cohort study was performed on intensive care COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Co-incubation of clarithromycin with spike protein-stimulated healthy volunteer PBMCs ex vivo resulted in an increase in CD8(+) (p = 0.004) and CD4(+) (p = 0.007) IL-2, with a decrease in CD8(+) (p = 0.032) and CD4(+) (p = 0.007) IL-10.

How much kidney disease education Latinx immigrants receive and how to improve kidney disease education and outreach among Latinx populations are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To understand the kidney disease educational gaps of Latinx individuals who need but lack access to scheduled outpatient dialysis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This qualitative study used semistructured interviews in a Texas hospital system from March 2020 to January 2021 with 15 individuals who received emergency-only dialysis when they were first diagnosed with kidney failure. Demographic information was collected, and a thematic analysis was performed using the constant comparative method on interviews after they were audio-recorded, translated, and transcribed verbatim. Data analysis was performed from April 2020 to February 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Subthemes and themes from semistructured interviews. RESULTS: All 15 persons interviewed (9 male individuals [60%]; mean [SD] age, 51 [17] years) identified as Hispanic, 11 (73%) were born in Mexico, and none reported knowing about their kidney disease more than 6 months before starting dialysis. The themes identified were (1) lack of kidney disease awareness, (2) education provided was incomplete and poor quality, (3) lack of culturally concordant communication and care, (4) elements that Latinx patients receiving emergency-only dialysis want in their education, (5) facilitators of patient activation and coping, and (6) Latinx patient recommendations to improve community outreach. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Latinx adults receiving emergency-only dialysis are usually unaware of their kidney disease until shortly before or after they start dialysis, and the education they receive is poor quality and often not culturally tailored.

We assessed the role of viral infections and nasopharyngeal bacterial carriage in ARTIs in E?epa Amerindians from Venezuela. Methods In 40 children aged 0C10 years with ARTIs, healthy nearest-age sibling controls and their mothers the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae/psittachi and 15 respiratory viruses was investigated. Results S. pneumoniae was the most frequently detected pathogen, with carriage rates of 75% and 38% in children and mothers respectively. In children, S. pneumoniae carriage was associated with ARTI risk in multivariate analysis (OR 14.1, 95% CI 1.4C137.7). Viral infections were not associated with ARTI risk. S. pneumoniae carriage was common in children of all ages while viral co-infections were more frequently present in children under 4 years compared to older children (46% vs. 17%, p < 0.01). An increase of one unit height-for-age Z score (i.e. improved chronic nutritional status) was associated with decreased odds of S. pneumoniae colonization in multivariate analysis (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.44C0.99).

Following the speed with which COVID-19 spread to all parts of the world, and to contain the spread of the disease, most governments around the world, including the US, authorized unprecedented social containment measures to stem the tide. These measures among others required social distancing and the temporary physical closure of educational institutions. The Georgia State University School of Public Health, like all other institutions of higher learning, had to create distance-learning opportunities to enable students to complete the 2019C2020 academic year. The unplanned, rapid, and uncertain duration of the approach presented challenges at all academic levels. Not much information on best practices was available to guide such abrupt transitions to college education. The purpose of the study was to collect data on how the transition to distance learning impacted undergraduate and graduate students taking courses in public health at GSU.

AIM: To explore sources of influence (family health, media consumption, and loss of work hours) on COVID-19 protection motivation. METHOD: An online quantitative survey of U.S. adults (N = 501) aged 18 years or older was administered using Qualtrics with participants recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Data were collected on constructs related to the protection motivation theory and theory of planned behavior as well as sources of influence and intention to socially distance and socially isolate during COVID-19. Constructs were further defined through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Structural equation modeling was used to determine relationships between constructs. RESULTS: A two-factor model was identified with threat appraisal as one factor and subjective norms appraisal, coping appraisal, and behavioral intention loading as another factor. Higher news media consumption and loss of work hours due to COVID-19 were both significant predictors of increased threat appraisal. Family healthy lifestyle and family health resources were significantly related to increases in the subjective norms, coping appraisal, and behavioral intention appraisal factor.

A master protocol governs the addition of new interventions as they become available, as well as the inclusion and cessation of existing intervention arms via frequent interim analyses. The first three interventions are hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and doxycycline. Eligible participants must be symptomatic in the community with possible or confirmed COVID-19 that started in the preceding 14 days and either (1) aged 65 years and over or (2) aged 50C64 years with comorbidities. Recruitment is through general practice, health service helplines, COVID-19 hot hubs and directly through the trial website. Participants are randomised to receive either usual care or a study drug plus usual care, and outcomes are collected via daily online symptom diary for 28 days from randomisation. The research team contacts participants and/or their study partner following days 7, 14 and 28 if the online diary is not completed. The trial has two coprimary endpoints: time to first self-report of feeling recovered from possible COVID-19 and hospital admission or death from possible COVID-19 infection, both within 28 days from randomisation.

The aim of the current study was to investigate the role of anxiety sensitivity during COVID-19 outbreak period, especially physical and cognitive concerns, in relation to attentional control and anxiety. Methods: It is a questionnaire study. A total of 464 participants were recruited through online sampling between February and March, 2020. They were surveyed by the Attentional Control Scale (ATTC), Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 (ASI-3) and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and correlation analysis. We also tested the mediating effect. Results: The results showed that attentional control is negatively correlated with physical concern, cognitive concern and anxiety. And results support that physical and cognitive concerns play a mediating role between attentional control and anxiety. Conclusions: Anxiety sensitivity plays a mediating role between attentional control and anxiety.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of PM on intraoperative blood loss, morbidity, and posthepatectomy hemorrhage (PHH). A series of 209 consecutive patients underwent extended hepatectomy (EH) (5 segment resection). The association of PM with perioperative outcomes was evaluated using multivariate analysis with a propensity score method to control for confounding. Fifty patients underwent PM with a median duration of 19 minutes. Multivariate analysis revealed that risk of excessive intraoperative bleeding (1500 ml; odds ratio [OR] 0.27, 95%-confidence interval [CI] 0.10-0.70, p = 0.007), major morbidity (OR 0.41, 95%-CI 0.18-0.97, p = 0.041), and PHH (OR 0.22, 95%-CI 0.06-0.79, p = 0.021) were significantly lower in PM group after EH. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in 3-year recurrence-free-survival between groups. PM is associated with lower intraoperative bleeding, PHH, and major morbidity risk after EH.

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are known to have an altered immune milieu which may be associated with a delay in viral clearance. Here, a cross-sectional observational study of 138 patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection at two large regional hospitals in Scotland, UK examined the median time to two consecutive negative nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 in an inpatient population. The median time from admission to the first of two consecutive negative nasopharyngeal swabs was 18 days (range = 1-44) in patients with CKD, compared with 11 days (range: 1-71) in patients without CKD (P = .0007). Multivariable linear regression analysis using explanatory variables of age, sex, SARS-CoV-2 disease severity, key comorbidities and renal function showed that declining estimated glomerular filtration rate was independently associated with prolonged time to viral clearance. Our data suggest that patients with CKD who are admitted to hospital with SARS-CoV-2 take longer to achieve sequential negative nasopharyngeal swab reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction results than those without CKD.

Our work takes the form of a population-based study in the principality of Liechtenstein, including 125 cases with clinically well-described and laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 1159 individuals without evidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 cases were tested for antibodies in sera taken with a median of 48 days (interquartile range, IQR, 43C52) and 139 days (IQR, 129C144) after symptom onset. Sera were also tested with other assays targeting antibodies against non-RBD-S1 and -S1/S2 epitopes. Sensitivity was 97.6% (95% confidence interval, CI, 93.2C99.1), whereas specificity was 99.8% (95% CI, 99.4C99.9). Antibody levels linearly decreased from hospitalized patients to symptomatic outpatients and SARS-CoV-2 infection without symptoms (p < 0.001). Among cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection, smokers had lower antibody levels than non-smokers (p = 0.04), and patients with fever had higher antibody levels than patients without fever (p = 0.001). Pan-SARS-CoV-2 S1-RBD Ig in SARS-CoV-2 infection cases significantly increased from first to second follow-up (p < 0.001).

The Papain-like protease (PLpro), which is essential for viral replication, shares a similar active site structural architecture to other cysteine proteases. Here, we have used representatives of the Ovarian Tumor Domain deubiquitinase family OTUB1 and OTUB2 along with the PLpro of SARS-CoV-2 to validate and rationalize the binding of inhibitors from previous SARS-CoV candidate compounds. By forming a new chemical bond with the cysteine residue of the catalytic triad, covalent inhibitors irreversibly suppress the protein's activity. Modeling covalent inhibitor binding requires detailed knowledge about the compounds' reactivities and binding. Molecular Dynamics refinement simulations of top poses reveal detailed ligand-protein interactions and show their stability over time. The recently discovered selective OTUB2 covalent inhibitors were used to establish and validate the computational protocol. Structural parameters and ligand dynamics are in excellent agreement with the ligand-bound OTUB2 crystal structures. For SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, recent covalent peptidomimetic inhibitors were simulated and reveal that the ligand-protein interaction is very dynamic. The covalent and non-covalent docking plus subsequent MD refinement of known SARS-CoV inhibitors into DUBs and the SARS-CoV-2 PLpro point out a possible approach to target the PLpro cysteine protease from SARS-CoV-2. The results show that such an approach gives insight into ligand-protein interactions, their dynamic character, and indicates a path for selective ligand design.","output":"Binding of SARS-CoV Covalent Non-Covalent Inhibitors to the SARS-CoV-2 Papain-Like Protease and Ovarian Tumor Domain Deubiquitinases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Monoclonal antibodies requiring higher doses for exerting therapeutic effect but having lower stability, are administered as dilute infusions, or as two (low concentration) injections both resulting in reduced patient compliance.

OBJECTIVE: Big data from social media such as geotagged tweets have been widely used in human mobility studies, yet more research is needed to validate the capabilities and limitations of using such data for studying human movement at different geographic scales (eg, from local to global) in the context of global infectious disease transmission. This study aims to develop a novel data-driven public health approach using big data from Twitter coupled with other human mobility data sources and artificial intelligence to monitor and analyze human movement at different spatial scales (from global to regional to local). METHODS: We will first develop a database with optimized spatiotemporal indexing to store and manage the multisource data sets collected in this project. This database will be connected to our in-house Hadoop computing cluster for efficient big data computing and analytics. We will then develop innovative data models, predictive models, and computing algorithms to effectively extract and analyze human movement patterns using geotagged big data from Twitter and other human mobility data sources, with the goal of enhancing situational awareness and risk prediction in public health emergency response and disease surveillance systems. RESULTS: This project was funded as of May 2020. We have started the data collection, processing, and analysis for the project. CONCLUSIONS: Research findings can help government officials, public health managers, emergency responders, and researchers answer critical questions during the pandemic regarding the current and future infectious risk of a state, county, or community and the effectiveness of social/physical distancing practices in curtailing the spread of the virus.

COVID-19-associated neutrophilia, increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, aberrant neutrophil activation, and infiltration of neutrophils into lungs suggest that neutrophils are important players in the disease immunopathology. The main objective of this study was to assess the phenotypic and functional characteristics of neutrophils in COVID-19 patients, with particular focus on the interaction between neutrophils and T cells. We hypothesize that the altered functional characteristics of COVID-19 patient-derived neutrophils result in skewed Th1/Th17 adaptive immune response, thus contributing to disease pathology. The expansion of G-MDSC and immature forms of neutrophils was shown in the COVID-19 patients. In the COVID-19 neutrophil/T cell cocultures, neutrophils caused a strong polarity shift toward Th17, and, conversely, a reduction of IFN?3-producing Th1 cells. The Th17 promotion was NOS dependent. Neutrophils, the known modulators of adaptive immunity, skew the polarization of T cells toward the Th17 promotion and Th1 suppression in COVID-19 patients, contributing to the discoordinated orchestration of immune response against SARS-CoV-2. As IL-17 and other Th17-related cytokines have previously been shown to correlate with the disease severity, we suggest that targeting neutrophils and/or Th17 represents a potentially beneficial therapeutic strategy for severe COVID-19 patients.","output":"Neutrophils mediate Th17 promotion in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 vaccines have been developed with unprecedented speed which would not have been possible without decades of fundamental research on delivery nanotechnology Lipid-based nanoparticles have played a pivotal role in the successes of COVID-19 vaccines and many other nanomedicines, such as Doxil R and Onpattro R, and have therefore been considered as the frontrunner in nanoscale drug delivery systems In this review, we aim to highlight the progress in the development of these lipid nanoparticles for various applications, ranging from cancer nanomedicines to COVID-19 vaccines The lipid-based nanoparticles discussed in this review are liposomes, niosomes, transfersomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, and nanostructured lipid carriers We particularly focus on the innovations that have obtained regulatory approval or that are in clinical trials We also discuss the physicochemical properties required for specific applications, highlight the differences in requirements for the delivery of different cargos, and introduce current challenges that need further development This review serves as a useful guideline for designing new lipid nanoparticles for both preventative and therapeutic vaccines including immunotherapies","output":"Lipid-Based Nanoparticles in the Clinic and Clinical Trials: From Cancer Nanomedicine to COVID-19 Vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Optic Neuritis had been an unusual manifestation, reported in patients affected with coronavirus disease-2019(COVID-19).

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected health care systems across developing and developed countries. Therefore, it is important to understand its impact on various parameters of patient care as regards revised infrastructure and policies in hospitals during the pandemic. METHOD: It is a retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted from 13-3C2020 to 26-4-2020 at King Khalid University Hospital in Saudi Arabia. Patient satisfaction and surgical outcomes were the main outcome measures. RESULTS: 331 participants were included in the study (median age: 53 years; 70% female), and 223 completed the patient's satisfaction survey. 260 of the surgeries were non-oncolog cases (78.6%) compared to 71 oncology cases (21.4%). With respect to the surgical outcomes, 12% of the patients required admission to the ICU, and 10.9% developed postoperative complications, most of which were infectious complications. Only 1.8% (6 patients) were re-admitted to the hospital. Three patients died within 30 days post-op (0.9%), all had emergency surgery. Regarding patient satisfaction, 77.6% and 93% of the patients reported that nurses and doctors, respectively, treated them with courtesy and respect, listened to them carefully, and provided clear explanations to them. 90.3% were satisfied with the hospital sanitary measures. 64.1% stated that they got written instructions at the time of discharge. CONCLUSION: The satisfaction level of patients was high for all the studied domains, and there were a small number of complications with overall good surgical outcomes. That indicates that all the actions and policies that were implemented during the pandemic were proven beneficial for the patients. It is recommended to continue those measures until the COVID-19 pandemic is over.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on patient satisfaction and surgical outcomes: A retrospective and cross sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Repositivity of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in discharged COVID-19 patients was reported recently. However, the characteristics of repositive results are still not well understood, leading to a lack of effective monitoring strategies. Methods In the present study, a total of 59 COVID-19 patients were enrolled, and the characteristics of the repositive samples were analyzed. Results The repositive rate in this cohort was 15.79%. The N gene was the main target gene that was positive in the repositive results as well as in the last positive results of all patients. The median duration from diagnosis to the last positive test was 20 days (IQR, 16C31 days), and the longest duration was 40 days. Repositivity was only observed in IgM single- or both IgM- and IgG-positive patients, instead of IgG single-positive patients. Conclusions There was a significant proportion of repositives in the recovered COVID-19 patients, and increasing the required number of negatives for consecutive nucleic acid tests may reduce the incidence of repositives. The recommended monitoring strategy for repositivity is monitoring the N gene in IgM-positive patients.

The issue of remote consultations has emerged. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, remote consultations were not routinely provided or covered by public health funding in Latvia. This study aimed to describe the dynamics of consultations and the volume of remote consultations provided for patients with particular NCD and explore clinicians experiences of providing remote consultations during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Latvia. METHODS: A mixed-method study focusing on the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Latvia in Spring 2020 was conducted. Quantitative data from the National Health Services were analysed to assess the dynamics of consultations for patients with selected NCDs. Qualitative data were collected through 34 semi-structured interviews with general practitioners (GPs) and specialists and were analysed using an inductive thematic analysis. Purposive maximum variation sampling was used for participant selection. RESULTS: During the period with the strongest restrictions of scheduled on-site consultations, a decrease in the total number of consultations was observed for a variety of NCDs. A significant proportion of consultations in this period were provided remotely. GPs provided approximately one-third of cancer-related consultations and almost half of consultations for the other selected conditions remotely. Among specialists, endocrinologists had the highest proportion of remote consultations (up to 72.0%), while urologists had the lowest (16.4%). Thematic analysis of the semi-structured interviews revealed five themes: 1) Adjusting in a time of confusion and fear, 2) Remote consultations: safety versus availability, 3) Sacrifice and loss of privacy, 4) Advantages and disadvantages of communication technologies, and 5) Different form of communication and a health literacy challenge. CONCLUSIONS: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Latvia, disruptions to health care services decreased the total number of consultations for patients with NCDs provided by both GPs and specialists. In this period, remote consultations proved to be an important instrument for ensuring the continuity of health care for patients with NCDs, and the necessity to develop a well-designed system for telemedicine in Latvia was highlighted.","output":"A mixed-method study on the provision of remote consultations for non-communicable disease patients during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Latvia: lessons for the future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus pandemic has affected millions of workers and companies around the world Movement of people has been restricted nationwide or in limited areas Social distancing measures have impacted labour markets in a great extent as numerous sectors and economic activities have been temporally closed or restricted Developed and emergent economies have been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and important contractions are expected by analysts and authorities Lives of workers have been impacted in a number of ways, varying from job loss to shifting to remote work This paper aims to explore potential transformations of the labour markets in and post-pandemic times and the role of digital skills It is argued that the telework and ICT-based mobile work will support labour market resilience during and after the coronavirus outbreak In this sense, digital skills will become more important and existing gaps can affect recovery [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Postmodern Openings / Deschideri Postmoderne is the property of Lumen Publishing House and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Digital Skills and Labour Market Resilience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) recently a global pandemic with unprecedented public health, economic and social impact. The development of effective mitigation strategies, therapeutics and vaccines relies on detailed genomic and biological characterization of the regional viruses. This study was carried out to isolate SARS-CoV-2 viruses circulating in Anatolia, and to investigate virus propagation in frequently-used cells and experimental animals. We obtained two SARS-CoV-2 viruses from nasopharngeal swabs of confirmed cases in Vero E6 cells, visualized the virions using atomic force and scanning electron microscopy and determined size distribution of the particles. Viral cytopathic effects on Vero E6 cells were initially observed at 72 h post-inoculation and reached 90% of the cells on the 5th day. The isolates displayed with similar infectivity titers, time course and infectious progeny yields. Genome sequencing revealed the viruses to be well-conserved, with less than 1% diversity compared to the prototype virus. The analysis of the viral genomes, along with the available 62 complete genomes from Anatolia, showed limited diversity (up to 0.2% on deduced amino acids) and no evidence of recombination. The most prominent sequence variation was observed on the spike protein, resulting in the substitution D614G, with a prevalence of 56.2%. The isolates produced non-fatal infection in the transgenic type I interferon knockout (IFNAR(?/-)) mice, with varying neutralizing antibody titers.

Four independent barley crop fields (40 x 40 m each) were sampled randomly to estimate the loss. Two were located near Alemsaga Priority State Forest and the other two were away from the forest. Four (2 x 2 m) rodent exclusion plots were established at 10 m interval as control units in each selected experimental barley fields using fine wire mesh. Rodent pest species were collected using both Sherman and snap traps throughout the different crop growing stages. The damaged and undamaged barley tillers by pest rodents were counted on five 1 x 1 m randomly sampled quadrats for each selected experimental fields. Variations on pest rodent population between cropping years and sites were analyzed using Chi square test. The mean crop damages between cropping years and experimental field sites were analyzed using two way ANOVA. Arvicanthis abyssinicus, Mastomys natalensis, Arvicanthis dembeensis, Mus musculus, Lophuromys simensis, Tachyoryctes splendens and Hystrix cristata were identified as pest rodents in the study area. A total of 968 individual rodents (427 in 2019 and 541 in 2020) were trapped during the study period. There was a statistical variation (2 = 13.42, df = 1 and P<0.05) between trapped individuals of the two successive years. The crop fields near the forest were more vulnerable than away from the forest during both cropping years.

The samples prepared using SEC and IEC retained more spikes on the surface than the ones prepared using ultracentrifugation, as confirmed by TEM and AFM. TEM showed that the spike (S) proteins were in the pre-fusion conformation. Notably, the S proteins could be recognized by specific monoclonal antibodies.

However, whether the insula is sensitive to stereotype inconsistency or plays a crucial role in stereotype regulation remains unclear. To help fill this gap, 21 young adults were presented with a modified single-category implicit association test (SC-IAT) that assessed their stereotypes about rural migrant workers. In a within-subjects design, participants completed separate blocks of compatible and incompatible trials, each of which consisted of stereotype-consistent or stereotype-inconsistent trait labels that had a positive or a negative valence. Functional MRI was used to identify specific brain regions associated with negative and positive stereotyping. The behavioral results revealed a typical stereotype regulation effect in which participants responded slower to stereotype-inconsistent condition than stereotype-consistent condition, although such effect was significantly modulated by IAT compatibility, rather than by emotional valence. MRI results revealed that activity in the right insula was significantly sensitive to stereotype regulation processes in negative incompatible tasks, whereas such effect was marginally significant in positive incompatible tasks. Moreover, psychophysiological interaction analyses indicated complex functional connectivity among the right insula and cognitive control regions [e.g., ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC)], social mentalizing regions [medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)], and motivation regions (putamen) in the condition where negative stereotypes were violated.

A total of 1378 participants were tested across four study sites. RESULTS: Compared to standard of care RT-PCR testing, the overall sensitivity and specificity of the Atila iAMP test for detection of SARS-CoV-2 were 76.2% and 94.9%, respectively, and increased to 88.8% and 89.5%, respectively, after exclusion of an outlier study site. Sensitivity varied based on the anatomic collected site. Sensitivity for nasopharyngeal was 65.4% (range across study sites:52.8%C79.8%), mid-turbinate 88.2%, saliva 55.1% (range across study sites:42.9%C77.8%) and anterior nares 66.7% (range across study sites:63.6%C76.5%).

METHODS This review is based on articles published up to 12 June 2020 that were retrieved by a selective literature search on the topic of invasive and non-invasive ventilation for respiratory failure in COVID-19. Guideline recommendations and study data on patients with respiratory failure in settings other than COVID-19 are also considered, as are the current figures of the intensive care registry of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine (Deutsche Interdisziplin?re Vereinigung fr Intensiv- und Notfallmedizin). RESULTS The high mortality figures among patients receiving invasive ventilation that have been reported in studies from abroad cannot be uncritically applied to the current situation in Germany. Study data on ventilation specifically in COVID-19 patients would be needed to do justice to the special pathophysiology of this disease, but such data are lacking. Being intubated too early is evidently associated with risks for the patient, but being intubated too late is as well. A particularly im - portant consideration is the potential harm associated with prolonged spontaneous breathing, with or without non-invasive assistance, as any increase in respiratory work can seriously worsen respiratory failure. On the other hand, it is clearly unacceptable to intubate patients too early merely out of concern that the medical staff might become infected with COVID-19 if they were ventilated non-invasively. CONCLUSION Nasal high flow, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive ventilation with intubation should be carried out in a stepwise treatment strategy, under appropriate intensive-care monitoring and with the observance of all relevant anti-infectious precautions. Germany is better prepared that other countries to provide COVID-19 patients with appropriate respiratory care, in view of the high per capita density of intensive-care beds and the availability of a nationwide, interdisciplinary intensive care registry for the guidance and coordination of intensive care in patients who need it.","output":"Invasive and Non-Invasive Ventilation in Patients With COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this descriptive study was to describe family caregivers experiences and changes in caregiving tasks and approaches during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The role of infections in COPD exacerbations is controversial. OBJECTIVES We investigated whether COPD exacerbations requiring hospitalization are associated with viral and/or bacterial infection and evaluated relationships among infection, exacerbation severity, assessed by reduction of FEV1, and specific patterns of airway inflammation. METHODS We examined 64 patients with COPD when hospitalized for exacerbations, and when in stable convalescence. We measured lung function, blood gases, and exhaled nitric oxide, and examined sputum for inflammation and for viral and bacterial infection. RESULTS Exacerbations were associated with impaired lung function (p < 0.01) and increased sputum neutrophilia (p < 0.001). Viral and/or bacterial infection was detected in 78% of exacerbations: viruses in 48.4% (6.2% when stable, p < 0.001) and bacteria in 54.7% (37.5% when stable, p = 0.08). Patients with infectious exacerbations (29.7% bacterial, 23.4% viral, 25% viral/bacterial coinfection) had longer hospitalizations (p < 0.02) and greater impairment of several measures of lung function (all p < 0.05) than those with noninfectious exacerbations. Patients with exacerbations with coinfection had more marked lung function impairment (p < 0.02) and longer hospitalizations (p = 0.001). Sputum neutrophils were increased in all exacerbations (p < 0.001) and were related to their severity (p < 0.001), independently of the association with viral or bacterial infections; sputum eosinophils were increased during (p < 0.001) virus-associated exacerbations. CONCLUSIONS Respiratory infections are associated with the majority of COPD exacerbations and their severity, especially those with viral/bacterial coinfection. Airway neutrophilia is related to exacerbation severity regardless of viral and/or bacterial infections. Eosinophilia is a good predictor of viral exacerbations.","output":"Infections and airway inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease severe exacerbations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background COVID-19 pandemic has affected routine immunization globally. Impact will likely be higher in low and middle-income countries with limited healthcare resources and fragile health systems. We quantified the impact, spatial heterogeneity, and determinants for childhood immunizations of 48 million population affected in the Sindh province of Pakistan. Methods We extracted individual immunization records from real-time provincial Electronic Immunization Registry from September 23, 2019, to July 11, 2020. Comparing baseline (6 months preceding the lockdown) and the COVID-19 lockdown period, we analyzed the impact on daily immunization coverage rate for each antigen by geographical area. We used multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the predictors associated with immunizations during the lockdown. Results There was a 51.0% decline in the daily average total number of vaccinations administered during lockdown compared to baseline. The highest decline was seen for Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) (40.6% (958/2,360) immunization at fixed sites. Around 8,438 children/day were missing immunization during the lockdown. Enrollments declined furthest in rural districts, and urban sub-districts with large slums, and polio-endemic super high-risk sub-districts. Pentavalent-3 (penta-3) immunization rates were higher in infants born in hospitals (RR: 1.09; 95% CI 1.04 C 1.15) and those with mothers who had higher education (RR: 1.19 C 1.50; 95% CI: 1.13 C 1.65). Likelihood of penta-3 coverage was reduced by 5% for each week of delayed enrollment into immunization. Conclusion One out of every two children in Sindh province have missed their routine vaccinations during the provincial COVID-19 lockdown. The pool of un-immunized children is expanding during lockdown, leaving them susceptible to vaccine-preventable diseases. There is a need for tailored interventions to promote immunization visits and safe service delivery. Higher maternal education, facility-based births, and early enrollment into the immunization program continue to show a positive association with immunization uptake, even during a challenging lockdown.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic response on uptake of routine immunizations in Sindh, Pakistan: an analysis of provincial electronic immunization registry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) modulate gene expression and regulate many physiological and pathological conditions. However, their modulation and effect in osteoclastogenesis remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of miR-346-3p in regulating the osteoclast differentiation from RAW264.7 cells. We used the miRNA microarray assay, miR-346-3p mimic transfection, tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining, bone resorption assay, qRT-PCR, and western blot. Our results showed that the expression of miR-346-3p was significantly upregulated during osteoclast differentiation. Further, by transfecting cells with miR-346-3p mimic, we observed an increased number of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells, increased pit area caused by bone resorption, and enhanced expression of osteoclast-specific genes and proteins. Conversely, miR-346-3p inhibition attenuated the osteoclast differentiation and function. Software-mediated prediction and validation using luciferase reporter assay showed that TRAF3, a negative regulator of osteoclast differentiation, was inhibited by miR-346-3p overexpression. Our results showed that miR-346-3p directly targeted TRAF3 mRNA via binding to its 3'-UTR and inhibited the expression of TRAF3 protein. Taken together, our results revealed that miR-346-3p promotes the regulation of osteoclastogenesis by suppressing the TRAF3 gene.

(2) Methods: In this retrospective study, clinical charts of enrolled patients were reviewed in a tertiary care center from the initial month of November 2017 to March 2020. All admitted patients with a central line and who enrolled in the OPAT of the hospital during this study period were included. The primary outcome was the 30-days readmission rate of OPAT patients. Secondary outcomes were factors associated with OPAT failure. Descriptive analysis of the data was used to express the results.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the Vivalytic SARS-CoV-2 rapid PCR kit in lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens. METHODS: Consecutive LRT specimens (bronchoalveolar lavage and bronchoaspirates) were collected from Intensive Care Units of San Martino Hospital (Genoa, Italy) between November 2020 and January 2021. All samples underwent RT-PCR testing by means of the Allplex? SARS-CoV-2 assay (Seegene Inc., South Korea). On the basis of RT-PCR results, specimens were categorized as negative, positive with high viral load [cycle threshold (Ct)  30] and positive with low viral load (Ct of 31C35). A 1:1:1 ratio was used to achieve a sample size of 75. All specimens were subsequently tested by means of the Vivalytic SARS-CoV-2 rapid PCR assay (Bosch Healthcare Solutions GmbH, Germany). The diagnostic performance of this assay was assessed against RT-PCR through the calculation of accuracy, Cohens , sensitivity, specificity and expected positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values. RESULTS: The overall diagnostic accuracy of the Vivalytic SARS-CoV-2 was 97.3% (95% CI: 90.9C99.3%), with an excellent Cohens  of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.72C1). Sensitivity and specificity were 96% (95% CI: 86.5C98.9%) and 100% (95% CI: 86.7C100%), respectively. In samples with high viral loads, sensitivity was 100% (Table 1). The distributions of E gene Ct values were similar (Wilcoxons test: p = 0.070), with medians of 35 (IQR: 25C36) and 35 (IQR: 25C35) on Vivalytic and RT-PCR, respectively (Fig. 1). NPV and PPV was 92.6% and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Vivalytic SARS-CoV-2 can be used effectively on LRT specimens following sample liquefaction. It is a feasible and highly accurate molecular procedure, especially in samples with high viral loads. This assay yields results in about 40 min, and may therefore accelerate clinical decision-making in urgent/emergency situations.","output":"Rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia on lower respiratory tract specimens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Outcomes 1.

Appraise the effectiveness of an educational toolkit to improve advance care planning in the emergency department for patients with COVID-19 Background The sudden emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) heightened the importance of advance care planning (ACP) conversations, particularly in the emergency department (ED). The objective of this quality improvement project was to determine the effect of an educational training program (toolkit) for emergency providers on ACP conversations in the ED during the COVID-19 pandemic. Aim Statement We sought to examine the efficacy of an emergency providerCfacing educational intervention, led by palliative care physicians, on the initiation of ED-based ACP for patients with COVID-19. Methods This was an evaluation of a quality improvement project at an academic ED using observational pre-/post-interventional data. Palliative care physicians delivered a 60-minute ACP educational intervention for emergency medicine providers in conjunction with release of reference documents as part of an educational toolkit. Initial training occurred on April 1, 2020. Measured outcomes for each patient included identification of a healthcare decision maker (HCDM), an order for a code status, or a documented goals-of-care (GOC) conversation. Results In total, 143 charts of patients with confirmed COVID-19 presenting for ED care between March 26 and May 25, 2020 were reviewed. There was exceptional representation in gender, race, and ethnicity, with 58% of participants being female, 29% Black, and 49% Hispanic/Latino. There was a 25.4% (95% CI, 7.0-43.9) increase in ED-based ACP, as measured by documentation of at least an HCDM, code status, or GOC conversation. Even after adjustment for patient demographics, a trend toward increased ACP activity was observed (OR = 2.71, 95% CI, 0.93-8.64). Conclusions and Implications In response to a pandemic threat, we found that a rapid and simple provider-facing educational toolkit was associated with increased ED-based ACP activities for patients with COVID-19.","output":"Advance Care Planning for Emergency Department Patients with COVID-19 Infection: An Assessment of a Physician Training Program (QI411)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims: This study aimed to investigate the clinical courses and outcomes of diabetes mellitus patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan.

However, the first patient was positive for serum MOG antibodies with normal CSF analysis, and the second had negative MOG antibodies but showed significant CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis.

A total of 210 RT-PCR-positive COVID-19 patients who provided consent were allotted to the control or case arm, based on block randomisation. The control arm received standard of care comprising paracetamol, ivermectin, and other adjuvant therapies. The patients in the case arm received indomethacin instead of paracetamol, with other medications retained. The primary endpoint was the development of hypoxia/desaturation with SpO(2)  93, while time to become afebrile and time for cough and myalgia resolution were the secondary endpoints.

Patients were treated with stent retriever-assisted thrombectomy  IV fibrinolysis. Baseline clinical and imaging characteristics were incorporated in univariate and multivariate analyses. Predictors of recanalization failure (TICI 0, 1, 2a), and of embolic and hemorrhagic complications were reported. The relationship between complication occurrence and periprocedural mortality rate was studied. RESULTS Median age was 69.5 years, and median NIHSS score was 18 at presentation. Fifty patients (34.7%) received stand-alone thrombectomy, and 94 (65.3%) received combined therapy. The procedural failure rate was 13.9%. Embolic complications were recorded in 12.5% and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in 7.6%. The overall rate of failure, complications, and/or death was 39.6%. The perioperative mortality rate was 18.4% in the overall cohort but was higher in cases of failure (45%; P = .003), embolic complications (38.9%; P = .0176), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages (45.5%; P = .0236), and intracranial stenosis (50%; P = .0176).

The PRECEDE component of the PRECEDE-PROCEED model was used to inform the interview questions. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and coded by 2 researchers using an inductive approach. Before COVID-19, stakeholders perceived that families of infants and toddlers were not aware of available resources related to food security in the community. Stakeholders' stated resources such as baby foods and nutrition education were limited. Since COVID-19, resources related to food security have become even more restricted due to the increased demand, lack of transportation, and new safety protocols (ie, limited hours, social distancing, etc.). Moreover, the stigma associated with applying for supplemental assistance was noted as a barrier to food security prior to and as a result of COVID-19. Stakeholders suggested these families have become more aware of supplemental assistance eligibility requirements and other available opportunities through social media and referrals since COVID-19. Age-appropriate foods and additional resources are needed in non-stigmatized ways for food-insecure families with young children, especially as a result of COVID-19.

RV15 Onestep ACE Detection), detecting 15 respiratory viruses (adenovirus, coronavirus 229E/NL63 and OC43, parainfluenza virus 1, 2, 3 and 4, influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, rhinovirus (RV), metapneumovirus, boccavirus and enterovirus). Results Patients were 2C24 yrs old (AVR 12 y), 13 chronically colonised with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA). Lung function test for 30 subjects showed: 9 normal findings; 11 mild, 7 moderate and 3 severe lung disease. There was no significant difference regarding lung function or PA status between the subgroups of patients positive or negative for viruses.

In this work, we infer the effect of and changes in home advantage prior to and during COVID-19 in the professional North American leagues for hockey, basketball, baseball, and American football. We propose a Bayesian multi-level regression model that infers the effect of home advantage while accounting for relative team strengths. We also demonstrate that the Negative Binomial distribution is the most appropriate likelihood to use in modelling North American sports leagues as they are prone to overdispersion in their points scored.

The clinical and serological characteristics of antibody-positive and seronegative patients were then compared. Sera positive for pan-neurofascin were also tested against live myelinated human stem cell-derived sensory neurons for antibody binding. RESULTS: Eight patients with IgG1-subclass antibodies directed against both isoforms of the nodal/paranodal cell adhesion molecule neurofascin were identified.

With the use of detailed epidemiological data from other countries, this article describes the possible reason for the SARS epidemic not appearing in Japan, and simulates the impact of different control strategies that can break the transmission cycle of SARS associated coronavirus. METHOD Mathematical modelling is used for predicting the epidemiological outcome and simultaneously for evaluating the effect of interventions on SARS. The study estimates the initial attack size that would result in failed invasion. Three different interventions have been incorporated into the public health response policies; precautionary public health measures, isolation of infected people, and quarantine of exposed humans. RESULTS The maximum number of humans newly infected could be roughly estimated on the basis of the initial attack size, using simple formulas. It is seen that the introduction of only a few cases into certain communities would not lead easily to an epidemic. The possible trajectories of SARS epidemic depend on the levels of public health interventions as quarantine and precautionary public health measures greatly affected the transmissibility of the disease. It is shown that there exist threshold levels of interventions at which the SARS epidemic settles down. CONCLUSION Initial attack size is one of the determinants of whether SARS can successfully invade the community or not. Two of the most effective policy procedures to prevent new infections would be to apply stringent precautionary measures and to impose quicker and more effective quarantine of the exposed populace.","output":"Modelling potential responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome in Japan: the role of initial attack size, precaution, and quarantine."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is one of the globes most common, multihost zoonoses and results in substantial socioeconomic costs for governments, farming industries, and tax payers Despite decades of surveillance and research, surprisingly, little is known about the exact mechanisms of transmission In particular, as a facultative intracellular pathogen, to what extent does survival of the causative agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis var bovis (M bovis), in the environment constitute an epidemiological risk for livestock and wildlife? Due largely to the classical pathology of cattle cases, the received wisdom was that bTB was spread by direct inhalation and exchange of bioaerosols containing droplets laden with bacteria Other members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) exhibit differing host ranges, an apparent capacity to persist in environmental fomites, and they favour a range of different transmission routes It is possible, therefore, that infection from environmental sources of M bovis could be a disease transmission risk Recent evidence from GPS-collared cattle and badgers in Britain and Ireland suggests that direct transmission by infectious droplets or aerosols may not be the main mechanism for interspecies transmission, raising the possibility of indirect transmission involving a contaminated, shared environment The possibility that classical pulmonary TB can be simulated and recapitulated in laboratory animal models by ingestion of contaminated feed is a further intriguing indication of potential environmental risk Livestock and wildlife are known to shed M bovis onto pasture, soil, feedstuffs, water, and other fomites;field and laboratory studies have indicated that persistence is possible, but variable, under differing environmental conditions Given the potential infection risk, it is timely to review the available evidence, experimental approaches, and methodologies that could be deployed to address this potential blind spot and control point Although we focus on evidence from Western Europe, the concepts are widely applicable to other multihost bTB episystems","output":"Does Mycobacterium tuberculosis var. bovis Survival in the Environment Confound Bovine Tuberculosis Control and Eradication?

In the presence of 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP) as the solvent, 1,6-addition alkylation reactions of p-QMs with NH-free indolines and THQs efficiently gave C5-alkylated indolines and C6-alkylated THQs. Using catalytic amounts of HFIP in DCM, the reaction of indolines and p-QMs resulted in the alkylation of indolines at the N1-position. HFIP plays two roles in the reactions: converting the indoline and THQ into bidentate nucleophiles and activating the p-QMs to achieve the 1,6-addition alkylation via hydrogen bond clusters. The indoline and THQ act as a C-nucleophile due to the H-bond clusters between HFIP and the nitrogen atom, whereas upon using catalytic amounts of HFIP, the compounds act as an N-nucleophile.

Immunothrombosis is driven by the complement/tissue factor/neutrophil axis, as well as by activated platelets, which can trigger the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and release further effectors of immunothrombosis, including platelet factor 4 (PF4/CXCL4) and high-mobility box 1 protein (HMGB1). Many of the central effectors of deregulated immunothrombosis, including activated platelets and platelet-derived extracellular vesicles (pEVs) expressing PF4, soluble PF4, HMGB1, histones, as well as histone-decorated NETs, are positively charged and thus bind to heparin. Here, we provide evidence that adsorbents functionalized with endpoint-attached heparin efficiently deplete activated platelets, pEVs, PF4, HMGB1 and histones/nucleosomes.

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional multicentre study of consecutive patients with refractory eosinophilic asthma who received treatment with benralizumab during at least 12 months. Patient follow-up was performed in specialised severe asthma units. The main effectiveness parameters measured were: the avoidance of one asthma exacerbation, a 3-point increase in the asthma control test (ACT) score, and the difference in utility scores (health-related quality of life) between a 1-year baseline treatment and 1-year benralizumab treatment. The health economic evaluation included direct costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: After 1 year of treatment with benralizumab, patients with refractory eosinophilic asthma showed an improvement in all the effectiveness parameters analysed: improvement of asthma control and lung function, and decrease in the number of exacerbations, oral corticosteroid (both as corticosteroid courses and maintenance therapy), and inhaled corticosteroid use. The total annual cost per patient for the baseline and benralizumab treatment periods were 11,544 and 14,043, respectively, reflecting an increase in costs due to the price of the biological agent but a decrease in costs for the remaining parameters. The ICER was 602 per avoided exacerbation and 983.86 for every 3-point increase in the ACT score.

Protists with symbionts were collected on large blocks of mangrove-peat. The blocks were placed in a flow cell with flow adjusted to in situ velocity. The water motion around the colonies was then characterized by particle tracking velocimetry. This shows that the feather-shaped colony of Z. niveum generates a unidirectional flow of seawater through the colony with no recirculation. The source of the feeding current was the free-flowing water although the size of the colonies suggests that they live partly submerged in the diffusive boundary layer. We showed that the filtered volume allows Z. niveum to assimilate sufficient sulfide to sustain the symbiosis at a few micromoles per liter in ambient concentration. Numerical modeling shows that sulfide oxidizing bacteria on the surfaces of Z. niveum can sustain 100-times higher sulfide uptake than bacteria on flat surfaces, such as microbial mats. The study demonstrates that the filter feeding zooids of Z. niveum are preadapted to be prime habitats for sulfide oxidizing bacteria due to Z. niveums habitat preference and due to the feeding current. Z. niveum is capable of exploiting low concentrations of sulfide in near norm-oxic seawater. This links its otherwise dissimilar habitats and makes it functionally similar to invertebrates with thiotrophic symbionts in filtering organs.

DISCUSSION: The 71.48% App user response rate, showed largely positive feedback of the COVID-19 tutorial. The fact that these healthcare workers/responders took the time to complete the survey during a pandemic was indicative of its immediate value. Further, the App users indicated that they FPV tutorial was rather helpful in addressing their training needs regarding their roles in COVID-19 patient care during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The tutorials were deployed to offer efficient and rapid global public health educational outreach as a tool to address COVID-19 healthcare training in a timely manner.","output":"Increasing global awareness of timely COVID-19 healthcare guidelines through FPV training tutorials: Portable public health crises teaching method"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has not only resulted in immense loss of human life, but it also rampaged across the global economy and socio-cultural structure. Worldwide, countries imposed stringent mass quarantine and lockdowns to curb the transmission of the pathogen. While the efficacy of such lockdown is debatable, several reports suggest that the reduced human activities provided an inadvertent benefit by briefly improving air and water quality. India observed a 68-days long, nation-wide, stringent lockdown between 24 March and 31 May 2020. Here, we delineate the impact of the lockdown on groundwater and river sourced drinking water sustainability in the arsenic polluted Ganges river basin of India, which is regarded as one of the largest and most polluted river basins in the world. Using groundwater arsenic measurements from drinking water wells and water quality data from river monitoring stations, we have studied ~700 km stretches of the middle and lower reaches of the As (arsenic)-polluted parts of the river for pre-lockdown (January-March 2020), syn-lockdown (April-May), and post-lockdown periods (June-July). We provide the extent of As pollution-free groundwater vis--vis river water and examine alleviation from lockdown as an opportunity for sustainable drinking water sources. The overall decrease of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentrations and increase of pH suggests a general improvement in Ganges water quality during the lockdown in contrast to pre-and-post lockdown periods, potentially caused by reduced effluent. We also demonstrate that land use (agricultural/industrial) and land cover (urban-periurban/rural) in the vicinity of the river reaches seems to have a strong influence on river pollutants. The observations provide a cautious optimistic scenario for potentially developing sustainable drinking water sources in the arsenic-affected Ganges river basin in the future by using these observations as the basis of proper scientifically prudent, spatially adaptive strategies, and technological interventions.","output":"Impact of Covid-19 Lockdown on Availability of Drinking Water in the Arsenic-Affected Ganges River Basin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Being heavily dependent to oil products (mainly gasoline and diesel), the French transport sector is the main emitter of Particulate Matter (PMs) whose critical levels induce harmful health effects for urban inhabitants. We selected three major French cities (Paris, Lyon, and Marseille) to investigate the relationship between the Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) outbreak and air pollution. Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) experiments, we have determined the concentration of PM(2.5) and PM(10) linked to COVID-19-related deaths. Our focus is on the potential effects of Particulate Matter (PM) in spreading the epidemic. The underlying hypothesis is that a pre-determined particulate concentration can foster COVID-19 and make the respiratory system more susceptible to this infection. The empirical strategy used an innovative Machine Learning (ML) methodology. In particular, through the so-called cutting technique in ANNs, we found new threshold levels of PM(2.5) and PM(10) connected to COVID-19: 17.4 g/m(3) (PM(2.5)) and 29.6 g/m(3) (PM(10)) for Paris; 15.6 g/m(3) (PM(2.5)) and 20.6 g/m(3) (PM(10)) for Lyon; 14.3 g/m(3) (PM(2.5)) and 22.04 g/m(3) (PM(10)) for Marseille. Interestingly, all the threshold values identified by the ANNs are higher than the limits imposed by the European Parliament.

Using the theoretical lens of surveillance, we found that travelers are digitally surveilled not only by their friends and family members on social media, but also by their superiors and colleagues through email and social networks. The expectations of being constantly available and responsive extend into their holiday, which makes it difficult for travelers to truly disconnect and enjoy their digital free travel experience. At the same time, they are inclined to engage in social surveillance of their peers which creates the constant urge to learn about any updates from their private and professional networks.

Yoga and meditation are proven interventions to reduce stress and anxiety and increase wellness. Yin yoga is an adaptable, quiet practice ideal for those lacking previous yoga experience, flexibility, and time. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of a 6-week yin yoga and meditation intervention on College of Pharmacy faculty and students' stress perception, anxiety levels, and mindfulness skills. METHODS: Faculty and students participated in a 6-week pilot program comprising a once-weekly yin yoga class followed by guided meditation. Yin yoga was selected for its quiet meditative style. Participants completed a pre- and postquestionnaire at 6 weeks and 3 and 6 months to evaluate potential changes in perceived stress scores, anxiety scores, and mindfulness skills. The questionnaire was composed of 3 self-reporting tools: Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Perceived Stress Scale, and the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire. RESULTS: Twenty participants, 12 students and 8 faculty (ages 18-66 years), completed the study. Anxiety and stress scores decreased, and mindfulness increased at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months, with all changes reaching statistical significance. No participants reported being in the \\"high\\" category of anxiety after intervention using BAI categorical data, although this finding was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Faculty and students demonstrated a reduction in stress and anxiety levels and an increase in mindfulness after a 6-week yin yoga and meditation program. Outcomes suggest that inclusion of an adaptable, meditative practice, which may easily be replicated at home, for as little as once per week for 6 weeks may reduce stress and anxiety and increase mindfulness long term.

We aimed to generate a WHO endorsed catalogue of mutations to serve as a global standard for interpreting molecular information for drug resistance prediction. METHODS: A candidate gene approach was used to identify mutations as associated with resistance, or consistent with susceptibility, for 13 WHO endorsed anti-tuberculosis drugs. 38,215 MTBC isolates with paired whole-genome sequencing and phenotypic drug susceptibility testing data were amassed from 45 countries. For each mutation, a contingency table of binary phenotypes and presence or absence of the mutation computed positive predictive value, and Fishers exact tests generated odds ratios and Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-values. Mutations were graded as Associated with Resistance if present in at least 5 isolates, if the odds ratio was >1 with a statistically significant corrected p-value, and if the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval on the positive predictive value for phenotypic resistance was >25%. A series of expert rules were applied for final confidence grading of each mutation. FINDINGS: 15,667 associations were computed for 13,211 unique mutations linked to one or more drugs. 1,149/15,667 (73%) mutations were classified as associated with phenotypic resistance and 107/15,667 (07%) were deemed consistent with susceptibility. For rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, fluoroquinolones, and streptomycin, the mutations pooled sensitivity was >80%. Specificity was over 95% for all drugs except ethionamide (914%), moxifloxacin (916%) and ethambutol (933%). Only two resistance mutations were classified for bedaquiline, delamanid, clofazimine, and linezolid as prevalence of phenotypic resistance was low for these drugs.

Methods: Assay performance was assessed in human plasma, BAL/BL and transport medium following chemical inactivation. For analytical evaluation, respective matrix materials were spiked with SARS-CoV-2 RNA in ten-fold dilution series. The efficacy of chemical inactivation by guanidine hydrochloride solution was confirmed in cell culture infectivity experiments. For correlation, a total of 235 predetermined clinical samples including respiratory swabs, plasma and BAL/BL were subjected to the SARS-CoV-2 IVD test and results were compared. Results: The SARS-CoV-2 IVD showed excellent linearity over five to seven log steps depending on matrix material.

Aim of this study was to determine transcriptome expression changes after experimental pneumonectomy in swine model. Experimental left pneumonectomy was performed in five pigs under general anaesthesia. Both the resected and the remaining lung, after 60 post-operative completely uneventful days, underwent genome-wide bulk RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq). RESULTS: Histological analysis showed dilation of air spaces and rupture of interalveolar septa. In addition, mild inflammation, no fibrosis, radial stretch of the bronchus, strong enlargement of airspaces and thinning of the blood supply were observed. Bioinformatic analyses of bulk RNA-Seq data identified 553 Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) at adjusted P-value below 0.001, between pre- and post-pneumonectomy. The top 10 up-regulated DEGs were Edn1, Areg, Havcr2, Gadd45g, Depp1, Cldn4, Atf3, Myc, Gadd45b, Socs3; the top 10 down-regulated DEGs were Obscn, Cdkn2b, ENSSSCG00000015738, Prrt2, Amer1, Flrt3, Efnb2, Tox3, Znf793, Znf365. Leveraging digital cytometry tools, no difference in cellular abundance was found between the two experimental groups, while the analysis of cell type-specific gene expression patterns highlighted a striking predominance of macrophage-specific genes among the DEGs. DAVID-based gene ontology analysis showed a significant enrichment of Extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway (FDR q = 7.60  10(? 3)) and Response to insulin (FDR q = 7.60  10(? 3)) genes, along with an enrichment of genes involved as Negative regulators of DDX58/IFIH1 signaling (FDR q = 7.50  10(? 4)) found by querying the REACTOME pathway database. Gene network analyses indicated a general dysregulation of gene inter-connections. CONCLUSION: This translational genomics study highlighted the existence both of individual genes, mostly dysregulated in certain cellular populations (e.g., macrophages), and gene-networks involved in pulmonary reaction after left pneumonectomy. Their involvement in lung homeostasis is largely supported by previous studies, carried out both in humans and in other animal models (under homeostatic or disease-related conditions), that adopted candidate-gene approaches. Overall, the present findings represent a preliminary assessment for future, more focused, studies on compensatory lung adaptation, pulmonary regeneration and functional reload.

METHODS: We retrospectively included 104 IPF patients and 52 controls who underwent baseline chest CT scans. Normal lungs below ? 500 HU were segmented, and the boundary was three-dimensionally reconstructed using in-house software. Gaussian curvature analysis provided histogram features on the heterogeneity of the fibrosis boundary. We analyzed the correlations between histogram features and the gender-age-physiology (GAP) and CT fibrosis scores. We built a regression model to predict diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) using the histogram features and calculated the modified GAP (mGAP) score by replacing DLCO with the predicted DLCO. The performances of the GAP, CT-GAP, and mGAP scores were compared using 100 repeated random-split sets. RESULTS: Patients with moderate-to-severe IPF had more numerous Gaussian curvatures at the fibrosis boundary, lower uniformity, and lower 10th to 30th percentiles of Gaussian curvature than controls or patients with mild IPF (all p < 0.0033). The 20th percentile was most significantly correlated with the GAP score (r = ? 0.357; p < 0.001) and the CT fibrosis score (r = ? 0.343; p = 0.001). More numerous Gaussian curvatures, higher entropy, lower uniformity, and 10th to 30th percentiles (p < 0.001C0.041) were associated with mortality. The mGAP score was comparable to the GAP and CT-GAP scores for survival prediction (mean C-indices, 0.76 vs. 0.79 vs. 0.77, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Gaussian curvatures of fibrosis boundaries became more heterogeneous as the disease progressed, and heterogeneity was negatively associated with survival in IPF. KEY POINTS: ? Gaussian curvature of the fibrotic lung boundary was more heterogeneous in patients with moderate-to-severe IPF than those with mild IPF or normal controls. ? The 20th percentile of the Gaussian curvature of the fibrosis boundary was linearly correlated with the GAP score and the CT fibrosis score. ? A modified GAP score that replaced the diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide with a composite measure using histogram features of the Gaussian curvature of the fibrosis boundary showed a comparable ability to predict survival to both the GAP and the CT-GAP score.

We tested the association between plasma sRAGE and illness severity, viral burden, and clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who were not mechanically ventilated. METHODS: Baseline sRAGE was measured among participants enrolled in the ACTIV-3/TICO trial of bamlanivimab for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Spearmans rank correlation was used to assess the relationship between sRAGE and other plasma biomarkers, including viral nucleocapsid antigen. Fine-Gray models adjusted for baseline supplemental oxygen requirement, antigen level, positive endogenous anti-nucleocapsid antibody response, sex, age, BMI, diabetes mellitus, renal impairment, corticosteroid treatment, and log(2)-transformed IL-6 level were used to assess the association between baseline sRAGE and time to sustained recovery. Cox regression adjusted for the same factors was used to assess the association between sRAGE and mortality. RESULTS: Among 277 participants, baseline sRAGE was strongly correlated with viral plasma antigen concentration ( = 0.57). There was a weaker correlation between sRAGE and biomarkers of systemic inflammation, such as IL-6 ( = 0.36) and CRP ( = 0.20). Participants with plasma sRAGE in the highest quartile had a significantly lower rate of sustained recovery (adjusted recovery rate ratio, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.43C0.90]) and a higher unadjusted risk of death (HR, 4.70 [95% CI, 2.01C10.99]) compared with participants in the lower quartiles. CONCLUSION: Elevated plasma sRAGE in hospitalized, nonventilated patients with COVID-19 was an indicator of both clinical illness severity and plasma viral load. Plasma sRAGE in the highest quartile was associated with a lower likelihood of sustained recovery and higher unadjusted risk of death. These findings, which we believe to be novel, indicate that plasma sRAGE may be a promising biomarker for COVID-19 prognostication and clinical trial enrichment.

This study aims to examine the effect of the AST report information complexity on physicians intention to prescribe antibiotics based on the AST report, as well as the mediating role of information overload and attitude. Methods: A cross-sectional study conducted on 411 physicians in a general hospital in China in July 2021. Data were collected by a self-reported questionnaire. A serial multiple mediation model was tested to explore the sequential causality between the information complexity of the AST report, information overload, attitude, and behavior intention to prescribe antibiotics based on the AST report by using the SPSS macro PROCESS program. Results: Information complexity, information overload, attitude and behavior intention were significantly correlated (p < 0.01). Information complexity can not only have a direct positive impact on the intention to prescribe antibiotics based on the AST report (effect = 0.173; SE = 0.044; Boot95%CI: LL = 0.089, UL = 0.260), but also have an indirect impact on behavior intention through the independent mediating role of information overload (effect = 0.025; SE = 0.011; Boot 95%CI: LL = 0.008, UL = 0.050) and the independent mediating role of attitude (effect = 0.130; SE = 0.025; Boot 95%CI: LL = 0.086, UL = 0.180), while the chain of information overload and attitude played a masking effect between information complexity and behavior intention (effect = ?0.013; SE = 0.004; Boot 95%CI: LL = ?0.023, UL = ?0.005). Conclusion: The increase in information complexity can encourage physicians to prescribe antibiotics based on the AST report, information overload and attitude can promote this effect.

With the limited effectiveness, currently available virus-directed therapies may have a substantial impact on global health due to continued reports of mutant variants affecting repeated waves of COVID-19 around the world. METHODS: We searched articles pertaining to aspirin, COVID-19, acute lung injury and pharmacology in PubMed and provide a comprehensive appraisal of potential use of aspirin in the management of patients with COVID-19. The scope of this article is to provide an overview of the rationale and currently available clinical evidence that supports aspirin as an effective therapeutic option in COVID-19. RESULTS: Experimental and clinical evidence are available for the potential use of aspirin in patients with COVID-19. DISCUSSION: Aspirin targets the intracellular signaling pathway that is essential for viral replication, and resultant inflammatory responses, hypercoagulability, and platelet activation. With these multiple benefits, aspirin can be a credible adjunctive therapeutic option for the treatment of COVID-19. In addition, inhaled formulation with its rapid effects may enhance direct delivery to the lung, which is the key organ damaged in COVID-19 during the critical initial course of the disease, whereas the 150C325 mg/day can be used for long-term treatment to prevent thrombotic event occurrences.

The membrane-associated Vpu accessory protein encoded by HIV-1 plays a key role in this process by altering cell surface levels of multiple host proteins. Using an unbiased quantitative plasma membrane profiling approach, we previously identified CD47 as a putative host target downregulated by Vpu. CD47 is a ubiquitously-expressed cell surface protein that interacts with the myeloid cell inhibitory receptor SIRP to deliver a dont-eat-me signal, thus protecting cells from phagocytosis. In this study, we investigate whether CD47 modulation by HIV-1 Vpu might promote the susceptibility of macrophages to viral infection via phagocytosis of infected CD4+ T cells. Indeed, we find that Vpu downregulates CD47 expression on infected CD4+ T cells leading to an enhanced capture and phagocytosis by macrophages. Interestingly, it is through this process that a CCR5-tropic transmitted/founder (T/F) virus, which otherwise poorly infects macrophages in its cell-free form, becomes infectious in macrophages. Importantly, we show that HIV-1-infected cells expressing a Vpu-resistant CD47 mutant are less prone to infect macrophages through phagocytosis. Mechanistically, Vpu forms a physical complex with CD47 through its transmembrane domain and targets the latter for lysosomal degradation. These results reveal a novel role of Vpu in modulating macrophage infection, which has important implications for HIV-1 transmission in early stages of infection and the establishment of viral reservoir. IMPORTANCE Macrophages play critical roles in HIV transmission, viral spread early in infection, and as a reservoir of virus. Selective capture and engulfment of HIV-1 infected T cells was shown to drive efficient macrophage infection suggesting that this mechanism represents an important mode of infection notably for weakly macrophage-tropic T/F viruses. In this study, we provide insight into the signals that regulate this process. We show that the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu downregulates cell surface levels of CD47, a host protein that interacts with the inhibitory receptor SIRP to deliver a dont-eat-me signal to macrophages. This allows for enhanced capture and phagocytosis of infected T cells by macrophages, ultimately leading to their productive infection even with T/F virus. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms governing the intercellular transmission of HIV-1 to macrophages with implications for the establishment of the macrophage reservoir and early HIV-1 dissemination in vivo.","output":"HIV-1 Vpu promotes phagocytosis of infected CD4+ T cells by macrophages through downregulation of CD47"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"According to the World Health Organization (WHO), one in four people will be affected by mental disorders at some point in their lives. However, in many parts of the world, patients do not actively seek professional diagnosis because of stigma attached to mental illness, ignorance of mental health and its associated symptoms. In this paper, we propose a model for passively detecting mental disorders using conversations on Reddit. Specifically, we focus on a subset of mental disorders that are characterized by distinct emotional patterns (henceforth called emotional disorders): major depressive, anxiety, and bipolar disorders. Through passive (i.e., unprompted) detection, we can encourage patients to seek diagnosis and treatment for mental disorders. Our proposed model is different from other work in this area in that our model is based entirely on the emotional states, and the transition between these states of users on Reddit, whereas prior work is typically based on content-based representations (e.g., n-grams, language model embeddings, etc). We show that content-based representation is affected by domain and topic bias and thus does not generalize, while our model, on the other hand, suppresses topic-specific information and thus generalizes well across different topics and times.

During the period between March and May 2020, the Italian scenario was considered as exemplary due to the large reduction of loads and thermal generation caused by the hard lockdown across the Country. Italy has experienced the most severe effects of pandemic in terms of increase of death rates and of pressure on the health system as well as severity of the countermeasures. As a domino effect, the total lockdown of one of the most industrialized countries in the world has created an emergency situation that has put a big stress on the power system, reducing the possibility for the system to recover under contingencies. The weakness of the system in such an extreme situation is analyzed in depth using open data, while some countermeasures for providing resilience to the power systems in such cases are analyzed in simulation. Two technologies are here considered as exemplary countermeasures for providing resilience to the Italian power system: Fast Frequency Response by Photovoltaic and Wind plants with rated power above 10 MVA and the massive implementation of Demand Response programs through Energy communities and aggregation using Blockchain technology.

Depression is also associated with the highest rates of self-harm and suicide (SH&S) (Singhal, Ross, Seminog, Hawton, & Goldarce, 2014). The impact of SH&S on a family ranges from shock and horror to, blame, secrecy and shame. Survivors may also be negatively judged or self-stigmatise (Cerel, Jordan, & Duberstein, 2008). Managing self-harm episodes has a significant financial implication for the NHS (Tsiachristas, et al., 2017). If high-risk individuals are identified and intervened early, it would not only save lives but also potentially reduce financial strains. The aim of the audit is to evaluate the performance of risk assessment and management of self-harm and suicide at the Reedyford Healthcare Group, Nelson, England, and to determine whether the primary care practice is meeting the standards of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for adults with depression. METHOD: A retrospective audit of 62 patients presenting with depressive symptoms over 3 months was performed at the Reedyford Healthcare Group. Two criteria from the NICE guidelines for adults with depression were included with associated standards of 100%: All patients with depression should be assessed for suicidal ideation and intent by asking direct questions. A patient presenting with significant risk to self/others should be referred to specialist mental health services the same day, as soon as possible. RESULT: 42 patients were asked direct questions about SH&S. 2 patients presenting with immediate risk were urgently referred to specialist services. Nonetheless, all those patients at increased risk of suicide were given an increased level of support by the practice. The results indicated that the practice could improve, and a quality improvement approach has been planned. CONCLUSION: The assessment of risk in patients presenting with depression is vital. This audit shows that it is not always done in practice. The author has not found other published audits on this topic and suggests that this may be appropriate for a national audit.

Furthermore, the antimicrobial mode of action is mainly physical (e.g. membrane distortion), which is characterized by a low risk of antimicrobial resistance. In this review, we evaluated the literature on the antiviral activity and broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties of CBNs. CBNs had antiviral activity against 12 enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2. CBNs with low or no toxicity to the humans are promising therapeutics against COVID-19 pneumonia complex with other viruses, bacteria and fungi, including those that are multidrug-resistant.","output":"Carbon-Based Nanomaterials: Promising Antiviral Agents to Combat COVID-19 in the Microbial Resistant Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A proper estimation of anti-epidemic measures related to the influence of the COVID-19 outbreak on air quality has to deal with filtering out the weather influence on pollution concentrations. The goal of this study was to estimate the effect of anti-epidemic measures at three pollution monitoring stations in the Ostrava region. Meteorological data were clustered into groups with a similar weather pattern, and pollution data were divided into subsets according to weather patterns. Then each subset was evaluated separately. Our estimates showed a 4.1C5.7% decrease in NO(x) concentrations attributed to lower traffic intensity during the lockdown. The decrease of PM(2.5) varied more significantly between monitoring stations. The highest decrease (4.7%) was detected at the traffic monitoring station, while there was no decrease detected at the rural monitoring station, which focuses mainly on domestic heating pollution. The key result of the study was the development of an analytical method that is able to take into account the effect of meteorological conditions. The method is much simpler and easy to replicate as an alternative to other published methods.","output":"Effect of the COVID-19 Lockdown on Air Pollution in the Ostrava Region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Non-human primates infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit mild clinical signs. Here we used a mathematical model to characterize in detail the viral dynamics in 31 cynomolgus macaques for which nasopharyngeal and tracheal viral load were frequently assessed. We identified that infected cells had a large burst size (>104 virus) and a within-host reproductive basic number of approximately 6 and 4 in nasopharyngeal and tracheal compartment, respectively. After peak viral load, infected cells were rapidly lost with a half-life of 9 hours, with no significant association between cytokine elevation and clearance, leading to a median time to viral clearance of 10 days, consistent with observations in mild human infections. Given these parameter estimates, we predict that a prophylactic treatment blocking 90% of viral production or viral infection could prevent viral growth. In conclusion, our results provide estimates of SARS-CoV-2 viral kinetic parameters in an experimental model of mild infection and they provide means to assess the efficacy of future antiviral treatments.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics in non-human primates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the need for a bedside tool for lung mechanics assessment and ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) monitoring. Mechanical power is a unifying concept including all the components which can possibly cause VILI (volume, pressures, flow, respiratory rate), but the complexity of its mathematical computation makes it not so feasible in routine practice and limits its clinical use. In this letter, we describe the development of a mobile application that allows to simply measure power associated with mechanical ventilation, identifying each component (respiratory rate, resistance, driving pressure, PEEP volume) as well. The major advantage, according to the authors who developed this mathematical description of mechanical power, is that it enables the quantification of the relative contribution of its different components (tidal volume, driving pressure, respiratory rate, resistance). Considering the potential role of medical apps to improve work efficiency, we developed an open source Progressive Web Application (PWA), named PowerApp (freely available at https://mechpower.goodbarber.app), in order to easily obtain a bedside measurement of mechanical power and its components. It also allows to predict how the modification of ventilatory settings or physiological conditions would affect power and each relative component.

However, there has also been criticism. With the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, the need for knowledge about how safety routines work in practice is larger than ever. In light of these obstacles, I suggest two approaches to the study of healthcare safety routines, based on a human factors perspective and a safety II mind-set that so far has gained little attention. The WHO surgical safety checklist, is used as an example. However, the suggestions presented here applies to other safety routines as well. The first approach is that instead of being preoccupied with what people do not do, investigate what they value with the routine. The perceived importance of different parts of the routine can expose the rationality behind the personnel's choice of actions when using the routine. Knowledge that could be used both to investigate the dynamics of everyday performance and for redesign and adjustment of the routine. The second approach is that instead of looking for failure, investigate and highlight when the routine works. Examples of when the routine works, i.e. avert adverse events, can be used both as positive reinforcement, and as an opportunity for learning with regards to everyday performance variability. Since a safety-II perspective is largely missing in the literature on healthcare safety routines, the two approaches suggested here comes with a huge potential for learning about how to improve safety.

We aimed to examine whether the combination of high-flow nasal oxygen therapy (HFNO) with awake-PP prevents the need for intubation when compared to HFNO alone. METHODS: Prospective, multicenter, adjusted observational cohort study in consecutive COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) receiving respiratory support with HFNO from 12 March to 9 June 2020. Patients were classified as HFNO with or without awake-PP. Logistic models were fitted to predict treatment at baseline using the following variables: age, sex, obesity, non-respiratory Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, APACHE-II, C-reactive protein, days from symptoms onset to HFNO initiation, respiratory rate, and peripheral oxyhemoglobin saturation. We compared data on demographics, vital signs, laboratory markers, need for invasive mechanical ventilation, days to intubation, ICU length of stay, and ICU mortality between HFNO patients with and without awake-PP. RESULTS: A total of 1076 patients with COVID-19 ARF were admitted, of which 199 patients received HFNO and were analyzed. Fifty-five (27.6%) were pronated during HFNO; 60 (41%) and 22 (40%) patients from the HFNO and HFNO + awake-PP groups were intubated. The use of awake-PP as an adjunctive therapy to HFNO did not reduce the risk of intubation [RR 0.87 (95% CI 0.53C1.43), p = 0.60]. Patients treated with HFNO + awake-PP showed a trend for delay in intubation compared to HFNO alone [median 1 (interquartile range, IQR 1.0C2.5) vs 2 IQR 1.0C3.0] days (p = 0.055), but awake-PP did not affect 28-day mortality [RR 1.04 (95% CI 0.40C2.72), p = 0.92]. CONCLUSION: In patients with COVID-19 ARF treated with HFNO, the use of awake-PP did not reduce the need for intubation or affect mortality.","output":"Awake prone positioning does not reduce the risk of intubation in COVID-19 treated with high-flow nasal oxygen therapy: a multicenter, adjusted cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transportation amongst cities is found as one of the main factors which affect the outbreak of diseases. To understand the effect of transport-related infection on disease spread, an SEIRS (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) epidemic model for two cities is formulated and analyzed. The epidemiological threshold, known as the basic reproduction number, of the model is derived. If the basic reproduction number is below unity, the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable. Thus, the disease can be eradicated from the community. There exists an endemic equilibrium which is locally asymptotically stable if the reproduction number is larger than unity. This means that the disease will persist within the community. The results show that transportation among regions will change the disease dynamics and break infection out even if infectious diseases will go to extinction in each isolated region without transport-related infection. In addition, the result shows that transport-related infection intensifies the disease spread if infectious diseases break out to cause an endemic situation in each region, in the sense of that both the absolute and relative size of patients increase. Further, the formulated model is applied to the real data of SARS outbreak in 2003 to study the transmission of disease during the movement between two regions. The results show that the transport-related infection is effected to the number of infected individuals and the duration of outbreak in such the way that the disease becomes more endemic due to the movement between two cities.

The behavior of implants in vivo is not sufficiently understood to design a surgical mesh mechanically compatible with the human abdominal wall. METHODS This analysis was based on radiological pictures of patients who underwent laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. The pictures show the trunk of the patient at rest in a standing position and under side bending. The change in the distance between different tacks due to trunk movement was analyzed, which allowed us to determine the in vivo elongation of the mesh incorporated into the abdominal wall. FINDINGS The relative elongations of the surgical mesh varied from a few percent to greater than 100% in two cases. The median of the median relative elongations obtained for all patients is 9.5%, and the median of the maximum relative elongations for all patients is 32.6%. The maximum elongation occurs between tacks that are next to each other. Trunk movement causes implant deformation, and this study provides quantitative information regarding changes in the distance between fasteners.

Elective services were stopped and trauma services focused on decreasing patient-clinician interactions and managing injuries nonoperatively wherever possible. The everyday life of the general public changed dramatically with the introduction of a national lockdown to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This paper looks at the experience of a South West London trauma unit. MATERIALS AND METHODS All patients reviewed in fracture clinic and by the orthopaedic on-call team between 23 March to 23 April 2020 were included. Data on the mechanism of injury and whether this was a usual activity, the injury sustained and its management were collected. RESULTS A total of 167 trauma injuries were seen, compared with 735 new patients with injuries in the previous month. The number of trauma operations completed decreased by 38%; 55% of injuries occurred inside the home and 44% outside the home during daily exercise. Some 31% of injuries were secondary to a new activity taken up during lockdown. Three open fractures and two polytrauma cases were seen that would have normally been managed at the local major trauma centre. CONCLUSION Overall, both the number of injuries seen and trauma operations completed during the enforced lockdown decreased. This is probably due to a change in the way the general public are living their lives, and the reconfigurations within the NHS in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is an interesting time within trauma and orthopaedic departments, as they continue to adapt to the changing injuries and working environment.","output":"The hidden dangers of staying home: a London trauma unit experience of lockdown during the COVID-19 virus pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Isothermal amplification strategies capable of rapid, inexpensive, and accurate nucleic acid detection provide new options for large-scale pathogen detection, disease diagnosis, and genotyping.

The current testing relies on reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), which is routinely performed in well-equipped laboratories by trained professionals at specific locations. However, during busy periods, high numbers of samples queued for testing can delay the test results, impacting efforts to reduce the infection risk. Besides, the absence of well-established laboratories at remote sites and low-resourced environments can contribute to a silent spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). These reasons compel the need to accommodate point-of-care testing for COVID-19 that meets the ASSURED criteria (affordable, sensitive, specific, user-friendly, rapid and robust, equipment-free, and deliverable). This study assessed the agreement and accuracy of the portable Biomeme SARS-CoV-2 system against the gold standard tests. Nasopharyngeal and nasal swabs were used. Of the 192 samples tested using the Biomeme SARS-CoV-2 system, the results from 189 samples (98.4%) were in agreement with the reference standard-of-care RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2. The portable system generated simultaneous results for nine samples in 80 min with high positive and negative percent agreements of 99.0% and 97.8%, respectively.

Human/COVID-19 interactions cause different outcomes ranging from minor health consequences to death. Since social interaction is the default mode by which individuals communicate with their surroundings, different modes of contagion can play a role in determining the long-term consequences for mental health and emotional well-being. We examined some basic aspects of human social interaction, emphasizing some particular features of the emotional contagion. Moreover, we analyzed the main report that described brain damage related to the COVID-19 infection. Indeed, the goal of this review is to suggest a possible explanation for the relationships among emotionally impaired people, brain damage, and COVID-19 infection. Results: COVID-19 can cause several significant neurological disorders and the pandemic has been linked to a rise in people reporting mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety. Neurocognitive symptoms associated with COVID-19 include delirium, both acute and chronic attention and memory impairment related to hippocampal and cortical damage, as well as learning deficits in both adults and children. Conclusions: Although our knowledge on the biology and long-term clinical outcomes of the COVID-19 infection is largely limited, approaching the pandemic based on lessons learnt from previous outbreaks of infectious diseases and the biology of other coronaviruses will provide a suitable pathway for developing public mental health strategies, which could be positively translated into therapeutic approaches, attempting to improve stress coping responses, thus contributing to alleviate the burden driven by the pandemic.","output":"The Social Brain and Emotional Contagion: COVID-19 Effects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10 1371/journal pone 0243702 ]","output":"Correction: Caregivers' mental distress and child health during the COVID-19 outbreak in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Concomitant experimental/compassionate drug administration has been all-pervasive in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. The objective of this study was to study the relationship between patient severity, the number of experimental/compassionate medications received (main outcome measure), and patient outcomes [survival to hospital discharge and length of hospital stay (LOS)]. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of data collected in real time during the first pandemic wave in a tertiary care hospital. Data included patient demographics, comorbidities, admission vital signs, laboratory values, most extreme respiratory intervention during hospitalization, and data regarding treatment with compassionate/experimental drugs during their stay. RESULTS: Overall, 292 PCR-confirmed patients with symptoms of COVID-19 were studied (March/April, 2020). Increasing respiratory support correlated with both LOS and mortality. Patients were more likely to receive more than 1 experimental/compassionate drugs as respiratory support escalated, ranging from 3% (n = 4/136) among patients on room air to 77.3% (n = 17/22) of mechanically ventilated/ECMO patients (P < 0.001, linear by linear association). The mean number of experimental/compassionate drugs received also increased with escalating respiratory support (P < 0.001, one-way ANOVA). After adjustment for severity of patient condition, administration of more experimental/compassionate drugs was unrelated to survival (P = 0.24), but was related to increased LOS (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Patients that were hospitalized in worse condition were more likely to receive more experimental/compassionate drugs. Treatment was unrelated to survival but may have been related to LOS.

The focus has been on the effects of coping mechanism; however, little is known about coping itself in palliative care. AIM: To synthesise evidence of coping strategies in palliative care professionals, and how different strategies play roles over time. DESIGN: Systematically conducted integrative review. DATA SOURCES: PubMed; CINAHL; Medline; PsycINFO and B-ON were searched (1996C2021) combining coping AND palliative care. A predefined data extraction sheet was developed to report data. Two researchers performed constant comparative analysis using Nvivo(?). RESULTS: Thirty-one studies were included. Four main strategies with recurrent reference to time were found: (a) proactive coping, involving activities to achieve self-confidence and control situations and emotions; (b) self-care based coping, including self-protection and self-awareness activities, with behavioural disconnection; (c) self-transformation coping, involving activities to accept limits; and (d) encountering deep professional meaning, is a coping mechanism based on meaning, frequently considering the deepest meaning of work. The dynamic and influencing factors were training, team interaction, professional motivation and family. They were usually protective factors, though sometimes they represented risk factors. The emotional burden associated with healthcare and systemic stressors were always risk factors.

Some surgeons, however, modify the technique by elevating a mucosal flap prior to creating the osteotomy with the aim of preserving the mucosa. To our knowledge, no clear-cut benefit of a mucosal flap has been established. The aim of this study is to examine the differences in surgical techniques and success rates of EDCRs with and without mucosal flap preservation. METHODS: We carried out a medical record review of all patients who underwent primary EDCR at the Goldschleger Eye Institute from October 2009 to October 2017. The following data were retrieved from the medical database and analyzed: patient demographics (age at diagnosis and gender), medical history, examination findings, surgical details, postoperative success, complications, and follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 107 patients who underwent 117 EDCRs participated in the study. Fifty-one patients comprised the group without a mucosal flap and 56 patients comprised the group with mucosal flap preservation. The medical history, presenting complaints, and preoperative examination findings were similar for both groups. The surgical success rate was not significantly different between the groups (82.1% without flap vs. 86.8% with flap, P = 0.478, Chi-square). CONCLUSION: The findings of this comparison of EDCRs with and without mucosal flap preservation in a large patient population revealed no differences in surgical success or complications rates between the two procedures and, therefore, no benefit for adding flap preservation to conventional EDCRs.","output":"Endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy with and without mucosal flapis there any difference?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background Since the onset of the new coronavirus pandemic, the world is facing a public health emergency. Repositioning hydroxychloroquine (HQ) seems to be a promising option. Many emerging evidences have converged on the effectiveness of HQ in the treatment of Covid-19 infection. In a recent paper, Gautret et al. suggested that further works are needed to determine if HQ antiviral prophylaxis is useful, especially for healthcare workers. Methods The purpose of this paper is to assess the Covid-19 exposure and risks level among caregivers. For this, we performed research on internet and PubMed by crossing the following keywords: healthcare givers, healthcare workers, doctors, nurses, coronavirus, Covid-19, mortality, infection rate, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine. Results Data on healthcare worker's infection and mortality by Covid-19 are partial and are not systematically published. However, it seems that the infection rate varies between 3.8% and 9% depending on the country. Moreover, the mean age of this population is relatively old, especially in the OECD area. Conclusions Anti-Covid-19 HQ prophylaxis should be urgently accessed, especially for healthcare workers.

However, for Switzerland, due to the lack of synthesis studies, it is currently unknown how many people are affected by obesity at all. This knowledge may help to better estimate the relevance and size of this group at elevated risk, which could be incorporated into strategies to protect risk groups during the still unfolding COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to provide a first overall estimation of how many people in Switzerland are currently affected by grade 2 or 3 obesity. Methods: Five representative national population-based studies were accessed which were conducted between 2012 and 2017 and which include data on height and weight of adult men and women in Switzerland. Results: In Switzerland in 2012-2017, among the 11.20% adults who were obese (body mass index (BMI) 30.0kg/m2), 1.76% (95% CI 1.50-2.02) suffered from grade 2 obesity (BMI 35.0-39.9 kg/m2), and 0.58% (95% CI 0.50-0.66) from grade severe 3 obesity (BMI 40.0 kg/m2). Converted into estimated absolute population numbers, this corresponds to a total of approximately n=154,515 people who suffer from grade 2 or 3 obesity (n=116,216 and n=38,298, respectively). Conclusions: This risk group includes many younger people in Switzerland. The number of people with obesity-related risk becomes 3.8 to 13.6 times higher if grade 1 obesity and overweight people are also included in this risk group, for which there are arguments arising in the latest literature.

In the present study, 239 academic lecturers answered an online questionnaire. Four groups of emotions were examined: Success, opportunity, failure, and threat. The findings indicated that the emotions lecturers experienced most strongly was that of success, followed by opportunity. The predictors of lecturer's willingness to teach online in the future were emotions related to 'opportunity' and 'failure'. Surprisingly, the dramatic event of COVID-19 lockdown evoked more positive than negative emotions among lecturers during the first semester of the crisis. The emotions of threat that might characterize this period did not affect the willingness to teach online in the future as may be expected. This study demonstrates how tracing the emotional response toward adopting technology may contribute to understanding technology acceptance.

Formative studies have demonstrated that students want a more engaging intervention tool for risky drinking that can be used just in time. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to test the appeal, relevance, and perceived utility of a draft mobile app for safer student drinking at a public university in Virginia. METHODS: Undergraduate student participants tested the draft mobile app via a web-based prototype that tailors to individual feedback with hot spots that responded to their taps to mimic app functionality.

NSARS-CoV-2 contains an intrinsically disordered region at its N-terminus (NTE) that can be phosphorylated and is affected by disease-relevant mutations. Here we show that NTE deletion decreases the range of RNA concentrations that can induce phase separation of NSARS-CoV-2. In addition, deletion of the prion-like NTE allows NSARS-CoV-2 droplets to retain their liquid-like nature during incubation. We further demonstrate that RNA-binding engages multiple parts of the NTE and changes NTEs structural properties.

All three professions demonstrated significantly elevated PHQ-2 and GAD-2 scores, when compared with general German population before the pandemic, but lower scores in relation to that during the pandemic. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that higher levels of depressive symptoms were associated with insufficient recovery during leisure time, increased alcohol consumption, and less trust in colleagues in difficult situations at work. In addition, elevated anxiety scores were related to increased fear of becoming infected with COVID-19.

Unfortunately, many front-line treatment providers do not utilize CM, likely due to contextual barriers that limit effective training and ongoing support for evidence-based practices. This study applied user-informed approaches to adapt a multi-level implementation strategy called the Science to Service Laboratory (SSL) to support CM implementation. METHODS: Leaders and treatment providers working in community-based opioid treatment programs (OTPs; N = 43) completed qualitative interviews inquiring about their preferences for training and support implementation strategies (didactic training, performance feedback, and external facilitation). Our team coded interviews using a reflexive team approach to identify common a priori and emergent themes. RESULTS: Leaders and providers expressed a preference for brief training that included case examples and research data, along with experiential learning strategies. They reported a desire for performance feedback from internal supervisors, patients, and clinical experts. Providers and leaders had mixed feelings about audio-recording sessions but were open to the use of rating sheets to evaluate CM performance. Finally, participants desired both on-call and regularly scheduled external facilitation to support their continued use of CM.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A survey study of a nonprobability convenience sample of 2000 recruited participants including a choice-based conjoint analysis was conducted to estimate respondents probability of choosing a vaccine and willingness to receive vaccination. Participants were asked to evaluate their willingness to receive each hypothetical vaccine individually. The survey presented respondents with 5 choice tasks. In each, participants evaluated 2 hypothetical COVID-19 vaccines and were asked whether they would choose vaccine A, vaccine B, or neither vaccine. Vaccine attributes included efficacy, protection duration, major adverse effects, minor adverse effects, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process, national origin of vaccine, and endorsement. Levels of each attribute for each vaccine were randomly assigned, and attribute order was randomized across participants. Survey data were collected on July 9, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Average marginal component effect sizes and marginal means were calculated to estimate the relationship between each vaccine attribute level and the probability of the respondent choosing a vaccine and self-reported willingness to receive vaccination.

A vaccine that originated from a non-US country was associated with a lower probability of choosing a vaccine (China: ?0.13 [95% CI, ?0.15 to ?0.11]; UK: ?0.04 [95% CI, ?0.06 to ?0.02]). Endorsements from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (coefficient, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.07-0.11) and the World Health Organization (coefficient, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.04-0.08), compared with an endorsement from President Trump were associated with higher probabilities of choosing a vaccine. Analyses of participants willingness to receive each vaccine when assessed individually yielded similar results. An increase in efficacy from 50% to 90% was associated with a 10% higher marginal mean willingness to receive a vaccine (from 0.51 to 0.61). A reduction in the incidence of major side effects was associated with a 4% higher marginal mean willingness to receive a vaccine (from 0.54 to 0.58). A vaccine originating in China was associated with a 10% lower willingness to receive a vaccine vs one developed in the US (from 0.60 to 0.50) Endorsements from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization were associated with increases in willingness to receive a vaccine (7% and 6%, respectively) from a baseline endorsement by President Trump (from 0.52 to 0.59 and from 0.52 to 0.58, respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this survey study of US adults, vaccine-related attributes and political characteristics were associated with self-reported preferences for choosing a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine and self-reported willingness to receive vaccination. These results may help inform public health campaigns to address vaccine hesitancy when a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available.","output":"Factors Associated With US Adults Likelihood of Accepting COVID-19 Vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Nationwide studies that examine climatic modification effects on the association between air pollution and health outcome are limited in developing countries. Moreover, few studies focus on PM1 pollution despite its greater health effect. OBJECTIVES This study aims to determine the modification effects of climatic factors on the associations between PM1 and the incidence rates of lung cancer for males and females in China. METHODS We conducted a nationwide analysis in 345 Chinese counties (districts) from 2014 to 2015. Mean air temperature and relative humidity over the study period were used as the proxies of climatic conditions. In terms of the multivariable linear regression model, we examined climatic modification effects in the stratified and combined datasets according to the three-category and binary divisions of climatic factors. Moreover, we performed three sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of climatic modification effects. RESULTS We found a stronger association between PM1 and the incidence rate of male lung cancer in counties with high levels of air temperature or relative humidity. If there is a 10 g/m3 shift in PM1, then the change in male incidence rate relative to its mean was higher by 4.39% (95% CI: 2.19, 6.58%) and 8.37% (95% CI: 5.18, 11.56%) in the middle and high temperature groups than in the low temperature group, respectively. The findings of climatic modification effects were robust in the three sensitivity analyses. No significant modification effect was discovered for female incidence rate. CONCLUSIONS Male residents in high temperature or humidity counties suffer from a larger effect of PM1 on the incidence rate of lung cancer in China. Future research on air pollution-related health impact assessment should consider the differential air pollution effects across different climatic conditions.","output":"Climatic modification effects on the association between PM1 and lung cancer incidence in China."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to COVID-19 outbreaks, most school pupils have had to be home-schooled for long periods of time. Two editions of a web-based competition Beat the Pathologists for school age participants in the UK ran to fill up pupils spare time after home-schooling and evaluate their ability on contributing to AI annotation. The two editions asked the participants to annotate different types of cells on Ki67 stained breast cancer images. The Main competition was at four levels with different level of complexity. We obtained annotations of four kinds of cells entered by school pupils and ground truth from expert pathologists. In this paper, we analyse school pupils performance on differentiating different kinds of cells and compare their performance with two neural networks (AlexNet and VGG16). It was observed that children tend to get very good performance in tumour cell annotation with the best F1 measure 0.81 which is a metrics taking both false positives and false negatives into account. Low accuracy was achieved with F1 score 0.75 on positive non-tumour cells and 0.59 on negative non-tumour cells. Superior performance on non-tumour cell detection was achieved by neural networks. VGG16 with training from scratch achieved an F1 score over 0.70 in all cell categories and 0.92 in tumour cell detection. We conclude that non-experts like school pupils have the potential to contribute to large-scale labelling for AI algorithm development if sufficient training activities are organised.

METHODS Systematic review and meta-analysis of trials in which patients were randomly allocated to 6% HES solutions or alternative i.v. fluids in patients undergoing surgery. Ovid Medline, Embase, Cinhal, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched for trials comparing 6% HES with clinically relevant non-starch comparator. The primary end-point was hospital mortality. Secondary endpoints were requirement for renal replacement therapy (RRT) and author-defined AKI. Pre-defined subgroups were cardiac and non-cardiac surgery. RESULTS Four hundred and fifty-six papers were identified; of which 19 met the inclusion criteria. In total, 1567 patients were included in the analysis. Dichotomous outcomes were expressed as a difference of proportions [risk difference (RD)]. There was no difference in hospital mortality [RD 0.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.02, 0.02], requirement for RRT (RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.04, 0.02), or AKI (RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.06) between compared arms overall or in predefined subgroups. CONCLUSIONS We did not identify any differences in the incidence of death or AKI in surgical patients receiving 6% HES. Included studies were small with low event rates and low risk of heterogeneity.

The exposure to general information concerning COVID-19 positively predicts negative attitudes, negative emotions and the emergence of subjective norms in relation to COVID-19, as well as the likelihood of engaging in protective behavioral intentions. The exposure to humoristic communication, however, diluted the positive association between exposure to general information and negative attitudes, as well as negative emotions. The results support the overall predictions of the TPB and report positive associations between negative attitudes towards COVID-19, subjective norms and behavioral control on the one hand, and protective behavioral intentions on the other. Negative emotions significantly predict the likelihood of engaging in protective behaviors. Our results also show that older respondents tend to develop more negative attitudes towards COVID-19, yet they do not report stronger intentions to engage in protective behaviors than younger respondents.

This study describes the characteristics of decedents on ECMO at the time of death, including clinical indications, types of circuit configurations, causes and manners of death, gross findings at autopsy, and therapeutic complications. Files of a regional medical examiner office within an academic medical center were searched for the period between 2013 and 2019. Nineteen cases were identified with a median age of 36 years. The circumstances surrounding the initial presentation included: sudden death, trauma, substance abuse, homicide, therapeutic complication, work-related injury, drowning, and hypothermia. The underlying causes of death included injury-related, as well as respiratory and cardiac-related natural diseases. The time spent on ECMO varied from less than 1 h to 10 months. Complications encountered due to ECMO included cannulation site bleeding, pneumohemopericardium, retroperitoneal hematoma, limb ischemia, clotting, and cannula dislodgement. The patient population likely to receive ECMO has significant overlap with death circumstances likely to be reported to the medical examiner. As ECMO therapy has become increasingly available, it is of importance for medical examiners and death investigators to be familiar with the procedure as well as its limitations.

Subjects and methods : This study involved 73 hospitalized patients positive for SARS-CoV-2. Patients were classified into two groups according to symptom severity as mild and severe. Blood levels of anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies, IL-6, CRP and iron-related biomarkers were measured. Results : The results revealed a significant increase in IL-6, CRP and ferritin levels and decreased transferrin and iron levels in severe COVID-19 disease. Transferrin negatively predicted variations in IgM and IgG levels (P< 0.001), as well as 34.4% and 36.6% increase in IL-6 and CRP levels respectively (P< 0.005). Importantly, transferrin was the main negative predictor of ferritin levels, determining 22.7% of serum variations (P< 0.001).

OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the literature that has been produced on children's exposure to violence during the pandemic to understand emerging patterns and critically appraise methodologies to help inform the design of future studies. The article concludes with recommendations for future research. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: The study entailed a search of working papers, technical reports, and journal articles. METHODS: The search used a combination of search terms to identify relevant articles and reports published between March 1 and December 31, 2020. The sources were assessed according to scope and study design. RESULTS: The review identified 48 recent working papers, technical reports, and journal articles on the impact of COVID-19 on violence against children. In terms of scope and methods, the review led to three main findings: 1) Studies have focused on physical or psychological violence at home and less attention has been paid to other forms of violence against children, 2) most studies have relied on administrative records, while other data sources, such as surveys or big data, were less commonly employed, and 3) different definitions and study designs were used to gather data directly, resulting in findings that are hardly generalizable. With respect to children's experience of violence, the review led to four main findings: 1) Studies found a decrease in police reports and referrals to child protective services, 2) mixed results were found with respect to the number of calls to police or domestic violence helplines, 3) articles showed an increase in child abuse-related injuries treated in hospitals, and 4) surveys reported an increase in family violence.

Most of the existing literature reports on the cannabinoids 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), or cannabis in general. There are many cannabis strains that vary widely in the composition of cannabinoids, terpenes, flavonoids, and other compounds. These components work synergistically to produce wide variations in benefits, side effects, and strain characteristics. Knowledge of the individual medicinal properties of the cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids is necessary to cross-breed strains to obtain optimal standardized synergistic compositions. This will enable targeting individual symptoms and/or diseases, including migraine, headache, and pain. OBJECTIVE Review the medical literature for the use of cannabis/cannabinoids in the treatment of migraine, headache, facial pain, and other chronic pain syndromes, and for supporting evidence of a potential role in combatting the opioid epidemic. Review the medical literature involving major and minor cannabinoids, primary and secondary terpenes, and flavonoids that underlie the synergistic entourage effects of cannabis. Summarize the individual medicinal benefits of these substances, including analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. CONCLUSION There is accumulating evidence for various therapeutic benefits of cannabis/cannabinoids, especially in the treatment of pain, which may also apply to the treatment of migraine and headache. There is also supporting evidence that cannabis may assist in opioid detoxification and weaning, thus making it a potential weapon in battling the opioid epidemic.

With the recognition that universal health coverage improves the health of a population and reduces health inequalities, universal health coverage has been acknowledged as a priority goal. To meet the global needs in a population with increased chronic illness and longer life expectancy, the health care system is in dire need of new, emerging technologies. eHealth solutions as a method of delivery may have an impact on quality of care and health care costs. As such, it is important to study methods previously used to avoid suboptimal implementation and promote general guidelines to further develop eHealth solutions. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore and thematically categorize a selected representation of early phase studies on eHealth technologies, focusing on papers that are under development or undergoing testing. Further, we want to assess enablers and barriers in terms of usability, scaling, and data management of eHealth implementation. The aim of this study to explore early development phase and feasibility studies was an intentional effort to provide applicable guidelines for evaluation at different stages of implementation. METHODS: A structured search was performed in PubMed, MEDLINE, and Cochrane to identify and provide insight in current eHealth technology and methodology under development and gain insight in the future potential of eHealth technologies. RESULTS: In total, 27 articles were included in this review. The clinical studies were categorized thematically by illness comparing 4 technology types deemed relevant: apps/web-based technology, sensor technology, virtual reality, and television. All eHealth assessment and implementation studies were categorized by their focus point: usability, scaling, or data management. Studies assessing the effect of eHealth were divided into feasibility studies, qualitative studies, and heuristic assessments. Studies focusing on usability (16/27) mainly addressed user involvement and learning curve in the adoption of eHealth, while the majority of scaling studies (6/27) focused on strategic and organizational aspects of upscaling eHealth solutions. Studies focusing on data management (5/27) addressed data processing and data sensitivity in adoption and diffusion of eHealth. Efficient processing of data in a secure manner, as well as user involvement and feedback, both throughout small studies and during upscaling, were the important enablers considered for successful implementation of eHealth. CONCLUSIONS: eHealth interventions have considerable potential to improve lifestyle changes and adherence to treatment recommendations. To promote efficient implementation and scaling, user involvement to promote user-friendliness, secure and adaptable data management, and strategical considerations needs to be addressed early in the development process. eHealth should be assessed during its development into health services.

We examined the accuracy of AI ECG for identification of LVSD (defined as LVEF 40% by transthoracic echocardiogram [TTE]) in cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) patients. METHOD We included unique Mayo Clinic CICU patients admitted from 2007 to 2018 who underwent AI-ECG and TTE within 7 days, at least one of which was during hospitalization. Discrimination of the AI-ECG for LVSD was determined using receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC) values. RESULTS We included 5680 patients with a mean age of 68  15 years (37% females). Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was present in 55%. LVSD was present in 34% of patients (mean LVEF 48  16%). The AI-ECG had an AUC of 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.82-0.84) for discrimination of LVSD. Using the optimal cut-off, the AI-ECG had 73%, specificity 78%, negative predictive value 85% and overall accuracy 76% for LVSD. AUC values were higher for patients aged <70 years (0.85 versus 0.80), males (0.84 versus 0.79), patients without ACS (0.86 versus 0.80), and patients who did not undergo revascularization (0.84 versus 0.80). CONCLUSIONS The AI-ECG algorithm had very good discrimination for LVSD in this critically-ill CICU cohort with a high prevalence of LVSD. Performance was better in younger male patients and those without ACS, highlighting those CICU patients in whom screening for LVSD using AI ECG may be more effective. The AI-ECG might potentially be useful for identification of LVSD in resource-limited settings when TTE is unavailable.","output":"Left ventricular systolic dysfunction identification using artificial intelligence-augmented electrocardiogram in cardiac intensive care unit patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 remains a major global crisis and continues to spread relentlessly around the world. In Japan, the number of infected people has incrementally increased since April 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has exerted a major impact not only on our daily lives but also on healthcare. As the infection continues to spread, many medical institutions have devoted all efforts to minimize the risk of infection not only for patients but also for medical personnel by prioritizing medical care, reserving treatment, and extending consultation intervals. Cancer treatment is one of the priorities for medical care even during an epidemic infection as there is a concern of decreasing curability or therapeutic effect from postponement. As the COVID-19 situation evolves rapidly, we created an informative triage to provide appropriate medical treatment to breast cancer patients. In this triage, we offer guidance on preparing for the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in breast cancer patients, prioritizing triage and diagnostic procedures, and providing advice on surgical, radiation, and oncological treatments.","output":"Recommendations for the management of breast cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic from the Japan Breast Cancer Society"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: From the worldwide youth-led climate strikes of 2018C2019 to the student-initiated austerity protests in Chile in 2019, it is undeniable that young people have been protagonists in pressuring for social change towards greater sustainability in recent years. This piece reflects on youth as agents of social-ecological change, and what researchers can learn from the rise in youth-led social movements demanding action in the face of global sustainability challenges. The study of sustainability problems like climate change and biodiversity loss, intrinsically requires consideration of inter-generational equity. However, despite 50% of the global population being under 30 years old, youth are often not included explicitly as actors in environmental social sciences and sustainability-related research. Here we discuss why explicitly considering young people as distinct actors during the research process is important, as it allows researchers to engage in just and inclusive work whilst at the same time accounting for important agents of change in complex social-ecological systems. RESULTS: As a framework for our inquiry we present the themes which emerged during a series of international meetings and forums on sustainability challenges and youth in 2019, a year characterized by world-wide youth mobilization. Our briefing spans the United Nations Youth 2019 Climate Action Summit, the post-2020 meetings organized by the youth branch of the Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD), the UNESCO Man and Biosphere Youth forums and the results from the Global Shapers Survey of the World Economic Forum. CONCLUSIONS: We argue that if researchers wish to facilitate youth-inclusive evidence-based decision making, research agendas must address knowledge gaps highlighted by institutional efforts to incorporate youth concerns within global sustainability policy, a recommendation that is even more relevant in the light of the COVID-19 crisis. We draw on the themes which emerged in our analysis of international youth meetings to provide recommendations for research agendas which account both for young actors as both passive and active components of social-ecological change and we propose a more inclusive and holistic study of coupled natural-human systems.","output":"Stewards of the future: accompanying the rising tide of young voices by setting youth-inclusive research agendas in sustainability research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the nationwide state of emergency, many hospitals could not provide outpatient cardiac rehabilitation for cardiac disease patients in order to minimize coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) incidence. The purpose of this study was to examine the trajectories of frailty, physical function and physical activity levels due to interruption and resumption of outpatient cardiac rehabilitation by COVID-19 in elderly heart failure patients. Fifteen patients who did not attend outpatient cardiac rehabilitation during the state of emergency but resumed it after the state of emergency were included. Frailty, physical function and physical activity levels were assessed with the Kihon checklist (KCL), various tests including short physical performance battery (SPPB), and life space assessment (LSA), respectively. Objective parameters were measured at three points; before and after the nationwide state of emergency in Japan and 3 months after resuming outpatient cardiac rehabilitation. The post-state of emergency KCL score was significantly higher than the pre-state of emergency score (P = 0.03), whereas there was no significant difference in KCL between post-state of emergency and 3 months after cardiac rehabilitation resumption. SPPB and LSA scores did not change significantly between pre- and post-state of emergency. The changes in LSA from post-state of emergency to 3 months after cardiac rehabilitation resumption tended to correlate with changes in KCL (r = -0.71, P = 0.11). We demonstrated that frailty status deteriorated significantly in elderly heart failure patients whose outpatient cardiac rehabilitation was interrupted due to COVID-19. In addition, the frailty status showed no significant improvement after 3 months of resuming cardiac rehabilitation.","output":"Trajectories of frailty, physical function, and physical activity levels in elderly patients with heart failure: impacts of interruption and resumption of outpatient cardiac rehabilitation due to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to report complications, as well as short- and long-term clinical outcomes of cats suffering from surgically reduced intussusception with and without enteroplication. METHODS Medical records of cats presented at our institution with intussusception between 2001 and 2016 were reviewed. The following data were retrieved: signalment; history; physical examination; diagnostic imaging, surgical and histological findings; and outcomes. Animals were grouped as with or without enteroplication. Duration of surgery, survival, complication and recurrence rates, duration of hospitalisation, and short- and long-term outcomes were compared. RESULTS Cats with intussusception presented with unspecific type and duration of clinical signs. Male or male castrated cats and Maine Coons were over-represented in both groups. Enteroplication was performed in 48% (10/21) of the cats. Cats in the enteroplication group were significantly younger than those in the non-enteroplication group ( P = 0.023). Duration of surgery, time of hospitalisation, complication rate and outcomes did not differ between the two groups. Two complications in the short term and one complication in the long term were possibly associated with enteroplication. A recurrence of intussusception was seen in 2/17 cats approximately 12 months after initial surgery, both previously treated with enteroplication. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although the number of cases was limited, our results suggest that enteroplication should be cautiously performed in cats with intussusception as it may be associated with major complications in the short and long term, and its efficacy remains unclear. Based on this study, the need for enteroplication in cats following a correction of intussusception could be questioned.","output":"Enteroplication in cats with intussusception: a retrospective study (2001-2016)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In June 2020, after committing to directing an online, live-streamed production of Colleen Wagners 2009 Down from Heaven for the 7 Towers Theatre Company, I found myself faced with questions I had not faced since directing my first show as an undergraduate (an adaptation of Shakespeares The Winters Tale, arguably an overambitious choice): How do I do this?

METHODS Thirty-seven SSc patients were included. Patients with SSc were allocated into 2 groups as supervised and home exercise. Breathing, aerobic and resistance exercises were performed with a physiotherapist for 12 weeks in the supervised exercise group. Breathing, posture and aerobic exercises were given to the home exercise group as a home program for 12 weeks. All patients were assessed at baseline and 12 weeks later in terms of functional capacity, pulmonary functions, respiratory-peripheral muscle strength, dyspnea severity, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and fatigue level. RESULTS Significant improvements were observed in the functional capacity, measured by 6 minute walking test in the supervised exercise group (before = 376.21  65.50, after = 518.78  75.84 m) and home exercise group (before = 384.44  68.14, after = 432.7  70.8 m; (P < .05). Respiratory-peripheral muscle strength (with the exception of inspiratory muscle strength and upper limb strength in the home exercise group) and HRQoL were significantly increased and fatigue level was significantly decreased in the supervised exercise and home exercise groups (P < .05). However, pulmonary functions and dyspnea severity were significantly improved only in the supervised exercise group (P < .05). The supervised exercise program was found superior to the home exercise program for change in all parameters (P < .05).

The administration of a third dose of mRNA vaccines induces a secondary response with increased protection. We investigated, at single-cell level, the longitudinal evolution of the neutralizing antibody response in four donors after three mRNA doses3. A total of 4,100 spike protein specific memory B cells were single cell sorted and 350 neutralizing antibodies were identified. The third dose increased the antibody neutralization potency and breadth against all SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern as previously observed with hybrid immunity3. However, the B cell repertoire that stands behind the response is dramatically different. The increased neutralizing response was largely due to the expansion of B cell germlines poorly represented after two doses, and the reduction of germlines predominant after primary immunization such as IGHV3-53;IGHJ6-1 and IGHV3-66;IGHJ4-1. Divergently to hybrid immunity, cross-protection after a third dose was mainly guided by Class 1/2 antibodies encoded by IGHV1-58;IGHJ3-1 and IGHV1-69;IGHJ4-1 germlines. The IGHV2-5;IGHJ3-1 germline, which induced broadly cross-reactive Class 3 antibodies after infection or viral vector vaccination, was not induced by a third mRNA dose.

Our aim was to measure current uptake of this delirium screening and introduce measures to improve practice. Method: We retrospectively collected data from medical records of patients on two Geriatric inpatient wards (42 patients) at the Leicester Royal Infirmary, to determine whether appropriate delirium screening was taking place for at-risk patients on admission. We then introduced two PDSA (plan, do, study, act) cycles: 1. teaching at departmental weekly educational meetings with sending electronic communications to all doctors in medicine highlighting importance of delirium screening;and 2. displaying posters on all admissions wards. A third cycle was planned involving visiting wards to raise awareness, however this was interrupted by the COVID pandemic. Results: Initial baseline results showed only 5% (1 of 18) of at-risk patients were fully screened for delirium. Following our first intervention, this increased to 13% (3 of 23). Second intervention involving display of posters led to an increase to 44% (8 of 18) of atrisk patients being screened. Proportions of dementia were comparable across PDSA cycles. Conclusions: Education, raising awareness, and display of reminder posters can improve delirium screening uptake of at-risk patients on admission to medical admission units, despite growing pressures associated with the COVID pandemic.

Relative and absolute values of each electrophoretic fraction were recorded and the number of cats showing single or combined electrophoretic changes consistent with FIP (hypoalbuminaemia, inverted albumin to globulin [A:G] ratio, increased total protein, total globulin, alpha []2-globulin and gamma []-globulin concentration) were counted. Additionally, a visual analysis of electrophoretograms was also performed. Results for the two time periods were statistically compared. Results The details of 91 AGE procedures (41 from cats with FIP and 50 from healthy cats) and 45 CZE procedures (26 from cats with FIP and 19 from healthy cats) were obtained from the database. No significant differences between the two time periods were found both in FIP and in healthy cats analysed with CZE and in healthy cats analysed with AGE.

While group differences were subtle, dyslexic children had significantly higher internal noise estimates for motion discrimination, and higher orientation-coherence thresholds, than typical children.

METHODS: An anonymous Internet-based study was conducted between 23 April and 26 June 2020. During the study period, the country underwent phase 3 and phase 4 of the Movement Control Order (MCO), Conditional Movement Control Order (CMCO), and Recovery Movement Control Order (RMCO). Psychological distress was measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which is a 14-item self-assessment scale for measuring distress (total HADS score; HADS-T) with two subscales, namely, anxiety (HADS-A) and depression (HADS-D). Perceived threat of infection was measured based on the health belief model. RESULTS: From a total of 631 responses received, the proportion of participants with anxiety and depression symptoms (above threshold score of 8 on HADS-A and HADS-D) was 29.0 and 20.9%, respectively. Psychological distress (HADS-T > 16) was reported in 22.3% of the respondents. A total of 16.5% had combined anxiety and depression symptoms. The highest HADS-A (6.10; 95% CI 5.64-6.56), HADS-D (5.61; 95% CI 5.14-6.08), and HADS-T (11.71; 95% CI 10.84-12.58) scores were reported among respondents during phase 4 of the MCO. Partial least square-based structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) revealed that self-perceived health status, perceived susceptibility, and severity of COVID-19 have the greatest effect, leading to higher HADS-A, HADS-D, and HADS-T scores.

RECENT FINDINGS: Initial anatomic descriptions of the facial artery musculocutaneous (FAMM) flap, the supraclavicular artery island flap and the submental artery island flap were published decades ago. Since then, many have proposed modifications to these descriptions to improve technical ease and patient outcomes. Benefits of regional flaps include ease of harvest, comparable outcomes to free tissue microvascular flaps, shorter operative time and hospital length of stay. Drawbacks to regional flaps include limitations to size and reach, partial necrosis, wound dehiscence and surgeon experience. The integrity of the vascular pedicle is also contingent upon vessel preservation during the cancer ablation. SUMMARY: Although a resurgence of regional flaps began well before the COVID-19 pandemic, many institutions began looking for alternatives to free flap reconstruction to conserve healthcare resources and minimize patient hospitalization time in the past year. There has been a revival of regional flaps such as the FAMM, supraclavicular and submental flaps that are valuable reconstructive options for many defects of the head and neck.","output":"Resurgence of regional flaps for head and neck reconstruction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT: Point-of-care testing (POCT) is inherently spatial, that is, performed where needed, and intrinsically temporal, because it accelerates decision making. POCT efficiency and effectiveness have the potential to facilitate antimicrobial resistance (AMR) detection, decrease risks of co-infections for critically ill COVID-19 patients, and improve the cost-effectiveness of healthcare. OBJECTIVES: To assess AMR identification using POCT, describe the United States AMR Diagnostic Challenge, and improve global standards of care for infectious diseases. Data Sources PubMed, WWW, and other sources were searched for papers focusing on AMR and POCT. EndNote X9.1 (Clarivate Analytics) consolidated abstracts, URLs, and PDFs representing ~500 articles assessed for relevance. Panelist insights at Tria?Con 2020 in San Francisco and finalist POC technologies competing for a US $20,000,000 AMR prize are summarized. CONCLUSIONS: Co-infections represent high risks for COVID-19 patients. POCT potentially will help target specific pathogens, refine choices for antimicrobial drugs, and prevent excess morbidity and mortality. POC assays that identify patterns of pathogen resistance can help tell us how infected individuals spread AMR, where geospatial hotspots are located, when delays cause death, and how to deploy preventative resources. Shared AMR data \\"clouds\\" could help reduce critical care burden during pandemics and optimize therapeutic options, similar to use of antibiograms in individual hospitals. Multidisciplinary healthcare personnel should learn the principles and practice of POCT, so they can meet needs with rapid diagnostic testing. The stakes are high. AMR is projected to cause millions of deaths annually and cumulative financial loses in the trillions by 2050.","output":"Geospatial Spread of Antimicrobial Resistance, Bacterial and Fungal Threats to COVID-19 Survival, and Point-of-Care Solutions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly emerging and highly transmissible disease caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Understanding the microbiomes associated with the upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and COVID-19 diseases has clinical interest. We hypothesized that the diversity of microbiome compositions and their genomic features are associated with different pathological conditions of these human respiratory tract diseases (COVID-19 and non-COVID; URTI and COPD). To test this hypothesis, we analyzed 21 whole metagenome sequences (WMS) including eleven COVID-19 (BD = 6 and China = 5), six COPD (UK = 6) and four URTI (USA = 4) samples to unravel the diversity of microbiomes, their genomic features and relevant metabolic functions. The WMS data mapped to 534 bacterial, 60 archaeal and 61 viral genomes with distinct variation in the microbiome composition across the samples (COVID-19>COPD>URTI). Notably, 94.57%, 80.0% and 24.59% bacterial, archaeal and viral genera shared between the COVID-19 and non-COVID samples, respectively, however, the COVID-19 related samples had sole association with 16 viral genera other than SARS-CoV-2. Strain-level virome profiling revealed 660 and 729 strains in COVID-19 and non-COVID sequence data, respectively and of them 34.50% strains shared between the conditions. Functional annotation of metagenomics sequences of thevCOVID-19 and non-COVID groups identified the association of several biochemical pathways related to basic metabolism (amino acid and energy), ABC transporters, membrane transport, replication and repair, clustering-based subsystems, virulence, disease and defense, adhesion, regulation of virulence, programmed cell death, and primary immunodeficiency. We also detected 30 functional gene groups/classes associated with resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds (RATC) in both COVID-19 and non-COVID microbiomes. Furthermore, a predominant higher abundance of cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance (CZCR) and multidrug resistance to efflux pumps (MREP) genes were detected in COVID-19 metagenome. The profiles of microbiome diversity and associated microbial genomic features found in both COVID-19 and non-COVID (COPD and URTI) samples might be helpful for developing the microbiome-based diagnostics and therapeutics for COVID-19 and non-COVID respiratory diseases. However, future studies might be carried out to explore the microbiome dynamics and the cross-talk between host and microbiomes employing larger volume of samples from different ethnic groups and geoclimatic conditions.","output":"Diversity and genomic determinants of the microbiomes associated with COVID-19 and non-COVID respiratory diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Gut microbiota and these microbial-derived products play a critical role in the induction of adaptive immune responses to influenza virus infection. However, the role of nasal bacteria in the induction of the virus-specific adaptive immunity is less clear. Here, we examine whether nasal bacteria critically regulates the generation of influenza virus specific adaptive immune response after infection or intranasal vaccination. Results: : We demonstrated that disruption of nasal bacteria by topical mucosal application of antibiotic enhances the virus-specific antibody responses to influenza virus infection. Although intranasal administration of hemagglutinin (HA) vaccine alone was insufficient to induce the HA-specific antibody responses, disruption of nasal bacteria by lysozyme or addition of culturable oral bacteria from a healthy human volunteer rescued inability of the nasal bacteria to generate antibody responses to intranasally administered split-virus vaccines. Myd88-depdnent signaling in the hematopoietic compartment was required for adjuvant activity of intranasally administered oral bacteria. In addition, we found that the oral bacteria-combined intranasal vaccine induced protective antibody response to influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Taking advantage of the fact that oceanic islands host fewer species than the mainland, we tested whether island birds show an increase in frequency bandwidth of acoustic signals compared to mainland birds. Given the higher animal diversity and more saturated acoustic space in the tropics, we expected acoustic character release, if any, to be stronger in the tropics than in the temperate zone. We field recorded 22 bird species (11 pairs consisting of an endemic island species and its closest mainland relative) breeding at similar latitudes and in similar habitats: 6 tropical pairs (S?o Tom Island / Mount Cameroon), and 5 temperate pairs (Madeira Island / southern France). For each species, we measured the degree of acoustic interference experienced when vocalizing, and the spectral characteristics of its song (minimum and maximum frequencies, bandwidth). As expected, island species spent more time vocalizing alone, and any overlap in vocalizations involved fewer species. The vocalizations of island species spanned broader frequency bandwidths than their mainland counterparts in the tropics (true for all 6 pairs), but this pattern was less evident in the temperate region (2/5 pairs with no marked differences and 1/5 with opposite pattern). Overall, the character release of communication signals only occurred where the differential in number of species was large (tropics).

The aim of this study was to describe the demographic, baseline clinical characteristics and early outcomes of a European cohort of liver transplant recipients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. DESIGN: We conducted an international prospective study across Europe on liver transplant recipients with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by microbiological assay during the first outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. Baseline characteristics, clinical presentation, management of immunosuppressive therapy and outcomes were collected. RESULTS: 57 patients were included (70% male, median (IQR) age at diagnosis 65 (57-70) years). 21 (37%), 32 (56%) and 21 (37%) patients had one cardiovascular disease, arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus, respectively.

We show why policies enacted early or broadly can cause communities to become reassured and therefore unwilling to maintain or adopt actions. Public health policies for which success relies on collective action should therefore exploit the behaviourally receptive phase; the period between the generation of sufficient concern to foster adoption of novel actions and the relaxation of adherence driven by reassurance fostered by avoidance of negative outcomes over time.","output":"Improving pandemic mitigation policies across communities through coupled dynamics of risk perception and infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is assumed to have increased the number of socially isolated older adults.

This study investigated the change in prevalence of social isolation caused by the spread of COVID-19 and examined various associated factors.

Protein acetylation is known to play a crucial role in host response to viral infection. Acetylation of viral proteins encoded by other RNA viruses have been reported to affect viral replication. It is therefore of interest to see whether MERS-CoV proteins are also acetylated. Viral proteins obtained from infected cells were trypsin-digested into peptides. Acetylated peptides were enriched by immunoprecipitation and subject to nano-LC-Orbitrap analysis. Bioinformatic analysis was performed to assess the conservation level of identified acetylation sites and to predict the upstream regulatory factors. A total of 12 acetylation sites were identified from 7 peptides, which all belong to the replicase polyprotein pp1ab. All identified acetylation sites were found to be highly conserved across MERS-CoV sequences in NCBI database. Upstream factors, including deacetylases of the SIRT1 and HDAC families as well as acetyltransferases of the TIP60 family, were predicted to be responsible for regulating the acetylation events identified. Western blotting confirms that acetylation events indeed occur on pp1ab protein by expressing NSP4 in HEK293 cells. Acetylation events on MERS-CoV viral protein pp1ab were identified for the first time, which indicate that MERS-CoV might use the host acetylation machinery to regulate its enzyme activity and to achieve optimal replication.

The aim of this study is to describe how individuals with IDD have been affected in the first 100 days of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. METHODS: Shortly after the first COVID\\\\19 case was reported in the USA, our organisation, which provides continuous support for over 11 000 individuals with IDD, assembled an outbreak committee composed of senior leaders from across the health care organisation. The committee led the development and deployment of a comprehensive COVID\\\\19 prevention and suppression strategy, utilising current evidence\\\\based practice, while surveilling the global and local situation daily. We implemented enhanced infection control procedures across 2400 homes, which were communicated to our employees using multi\\\\faceted channels including an electronic resource library, mobile and web applications, paper postings in locations, live webinars and direct mail. Using custom\\\\built software applications enabling us to track patient, client and employee cases and exposures, we leveraged current public health recommendations to identify cases and to suppress transmission, which included the use of personal protective equipment. A COVID\\\\19 case was defined as a positive nucleic acid test for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 RNA. RESULTS: In the 100\\\\day period between 20 January 2020 and 30 April 2020, we provided continuous support for 11 540 individuals with IDD. Sixty\\\\four per cent of the individuals were in residential, community settings, and 36% were in intermediate care facilities. The average age of the cohort was 46  12 years, and 60% were male. One hundred twenty\\\\two individuals with IDD were placed in quarantine for exhibiting symptoms and signs of acute infection such as fever or cough. Sixty\\\\six individuals tested positive for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2, and their average age was 50. The positive individuals were located in 30 different homes (1.3% of total) across 14 states. Fifteen homes have had single cases, and 15 have had more than one case. Fifteen COVID\\\\19\\\\positive individuals were hospitalised. As of 30 April, seven of the individuals hospitalised have been discharged back to home and are recovering. Five remain hospitalised, with three improving and two remaining in intensive care and on mechanical ventilation. There have been three deaths. We found that among COVID\\\\19\\\\positive individuals with IDD, a higher number of chronic medical conditions and male sex were characteristics associated with a greater likelihood of hospitalisation. CONCLUSIONS: In the first 100 days of the COVID\\\\19 outbreak in the USA, we observed that people with IDD living in congregate care settings can benefit from a coordinated approach to infection control, case identification and cohorting, as evidenced by the low relative case rate reported. Male individuals with higher numbers of chronic medical conditions were more likely to be hospitalised, while most younger, less chronically ill individuals recovered spontaneously at home.","output":"Supporting individuals with intellectual and developmental disability during the first 100 days of the COVID\\\\19 outbreak in the USA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic presents a rare opportunity to assess national performance in responding to a historic crisis. It is not well understood how income inequality might be related to differential disease burden of COVID-19 across countries.

After adjusting for differences in population size, age structure, longevity, population density, GDP per capita, health care expenditures, educational attainment, direct democracy index, stringency of implemented measures, and testing intensity for COVID-19, results from Cox Proportional Hazards regressions revealed that countries with more unequal income distribution carried a higher burden of COVID-19 infections and deaths in 2020. On average, each percentage point increase in the Gini index was associated with an 9% increase in the hazard of having a higher COVID-19 infection rate in the sample (AOR = 1.09, 95% CI 1.01, 1.18). The corresponding associated increase in the hazard of having a higher COVID-19 death rate was 14% (AOR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.06, 1.23).

Modelling results obtained from analytical tool development are essential to understand the ongoing pandemic dynamics with a view to helping the public and policy makers. The pandemic has generated data on a huge number of interesting statistics such as the number of new cases, hospitalisations and deaths in many spatio-temporal resolutions for the analysts to investigate. The multivariate nature of these data sets, along with the inherent spatio-temporal dependencies, poses new challenges for modellers. This article proposes a two-stage hierarchical Bayesian model as a joint bivariate model for the number of cases and deaths observed weekly for the different local authority administrative regions in England. An adaptive model is proposed for the weekly Covid-19 death rates as part of the joint bivariate model. The adaptive model is able to detect possible step changes in death rates in neighbouring areas. The joint model is also used to evaluate the effects of several socio-economic and environmental covariates on the rates of cases and deaths. Inclusion of these covariates points to the presence of a north-south divide in both the case and death rates. Nitrogen dioxide, the only air pollution measure used in the model, is seen to be significantly positively associated with the number cases, even in the presence of the spatio-temporal random effects taking care of spatio-temporal dependencies present in the data. The proposed models provide excellent fits to the observed data and are seen to perform well for predicting the location specific number of deaths a week in advance. The structure of the models is very general and the same framework can be used for modelling other areally aggregated temporal statistics of the pandemics, e.g. the rate of hospitalisation.","output":"Bayesian spatio-temporal joint disease mapping of Covid-19 cases and deaths in local authorities of England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Favipiravir is an antiviral drug, an inhibitor of RNA dependent RNA polymerase that is preliminarily effective against SARS-CoV-2 virus.

The study was organized in 10 clinical centers in Russia. Eligible patients had laboratory confirmed by PCR test infection of SARS-CoV-2 and were aged 18-60 years. Patients were randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) to receive either favipiravir (1800 mg BID on day 1, followed by 800 mg BID for up to 9 days), or standard of care (SOC) treatment (umifenovir + intranasal interferon alpha-2b, or hydroxychloroquine) for up to 10 days. Randomization was performed using a web-response system after stratification by COVID-19 severity, age and CT severity at enrollment. The co-primary outcomes were the time to clinical improvement and the time to viral clearance. An efficacy analysis was performed in intent-to-treat population. The safety population included all participants who received at least one dose of favipiravir or SOC. Findings: Between May 23, 2020, and June 30, 2020, 190 patients were assessed for eligibility, of whom 168 were randomly assigned to receive either favipiravir (n = 112), or SOC (n = 56). The median time to clinical improvement was 6.0 (IQR 40;93) days in favipiravir group and 10.0 (IQR 50;210) days in SOC group;the median difference was 4 days (HR 163;95% CI 114-234, p = 0007).

The rate of clinical improvement on Day 7 in the favipiravir group was 1.5-fold higher compared to SOC: 527% vs. 358% (RR 150;95% CI 102-222;p = 0020). Favipiravir was well tolerated: most of the adverse events (AE) were mild. Any AEs were reported in 741% of patients in the favipiravir group vs. 600% in the SOC group. Among the most common adverse reactions was asymptomatic hyperuricemia, transient elevation of ALT & AST, and gastrointestinal disorders (diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain).Interpretation: Favipiravir was superior to SOC in shortening the time to clinical improvement in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.Trial Registration: The trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT04501783.Funding: Funded by R-Pharm Group of CompaniesDeclaration of Interests: ENK, MYS, MVN, VAR, AVZ, and OVF were employees of R-Pharm Group of Companies during the study and received compensation as part of their employment.

Specific, highly effective therapeutics and vaccines against the MERS-CoV are urgently needed to save human lives and address the pandemic concerns. We identified three human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), m336, m337, and m338, targeting the receptor (CD26/DPP4) binding domain (RBD) of the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein from a very large na?ve-antibody library (containing 10(11) antibodies). They bound with high affinity: equilibrium dissociation constants for the three MAbs were equal to 4.2, 9.3, and 15 nM, respectively, as measured by Biacore for Fabs binding to RBD. The avidity for IgG1 m336, m337, and m338 was even higher: 99, 820, and 560 pM, respectively. The antibodies bound to overlapping epitopes that overlap the receptor binding site on the RBD as suggested by competition experiments and further supported by site-directed mutagenesis of the RBD and a docking model of the m336-RBD complex. The highest-affinity MAb, m336, neutralized both pseudotyped and live MERS-CoV with exceptional potency, 50% neutralization at 0.005 and 0.07 g/ml, respectively, likely by competing with DPP4 for binding to the S glycoprotein. The exceptionally high neutralization activity of these antibodies and especially m336 suggests that they have great potential for prophylaxis and therapy of MERS-CoV infection in humans and as a tool for development of vaccine immunogens. The rapid identification (within several weeks) of potent MAbs suggests a possibility to use the new large antibody library and related methodology for a quick response to the public threat resulting from emerging coronaviruses. Importance: A novel human coronavirus, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was found to infect humans with a high mortality rate in 2012, just 1 decade after the appearance of the first highly pathogenic coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). There are no effective therapeutics available. It is highly desirable to find an approach for rapidly developing potent therapeutics against MERS-CoV, which not only can be implemented for MERS treatment but also can help to develop a platform strategy to combat future emerging coronaviruses. We report here the identification of human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) from a large nonimmune antibody library that target MERS-CoV. One of the antibodies, m336, neutralized the virus with exceptional potency. It therefore may have great potential as a candidate therapeutic and as a reagent to facilitate the development of vaccines against MERS-CoV.","output":"Exceptionally potent neutralization of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus by human monoclonal antibodies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and aims One of the comorbidities associated with severe outcome and mortality of COVID-19 is dyslipidemia.

Our meta-analysis showed that statin use did not improve the composite poor outcomes of COVID-19 [OR 1.08 (95% CI 0.86 C 1.35), p = 0.50, I 2 = 98%, random-effect modelling]. Meta-regression showed that the association with composite poor outcomes of COVID-19 was influenced by age (p = 0.010), gender (p = 0.045), and cardiovascular disease (p = 0.012). Subgroup analysis showed that the association was weaker in studies with median age 60 years-old (OR 0.94) compared to <60 years-old (OR 1.43), and in the prevalence of cardiovascular disease 25% (RR 0.94) compared to <25% (RR 1.24). Conclusion Statin use did not improve the composite poor outcomes of COVID-19. Patients with dyslipidemia should continue taking statin drugs despite COVID-19 infection status, given its beneficial effects on cardiovascular outcomes.","output":"Statin and outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): A systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Muslim and Christian minority communities in Sri Lanka, as a matter of religious ruling and practice, bury their dead. Having initially permitted cremation or burial, the Sri Lankan Ministry of Health issued fresh Regulations purportedly under section 2 and 3 of the Quarantine and Prevention of Diseases Ordinance No: 3 of 1987 making it mandatory to cremate bodies of COVID-19 victims irrespective of their faith.

In this paper, we present the protocol for two systematic reviews of parameters for estimating the number of deaths and disability-adjusted life years from stroke attributable to exposure to long working hours, to inform the development of the WHO/ILO joint methodology. OBJECTIVES We aim to systematically review studies on occupational exposure to long working hours (called Systematic Review 1 in the protocol) and systematically review and meta-analyse estimates of the effect of long working hours on stroke (called Systematic Review 2), applying the Navigation Guide systematic review methodology as an organizing framework, conducting both systematic reviews in tandem and in a harmonized way. DATA SOURCES Separately for Systematic Reviews 1 and 2, we will search electronic academic databases for potentially relevant records from published and unpublished studies, including Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, CISDOC and PsychINFO. We will also search electronic grey literature databases, Internet search engines and organizational websites; hand-search reference list of previous systematic reviews and included study records; and consult additional experts. STUDY ELIGIBILITY AND CRITERIA We will include working-age (15 years) workers in the formal and informal economy in any WHO and/or ILO Member State, but exclude children (<15 years) and unpaid domestic workers. For Systematic Review 1, we will include quantitative prevalence studies of relevant levels of occupational exposure to long working hours (i.e. 35-40, 41-48, 49-54 and 55 h/week) stratified by country, sex, age and industrial sector or occupation, in the years 2005-2018. For Systematic Review 2, we will include randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies and other non-randomized intervention studies with an estimate of the relative effect of a relevant level of long working hours on the incidence of or mortality due to stroke, compared with the theoretical minimum risk exposure level (i.e. 35-40 h/week). STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS At least two review authors will independently screen titles and abstracts against the eligibility criteria at a first stage and full texts of potentially eligible records at a second stage, followed by extraction of data from qualifying studies. At least two review authors will assess risk of bias and the quality of evidence, using the most suited tools currently available. For Systematic Review 2, if feasible, we will combine relative risks using meta-analysis. We will report results using the guidelines for accurate and transparent health estimates reporting (GATHER) for Systematic Review 1 and the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines (PRISMA) for Systematic Review 2.

One strategy for combating the rising number of overdoses is through opioid overdose prevention programs (OOPPs). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of an innovative OOPP, with changes in knowledge and attitudes serving as the primary outcome measures. METHODS: The OOPP was developed by a group of medical students under guidance from faculty advisors. Training sessions focused on understanding stigmatizing factors of opioid use disorder (OUD), as well as protocols for opioid overdose reversal through naloxone administration. Pre- and post-surveys were partially adapted from the opioid overdose attitudes and knowledge scales and administered to all participants. Paired t-tests were conducted to assess differences between pre- and post-surveys. RESULTS: A total of 440 individuals participated in the training; 381 completed all or the majority of the survey. Participants came from a diverse set of backgrounds, ages, and experiences. All three knowledge questions showed significant improvements. For attitude questions, significant improvements were found in all three questions evaluating confidence, two of three questions assessing attitudes towards overdose reversal, and four of five questions evaluating stigma and attitudes towards individuals with OUD. CONCLUSIONS: Our innovative OOPP was effective not only in increasing knowledge but also in improving attitudes towards overdose reversal and reducing stigma towards individuals with OUD. Given the strong improvements in attitudes towards those with OUD, efforts should be made to incorporate the unique focus on biopsychosocial and sociohistorical components into future OOPPs.

We analyzed medical records of all patients aged of 75 and older with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 hospitalized in our Hospital between March 3 and April 25, 2020. Standardized variables were prospectively collected, and standardized care were provided to all patients. One hundred and eighty-six patients were included (mean 85.3  5.78 year). The all cause 30-day mortality was 30% (56/186). At admission, dead patients were more dyspneic (57% vs. 38%, p = .014), had more often an oxygen saturation less than 94% (70% vs. 47%, p < .01) and had more often a heart rate faster than 90/min (70% vs. 42%, p < .001). Mortality increased in parallel with CFS score (p = .051) (20 deaths (36%) in 7-9 category). In multivariate analysis, CFS score (odds ratio [OR] = 1.49; confidence interval [CI] 95%, 1.01-2.19; p = .046), age (OR = 1.15; CI 95%, 1.01-1.31; p = .034), and dyspnea (OR = 5.37; CI 95%, 1.33-21.68; p = .018) were associated with all-cause 30-day mortality.

METHODS: In this prospective, observational study, 108 non-hospitalized patients with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection not requiring intensive care were asked using a standardized questionnaire regarding disease associated ocular symptoms, demographic data, as well as general physical and nasal symptoms. Total ocular symptom score (TOSS) was evaluated during and retrospectively prior to coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) infection. Associations between TOSS and demographic data as well as general and nasal symptoms were evaluated. RESULTS: 75 out of the 108 COVID-19 patients (69.4 %) suffered from at least one ocular symptom during COVID-19. The most common symptoms included burning sensations in 36.1% (n=39), epiphora in 34.3% (n=37), and redness in 25.9% (n=28), compatible with conjunctivitis. These symptoms occurred 1.96  3.17 days after the beginning of COVID-19 and were rather mild. TOSS was significantly higher during COVID-19 (1.271.85) than prior to the infection (0.331.04; p<0.001). There were no significant associations between TOSS and gender (beta coefficient: -0.108; p=0.302), age (-0.024; p=0.816), rhinorrhea (-0.127; p=0.353), nasal itching (-0.026; p=0.803), sneezing (0.099; p=0.470), nasal congestion (-0.012; p=0.930), cough (-0.079; p=0.450), headache (0.102; p=0.325), sore throat (0.208; p=0.052), or fever (0.094; p=0.361). CONCLUSIONS: Ocular involvement in European non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19 seems to be highly underestimated.

Design/methodology/approach: The discussion is theoretically grounded on Luhmanns concept of moral communication combined with the key assumption of critical discourse analysis that language reflects a position of power of social actors. Based on these premises, the analysis of a sample of articles in a chosen online media was conducted to uncover the moral codes in the public debate concerning the corona outbreak and connect them with specific moral discourses of particular social actors. Findings: The findings clearly indicate that the communication about the pandemic is considerably imbued with moralization and that moral coding is profoundly used to generate preferred types of behaviour of citizens and their compliance with the imposed epidemiologic measures. In conclusion, Luhmanns claim of moralization as a contentious form of communication is confirmed as the examined public discussion fosters confrontations and generates disruptions rather than contributing to a productive dialogue among diverse social actors.

ResultsIn the first step of our study we identified, through a gene expression analysis, several drugs that could act on the biological pathways altered in COVID-19. In the second step, we performed a docking simulation in order to test the properties of the identified drugs to target the 3CL main protease of SARS-CoV-2. The drugs that showed higher binding affinity are bardoxolone (-8.78 kcal/ mol), Irinotecan (-8.40 kcal/mol) and Pyrotinib (-8.40 kcal/mol). Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out on the three selected drugs to validate the stability and interactions of the complexes.

Antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) that can be used at the point of care have the potential to increase access to COVID-19 testing, particularly in settings with limited laboratory capacity. This systematic review synthesized literature on specific use cases and performance of Ag-RDTs for detecting SARS-CoV-2, for the first comprehensive assessment of Ag-RDT use in real-world settings. MethodsWe searched three databases (PubMed, EMBASE and medRxiv) up to 12 April 2021 for publications on Ag-RDT use for large-scale screening, irrespective of symptoms, and surveillance of COVID-19, excluding studies of only presumptive COVID-19 patients. We tabulated data on the study setting, populations, type of test, diagnostic performance and operational findings. We assessed risk of bias using QUADAS-2 and an adapted tool for prevalence studies. ResultsFrom 4313 citations, 39 studies conducted in asymptomatic and symptomatic adults were included. Study sample sizes varied from 40 to >5 million. Of 39 studies, 37 (94.9%) investigated lateral flow Ag-RDTs and two (5.1%) investigated multiplex sandwich chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay Ag-RDTs. Six categories of testing (screening/surveillance) initiatives were identified: mass screening (n=13), targeted screening (n=11), healthcare entry testing (n=6), at-home testing (n=4), surveillance (n=4) and prevalence survey (n=1). Across studies, Ag-RDT sensitivity varied from 40% to 100%. Ag-RDTs were noted as convenient, easy-to-use and low cost, with a rapid turnaround time and high user acceptability. Risk of bias was generally low or unclear across the studies. ConclusionThis systematic review demonstrates the use of Ag-RDTs across a wide range of real-world settings for screening and surveillance of COVID-19 in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals.

The main purpose of this study is to provide a basis for policy advice on border restrictions and control measures in response to outbreaks that may occur during the vaccination roll-out. The model can be used to estimate the theoretical population immunity threshold, which represents a point in the vaccine rollout at which border restrictions and other controls could be removed and only small, occasional outbreaks would take place. We find that, with a basic reproduction number of 6, approximately representing the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, and under baseline vaccine effectiveness assumptions, reaching the population immunity threshold would require close to 100% of the total population to be vaccinated. Since this coverage is not likely to be achievable in practice, relaxing controls completely would risk serious health impacts. However, the higher vaccine coverage is, the more collective protection the population has against adverse health outcomes from COVID-19, and the easier it will become to control outbreaks. There remains considerable uncertainty in model outputs, in part because of the potential for the evolution of new variants. If new variants arise that are more transmissible or vaccine resistant, an increase in vaccine coverage will be needed to provide the same level of protection.","output":"A COVID-19 vaccination model for Aotearoa New Zealand"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Male and female mice with a dominant severe bone fragility disorder, osteogenesis imperfecta, and their wild-type littermates (FVB background) were challenged with a long-term (26 weeks) high-fat diet to evaluate the development of obesity and glucose intolerance.

The significance of this finding is unclear and, in most patients, does not represent active infection. Detection of subgenomic RNA has been proposed to represent productive infection and may be a useful marker for monitoring infectivity. METHODS: We used RT-qPCR to quantify total and subgenomic nucleocapsid (sgN) and envelope (sgE) transcripts in 185 SARS-CoV-2 positive nasopharyngeal swab samples collected on hospital admission and to relate to symptom duration. RESULTS: We find that all transcripts decline at the same rate; however, sgE becomes undetectable before other transcripts. The median duration of symptoms to a negative test is 14 days for sgE and 25 days for sgN. There is a linear decline in subgenomic compared to total RNA suggesting subgenomic transcript copy number is dependent on copy number of total transcripts. The mean difference between total and sgN is 16-fold and the mean difference between total and sgE is 137-fold. This relationship is constant over duration of symptoms allowing prediction of subgenomic copy number from total copy number. CONCLUSIONS: Subgenomic RNA may be no more useful in determining infectivity than a copy number threshold determined for total RNA.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Total and Subgenomic RNA Viral Load in Hospitalized Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a serious health concern worldwide for almost a year.

This study implied spearmans correlation to see the correlation between daily COVID-19 cases and different air pollutants and meteorological variables. Besides, multiple linear regression and the Generalized Additive Model (GAM) were used to investigate the association between COVID-19 cases and other variables used in this study. Due to lockdown measures, significant differences between PM2.5, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3 in 2019 and 2020 were observed in Dhaka city. We used lag-0, lag-7, lag-14, and lag-21 days on daily COVID-19 cases to look at the lag effect of different air pollutants and meteorology. The LRM results showed that the daily COVID-19 cases are significantly correlated with relative humidity (lag-0 days) and pressure (lag-14 days) (p &lt; 0.05).

RNA synthesis essentially can be initiated by two different mechanisms, de novo initiation and primer-dependent initiation. Most viral RdRps have been identified solely on the basis of comparative sequence analysis, and for many viruses the mechanism of initiation is unknown. In this study, using the family prototype equine arteritis virus (EAV), we address the mechanism of initiation of RNA synthesis in arteriviruses. The RdRp domains of the members of the arterivirus family, which are part of replicase subunit nsp9, were compared to coronavirus RdRps that belong to the same order of Nidovirales, as well as to other RdRps with known initiation mechanisms and three-dimensional structures. We report here the first successful expression and purification of an arterivirus RdRp that is catalytically active in the absence of other viral or cellular proteins. The EAV nsp9/RdRp initiates RNA synthesis by a de novo mechanism on homopolymeric templates in a template-specific manner. In addition, the requirements for initiation of RNA synthesis from the 3' end of the viral genome were studied in vivo using a reverse genetics approach. These studies suggest that the 3'-terminal nucleotides of the EAV genome play a critical role in viral RNA synthesis.","output":"De novo initiation of RNA synthesis by the arterivirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nursing homes are high-risk settings for outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1,2). During the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. health departments worked to improve infection prevention and control (IPC) practices in nursing homes to prevent outbreaks and limit the spread of COVID-19 in affected facilities; however, limited resources have hampered health departments' ability to rapidly provide IPC support to all nursing homes within their jurisdictions. Since 2008, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has published health inspection results and quality ratings based on their Five-Star Quality Rating System for all CMS-certified nursing homes (3); these ratings might be associated with facility-level risk factors for COVID-19 outbreaks. On April 17, 2020, West Virginia became the first state to mandate and conduct COVID-19 testing for all nursing home residents and staff members to identify and reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in these settings (4). West Virginia's census of nursing home outbreaks was used to examine associations between CMS star ratings and COVID-19 outbreaks. Outbreaks, defined as two or more cases within 14 days (with at least one resident case), were identified in 14 (11%) of 123 nursing homes. Compared with 1-star-rated (lowest rated) nursing homes, the odds of a COVID-19 outbreak were 87% lower among 2- to 3-star-rated facilities (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.03-0.54) and 94% lower among 4- to 5-star-rated facilities (aOR = 0.06, 95% CI = 0.006-0.39). Health departments could use star ratings to help identify priority nursing homes in their jurisdictions to inform the allocation of IPC resources. Efforts to mitigate outbreaks in high-risk nursing homes are necessary to reduce overall COVID-19 mortality and associated disparities. Moreover, such efforts should incorporate activities to improve the overall quality of life and care of nursing home residents and staff members and address the social and health inequities that have been recognized as a prominent feature of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States (5).","output":"Association Between CMS Quality Ratings and COVID-19 Outbreaks in Nursing Homes  West Virginia, March 17CJune 11, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective The primary objective of the present study is to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the prevalence of burnout syndrome among residents in orthopedic surgery.

Method In the present cross-sectional study, graduating orthopedic residents were evaluated before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Medical students formed a control group. The participants answered a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Maslach Burnout Inventory, and the Brazilian validated version of the 36-item short-form health survey questionnaire (SF-36). Fifty-two residents were appraised before the pandemic and 19 during the pandemic. Results Forty-four (84.6%) residents fulfilled the criteria for burnout syndrome, and the severe form of the syndrome was present in 16 (30.7%). There was no significant change in the evaluated scores after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. There was also no increase in the prevalence of burnout syndrome or of the severe form of the syndrome. A negative correlation was observed between SF-36 items and the development of the severe form of burnout syndrome.

The 22-items questionnaire was designed to acquire information from adults with epilepsy living in Croatia on demographic data, cognitive, emotional and behavioral responses to the pandemic, and communication problems between patients and their neurologists during the lockdown. Perceived anxiety and fears were expressed with the Likert scale (1-5) and the results of specific fears added to make the Total Fear Score. Results: Out of 186 respondents in total, only 2.8% did not comply with the lockdown measures, and all of those respondents stated that they did not feel any anxiety related to COVID-19. A canceled neurologist examination during the lockdown was significantly associated with pandemic-related anxiety (2.9a?a?1.28 vs. 2.3a?a?1.19, Ua?=a?3039, pa?=a?0.001) and fears (Total Fear Score 31.4a?a?9.70 vs. 28.4a?a?9.79, Ua?=a?3341, pa?=a?0.036), and 87.4% of respondents expressed the wish to communicate with their neurologist, either by phone/video call (53.0%) or email (34.4%).

METHODS: Fifty-three discharged COVID-19 patients were enrolled at Beijing YouAn Hospital, Capital Medical University, between January 21 and March 10, 2020. Spearman correlation analysis was performed between CT scores and laboratory indicators. Patients were divided into the Wuhan group (lived in or with travel to Wuhan, numbering 30 cases) and non-Wuhan group (close contacts or unknown exposure, totaling 23 cases). The CT and laboratory findings were compared between and within groups during the clinical process. RESULTS: Fever (88.7%), cough (64.2%), fatigue (34%), and abnormal laboratory indicators, including lymphopenia, reduced albumin, albumin/globulin (A/G), and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), were mainly observed. Subpleural ground-glass opacities (86.8%) were usually detected at admission. The CT scores were highly correlated with lymphocytes, CRP, albumin, and A/G at initial and follow-ups (all p < 0.05). Four days after admission, most patients (66.7% Wuhan, 47.8% non-Wuhan) showed progression, and the CT scores of Wuhan significantly increased (p = 0.015). Eight days after admission, the vast majority of patients (69.2% Wuhan, 100% non-Wuhan, p = 0.006) presented improvement, and the CT scores of non-Wuhan were significantly lower than Wuhan (p = 0.006). Pneumonia was completely absorbed in most patients 2-4 weeks after discharge. CONCLUSIONS: CT plays a crucial role in the early diagnosis and monitoring of changes in COVID-19. Lymphocytes, CRP, albumin, and A/G are expected to predict disease severity and prognosis. Viral pathogenicity in non-endemic areas may be weaker than core-infected areas.

The second group included dogs that shared households with confirmed COVID-19 cases in humans. This study group numbered 78 dogs. In COVID-19 infected households, 43.9% tested ELISA positive, and neutralising antibodies were detected in 25.64% of dogs.

Epithelial cells are central to the pathogenesis of multiple lung diseases. In chronic diseases, increasing age is a principle risk factor. In acute diseases, such as COVID-19, children suffer less severe symptoms than adults and have a lower rate of mortality. Few studies have explored differences between airway epithelial cells in children and adults to explain this age dependent variation in diseases. Here, we perform bulk RNA sequencing studies in laser-capture microdissected whole epithelium, FACS-sorted basal cells and cultured basal cells, as well as in vitro cell proliferation experiments, to address the intrinsic molecular differences between paediatric and adult airway basal cells.

The mean eBC mass concentration was observed before lockdown (01stC24th March 2020) and during the lockdown (25th MarchC30th June 2020) period and was about 1.74  0.36 and 1.11  0.14 g mC3, respectively. The sharp decrease (~35%) of eBC mass concentration observed during the lockdown (LD) period as compared with before lockdown (BLD) period, was mainly due to the reduction of anthropogenic activities and meteorology. Furthermore, during the entire LD period, the net composite forcing at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) and at the surface (SUR) varied from C4.52 to C6.19 WmC2 and C22.91 to C29.35 WmC2, respectively, whereas the net forcing in the atmosphere (ATM) varied from 17.27 to 23.16 WmC2 . Interestingly, the amount of energy trapped in the atmosphere due to eBC is 11.19 WmC2 before LD and 8.56 WmC2 during LD. It is concluded that eBC contributes almost 43C50% to the composite forcing.

Methods Two hundred and seventy-three patients with unresectable stage III or metastatic melanoma were recruited from February 2020 to November 2021, and completed the Fear of Progression Questionnaire-Short Form (FoP-Q-SF), State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-6), and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Results One hundred and seventy-four (64.7%) patients experienced heighted FoP (FoP-Q-SF: 39.9  11.0), 198 (72.5%) patients reported elevated anxiety (STAI-6: 13.1  3.0), and 62 (22.7%) patients had increased depression (PHQ-9: 6.4  6.1). In multivariate analysis, illness duration (OR = 0.987 for FoP;OR = 0.984 for depression), cancer stage (OR = 14.394 for anxiety) and disease progression (OR = 1.960 for FoP;OR = 23.235 for anxiety;OR = 1.930 for depression) were independent predictors for FoP, anxiety or depression. Additionally, the high levels of FoP, anxiety and depression were significantly positive correlated with each other (r = 0.466 for FoP and anxiety;r = 0.382 for FoP and depression;r = 0.309 for anxiety and depression). Conclusion Our study indicates that FoP, anxiety and depression are persisting among patients with advanced melanoma in the COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 era. Effective psycho-oncological interventions are needed for melanoma patients with psychological distress during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Fear of Progression, Anxiety, and Depression in Patients With Advanced Melanoma in the COVID-19 and Post-COVID-19 Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In an effort to expedite the publication of articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, AJHP is posting these manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance.

In this study, we report the oncologic safety results of EABS compared with CBS. METHODS: Patients underwent EABS for breast cancer during the period June 2010 to March 2020 were collected from the EABS database from single institute, and another cohort of patients, who received CBS, were identified to determine the effectiveness and oncologic safety of EABS. A case-control study was conducted using propensity score matching (PSM) to prevent bias from cases selection. RESULTS: A total of 3426 patients were enrolled in the current study, including 405 patients receiving EABS and 3021 underwent CBS. Before PSM, patients selected for EABS tend to be smaller in tumor size, node negative, early stage, low histologic grade, and HER-2 negative. After PSM, 343 patients underwent EABS were compared with another 343 patients received CBS. The margin involved rate in EABS group is 2.6%, and 5.6% in CBS group (p = 0.054) after PSM. In breast conserving cases, the margin involved rates were 2% in EABS group, and 7.2% in CBS group (p = 0.04). In Kaplan-Meier survival curves analysis, there was no difference in local regional recurrence (p = 0.89), distant metastasis (p = 0.08), and overall survival (p = 0.14). CONCLUSION: The preliminary oncologic safety analysis from current study showed EABS is a safe procedure and results in low margin involved rate, and no increase of locoregional recurrence, distant metastasis or mortality compared with CBS.","output":"Oncologic Outcome of Endoscopic Assisted Breast Surgery Compared with Conventional Approach in Breast Cancer: An Analysis of 3426 Primary Operable Breast Cancer Patients from Single Institute with and Without Propensity Score Matching"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with haemoglobin disorders, particularly -thalassaemia or sickle cell disease (SCD) or combined forms, on account of their underlying disease pathology and associated (iron load mainly in the case of thalassaemia) co-morbidities are defined as high-risk individuals prone to develop more severe complications from coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).

DESIGN, SETTING: Prospective, observational cohort study in 77 ICUs across Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to participating ICUs with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 during 27 February - 30 June 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: ICU mortality and resource use (ICU length of stay, peak bed occupancy). RESULTS: The median age of the 204 patients with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care was 63.5 years (IQR, 53-72 years); 140 were men (69%). The most frequent comorbid conditions were obesity (40% of patients), diabetes (28%), hypertension treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (24%), and chronic cardiac disease (20%); 73 patients (36%) reported no comorbidity. The most frequent source of infection was overseas travel (114 patients, 56%). Median peak ICU bed occupancy was 14% (IQR, 9-16%). Invasive ventilation was provided for 119 patients (58%). Median length of ICU stay was greater for invasively ventilated patients than for non-ventilated patients (16 days; IQR, 9-28 days v 3 days; IQR, 2-5 days), as was ICU mortality (26 deaths, 22%; 95% CI, 15-31% v four deaths, 5%; 95% CI, 1-12%).

Although telepsychotherapy is new to many clinical psychologists, there is considerable research on telepsychotherapy treatments. Nearly 2 decades of clinical research on telepsychotherapy treatments with children with neurological conditions has the potential to inform emerging clinical practice in the age of COVID-19. Toward that end, we synthesized findings from 14 clinical trials of telepsychotherapy problem-solving and parent-training interventions involving more than 800 children and families with diverse diagnoses, including traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, brain tumors, congenital heart disease, and perinatal stroke. We summarize efficacy across studies and clinical populations and report feasibility and acceptability data from the perspectives of parents, children, and psychotherapists. We describe adaptation for international contexts and strategies for troubleshooting technological challenges and working with families of varying socioeconomic strata. The extensive research literature reviewed and synthesized provides considerable support for the utility of telepsychotherapy with children with neurological conditions and their families and underscores its high level of acceptability with both diverse clinical populations and providers. During this period of heightened vulnerability and stress and reduced access to usual supports and services, telepsychotherapy approaches such as online family problem-solving treatment and online parenting skills training may allow psychologists to deliver traditional evidence-based treatments virtually while preserving fidelity and efficacy.","output":"Telepsychotherapy with children and families: Lessons gleaned from two decades of translational research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Olfactory neurons connect the external environment and the brain, allowing the translocation of materials from the nasal cavity into the brain. The olfactory system is involved in SARS-CoV-2 infections; early in the pandemic declared in 2020, a loss of the sense of smell was found in many infected patients. Attention has also been focused on the role that the olfactory epithelium appears to play in the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the brain. Specifically, SARS-CoV-2 enters cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 protein (ACE2), which is found on supporting cells in the olfactory epithelium. The intranasal administration of sphingosine has been proposed to prevent the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2. Further, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptors appear to facilitate the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the brain. The goal of these studies was to characterize S1P receptor expression status in rodent olfactory mucosa. The expression of receptors for a related sphingolipid, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), was also assessed. The results confirm previous reports of S1P1 and S1P3 receptor expression, as well as LPA receptor 1, in mouse olfactory mucosa; moreover, they extend the previous findings to identify additional S1P and LPA receptor transcripts in rat and mouse olfactory mucosa, as well as in cultured olfactory neurons. These findings may enhance the utility of rodent models in identifying agonists and/or antagonists of S1P and LPA receptors that may block the entry of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses into nasal epithelial cells, and prevent transmission from the nasal cavity into the brain.","output":"An Update on Sphingosine-1-Phosphate and Lysophosphatidic Acid Receptor Transcripts in Rodent Olfactory Mucosa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Despite the wide usage of World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule II (WHODAS 2.0) in psychiatry research and clinical practice, there was limited knowledge on its proxy reliability among people with mental disorders. This paper aimed to compare the 12-item WHODAS 2.0 responses of adult patients with mental disorders to their family caregivers. METHODS In this study, 205 pairs of patients with mental disorders and primary family caregivers were consecutively recruited from one inpatient mental health department in a large hospital in China. All participants completed the 12-item version WHODAS 2.0 to assess patients' functioning in the 30 days prior to the hospitalization. Measurement invariance, including configural, metric and scalar invariance, was tested across patient and proxy groups, using multi-group confirmatory factor analysis. Agreement between patients and proxies was examined by paired Wilcoxon tests and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Subgroup analyses for proxy reliability were conducted within strata of proxy kinship and patient psychiatric diagnosis. RESULTS The 12-item WHODAS 2.0 achieved configural, metric and partial scalar invariance across patient and proxy groups. Unsatisfactory consistency was found for most items (ICC < 0.75, P < 0.05), especially for items on Cognition, Getting along, Life activities, and Participation in society (ICC < 0.4, P < 0.05). Spouses agreed with patients more often than parents (ICC  0.4, P < 0.05). The paired Wilcoxon tests found that impairment of patients with psychotic disorders tended to be overestimated by proxies while proxies tended to underestimate impairment of patients with mood disorders. CONCLUSION Our study reveals inconsistency between self and proxy reports in the 12-item WHODAS 2.0 among adult patients with mental disorders. When proxy reports is needed, spouses are preferred than parents. We should be aware of proxies' impairment overestimation among patients with psychotic disorders and underestimation among patients with mood disorders.","output":"Proxy reliability of the 12-item world health organization disability assessment schedule II among adult patients with mental disorders."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has produced a global health calamity that has a profound impact on the way of perceiving the world and everyday lives.

The most popular strategy for the production of inactivated vaccines is based on monkey-derived Vero cells, which results in high productivity of the virus but has a certain carcinogenic risk due to non-human DNA contamination. Since human diploid cells, such as MRC-5 cells, can produce a safer vaccine, efforts to develop a strategy for inactivated vaccine production using these cells have been investigated using MRC-5 cells. However, most viruses do not replicate efficiently in MRC-5 cells. In this study, we found that rabies virus (RABV) infection activated a robust interferon (IFN)- response in MRC-5 cells but almost none in Vero cells, suggesting that the IFN response could be a key limiting factor for virus production. Treatment of the MRC-5 cells with IFN inhibitors increased RABV titers by 10-fold. Additionally, the RABV titer yield was improved five-fold when using IFN receptor 1 (IFNAR1) antibodies. As such, we established a stable IFNAR1-deficient MRC-5 cell line (MRC-5(IFNAR1?)), which increased RABV production by 6.5-fold compared to normal MRC-5 cells. Furthermore, in a pilot-scale production in 1500 square centimeter spinner flasks, utilization of the MRC-5(IFNAR1?) cell line or the addition of IFN inhibitors to MRC cells increased RABV production by 10-fold or four-fold, respectively. Thus, we successfully established a human diploid cell-based pilot scale virus production platform via inhibition of IFN response for rabies vaccines, which could also be used for other inactivated virus vaccine production.","output":"Interferon Inhibition Enhances the Pilot-Scale Production of Rabies Virus in Human Diploid MRC-5 Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The diagnosis and timely treatment of cancer patients should not be compromised during an infectious disease pandemic.

In this wave, 1 second trimester miscarriage and 6 stillbirths were observed in the Irish population due to placental insufficiency as a result of SARS-CoV-2 placentitis. This observation was at odds with the country's previous experience with COVID-19 disease in pregnant mothers. OBJECTIVE - To describe the clinical and pathological features of these pregnancy losses. DESIGN - Retrospective review of clinical and pathological data of cases of second trimester miscarriage, stillbirth or neonatal death identified by perinatal pathologists as being due to SARS-CoV-2 placentitis during the third wave of COVID-19 in Ireland. RESULTS - Clinical and pathological data was available for review in 6 pregnancies. Sequencing or genotyping of the virus identified SARS-CoV-2 Alpha (B.1.1.7) in all cases. Three of the 6 cases had maternal thrombocytopenia, while fetal growth restriction was not prominent suggesting a rapidly progressive placental disease. CONCLUSIONS - The identification of SARS-CoV-2 Alpha in all these cases suggests that the emergence of the variant was associated with an increased risk of fetal death due to SARSCoV-2 placentitis when compared to the original virus. Maternal thrombocytopenia, may have potential as a clinical marker of placentitis but other inflammatory markers need investigation.

However, whether a non-invasive transcutaneous auricular VNS (taVNS) modulates the inflammation levels via altering the parameter of taVNS is poorly understood. This study aimed to determine the differential inhibitory effects of taVNS on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced systemic inflammation using electrical stimulation parameters such as pulse frequency and time. The taVNS-promoted CAP activity significantly recovered LPS-induced tissue injuries (lung, spleen, and intestine) and decreased inflammatory cytokine levels and tissue-infiltrated immune cells. Interestingly, the anti-inflammatory capacity of taVNS with 15 Hz was much higher than that of taVNS with 25 Hz. When a cytokine array was used to investigate the changes of inflammation and immune response-related cytokines/chemokines expression in taVNS with 15 Hz or 25 Hz treatment in LPS-induced endotoxemia in mice, most of the expression of cytokines/chemokines associated with pro-inflammation was severely decreased in taVNS with 15 Hz compared to 25 Hz. This study demonstrated that the taVNS parameter could differentially modulate the inflammation levels of animals, suggesting the importance of taVNS parameter selection for use in feasible interventions for acute inflammation treatment.","output":"Different Transcutaneous Auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation Parameters Modulate the Anti-Inflammatory Effects on Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Acute Inflammation in Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The prevention and control of novel coronavirus pneumonia is the most priority recently, and various measures during the prevention and control period will have varying degrees of impact on the implement of clinical trials.However, various examinations in ophthalmological clinical trials need close contact between operators and patients, which put us at risk of cross-infection.This paper indicated some suggestions based on the criteria of clinical trials under major public health emergencies, the management of clinical trials during epidemic period, including the follow-up of subjects, the treatment of epidemic serious adverse event (SAE) and the management requirements of co-sponsors, as well as the requirements and management principles for environment, subjects, examiners and inspection equipment in the process of ophthalmic clinical trials.It may be helpful to the ophthalmic clinical trial researchers and subjects during the period of novel coronavirus infection.","output":"Key points of serious adverse event and protection of patients in ophthalmic clinical trials during novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak/ ͹״׷ڼۿٴ̹÷Ҫ"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: to investigate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy in Senegal.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A multiwave longitudinal cohort study was conducted using data from the 2006 to 2014 waves of the Health and Retirement Study in a national cohort study setting. The data comprise 26 509 person-years observations from 14 394 noninstitutionalized individuals aged 50 years or older during the study period. Data were analyzed from September 1 to December 14, 2020. EXPOSURES: Moderate food insecurity (not enough money to buy the food needed) and severe food insecurity (reduced food intake due to financial constraints) measured at the household level. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The AL score (0-9, with higher scores indicating a greater risk of physiologic dysregulation) and binary indicators of dysregulated inflammatory (C-reactive protein), cardiovascular (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, and cystatin C), and metabolic (hemoglobin A(1c), body mass index, waist-to-height ratio, total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio) systems. RESULTS: Of 14 394 participants included in the analysis, the median age was 60 (IQR, 56-69) years, 8143 (56.6%) were women, 517 (3.6%) were moderately food insecure, and 804 (5.6%) were severely food insecure. In adjusted models, the incidence rate of AL was 1.05 (95% CI, 1.00-1.09) times higher for the participants with moderate food insecurity and 1.11 (95% CI, 1.07-1.15) times higher for the participants with severe food insecurity, compared with those who were food secure. The increased incidence rate of AL among participants with severe food insecurity was associated with C-reactive protein level (odds ratio [OR], 1.22; 95% CI, 1.04-1.44), cystatin C level (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.01-1.51), hemoglobin A(1c) level (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.01-1.59), body mass index (OR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.41-2.40), waist-to-height ratio (OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.26-1.88), and total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.10-1.59) inflated to the high-risk range. The interaction between moderate food insecurity and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) enrollment ( = ?0.18; P = .001) and the interaction between severe food insecurity and SNAP enrollment ( = ?0.09; P = .02) were associated with a reduction in AL. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this national cohort study of US adults aged 50 years or older, food insecurity was associated with higher AL, mainly through dysregulation of the inflammatory and metabolic systems. SNAP enrollment may modify this association between food insecurity and AL.","output":"Association of Food Insecurity With Allostatic Load Among Older Adults in the US"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus pandemic has created havoc in the world. COVID-19 is now officially labeled as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus-SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, it is equally important to combat the virus both inside the human body as well as in the environment. These viruses, being RNA viruses, are found to be susceptible to ozone. Ozone being an unstable molecule can breakup into its split products namely reactive oxygen species and ozonides creating a toxic environment for these viruses. Ozone mainly prevents the membrane fusion with the host cell, thus interfering with their replication. With vast applications of the gas, it has created a new spark in the field of medicine in combating these viruses and many other organisms. In this context, this article provides insights from recent clinical and research studies on the problems and possibilities in employing the ozone to combat the coronaviruses.","output":"Recent case studies on the use of ozone to combat coronavirus: Problems and perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This month's installment of The AJT Report explores the role of the transplant community in the wider healthcare framework as both entities navigate the challenges of COVID\\\\19.

Despite many promising ongoing progress, there are currently no FDA approved drugs to treat infected patients. Among the various protein targets of SARS-CoV-2 virus, the main protease (Mpro) has attracted most interests. Recently, the crowdsourcing of drug discovery for inhibiting Mpro have yielded a plenty of drug fragments resolved inside the active site of Mpro via the crystallography method. Following the principle of fragment-based drug design (FBDD), we are motivated to design a potent drug molecule through merging several of these newly discovered drug fragments. Among various designed ligands, we found that B19 by merging three fragments JFM, U0P and HWH is the most stable one, evidenced through extensive (~10 s totally) all-atom molecular dynamics simulation. We further estimated that the binding free energy of B19 is comparable or even a little better than that of a native protein ligand processed by Mpro. Our promising results suggest that B19 can potentially be an efficacious drug molecule for inhibiting Mpro of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Crystal-Structures-Guided Design of Fragment-Based Drugs for Inhibiting the Main Protease of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic had a major impact on the economy around the world, damaging many areas of daily life. The industrial sector has been affected by the effects of industrial closures, reduced economic activity, and disruptions in logistics and transportation. The damage caused by the crisis has not yet been specifically assessed, as the industrial sector was not the most affected by the pandemic compared to other sectors of the economy. The subject of the study is the industrial sector of Ukraine and the EU. The aim of the article is to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on industrial development in Ukraine and the EU, as well as to propose economic policy measures to achieve stabilization in the industrial sector. Since industry is the foundation of economic growth and development, it is necessary to assess the depth of its decline and find possible solutions to get out of the recession. The theoretical analysis of the article is based on recent work by scientists in the field of industrial development, as well as on the authors' developments assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy. The COVID-19 pandemic created the following problems for Ukraine's economy and industry: a decrease in aggregate global demand and a decline in business activity, which led to lower prices on world commodity markets;strengthening of government regulation;raw-material orientation of Ukraine's exports and the significant dependence of industrial enterprises on world prices for raw materials;transport and logistics problems with raw material supply chains;lower business expectations and reduced investment due to significant uncertainty. The findings showed that the coronavirus crisis hit the industrial sectors mainly in April 2020, leading to a 16.1% decline in industrial production in Ukraine and an 18.6% decline in the coal mining, oil and gas extraction were hit the hardest. The following measures to stabilize the industrial sector are proposed: support for domestic demand for the products of industries, namely metallurgy, machine building, and chemical industry, which are mainly export-oriented and very sensitive to changes in global demand;stimulation and development of high value-added production;acceleration of the digitalization process within national borders;support for the industrial sector in its pursuit of environmentally friendly production, and others.","output":"Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic on the Industrial Sector: Implications for Economic Policy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[...]eight focus groups were conducted with primary school teachers from public and private institutions to learn about their perception of their own and their students' media competencies, the impact of the pandemic on their practices and needs, and the emerging challenges in this crisis.

RESULTS: Our findings show that there are several prescription drugs that can cause pigmented lesions in the oral mucosa. This must be known by clinicians in order to properly diagnose pigmented lesions. We have identified a set of 21 medicaments which cause these lesions, some of which are used frequently in the clinic, such as Metronidazole, Amitriptyline, conjugated oestrogens and Chlorhexidine gluconate. We also found discrepancies with the data published in specialized literature, some of which wasnt reflected in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

The aim of this study was to determine whether self-reported symptoms at the time of diagnosis can identify patients at risk of clinical deterioration. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of 671 outpatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosed in Toronto between March 1 and October 16, 2020. We examined the association between patients' baseline characteristics and self-reported symptoms at the time of diagnosis and the risk of subsequent hospitalization. Results: Of 671 participants, 26 (3.9%) required hospitalization. Individuals aged 65 years or older were more likely to require hospitalization (odds ratio [OR] 5.29, 95% CI 2.19 to 12.77), whereas those without medical comorbidities were unlikely to be hospitalized (OR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.17). After adjusting for age and presence of comorbidities, sputum production (adjusted OR [aOR] 5.01, 95% CI 1.97 to 12.75), arthralgias (aOR 4.82, 95% CI 1.85 to 12.53), diarrhea (aOR 4.56, 95% CI 1.82 to 11.42), fever (aOR 3.64, 95% CI 1.50 to 8.82), chills (aOR 3.62, 95% CI 1.54 to 8.50), and fatigue (aOR 2.59, 95% CI 1.04 to 6.47) were associated with subsequent hospitalization. Conclusions: Early assessment of symptoms among outpatients with COVID-19 can help identify individuals at risk of clinical deterioration. Additional studies are needed to determine whether more intense follow-up and early intervention among high-risk individuals can alter the clinical trajectory of and outcomes among outpatients with COVID-19.

There have nevertheless been at least three significant alternatives developed to this disastrous bioethical failure. These alternatives are reviewed in this article in the terms of 'vaccine diplomacy', 'vaccine charity', and 'vaccine liberty'. Vaccine diplomacy includes the diverse bilateral deliveries of vaccines organized by the geopolitical considerations of countries strategically seeking various kinds of global and regional advantages in international relations. Vaccine charity centrally involves the humanitarian work of the global health agencies and donor governments that have organized the COVAX program as an antidote to unequal access. Despite their many promises, however, both vaccine diplomacy and vaccine charity have failed to deliver the doses needed to overcome the global vaccination gap. Instead, they have unfortunately served to immunize the global vaccine supply system from more radical demands for a 'People's Vaccine', technological transfer and compulsory licensing of vaccine intellectual property (IP). These more radical demands represent the third alternative to vaccine access inequalities. As a mix of NGO-led and politician-led social justice demands, they are diverse and multifaceted, but together they have been articulated as calls for vaccine liberty. After first describing the realities of vaccine access inequalities, this article compares and contrasts the effectiveness thus far of the three alternatives. In doing so, it also provides a critical bioethical framework for reflecting on how the alternatives have come to compete with one another in the context of the vaccine property norms and market structures entrenched in global IP law. The uneven and limited successes of vaccine diplomacy and vaccine charity in delivering vaccines in underserved countries can be re-considered in this way as compromised successes that not only compete with one another, but which have also worked together to undermine the promise of universal access through vaccine liberty.","output":"Competing responses to global inequalities in access to COVID vaccines: Vaccine Diplomacy and Vaccine Charity Versus Vaccine Liberty"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 51-year-old man presented with dyspnoea and basithoracic pain.

A comprehensive and systematic study of the evolutionary process of ALV-J in China is needed. In this study, we amplified the full-length viral cDNA sequences of 16 ALV-J isolates of Yellow-chicken origin and analyzed and compared these sequences with another 69 ALV-J strains isolated during the years 1988C2018. These isolates were then sorted into 2 clusters: cluster I included isolates that mainly originated from the layers and White-feather broilers from northern China; cluster II included isolates mainly from the Yellow-chicken, most of them being from southern China. According to the sequence homologies of the whole genome and gag, pol, gp85, and gp37 genes, the ALV-J strains are more likely to randomly change in different directions from the original strain HPRS-103 as time passes. The results of entropy analysis of the sequences of gag, pol, and env revealed that the env gene had the largest variation, and the gag gene nonconserved sites are mainly concentrated in p19, p10, and p12. In addition, 84.71% (72/85) of the isolates had the 205-nucleotide (nt) deletion in the 3UTR region, and 30.59% (26/85) of the isolates had the 125-nt to 127-nt deletion in the E element.

However, PCR availability is restricted in most countries. Rapid diagnostic tests are considered acceptable alternatives, but data are lacking on their performance. We assessed the performance of four antibody-based rapid diagnostic tests and one antigen-based rapid diagnostic test for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community in Cameroon. METHODS: In this clinical, prospective, diagnostic accuracy study, we enrolled individuals aged at least 21 years who were either symptomatic and suspected of having COVID-19 or asymptomatic and presented for screening. We tested peripheral blood for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using the Innovita (Biological Technology; Beijing, China), Wondfo (Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech; Guangzhou, China), SD Biosensor (SD Biosensor; Gyeonggi-do, South Korea), and Runkun tests (Runkun Pharmaceutical; Hunan, China), and nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 antigen using the SD Biosensor test. Antigen rapid diagnostic tests were compared with Abbott PCR testing (Abbott; Abbott Park, IL, USA), and antibody rapid diagnostic tests were compared with Biomerieux immunoassays (Biomerieux; Marcy l'Etoile, France). We retrospectively tested two diagnostic algorithms that incorporated rapid diagnostic tests for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients using simulation modelling. FINDINGS: 1195 participants were enrolled in the study. 347 (29%) tested SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive, 223 (19%) rapid diagnostic test antigen-positive, and 478 (40%) rapid diagnostic test antibody-positive. Antigen-based rapid diagnostic test sensitivity was 800% (95% CI 710-880) in the first 7 days after symptom onset, but antibody-based rapid diagnostic tests had only 268% sensitivity (183-368). Antibody rapid diagnostic test sensitivity increased to 764% (701-820) 14 days after symptom onset. Among asymptomatic participants, the sensitivity of antigen-based and antibody-based rapid diagnostic tests were 370% (270-480) and 507% (422-591), respectively. Cohen's &#954; showed substantial agreement between Wondfo antibody rapid diagnostic test and gold-standard ELISA (&#954;=076; sensitivity 098) and between Biosensor and ELISA (&#954;=060; sensitivity 094). Innovita (&#954;=047; sensitivity 093) and Runkun (&#954;=043; sensitivity 076) showed moderate agreement. An antigen-based retrospective algorithm applied to symptomatic patients showed 940% sensitivity and 910% specificity in the first 7 days after symptom onset. For asymptomatic participants, the algorithm showed a sensitivity of 34% (95% CI 230-440) and a specificity of 920% (880-960). INTERPRETATION: Rapid diagnostic tests had good overall sensitivity for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Rapid diagnostic tests could be incorporated into efficient testing algorithms as an alternative to PCR to decrease diagnostic delays and onward viral transmission.

While actual case numbers appear vague, mortality numbers related to COVID-19 seem more precise. In this study, we used the mortality rate as the main indicator to evaluate the extent of underreporting and underdetection of COVID-19 cases. Methods We have analyzed all available data provided by the World Health Organization on the development of international COVID-19 cases and mortality numbers on March 17th, 2020. A crude case-fatality risk (cCFR) and adjusted case-fatality risk (aCFR) was calculated for China, South Korea, Japan, Italy, France, Spain, Germany, Iran and the United States. Additionally, a fold-change (FC) was derived for each country. Results The highest aCFR and FC were detected for Spain. Based on their FC values, an extremely high number of undetected COVID-19 cases was displayed in France, the United States, Italy and Spain. For these countries, our findings indicate a detection rate of only 1-2% of total actual COVID-19 cases. Conclusions Due to limited testing capacities, mortality numbers may serve as a better indicator for COVID-19 case spread in many countries. Our data indicate that countries like France, Italy, the United States, Iran and Spain have extremely high numbers of undetected and underreported cases. Differences in testing availability and capacity, containment as well as overall health care and medical infrastructure result in significantly different mortality rates and COVID-19 case numbers for each respective country.","output":"Evaluating the massive underreporting and undertesting of COVID-19 cases in multiple global epicenters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A high body mass index (BMI) has been associated with decreased mortality in critically ill patients. This association may, in part, relate to the impact of BMI on glycemia. We aimed to study the relationship between BMI, glycemia and hospital mortality. METHODS: We included all patients with a recorded BMI from four large international clinical databases (n = 259,177). We investigated the unadjusted association of BMI with average glucose levels, mortality and hypoglycemia rate. We applied multivariate analysis to investigate the impact of BMI on hypoglycemia rate, after adjusting for glycemia-relevant treatments (insulin, dextrose, corticosteroids, enteral and parenteral nutrition) and key physiological parameters (previous blood glucose level, blood lactate, shock state, SOFA score). RESULTS: We analyzed 5,544,366 glucose measurements. On unadjusted analysis, increasing BMI was associated with increasing glucose levels (average increase of 5 and 10 mg/dL for the 25-30, 30-35 kg/m2 BMI groups compared to normal BMI (18.5-25 kg/m2) patients). Despite greater hyperglycemia, increasing BMI was associated with lower hospital mortality (average decrease of 2% and 3.25% for the 25-30, 30-35 kg/m2 groups compared to normal BMI patients) and lower hypoglycemia rate (average decrease of 2.5% and 3.5% for the 25-30, 30-35 kg/m2 groups compared to normal BMI patients). Increasing BMI was significantly independently associated with reduced hypoglycemia rate, with odds ratio (OR) 0.72 and 0.65, respectively (95% CIs 0.67-0.77 and 0.60-0.71, both p < 0.001) when compared with normal BMI. Low BMI patients showed greater hypoglycemia rate, with OR 1.6 (CI 1.43-1.79, p < 0.001). The association of high BMI and decreased mortality did not apply to diabetic patients. Although diabetic patients had higher rates of hypoglycemia overall and higher glucose variability (p < 0.001), they also had a reduced risk of hypoglycemia with higher BMI levels (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Increasing BMI is independently associated with decreased risk of hypoglycemia. It is also associated with increasing hyperglycemia and yet with lower mortality. Lower risk of hypoglycemia might contribute to decreased mortality and might partly explain the obesity paradox. These associations, however, were markedly modified by the presence of diabetes.","output":"The obesity paradox and hypoglycemia in critically ill patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: To investigate the feasibility of using music listening by adults with fibromyalgia (FM) as a potential tool for reducing pain sensitivity. Patients and methods: We report results from a double-blind two-arm parallel randomized pilot study (NCT04059042) in 9 participants with FM. Pain tolerance and threshold were measured objectively using quantitative sensory tests; autonomic nervous system (ANS) reactivity was measured with electrocardiogram. Participants were randomized to listen to instrumental Western Classical music or a nature sound control to test whether music listening elicits greater analgesic effects over simple auditory distraction. Participants also completed separate control testing with no sound that was counterbalanced between participants. Results: Participants were randomized 1:1 to music or nature sounds (4 Music, 5 Nature). Although the groups were not different on FM scores, the Music group had marginally worse pain summation (p=.09) and tolerance (p=.13). The Nature group had higher Anxiety scores (p<.05). Outcome measures showed a significant Group by Session interaction for pain tolerance (p<.05) revealing that the Nature group had greater pain reduction during audio compared to silence, while the Music group had no difference between sessions. No significant effects were observed for ANS testing. Within the Music group, there was a trend of vagal response increase from baseline to music listening, but it did not reach statistical significance; this pattern was not observed in the Nature group. Conclusion: Auditory listening significantly altered pain responses. There may be greater vagal response to music versus nature sounds, however, results could be due to group differences in pain and anxiety. This line of study will help determine whether music could be prophylactic for people with FM when acute pain is expected.","output":"Autonomic Nervous System Markers of Music-Elicited Analgesia in People with Fibromyalgia: A Double-Blind Randomized Pilot Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Arsenic exposure and micronutrient deficiencies may alter immune reactivity to influenza vaccination in pregnant women, transplacental transfer of maternal antibodies to the fetus, and maternal and infant acute morbidity.

Among its major functions are conservation of energy during starvation, recycling organelles, and turnover of long-lived proteins. Besides, autophagy plays a critical role in removing intracellular pathogens and very likely represents a primordial intrinsic cellular defence mechanism. More recent findings indicate that it has not only retained its ability to degrade intracellular pathogens, but also functions to augment and fine tune antiviral immune responses. Interestingly, viruses have also co-evolved strategies to manipulate this pathway and use it to their advantage. Particularly intriguing is infection-dependent activation of autophagy with positive stranded (+)RNA virus infections, which benefit from the pathway without succumbing to lysosomal degradation.

Severe disease courses are associated with interstitial pneumonia and ventilated patients, in whom tracheotomy (TT)a droplet- and aerosol-producing medical interventionis regularly necessary. TT as a potential infection risk for medical staff is scarcely found in the literature. Therefore, the aim of this study was to quantify droplet exposure of the surgical team during TT, to better define the requirements for personal protective equipment (PPE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Surgical TT was performed in four non-infectious patients, during which the surgeon and his assistant both wore a surgical nasal mask with a transparent visor. After the procedure, the type, distribution, and number of droplets on the visor were determined macroscopically and microscopically. RESULTS: An average of 29 droplets were found on the middle third of the visor, 4 on the right third, and 13 on the left third, with an average droplet size of 571 m ( 381 m). The smallest droplets were 55 m, the largest 1431 m. An increase in the number of droplets was found with increased ventilation during the procedure. Blood droplets were more common than secretion droplets. CONCLUSION: Contamination of the visor with droplets was demonstrated. Especially in the case of TT in highly infectious patients, e.g., COVID-19 patients, the use of hooded headgear in combination with breathing apparatus with air purification and power supply is recommended to ensure best protection from infection for the surgeon and the surgical assistant.","output":"Tr?pfchenexposition bei Tracheotomie: Fallanalyse und Konsequenzen in Bezug auf COVID-19-Patienten"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The field of regenerative medicine utilizes a wide array of technologies and techniques for repairing and restoring function to damaged tissues.

A cross-sectional study was conducted among several universities in Shandong Province, China. We randomly selected 254 Chinese engineering college students from these colleges. Participants who were given questionnaires completed the Physical Activity Rating Scale (PARS-3), Basic Needs Satisfaction in General Scale (BNSG-S), Parental psychological control Questionnaire, the Beck anxiety inventory (BAI), and the Kessler 10 (K10) scale. The mediation model was conducted to assess the mediation effect of anxiety between the relationship of basic psychological needs and mental health. Among 254 Chinese college students majoring in engineering, the results showed that their mental health was in the mid-level range. Besides, physical activity and basic psychological needs is positively correlated with mental health, respectively, while parental psychological control is not correlated with mental health. Anxiety is negatively associated with mental health. Mediation analysis revealed that anxiety played a mediation role in the relationship between basic psychological needs and mental health. In conclusion, mental health of Chinese engineering college students deserves extensive attention during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The premise is to reverse the state of oral dysbiosis, and restore the ecological balance to maintain a stable homeostasis with the host immune system. This study will assess the effectiveness, feasibility, and safety of OMT using an interdisciplinary approach. METHODS/DESIGN: To find donors suitable for microbial transplantation, supragingival plaque samples will be collected from 600 healthy participants. Each sample (200L) will subsequently be examined in two ways: 1) 100L of the sample will undergo high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and shotgun sequencing to identify the composition and characterisation of a healthy supragingival microbiome, 2) the remaining 100L of the plaque sample will be mixed with 25% artificial saliva medium and inoculated into a specialised in-vitro flow cell model containing a hydroxyapatite disk. To obtain sufficient donor plaque, the samples would be grown for 14 days and further analysed microscopically and sequenced to examine and confirm the growth and survival of the microbiota. Samples with the healthiest microbiota would then be incorporated in a hydrogel delivery vehicle to enable transplantation of the donor oral microbiota. The third step would be to test the effectiveness of OMT in caries and periodontitis animal models for efficacy and safety for the treatment of oral diseases. DISCUSSION: If OMTs are found to be successful, it can form a new treatment method for common oral diseases such as dental caries and periodontitis.

We investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on incidence, time of diagnosis and delivery of healthcare among paediatric oncology patients in Germany in 2020. METHODS: We analysed incident paediatric cancer cases diagnosed in 0- to 17-year olds in Germany in 2020 using data of the German Childhood Cancer Registry. Absolute numbers and age-standardised incidence rates (ASR) in 2020 were compared to the previous five years (2015C2019). Moreover, we conducted a survey with open-ended questions, gathering perceptions of the diagnostic process and healthcare delivery for paediatric oncology patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. FINDINGS: More or similar numbers of paediatric cancer patients were newly diagnosed each month throughout 2020 in comparison to the previous five years. The estimated ASRs showed markedly higher incidence rates, overall and across diagnostic groups, in 2020 compared to 2015-2019. Results from the qualitative survey indicated that diagnostic processes, timeliness of diagnosis, and delivery of treatment were hardly affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, psychosocial supportive care and non-urgent appointments were considerably reduced during the lockdown periods. INTERPRETATION: We found no indications of severe adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on diagnosis and delivery of healthcare among children with cancer in Germany. The underlying reasons of the increase in incidence rates remain speculative. Continued close monitoring of incidence patterns may shed light on the underlying reasons of the present increase and contribute to understanding disease aetiology.

The number of studies funded by industry and US government remained unchanged, whereas studies funded by other sources (e.g., academic medical centers) grew (CAGR 11.3%). Neurodevelopmental disorders comprised the largest proportion of disorders studied, and Non-DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5) conditions was the only disorder category to grow (14.5% to 24.6%; first half to second half of decade). There was significant growth of trials studying non-psycho/pharmacotherapy treatments (33.8% to 49.0%) and a decline in trials studying pharmacotherapies (31.7% to 20.6%), though these trends differed by funding source. There were also notable differences in funding sources and treatments studied within each disorder category. Trials using double blinding declined (26.2% to 18.0%). Limitations include that ClinicalTrials.gov is not an exhaustive list of US clinical trials, and trends identified may in part reflect changes in trial registration rather than changes in clinical research. Nevertheless, ClinicalTrials.gov is among the largest databases available for evaluating trends and patterns in pediatric mental health research that might otherwise remain unassessable. Understanding these trends can guide researchers and funding bodies when considering the trajectory of the field.","output":"Trends in US pediatric mental health clinical trials: An analysis of ClinicalTrials.gov from 2007C2018"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) has a multiplicity of physiological roles that revolve around its trivalent function: a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system, facilitator of amino acid transport, and the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 receptor. ACE2 is widely expressed, including, in the lungs, cardiovascular system, gut, kidneys, central nervous system, and adipose tissue. ACE2 has recently been identified as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, the infective agent responsible for coronavirus disease 2019, providing a critical link between immunity, inflammation, ACE2, and cardiovascular disease. Although sharing a close evolutionary relationship with SARS-CoV, the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 differs in several key amino acid residues, allowing for stronger binding affinity with the human ACE2 receptor, which may account for the greater pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. The loss of ACE2 function following binding by SARS-CoV-2 is driven by endocytosis and activation of proteolytic cleavage and processing. The ACE2 system is a critical protective pathway against heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction including, myocardial infarction and hypertension, and against lung disease and diabetes mellitus. The control of gut dysbiosis and vascular permeability by ACE2 has emerged as an essential mechanism of pulmonary hypertension and diabetic cardiovascular complications. Recombinant ACE2, gene-delivery of Ace2, Ang 1-7 analogs, and Mas receptor agonists enhance ACE2 action and serve as potential therapies for disease conditions associated with an activated renin-angiotensin system. rhACE2 (recombinant human ACE2) has completed clinical trials and efficiently lowered or increased plasma angiotensin II and angiotensin 1-7 levels, respectively. Our review summarizes the progress over the past 20 years, highlighting the critical role of ACE2 as the novel SARS-CoV-2 receptor and as the negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system, together with implications for the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and associated cardiovascular diseases.","output":"Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2: SARS-CoV-2 Receptor and Regulator of the Renin-Angiotensin System: Celebrating the 20th Anniversary of the Discovery of ACE2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction et but de ltude Les patients obses prsentent un risque accru de complications svres en cas dinfection  SARS-CoV2.

STUDY DESIGN Case series. ANIMALS Dogs (n=7) with Cushing's syndrome caused by unilateral adrenocortical carcinoma. METHODS Laparoscopic adrenalectomy with the dog in lateral recumbency on the unaffected side. Three 5-mm portals (1 laparoscopic portal, 2 instrument portals) were placed in the paralumbar fossa. A fourth instrumental portal (5-12 mm) was placed above the kidney. After dissection and hemostatic control of the phrenicoabdominal vein, the adrenal gland was carefully dissected or when there was capsule fragility, necrotic content was partially aspirated. The remaining glandular tissue was removed through the 12-mm trocar site. RESULTS Dogs with unilateral adrenocortical carcinoma (3 right-sided, 4 left-sided) without invasion of the caudal vena cava were successfully operated by laparoscopic approach. There were no significant intraoperative complications; 2 dogs died within 48 hours of surgery because of respiratory complications. Five dogs were discharged 72 hours after surgery, and signs of hyperadrenocorticism disappeared thereafter (survival time ranged from 7 to 25 months). CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic adrenalectomy is feasible in dogs with either right- or left-sided adrenocortical carcinoma not involving the caudal vena cava.

Using freshly-collected, undiluted whole blood at body temperature as both our calibration and measurement conditions, we demonstrate accuracy of better than  10% for the measurement of our test bed drug, vancomycin. Comparing titrations collected at room and body temperature, we find that matching the temperature of calibration curve collection to the temperature used during measurements improves quantification by reducing differences in sensor gain and binding curve midpoint.

We aimed to investigate whether cardiovascular risk is associated with increased risk of acute respiratory infection and acute cardiovascular events after acute respiratory infection using 10 years of linked electronic health record (EHR) data in England. METHODS: In this retrospective, population-based cohort study we used EHRs from primary care providers registered on the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD and Aurum databases in England. Eligible individuals were aged 40C64 years, did not have established cardiovascular disease or a chronic health condition that would make them eligible for influenza vaccination, were registered at a general practice contributing to the CPRD, and had linked Hospital Episode Statistics Admitted Patient Care data in England from Sept 1, 2008, to Aug 31, 2018. We classified cardiovascular risk on the basis of diagnosed hypertension and overall predicted cardiovascular risk, estimated by use of the QRISK2 risk-prediction tool (comparing a score of 10% [increased risk] with a score of <10% [low risk]). Using multivariable Poisson regression models, we calculated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for systemic acute respiratory infection. Among individuals who had an acute respiratory infection, we used multivariable Cox regression to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) for the risk of acute cardiovascular events within 1 year of infection. FINDINGS: We identified 6 075 321 individuals aged 40C64 years with data in the CPRD and linked data in the Hospital Episode Statistics Admitted Patient Care database between Sept 1, 2008, and Aug 31, 2018. Of these individuals, 4 212 930 (including 526 480 [125%] with hypertension and 607 087 [144%] with a QRISK2 score of 10%) were included in the assessment of the incidence of acute respiratory infection. After adjusting for confounders (age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, body-mass index, alcohol consumption, smoking status, and consultation frequency in the hypertension analysis; and alcohol consumption and consultation frequency in the QRISK2 analysis), the incidence of acute respiratory infection was higher in individuals with hypertension than those without (IRR 104 [95% CI 103C105]) and higher in those with a QRISK2 score of 10% or higher than in those with a QRISK2 score of less than 10% (139 [137C140]). Of the 442 408 individuals who had an acute respiratory infection, 4196 (09%) had an acute cardiovascular event within 1 year of infection. After adjustment (for age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, body-mass index, alcohol consumption, and smoking status in the hypertension analysis; and for alcohol consumption in the QRISK2 analysis), hypertension (HR 198 [95% CI 183C215]) and a QRISK2 score of 10% or higher (365 [342C389]) were associated with a substantially increased risk of acute cardiovascular events after acute respiratory infection. INTERPRETATION: People with increased cardiovascular risk but without diagnosed cardiovascular disease, measured by diagnosed hypertension or overall predicted cardiovascular risk, could benefit from influenza and pneumococcal vaccine prioritisation to reduce their risk of both acute respiratory infection and cardiovascular complications following an acute respiratory infection.

Methods: To assess e-cigarette use and perceptions, a nationally distributed 52-item questionnaire assessed e-cigarette use, dependence and perceptions, COVID-19 diagnosis, demographic data, and pre/during COVID-19 vaping habits. E-cigarette usage/dependence was assessed via the validated Penn State Electronic Cigarette Dependence Index. Questions were developed in-house to assess pre/during COVID-19 vaping habits of users and risk perceptions of both non-users and users of e-cigarettes. Results: A total of 565 survey responses were obtained with 393 (69%) reporting no e-cigarette use and 172 (31%) e-cigarette users. Fifty (30%) vapers believed there were no adverse health effects due to vaping e-cigarettes while only 38 (9%) nonusers agreed (P&lt;0.0001). Two hundred eight (76%) non-users believed that e-cigarette use would lead to worse COVID-19 symptoms, compared to 40% of users (P&lt;0.001). Twenty-eight percent of non-users also believed that e-cigarette users were more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, versus only 11% of e-cigarette users. Thirty percent of all vapers reported high dependence on vaping. Fifty-three (33%) users believed that ecigarettes are not a safe alternative to conventional tobacco (P&lt;0.001). Of total respondents, 11 (6%) reported having had COVID-19. Fifty-nine (38%) e-cigarette users reported changing their habits during the pandemic, with 31% reporting increased vaping (P&lt;0.001). Although 109 e-cigarette users (70%) reported vaping in a social setting before the pandemic, 38 (25%) users switched to vaping non-socially during the pandemic (P&lt;0.001). One hundred three (67%) e-cigarette users replied that they would decrease or stop vaping if diagnosed with COVID, while 50 (31%) said they would continue vaping (P&lt;0.001). Conclusions: Our findings show a large difference in risk perception of e-cigarette use between users and non-users, which is consistent with past studies and data.

Methods: The study included four different types of maculopathy: central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC), retinitis pigmentosa (RP), Stargardt disease (STGD) and phototoxic retinopathy. In all four cases, cone mosaic and cone density were obtained using AO fundus camera. Further, the high-resolution images were compared with the FAF and optical coherence tomography (OCT) results. Results: In CSC, FAF and AO, changes could be shown in the macula even two years after the subretinal fluid resorption, as opposed to a normal OCT. The improvement of FAF and cone mosaic appearance was concomitant with the visual acuity growth. Several cone mosaic phenotypes were observed in RP and STGD. In RP, the cone density was 24.240 cones /mm2 in the center, and decreased to 8.163 cones/ mm2 in the parafoveal area. In STGD, the cone density was lower in the center, 9.219 cones/ mm2, and higher at the periphery, 12.594 cones/ mm2. In the case of phototoxic retinopathy, AO and OCT were more effective than FAF in highlighting the photoreceptor and retinal pigment epithelium lesions.

Moreover, the therapeutic monoclonal antibodies demonstrate an excellent efficacy against WNV in animal models and represent a promising class of WNV therapeutics. However, there are some challenges as to the design and development of a safe and efficient WNV vaccine or therapeutic. In this chapter, we discuss the current approaches, progress, and challenges toward the development of WNV vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and antiviral drugs.","output":"An Overview of Current Approaches Toward the Treatment and Prevention of West Nile Virus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus crisis clearly exposed Germany's deficits in the digitalisation of the economy and society The cooperation between established SMEs and innovative start-ups offers considerable opportunities for the respective companies and the German economy New business models can be adopted and innovative products can be jointly developed In particular, the digitalisation of the 'German Mittelstand' could receive a boost through collaboration with digital start-ups This could lead to an increase in the demographically induced declining growth potential of the German economy","output":"[More Cooperation Between Startups and SMEs as an Opportunity for Digital Transformation and Innovation]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and subsequent COVID-19 pandemic initiated intense research into the mechanisms of action for this virus.

Some ARI in adult patients may be caused by bacteria but most often the causes are virus infections. When ARI affect immunocompromised patients or the elderly the mortality rates are significantly higher than in immunocompetent individuals. Many types of viruses cause ARI. Among them, influenza viruses A and B and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are thought to be the most important because of the severity of illness after infection and their high communicability in the human population. Recently, several novel antiviral drugs against ARI have been developed and some are proceeding in clinical trials. This review covers current investigations into antiviral compounds targeted at several points in the virus life-cycle. This includes PM-523, which broadly inhibits ortho- and paramyxo-viruses, two neuraminidase inhibitors for influenza virus, neutralizing antibody to RSV and chimeric soluble ICAM-1-IgA molecules targeted against rhinoviruses.","output":"Approaches to antiviral chemotherapy for acute respiratory infections."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The way diseases spread through schools, epidemics through countries, and viruses through the Internet is crucial in determining their risk. Although each of these threats has its own characteristics, its underlying network determines the spreading. To restrain the spreading, a widely used approach is the fragmentation of these networks through immunization, so that epidemics cannot spread. Here we develop an immunization approach based on optimizing the susceptible size, which outperforms the best known strategy based on immunizing the highest-betweenness links or nodes. We find that the network's vulnerability can be significantly reduced, demonstrating this on three different real networks: the global flight network, a school friendship network, and the internet. In all cases, we find that not only is the average infection probability significantly suppressed, but also for the most relevant case of a small and limited number of immunization units the infection probability can be reduced by up to 55%.","output":"Suppressing Epidemics with a Limited Amount of Immunization Units"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: H7N9 is an emerging pathogen with associated morbidity and mortality, and a broader understanding of the chest radiographic characteristics associated with human H7N9 infections is needed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) for patients with H7N9 influenza. Lesion patterns, distributions, and changes at follow-up chest X-ray and/or CT were investigated. The time to progression on chest CT image, and the time to resolution of the chest CT findings were assessed. RESULTS: Lymphocytopenia was a common laboratory test abnormality. The most common CT findings were lobar consolidation with air bronchogram and ground-glass opacities. For 7 recovering patients, the time to resolution of the chest CT findings was 10C90 days. Fibrosis and traction bronchiectasis were the main features on the CT scans of recovering patients. Interestingly, the time to recovery from lymphopenia was highly consistent with time to resolution of the chest CT findings. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown the presence of radiographic abnormalities among H7N9 patients.

This paper describes a systematic review of 113 academic journal articles and identifies associations between telework and sustainability, explored by previous researchers. Those associations were categorized and discussed, based on their contributions to different United Nations Social Development Goals. Most of research was found to focus on countries classified as having a very high human development index status, and regions with a low, medium or high human development index, largely ignored. The SWOT matrix technique was used to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses identified in the current literature as well as threats and opportunities for future work. This can help to ensure policy coherence and that strategies to promote one outcome, such as economic productivity improvements, does not undermine another, such as improved health. Practical implications and potential research opportunities were identified across a range of SDG impact areas, including good health and well-being, gender equality, reduced inequality, climate mitigation, sustainable cities and resilient communities.

Across Italy, 1215 respondents completed our Qualtrics-based online-survey during the end of a seven to 10-week imposed lockdown and home confinement (from April 29 to May 17, 2020). We found subjective cognitive functioning and mental health severely changed in association with the lockdown. Under government regulations, cognitive complaints were mostly perceived in routine tasks involving attention, temporal orientation and executive functionswith no changes in language abilities. A paradoxical effect was observed for memory, with reduced forgetfulness compared to pre-lockdown. We found higher severity and prevalence of depression, anxiety disorders, abnormal sleep, appetite changes, reduced libido and health anxiety: with mild-to-severe depression and anxiety prevalence climbing to 32 and 36 percent, respectively, under restrictions. Being female, under 45 years, working from home or being underemployed were all identified as relevant risk factors for worsening cognition and mental health.

A weak health system, poor infrastructure, and varied socio-cultural factors are cited as inhibitors to optimal health system performance and improved maternal and child health status. eHealth has become a major solution to closing these gaps in health care delivery in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This research reports the use of satellite communication (SatCom) technology and the existing 3G mobile network for providing video training (VTR) for health workers and improving the digitization of healthcare data. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the expected project outcomes that were achieved at the end-line evaluation of 2019 were sustained 12 months after the project ended. METHODS: From March 2017 to March 2019, digital innovations including VTR and data digitization interventions were delivered in 62 healthcare facilities in Ondo State, southwest Nigeria, most of which lacked access to a 3G mobile network. Data collection for the evaluation combined documents' review with quantitative data extracted from health facility registers, and 24 of the most significant change stories to assess the longevity of the outcomes and impacts of digital innovation in the four domains of healthcare: use of eHealth technology for data management, utilization of health facilities by patients, the standard of care, and staff attitude. Stories of the most significant changes were audio-recorded, transcribed for analysis, and categorized by the above domains to identify the most significant changes 12 months after the project closedown. RESULTS: Findings showed that four project outcomes which were achieved at end-line evaluation were sustained 12 months after project closedown namely: staff motivation and satisfaction; increased staff confidence to perform healthcare roles; improved standard of healthcare delivery; and increased adoption of eHealth innovations beyond the health sector. Conversely, an outcome that was reversed following the discontinuation of SatCom from health facilities is the availability of accurate and reliable data for decision-making. CONCLUSION: Digital technology can have lasting impacts on health workers, patients, and the health system, through improving data management for decision-making, the standard of maternity service delivery, boosting attendance at health facilities, and utilization of services. Locally driven investment is essential for ensuring the long-term survival of eHealth projects to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs) in LMICs.","output":"Sustainability of the Effects and Impacts of Using Digital Technology to Extend Maternal Health Services to Rural and Hard-to-Reach Populations: Experience From Southwest Nigeria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The year 2020 has witnessed unprecedented levels of demand for COVID-19 medical equipment and supplies.

In a public health response due to coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, the Italian government imposed a lockdown from March 9 to May 3. This extraordinary situation may have been challenging for maternal psychological health. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of depressive and post-traumatic stress symptoms in women giving birth during the Covid-19 pandemic and its associations with quarantine measures, obstetrical factors, and relational attachment style. METHODS: Women who gave birth in a high-volume obstetric/gynaecological medical centre located in an epidemic area during the Covid-19 pandemic (March 8 to June 15) were asked to complete an online survey about their childbirth experience and the perceived effect of the pandemic. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the Relationship Questionnaire (RQ) were administered to assess levels of postpartum depressive and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and relational style of attachment, respectively. Multivariate analysis was applied to identify associations between quarantine measures, childbirth experience, attachment style, and EPDS and IES-R scores. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 163 women (response rate 60.8%). The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 44.2% (EPDS cut-off score &#8805; 11) and the PTSS rate was 42.9% (IES-R cut-off score &#8805; 24). Dismissive and fearful avoidant attachment styles were significantly associated with the risk of depression and PTSS, respectively. Perceived pain during birth was a risk factor for postpartum depression. Perceived support provided by healthcare staff was a protective factor against depression and PTSS. Another protective factor against PTSS was quiet on the ward due to the absence of hospital visitors. CONCLUSION: This study reports a high prevalence of postpartum depressive and PTSS in women who gave birth during the Covid-19 pandemic. Postnatal psychological distress seemed to be associated more with the prenatal experience and other individual factors than with the pandemic hospital restrictions. Early detection during pregnancy of an insecure attachment style is fundamental to provide targeted preventive and therapeutic psychological interventions.","output":"Psychosocial factors associated with postpartum psychological distress during the Covid-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Wire Arc Additive Manufactoring (WAAM), an object is welded from scratch.

The search for such welding paths in 3D can be mapped to searching for a fragmented Hamiltonian path in a mathematical graph. We propose a SAT-based approach to finding such fragmented Hamiltonian paths that is suitable for planning WAAM paths. We show how to encode the search for such paths as a mix of SAT clauses and one non-clausal constraint that can be integrated into the SAT solver itself.

Reliable figures of this reduction have not been produced yet. Our international audit aimed at giving a precise snapshot of the absolute and relative changes of emergency surgical admissions at the outbreak of the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Datasets of patients admitted as general surgical emergencies into 45 internationally distributed emergency surgical units during the months of March and April 2020 (Covid-19 pandemic outbreak) were collected and compared with those of patients admitted into the same units during the months of March and April 2019 (pre-Covid-19). Primary endpoint was to evaluate the relative variation of the presentation symptoms and discharge diagnoses between the two study periods. Secondary endpoint was to identify the possible change of therapeutic strategy during the same two periods. RESULTS: Forty-five centres participated sent their anonymised data to the study hub, for a total of 6263 patients. Of these, 3810 were admitted in the pre-Covid period and 2453 in the Covid period, for a 35.6% absolute reduction. The most common presentation was abdominal pain, whose incidence did not change between the two periods, but in the Covid period patients presented less frequently with anal pain, hernias, anaemia and weight loss. ASA 1 and low frailty patients were admitted less frequently, while ASA>1 and frail patients showed a relative increase. The type of surgical access did not change significantly, but lap-to-open conversion rate halved between the two study periods. Discharge diagnoses of appendicitis and diverticulitis reduced significantly, while bowel ischaemia and perianal ailments had a significant relative increase. CONCLUSIONS: Our audit demonstrates a significant overall reduction of emergency surgery admissions at the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic with a minimal change of the proportions of single presentations, diagnoses and treatments. These findings may open the door to new ways of managing surgical emergencies without engulfing the already busy hospitals.","output":"Emergency surgery admissions and the COVID-19 pandemic: did the first wave really change our practice?

The S protein can also mediate the formation of syncytia in infected cells. The S protein is a type I transmembrane protein that is very large compared to other viral fusion proteins, and all except a short carboxy-terminal segment of the S molecule constitutes the ectodomain. For the prototype coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), it has previously been established that S protein assembly into virions is specified by the carboxy-terminal segment, which comprises the transmembrane domain and the endodomain. We have genetically dissected these domains in the MHV S protein to localize the determinants of S incorporation into virions. Our results establish that assembly competence maps to the endodomain of S, which was shown to be sufficient to target a heterologous integral membrane protein for incorporation into MHV virions. In particular, mutational analysis indicated a major role for the charge-rich carboxy-terminal region of the endodomain. Additionally, we found that the adjacent cysteine-rich region of the endodomain is critical for fusion of infected cells, confirming results previously obtained with S protein expression systems.","output":"Genetic analysis of determinants for spike glycoprotein assembly into murine coronavirus virions: distinct roles for charge-rich and cysteine-rich regions of the endodomain."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - novel Coronavirus 2 (SARS-nCoV-2), was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December, 2019.

In order to investigate the potential SARS-CoV kidney tropism, we have evaluated the susceptibility of human renal cells of tubular and glomerular origin to in vitro SARS-CoV infection. Immortalized cultures of differentiated proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTEC), glomerular mesangial cells (MC), and glomerular epithelial cells (podocytes) were found to express the SARS-CoV receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 on their surface. Productive infection, however, occurred only in PTEC but not in glomerular cells. A transient infection with poor virus production was observed in MC, whereas podocytes were not permissive to SARS-CoV infection. In contrast to the cytopathic infection of the Vero E6 cell line, SARS-CoV did not cause overt cytopathic effects in PTEC or MC. Of interest, PTEC, but not MC, maintained stable levels of SARS-CoV production in serial subcultures, suggesting a persistent state of infection. In this regard, a SARS-CoV variant with increased replication capacity in PTEC was selected after four serial subculture passages. This SARS-CoV variant acquired a single nonconservative amino acid change from glutamic acid (E) to alanine (A) at position 11 in the viral membrane (M) protein. The E11A point mutation was sufficient for enhanced SARS-CoV replication and persistence in PTEC when introduced in a SARS-CoV recombinant infectious clone. These findings indicate that human PTEC may represent a site of SARS-CoV productive and persistent replication favoring the emergence of viral variants with increased replication capacity, at least in these kidney cells.","output":"Persistent replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in human tubular kidney cells selects for adaptive mutations in the membrane protein."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A higher incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) has been observed after haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (h-HSCT) with posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PTCY) using peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) as a source of graft. Moreover, combining PTCY with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) may help to reduce GVHD incidence. In this study, early immune reconstitution, especially of T and NK cell compartments, was compared after both types of transplant (PTCY versus PTCY + ATG) investigate their influence on patient outcomes. This retrospective study included 58 adults who received a reduced intensity conditioning to PBSC h-HSCT with cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetyl + PTCY (n = 32) or PTCY + ATG (n = 26) as GVHD prophylaxis. Both groups shared similar characteristics except for the median number of CD3+ T cells infused, significantly higher for PTCY + ATG patients. Blood samples from all patients were collected three times a week from day 0 until day 30 then at day 60 and day 90/100 to evaluate T and NK cells reconstitution by flow cytometry. The results show that PTCY + ATG versus PTCY alone significantly limits the occurrence of acute grade 2-4 GVHD after reduced intensity conditioning PBSC h-HSCT, perhaps because of the combined effect of T and NK cell reconstitution. Indeed, although a slower T cell reconstitution with PTCY + ATG may limit GVHD occurrence, the quicker reconstitution of some NK cell subtypes may help with avoiding relapse. Larger prospective studies are needed to better determine which NK cell subsets may influence the incidence of relapse after h-HSCT and optimize donor selection.","output":"Posttransplant Cyclophosphamide and Antithymocyte Globulin versus Posttransplant Cyclophosphamide as Graft-versus-Host Disease Prophylaxis for Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Haploidentical Transplants: Comparison of T Cell and NK Effector Reconstitution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"What will be the global impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19)? Answering this question requires accurate forecasting the spread of confirmed cases as well as analysis of the number of deaths and recoveries. Forecasting, however, requires ample historical data. At the same time, no prediction is certain as the future rarely repeats itself in the same way as the past. Moreover, forecasts are influenced by the reliability of the data, vested interests, and what variables are being predicted. Also, psychological factors play a significant role in how people perceive and react to the danger from the disease and the fear that it may affect them personally. This paper introduces an objective approach to predicting the continuation of the COVID-19 using a simple, but powerful method to do so. Assuming that the data used is reliable and that the future will continue to follow the past pattern of the disease, our forecasts suggest a continuing increase in the confirmed COVID-19 cases with sizable associated uncertainty. The risks are far from symmetric as underestimating its spread like a pandemic and not doing enough to contain it is much more severe than overspending and being over careful when it will not be needed.

However, this condition remains poorly recognized and undertreated. During 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted daily living and health care systems, the situation of people with chronic pain has drawn little public attention. METHODS: This qualitative study was part of a pan-Canadian mixed-methods project and aimed to understand the experiences and challenges of people living with chronic pain during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. Between May and August 2020, we conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with 22 individuals living with chronic pain across the country. We used reflexive thematic analysis to interpret data. RESULTS: Our findings underscored four dimensions of the chronic pain experience during the pandemic: (1) Reinforced vulnerability due to uncertainties regarding pain and its management; (2) Social network as a determinant of pain and psychological condition; (3) Increasing systemic inequities intermingling with the chronic pain experience; (4) More viable living conditions due to confinement measures. Though several participants reported improvements in their quality of life and reduced social pressure in the context of stay-at-home orders, participants from socio-economically deprived groups and minorities reported more challenges in accessing pain relief, health care services, and psychosocial support. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed and intensified pre-existing disparities and challenges among people living with chronic pain in terms of material resources, psychosocial condition, social support, and access to care. In post-pandemic times, it will be essential to address flaws in health and welfare policies to foster equity and social inclusiveness of people with chronic pain.","output":"Chronic pain experience and health inequities during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada: qualitative findings from the chronic pain & COVID-19 pan-Canadian study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"England has been heavily affected by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, with severe 'lockdown' mitigation measures now gradually being lifted.

Its decreased level on the cell surface correlates with poor prognosis in several tumor types.

In the presented work the question was addressed if changes in syndecan-1 expression are related to the prognosis of cervical cancer. Immunohistochemistry for syndecan-1 extracellular domain was performed on surgical specimens of primary cervical cancer. To follow the communication between tumor cells and stromal fibroblasts, their mono-and co-cultures were studied, detecting the expression of syndecan-1, smooth muscle actin, vimentin, and desmin. Immunohistochemistry of tumorous specimens revealed that while cell surface syndecan-1 expression was reduced on cancer cells, it appeared on the surface of tumor-associated fibroblasts. Until year 7, the cohort with high cell surface syndecan-1 expression had significantly longer survival. No difference in the same time-period could be detected when stromal syndecan-1 expression was analyzed. In vitro analysis revealed, that tumor cells can induce syndecan-1 expression on fibroblast, and fibroblasts showed that fibroblast-like cells are built by two cell types: (a) syndecan-1 positive, cytokeratin negative real fibroblasts, and (b) syndecan-1 and cytokeratin positive epithelial-mesenchymal transformed tumor cells.

Exposure to epidemics and confinement have been consistently associated with psychological consequences, but changes on lifestyle behaviors remain under-researched. Materials and Methods: An online survey was conducted among the general population living in Spain during the COVID-19 home-isolation. In addition to demographic and clinical data, participants self-reported changes in seven lifestyle domains. The Short Multidimensional Inventory Lifestyle Evaluation was developed specifically to evaluate changes during the confinement (SMILE-C). Results: A total of 1254 individuals completed the survey over the first week of data collection. The internal consistency of the SMILE-C to assess lifestyles during confinement was shown (Cronbach's Alpha=0.747). Most participants reported substantial changes on outdoor time (93.6%) and physical activity (70.2%). Moreover, about one third of subjects reported significant changes on stress management, social support, and restorative sleep. Several demographic and clinical factors were associated to lifestyle scores. In the multivariate model, those independently associated with a healthier lifestyle included substantial changes on stress management (p<0.001), social support (p=0.001) and outdoor time (p<0.001), amongst others.

A total of 74 patients with 2019-nCoV were continuously enrolled between January 22 and March 2, 2020 at Zhejiang Hospital. Diagnosis was confirmed at Zhejiang Hospital by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), which was approved by the Chinese government. Subsequently, the clinical features between positive- and negative-NCP patients in Zhejiang were compared. Among the 74 hospitalized patients with suspected 2019-NCP, six patients (one male and five female patients) were confirmed to be infected with 2019-nCoV by RT-PCR. The average age of the confirmed patients was 4013 years. There were three family clusters among the confirmed cases, one patient from each of these families had travel history or contact with patients from Wuhan within 2 weeks. Compared with non-NCP patients, the most common symptoms at onset for patients with NCP were fever (5/6; 83.3%) and cough (5/6; 83.3%), followed by dyspnea/pharyngalgia (2/6; 33.3%), whereas myalgia (1/6; 16.7%) and fatigue (1/6; 16.7%) were less common.

It has made possible to identify almost 300,000 SARS-CoV-2 different genetic variants, connecting them with clinical and epidemiological findings. Among this immense data collection, that constitutes the biggest evolutionary experiment in history, is buried the answer to what will happen in the future. Will new strains, more contagious than the current ones or resistant to the vaccines, arise by mutation? Although theoretic population genetics is, by far, the most powerful tool we have to do an accurate prediction, it has been barely used for the study of SARS-CoV-2 due to its conceptual difficulty. Having in mind that the size of the SARS-CoV-2 population is astronomical we can apply a discrete treatment, based on the branching process method, Fokker-Plank equations and Kolmogoroffs forward equations, to calculate the survival likelihood through time, to elucidate the likelihood to become dominant genotypes and how long will this take, for new SARS-CoV-2 mutants depending on their selective advantage. Results show that most of the new mutants that will arise in the SARS-CoV-2 meta-population will stay at very low frequencies. However, some few new mutants, significantly more infectious than current ones, will still emerge and become dominant in the population favoured by a great selective advantage. Far from showing a mutational meltdown, SARS-CoV-2 meta-population will increase its fitness becoming more infective. There is a probability, small but finite, that new mutants arise resistant to some vaccines. High infected numbers and slow vaccination programs will significantly increase this likelihood.","output":"Sword of Damocles or choosing well.

Stay-at-home orders and other COVID-19 mitigation strategies have resulted in reduced shelter availability and increased intimate partner violence rates. Coupled with the economic impact of the pandemic, these factors have threatened financial and housing stability. To better understand these challenges and provide immediate support, The National Alliance for Safe Housing (NASH) co-hosted a peer support call to provide a virtual platform for practitioners to ask questions, discuss challenges, and share strategies for quality service provision during the COVID-19 pandemic. Over 800 practitioners from across the United States participated in the NASH call, most of whom were advocates, program directors, and managers. NASH gathered data on practitioners needs from a brief survey from the registration form analyzed using conventional inductive content analysis. Practitioners primary concerns were situated within eight questions, which we categorized into four meta-categories: (1) managing residential housing programs; (2) getting survivors materials resources; (3) keeping staff safe; and (4) maintaining organizational operations.

These stents usually pass spontaneously, but they can be retained and, rarely, this may cause biliary obstruction. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this paper is twofold: to describe the appearance of biliary tract obstruction caused by retained surgical stents in pediatric liver transplants, and to report how these stents can be removed using interventional radiology techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS Three pediatric patients presenting with biochemical and imaging evidence of biliary obstruction were encountered over a 6-month period. At percutaneous cholangiography all patients were found to have retained surgical stents which appeared to be causing biliary tract obstruction. Percutaneous snaring of the stents was undertaken. RESULTS All stents were successfully removed using interventional radiology techniques, and follow-up showed no evidence of recurrent obstruction. CONCLUSION Surgical stents in children undergoing hepaticojejunostomy may be retained and cause biliary obstruction. Radiologists involved with imaging these patients should be aware of this potential cause of biliary obstruction. This complication is amenable to interventional radiology techniques with good long-term results. There is no easy endoscopic or surgical treatment option in these patients.","output":"Retained surgical stents as a cause of biliary obstruction in pediatric liver transplants."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, in-vitro setups, and experimental ex-vivo approaches have been applied to numerous alveolar geometries over the past years. They aimed to study and examine airflow patterns, particle transport, and particle-alveolar wall deposition fractions. These studies are imperative to both pharmaceutical and toxicological studies, especially nowadays with the escalation of the menacing COVID-19 virus. However, most of these studies ignored the surfactant layer that covers the alveoli and the effect of the air-surfactant surface tension on flow dynamics and air-alveolar surface mechanics. The present study employs a realistic human breathing profile of 4.75 to emphasize the importance of the surfactant layer by numerically comparing airflow phenomena between a surfactant-enriched and surfactant-deficient model. The acinar model exhibits physiologically accurate alveolar and duct dimensions extending from lung generations 18 to 23. Proximal lung generations experience dominant recirculating flow while farther generations in the distal alveolar region exhibit dominant radial flows. In the surfactant-enriched model, surface tension values alternate during inhalation and exhalation. In the surfactant-deficient model, only water coats the alveolar walls. Results showed that surfactant deficiency in the alveoli adversely alters airflow behavior and generates unsteady chaotic breathing through the production of vorticities, accompanied by higher vorticity and velocity magnitudes. In addition, high air-water surface tension in the surfactant-deficient case was found to induce higher shear stress values on the alveolar walls than that of the surfactant-enriched case. Overall, it was concluded that the presence of the surfactant improves respiratory mechanics and allows for smooth breathing and normal respiration.","output":"Surface tension effects on flow dynamics and alveolar mechanics in the acinar region of human lung"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Vaccinia virus-infected BSC 40 cells do not permit the replication of superinfecting vaccinia virus. The extent of superinfecting virus propagation depends on the time of superinfection; there is 90% exclusion by 4 hr after the initial infection, and more than 99% by 6 hr. When superinfection is attempted at 6 hr after infection, the superinfecting virus is incapable of carrying out DNA replication or early gene transcription, demonstrating that an early event in the virus life cycle is inhibited. The rate of adsorption of the superinfecting virus is unaltered which shows that exclusion is affected at a point between adsorption and early gene transcription. In order to exclude superinfection, the primary infecting virus does not require replication of its DNA or expression of its late genes but it must express one or more early genes.","output":"Superinfection exclusion of vaccinia virus in virus-infected cell cultures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: We aimed to predict the trend of coronavirus (COVID-19) in India using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model Even though many models are available, ARIMA is found to be the best in COVID-19 situation;because ARIMA uses actual data and predicts accurately for a short period and thus proved as an effective public health tool especially in COVID-19 pandemic On the contrary, most of the other models uses assumptions instead of actual data;based on agent, host, environmental factors, which is not yet clearly understood in this pandemic and those models will suit for well-understood diseases Materials and methods: The trend of COVID-19 was predicted using Gretl software and ARIMA model Information about the COVID-19 was collected on a daily basis during January 1, 2020 to July 4, 2020 and predicted from July 5 to August 30, 2020 Various ARIMA models were assessed and the best one was selected Then, the model's fitness was evaluated based on the normality of the residuals' distribution, based on the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) We also compared the first 20 days' data with actual data","output":"Autoregressive integrated moving average model for forecasting coronavirus 2019 in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Many RNA viruses arise from animal reservoirs, namely bats, rodents and insectivores but mechanisms of virus maintenance and transmission still need to be addressed. The bicolored white-toothed shrew (Crocidura leucodon) has recently been identified as reservoir of the neurotropic Borna disease virus 1 (BoDV-1). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Six out of eleven wild living bicoloured white-toothed shrews were trapped and revealed to be naturally infected with BoDV-1. All shrews were monitored in captivity in a long-term study over a time period up to 600 days that differed between the individual shrews. Interestingly, all six animals showed an asymptomatic course of infection despite virus shedding via various routes indicating a highly adapted host-pathogen interaction. Infectious virus and viral RNA were demonstrated in saliva, urine, skin swabs, lacrimal fluid and faeces, both during the first 8 weeks of the investigation period and for long time shedding after more than 250 days in captivity. CONCLUSIONS: The various ways of shedding ensure successful virus maintenance in the reservoir population but also transmission to accidental hosts such as horses and sheep. Naturally BoDV-1-infected living shrews serve as excellent tool to unravel host and pathogen factors responsible for persistent viral co-existence in reservoir species while maintaining their physiological integrity despite high viral load in many organ systems.","output":"Shedding of Infectious Borna Disease Virus-1 in Living Bicolored White-Toothed Shrews"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) is currently classified within the Togaviridae family. In an effort to obtain further information on the characteristics of this virus, we have begun to sequence the viral RNA genome and to map the virion structural protein genes.

A 3 noncoding region of 80 nucleotides followed by two complete open reading frames (ORFs) were found within this sequence. The two ORFs were in different reading frames and overlapped each other by 11 nucleotides. One ORF encoded a protein of 170 amino acids and the other ORF, located adjacent to the 3 noncoding region of the viral genome, encoded a 114 amino acid protein. Thirty-three N-terminal residues were sequenced directly from purified LDV capsid protein, Vpi, and this amino acid sequence mapped to the ORF adjacent to the 3 noncoding region. The presence of overlapping ORFs and the 3 terminal map position of Vpi indicate that LDV differs significantly from the prototype alpha togaviruses.","output":"Map location of lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) capsid protein (Vpl) gene"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The vulnerability thesis is one of the most important legal concepts in contemporary legal theory. Apart from being studied by legal scholars, the notion of vulnerability has been embodied in concrete legal rules and transferred to national case law allowing courts to set its boundaries by the power of judicial interpretation. Even though it would be hard to contest Schroeder and Gefenas's statement that it is not necessary for an academic to say what vulnerability is because common sense dictates the existence of it, recent scholarly analysis clearly shows that the concept itself has become intolerably vague and slippery. More precisely, it is not quite clear what the essence of vulnerability is and what the effects of its gradation as well as repercussions are on other constitutional institutes across the human rights spectrum. The noted vagueness poses a great concern, particularly in the time of COVID-19, the greatest social stressor that humanity has faced in recent months. The COVID-19 crisis has had untold consequences on our health, mental well-being, educational growth, and economic stability. In order for the state to bear the COVID-19 social burden and adequately protect the vulnerable, it is of the utmost importance to set clear guidance for the interpretation and implementation of the vulnerability concept. Seeking to contribute to literature on these issues, the author brings light to constitutional and criminal legal standards on vulnerability set within the current jurisprudence and doctrine. Bearing in mind the influence of the European Court of Human Rights (hereinafter, the ECtHR or the Court) on developments in human rights law, 196 judgments related to vulnerability have been retrieved from the HUDOC database using a keywords search strategy. The quantitative analysis was supplemented with more in-depth qualitative linguistic research of the Court's reasoning in cases concerning vulnerable children, persons suffering from mental illness and victims of family violence. Although the vulnerability reasoning has considerably expended their rights within the ambit of the Convention, the analysis has shown that inconsistencies and ambiguities emerge around the formulation of the applicant's vulnerability and its gradation with respect to positive obligations.

The manifestations are heterogeneous and vary in their frequency. Their multisystem nature requires a holistic approach to management. There are sparse data from the South Asian region on the outcomes of hospital-discharged COVID-19 patients. We assessed the posthospital discharge outcomes of a cohort of Sri Lankan COVID-19 patients and explored the factors that influenced these outcomes. METHODS: Data were prospectively collected from patients who were discharged following an admission to the Nawaloka Hospital, Sri Lanka with COVID-19 from March to June 2021. At discharge, their demographic, clinical and laboratory findings were recorded. The patients were categorised as having mild, moderate and severe COVID-19, based on the Sri Lanka Ministry of Health COVID-19 guidelines. Following discharge, information on health status, complications and outcomes was collected through clinic visits and preplanned telephone interviews. A validated (in Sri Lanka) version of the Short Form 36 health survey questionnaire (SF-36) was used to assess multi-item dimensions health status of the patients at 1, 2 and 3 mo postdischarge. RESULTS: We collected data on 203 patients (male, n=111 [54.7%]). The level of vaccination was significantly associated with disease severity (p<0.001). Early recovery was seen in the mild group compared with the moderate and severe groups. At 3 mo, on average 98% of mild and 90% of moderate/severe patients had recovered. Based on the SF-36, physical functioning dimensions, role limitation due to physical and emotional health, energy/ fatigue, emotional well-being, social functioning, pain and general health were significantly different in the moderate/severe vs mild COVID-19 groups at 1, 2 and 3 mo postdischarge (p<0.05). Twenty-three patients developed complications, of which the most common were myocardial infarction with heart failure (n=6/23; 26.1%), cerebrovascular accident (n=6/23; 26.1%) and respiratory tract infections (n=3/23; 13.01%) and there were six deaths. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, receiving two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine was associated with reduced disease severity. Those with mild disease recovered faster than those with moderate/severe disease.

After infection with SARS-COV-2, patients often experience fever, cough, gas prostration, dyspnea and other symptoms, which can lead to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), kidney failure and even death. The SARS-COV-2 virus is particularly infectious and has led to a global infection crisis, with an explosion in the number of infections. Therefore, rapid and accurate detection of the virus plays a vital role. At present, many detection methods are limited in their wide application due to their defects such as high preparation cost, poor stability and complex operation process. Moreover, some methods need to be operated by professional medical staff, which can easily lead to infection. In order to overcome these problems, a Surface molecular imprinting technology (SM-MIT) is proposed for the first time to detect SARS-COV-2 virus. For this SM-MIT method, this review provides detailed detection principles and steps. In addition, this method not only has the advantages of low cost, high stability and good specificity, but also can detect whether it is infected at designated points.

In particular, it enables the precise determination of when the limit to exponential growth is reached and exceeded. A variety of possible developments is examined, including linear and exponential growth of the infection numbers as well as sub- and super-exponential growth. It turned out useful to incorporate the incidence as a further epidemiological indicator. It is used for calculating the trace that the progression of the pandemic leaves behind on a plain spanned by itself and the acceleration parameter.

Reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction has been targeted as a promising pathway to convert CO(2) into syngas which is the primary reactive in several reactions to obtain high-value chemicals. Among the different catalysts reported for RWGS, the nickel-based catalyst has been proposed as an alternative to the expensive noble metal catalyst. However, Ni-based catalysts tend to be less active in RWGS reaction conditions due to preference to CO(2) methanation reaction and to the sintering and coke formation. Due to this, the aim of this work is to study the effect of the potassium (K) in Ni/CeO(2) catalyst seeking the optimal catalyst for low-temperature RWGS reaction. We synthesised Ni-based catalyst with different amounts of K:Ni ratio (0.5:10, 1:10, and 2:10) and fully characterised using different physicochemical techniques where was observed the modification on the surface characteristics as a function of the amount of K. Furthermore, it was observed an improvement in the CO selectivity at a lower temperature as a result of the K-Ni-support interactions but also a decrease on the CO(2) conversion. The 1K catalyst presented the best compromise between CO(2) conversion, suppression of CO(2) methanation and enhancing CO selectivity. Finally, the experimental results were contrasted with the trends obtained from the thermodynamics process modelling observing that the result follows in good agreement with the modelling trends giving evidence of the promising behaviour of the designed catalysts in CO(2) high-scale units.","output":"K-Promoted Ni-Based Catalysts for Gas-Phase CO(2) Conversion: Catalysts Design and Process Modelling Validation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments around the world now recommend, or require, that their citizens cover the lower half of their face in public.

Participants judged whether two simultaneously presented face photographs showed the same person or two different people. We superimposed images of surgical masks over the faces, creating three different mask conditions: control (no masks), mixed (one face wearing a mask), and masked (both faces wearing masks). We found that surgical face masks have a large detrimental effect on human face matching performance, and that the degree of impairment is the same regardless of whether one or both faces in each pair are masked. Surprisingly, this impairment is similar in size for both familiar and unfamiliar faces. When matching masked faces, human observers are biased to reject unfamiliar faces as mismatches and to accept familiar faces as matches. Finally, the face recognition system showed very high classification accuracy for control and masked stimuli, even though it had not been trained to recognise masked faces. However, accuracy fell markedly when one face was masked and the other was not.

Beyond the depletion of research funds, bot infiltration threatens data integrity and may disproportionately harm research with marginalized populations. Based on our experience, we recommend the use of strategies such as qualitative questions, duplicate demographic questions, and incentive raffles to reduce likelihood of mischievous respondents. These protections can be undertaken to ensure data integrity and facilitate research on vulnerable populations.","output":"Ensuring survey research data integrity in the era of internet bots"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION A subset of patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG) require eventual conversion to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) due to complications from SG or to enhance weight loss. The aim of this study is to characterize the indications for conversion and perioperative outcomes in a large cohort of these patients at a single institution. METHODS Patients who underwent revisional surgery to convert SG to RYGB at our institution from January 2008 through January 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS Eighty-nine patients with previous SG underwent conversion to RYGB as part of a planned two-stage approach to gastric bypass (n = 36), for weight recidivism (n = 11), or for complications related to SG (n = 42). Complications from SG that warranted conversion included refractory GERD (40.5%), sleeve stenosis (31.0%), gastrocutaneous (16.7%), or gastropleural (7.1%) fistula, and gastric torsion (4.1%). The mean (SD) age was 47.2 years (11.4 years) and median BMI at the time of revision was 43.2 kg/m2. A laparoscopic approach was successfully completed in 76 patients (85.4%), with an additional of four completed robotically (4.5%). The median length of stay was 3 days. Twenty-eight patients (31.5%) had complications which included surgical site infection (20.2%), re-operation (6.7%), anastomotic stricture (3.4%), and one pulmonary embolism. There were no mortalities with a median follow-up of 15 months. CONCLUSIONS Conversion of SG to RYGB is safe and technically feasible when performed for complications of SG or to enhance weight loss. This operation can be successfully performed laparoscopically with a low rate of conversion and reasonable complication profile.","output":"Conversion of Sleeve Gastrectomy to Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An 87-year-old woman presented to us with a 5-day history of worsening epigastric pain and vomiting.

The applications of metagenomics to monitor and identify the prevalence/endemicity and emergence of these pathogenic agents from different sources were examined. Methods Articles published in English language up to October 2020 were searched for on PubMed. Qualitative and quantitative data extracted from the included articles were translated into charts and maps. GraphPad Prism 9.0.2 was used to undertake statistical analysis using descriptive and column statistics, Chi-square, ANOVA, Wilcoxons signed-rank, and one-sample t-test. Results In all, 143 articles from 39 countries from Europe, America, Asia, and Africa were quantitatively analysed. Metagenomes from sewage/wastewater, surface water samples (ocean, sea, river lake, stream and tap water), WWTP, effluents and sludge samples contained pathogenic bacteria (Aeromonas, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, Bacteroides, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii), viruses (Adenovirus, Enterovirus, Hepatovirus, Mamastrovirus and Rotavirus) and parasites (Acanthamoeba, Giardia, Entamoeba, Blastocystis and Naegleria). Integrons, plasmids, transposons, insertion sequences, prophages and integrative and conjugative elements were identified. ARGs mediating resistance to important antibiotics, including -lactams, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and tetracycline, and virulence factors such as secretion system, adherence, antiphagocytosis, capsule, invasion, iron uptake, hemolysin, and flagella. Conclusion Clinically important pathogens, ARGs, and MGEs were identified in diverse clinical, environmental, and animal sources through metagenomics, which can be used to determine the prevalence and emergence of known and unknown pathogens and ARGs.

However, the diagnosis of sepsis and the prediction of mortality are challenging in COVID-19 patients, especially in the early stage of sepsis. Research about the performance of SIRS criteria and qSOFA score in patients with COVID sepsis is limited. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the performance of SIRS, qSOFA, and a combination of both in hospitalized COVID-19 adult patients regarding the diagnosis of sepsis and the prediction of in-hospital mortality. METHODS: Retrospective data analysis included 341 patients who were hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection during April 2020 and January 2021 (the peaks of the first and second waves in New York state) at a 242-bed university-affiliated community-based hospital. Data from the initial patient encounter at the emergency room was collected by reviewing the electronic health records. SIRS criteria, qSOFA score, and a combination of both (SIRS+qSOFA) were analyzed by the MATLAB software. SIRS+qSOFA includes 5 parameters: tachypnea (respiratory rate  22), tachycardia (heart rate >90/min), fever or hypothermia (temperature >38C (100.4F) or < 36C (96.8F)), leukocytosis, leukopenia or bandemia (WBC > 12000/mm3, < 4000/mm3, or > 10% bands), altered mentation, and hypotension (systolic blood pressure 100 mmHg). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) was calculated to evaluate the performance of SIRS, qSOFA, and SIRS+qSOFA. RESULTS: In 341 COVID-19 patients, 128 patients were diagnosed with sepsis (37.5%), which included 77 expired patients (60.2%);213 patients were not diagnosed with sepsis (62.5%), which included 50 expired patients (23.5%). The AUCs for the diagnosis of sepsis with SIRS, qSOFA, and SIRS+qSOFA were 0.739, 0.731, and 0.793, respectively. The AUCs for the prediction of mortality with SIRS, qSOFA, and SIRS+qSOFA were 0.593, 0.665, and 0.646, respectively. For diagnosing sepsis, the sensitivity of SIRS ( 2), qSOFA ( 2), and SIRS+qSOFA ( 3) were 82.0%, 48.4%, and 68.8%, respectively;the specificity of SIRS ( 2), qSOFA ( 2), and SIRS+qSOFA ( 3) were 54.9%, 85.4%, and 76.5%, respectively. For predicting mortality, the sensitivity of SIRS ( 2), qSOFA ( 2), and SIRS+qSOFA ( 3) were 68.5%, 42.5%, and 55.9%, respectively;the specificity of SIRS ( 2), qSOFA ( 2), and SIRS+qSOFA ( 3) were 46.7%, 81.8%, and 68.7%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: For diagnosing sepsis in COVID-19 patients, the performance of SIRS+qSOFA with 5 parameters (AUC=0.793) is better than either SIRS (AUC=0.739) or qSOFA (AUC=0.731). For predicting mortality, the performance of qSOFA (AUC=0.665) is superior to either SIRS (AUC=0.593) or SIRS+qSOFA (AUC=0.646).

The rapid rise and spread of the EVD outbreak threatened health security in neighboring countries and global health security. The United Nations developed an EVD preparedness and readiness (EVD-PR) plan to assist the nine neighboring countries to advance their critical preparedness measures. In Uganda, EVD-PR was implemented between 2018 and 2019. The World Health Organization commissioned an independent evaluation to assess the impact of the investment in EVD-PR in Uganda. Objectives: i) to document the program achievements; ii) to determine if the capacities developed represented good value for the funds and resources invested; iii) to assess if more cost-effective or sustainable alternative approaches were available; iv) to explore if the investments were aligned with country public health priorities; and v) to document the factors that contributed to the program success or failure. METHODS: during the EVD preparedness phase, Uganda's government conducted a risk assessment and divided the districts into three categories, based on the potential risk of EVD. Category I included districts that shared a border with the DRC provinces where EVD was ongoing or any other district with a direct transport route to the DRC. Category II were districts that shared a border with the DRC but not bordering the DRC provinces affected by the EVD outbreak. Category III was the remaining districts in Uganda. EVD-PR was implemented at the national level and in 22 category I districts. We interviewed key informants involved in program design, planning and implementation or monitoring at the national level and in five purposively selected category I districts. RESULTS: Ebola virus disease preparedness and readiness was a success and this was attributed mainly to donor support, the ministry of health's technical capacity, good coordination, government support and community involvement. The resources invested in EVD-PR represented good value for the funds and the activities were well aligned to the public health priorities for Uganda. CONCLUSION: Ebola virus disease preparedness and readiness program in Uganda developed capacities that played an essential role in preventing cross border spread of EVD from the affected provinces in the DRC and enabled rapid containment of the two importation events.

Patients with pre-existent chronic morbidities are likely to be more severely affected by SARS-Cov2 infection. In Italy, the Societ Italiana Talassemie ed Emoglobinopatie (SITE) has recently estimated the number of patients (Pts) with Hemoglobinopathies followed by Italian Specialized Centers (SITE Network). Five thousand Transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT), 1900 Non-Transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (NTDT) and 2000 Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) were registered [1]. To verify the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on Pts with Hemoglobinopathies, we performed a specific survey by electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). Inclusion criteria included positive swab or serology in a patient with hemoglobinopathy and at least 15 days of follow-up from either the onset of symptoms or SARS-CoV2 positivity. The survey was approved by the Ethics Committee, and eCRF was shared with the Centers of Italian Hemoglobinopathies Network. Preliminary data updated to April 10, 2020, were published [2]. Results. As of July 31, 2020, 27 cases have been reported: 18 TDT, 4 NTDT, 5 SCD. 89% of the cases were in Northern Italy, where the rate of infection was much higher than the rest of the country, reflecting the national epidemiology. The mean age of thalassemia patients (TDT and NTDT) was 4311 years, and 55% were male; the mean age of SCD patients was 3315 years, and 40% was male. The likely source of infection has been detected in 63% (17/27) of cases: 11 had occupational exposure, 6 had a positive relative. Five patients were asymptomatic: for them, the SARS-CoV-2 infection was identified by positive swab for 1 patient and by positive level of IgG for 4. Twenty patients had associated comorbidities, 14 were splenectomized, and 3 had functional asplenia. Eleven patients were hospitalized, only one in high-intensity care unit. Three patients required more intensive ventilation support with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), one of these has a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated with chemotherapy in the previous year. Three other patients required support by oxygen. No Pts required intubation. Two Pts increased blood requirement. Only five received supposedly specific treatment for COVID-19: two hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), one HCQ plus ritonavir/darunavir, and one HCQ plus anakinra, one HCQ plus Tocilizumab plus Lopinavir/Ritonavir. The clinical course of hospitalized patients was 187 days. All patients recovered. Conclusions. The prevalence of COVID-19 infection in Italian patients with Hemoglobinopathies result 0,3% while in general population the prevalence in Italy is 0,4% [3]. Considering that the thalassemia population is more strictly observed, we could postulate that the precautions suggested or self-applied by the Pts were effective. No death nor severe SARS with intubation, nor signs of cytokines storm, only one thromboembolic event was observed although most individuals had pre-existing complications. A single case with pulmonary hypertension has been described in detail [4]. In most individuals the infection has been pauci or asymptomatic and all recovered. This experience differs from what has been observed in Iran on a similar series with different severity and mortality and ask for a more in-depth comparison [5]. In conclusion, our data do not indicate increased severity of COVID-19 in Pts with Hemoglobinopathies followed in Specialized Centers. Acknowledgment.

The model also exposes the different parameters that have an impact on the spread of the disease and the various decision variables that can be used to control it (e.g, social distancing, number of tests administered to single out infected subjects). The model describes the stochastic phenomena that underlie the spread of the epidemic and captures, in the form of deterministic parameters, some fundamental limitations in the availability of resources (hospital beds and test swabs). The model lends itself to different uses. For a given control policy, it is possible to verify if it satisfies an analytical property on the stochastic evolution of the state (e.g., to compute probability that the hospital beds will reach a fill level, or that a specified percentage of the population will die). If the control policy is not given, it is possible to apply POMDP techniques to identify an optimal control policy that fulfils some specified probabilistic goals.

During the COVID-19 outbreak, frequency of sensory disorders (smell and/or taste) in affected patients has shown a high variability from 5 to 98%, depending on the methodology, country, and study. RECENT FINDINGS: A sudden, severe, isolated loss of smell and/or taste, in the absence of other upper airway inflammatory diseases (allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, nasal polyposis), should alert individuals and physicians on being potentially affected by COVID-19. The evaluation of smell/taste disorders with a visual analogue scale or an individual olfactory or gustatory test, at the hospital or by telemedicine, to prevent contamination might facilitate an early detection of infected patients and reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. During the COVID-19 outbreak, patients with sudden loss of smell should initiate social distancing and home isolation measures and be tested for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test when available. Olfactory training is recommended when smell does not come back after 1 month but can be started earlier.","output":"The Loss of Smell and Taste in the COVID-19 Outbreak: a Tale of Many Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic restrictions impacted dietary habits during the initial months of the pandemic, but long-term effects are unclear. In this longitudinal study, self-selected UK adults (n=1,733) completed three online surveys (May-June, August-September and November-December 2020, with a retrospective pre-pandemic component in the baseline survey), self-reporting sociodemographics, lifestyle and behaviours, including high fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) snacks, HFSS meals and fruit and vegetable (FV) intake. Data were analysed using generalised estimating equations. Monthly HFSS snacks portion intake increased from pre-pandemic levels (48.3) in May-June (57.6, p<0.001), decreased in August-September (43.7, p<0.001), before increasing back to pre-pandemic levels in November-December (49.2, p<0.001). 48.5% self-reported increased (25.9 [95% confidence interval: 24.1, 27.8]) and 47.7% self-reported decreased (24.1 [22.4,26.0]) monthly HFSS snacks portion intakes in November-December compared with pre-pandemic levels. Monthly HFSS meals portion intake decreased from pre-pandemic levels (7.1) in May-June (5.9, p<0.001), being maintained in August-September (5.9, p=0.897), and then increasing again in November-December (6.6, p<0.001), to intakes that remained lower than pre-pandemic levels (p=0.007). 35.2% self-reported increased (4.8 [4.3, 5.3]) and 44.5% self-reported decreased (5.1 [4.6,5.6]) monthly HFSS meals portion intakes in November-December compared with pre-pandemic levels. The proportion meeting FV intake recommendations was stable from pre-pandemic through to August-September (70%), but decreased in November-December 2020 (67%, p=0.034). Increased monthly HFSS snacks intake was associated with female gender, lower quality of life, and - in a time-varying manner - older age and higher HFSS meals intake. Increased monthly HFSS meals intake was associated with female gender, living with adults only and higher HFSS snacks intake. Reduced FV intake was associated with higher body mass index (BMI) and lower physical activity. These results suggest large interindividual variability in dietary change during the first year of the pandemic, with important public health implications in individuals experiencing persistent increases in unhealthy diet choices, associated with BMI, gender, quality of life, living conditions, physical activity and other dietary behaviours.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on diet behaviour among UK adults: a longitudinal analysis of the HEBECO study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Attendance management system is always an important entity for any of the organization, a number of attendance system like barcode, RFID, finger-print recognition system are already available in the market While various companies are using different types of attendance management system according to their budget and convenience Few of the designed and adopted systems have their own drawbacks like data handling, data security and privacy of the information In this pape, we have proposed and designed a secured attendance management system with Secret sharing algorithm The main objective is to automate the attendance system and provide the complete authentic and secure database of all the employees or users Due to Covid-19 maximum of the organizations are trying to adopt the attendance management system without any physical connectivity or manual intervention Our proposed solution is the best feasible solution to handle the stated problems Attendance can be marked by scanning the QR code with a mobile phone at distant locations while secret sharing security algorithm is providing the security by distributing the complete code into number of secret shares which can be only recovered by authentic entities so integrity and privacy of the information is maintained properly ? 2020 IEEE","output":"A secured automated Attendance Management System implemented with Secret Sharing Algorithm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Indoor environments contribute significantly to total human exposure to air pollutants, as people spend most of their time indoors.

The neutralizing antibody titers of rabbits immunized with adjuvanted VLPs were similar to those immunized with the replication-competent VSV, indicating that presentation of the antigen in its native conformation rather than de novo antigen expression is essential for production of functional antibodies. This approach also yielded high-titer antisera against Nipah virus glycoproteins, illustrating that it is transferable to other virus families. Multiple-step immunoglobulin G purification using a two-step 20C40% ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by protein A affinity chromatography resulted in 90% recovery of functionality and sustained in vivo stability.

In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of recently-developed reduced-toxicity myeloablative regimen that combines fludarabine, intravenous busulfan, and melphalan (FBM). METHODS: We conducted a single-center retrospective analysis of 39 patients (23 with myeloid neoplasms and 16 with lymphoid neoplasms), with a median age of 50 (range, 17-68) years, who underwent their first allo-HCT using the FBM regimen. Graft types were bone marrow in 11, peripheral blood in 11, and cord blood in 17 patients. Cyclosporine- or tacrolimus-based graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was administered. The primary end point of the study was the overall survival rate at 2-year after transplantation. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 910 days for the surviving patients, 2-year overall survival was 62% for the entire cohort; 73% in the low-to-intermediate-risk group and 44% in the high-to-very high-risk group classified by the refined CIBMTR Disease Risk Index. Cumulative incidences of engraftment, grade II-IV acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, relapse, and non-relapse mortality were 95%, 56%, 56%, 31%, and 17%, respectively. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that our FBM regimen can be applied to allo-HCT using various graft types and yields acceptable outcomes with relatively low non-relapse mortality in both myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms. Also, we observed a promising survival in the group of patients with high-risk diseases, warranting more accumulation of patients and longer follow-up.","output":"Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation using fludarabine plus myeloablative busulfan and melphalan confers promising survival in high-risk hematopoietic neoplasms: a single-center retrospective analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previous studies indicated that the nucleocapsid (N) protein of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) interacted with specific sequences in the 3 non-coding region of IBV RNA.

The two (32)P-labeled probes that interacted with N and the amino and carboxyl fragments of N were RNA consisting of the IBV N gene and adjacent 3 non-coding terminus, and RNA consisting of the 155-nucleotide sequences at the 3 end of the 504-nt 3 untranslated region. In contrast, the polypeptide fragment from the middle region, residues 101C283, did not interact with these 3 IBV RNAs. The binding site in the amino region of N was either not present or only partially present in the first 91 residues because no interaction with RNA was observed with the polypeptide incorporating these residues. Cache Valley virus N expressed with a histidine tag, bovine serum albumin, and the basic lysozyme protein did not shift the IBV RNA. The lower molarities of the carboxyl fragment compared with residue 1C274 fragment needed for equivalent shifts suggested that the binding avidity for RNA at the carboxyl domain was greater than the amino domain.","output":"The amino and carboxyl domains of the infectious bronchitis virus nucleocapsid protein interact with 3 genomic RNA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this paper focuses on two sub-tasks related to aspect-based sentiment analysis, namely, aspect category detection (ACD) and aspect category polarity (ACP) in the Persian language. Its ability to identify all aspects discussed in the text is what makes aspect-based sentiment analysis so important and useful. While aspect-based sentiment analysis analyses all aspects of the text, it will be most useful when it is able to identify their polarity along with their identification. Most of the previous methods only focus on solving one of these sub-tasks separately or use two separate models. Thus, the process is pipelined, that is, the aspects are identified before the polarities are identified. In practice, these methods lead to model errors that are unsuitable for practical applications. In other words, ACD mistakes are sent to ACP. In this paper, we propose a multi-task learning model based on deep neural networks, which can concurrently detect aspect category and detect aspect category polarity. We evaluated the proposed method using a Persian language dataset in the movie domain on different deep learning-based models. Final experiments show that the CNN model has better results than other models. The reason is CNN's capability to extract local features. Since sentiment is expressed using specific words and phrases, CNN has been able to be more efficient in identifying these in this dataset.iments show that the CNN model has better results than other models.","output":"Joint Learning for Aspect and Polarity Classification in Persian Reviews Using Multi-Task Deep Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Renewable energy policies emphasize both the utilization of renewable energy sources and the improvement of energy efficiency. Over the past decade, built-in photovoltaic (BIPV) technologies have mostly focused on using photovoltaic ideas and have been shown to aid buildings that partially meet their load as sustainable solar energy generating technologies. It is challenging to install conventional photovoltaic systems on curved facades. In this research, elastic solar panels assisted by flexible photovoltaic systems (FPVs) were developed, fabricated, and analyzed on a 1 m2 scale. A flexible structure on a flat, hemispherical, and cylindrical substrate was studied in real terms. Using the LabVIEW application, warm and dry climate data has been recognized and transmitted online. The results showed that when installed on the silo and biogas interfaces, the fill factor was 88% and 84%, respectively. Annual energy production on the flat surface was 810 kWh, on the cylindrical surface was 960 kWh, and on the hemisphere surface was 1000 kWh, respectively. The economic results indicate that the net present value (NPV) at a flat surface is USD 697.52, with an internal rate of return (IRR) of 34.81% and a capital return term of 8.58 years. Cylindrical surfaces and hemispheres each see an increase of USD 955.18. The investment yield returned 39.29% and 40.47% for cylindrical and hemispheres structures. A 20% increase in fixed investment in the flat system increased IRR by 21.3%, while this increase was 25.59% in the cylindrical system and 24.58% in the hemisphere.

METHODS Six consecutive patients were included in this study with the following criteria of inclusion: (1) failure of dual antiplatelet therapy defined as recurrent TIA or ischemic stroke, (2) presence of ICS of 70 %, and (3) endovascular accessibility of the target lesion as judged by CTA or MRA. Technical feasibility, safety, and efficacy were observed for the first-ballon-then-stent (FBTS) technique using the percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) balloon microcatheter over which a self-expandable microstent can be directly delivered obviating the need to exchange microcatheters. RESULTS FBTS was performed in six patients (four female, median age 69, median stenosis 82.5 %) all refractory to best medical treatment: three V4, two M1, and one supraclinoid ICA stenosis. PTA and stent deployment were technically feasible in all patients and immediately effective with a median postprocedural stenosis grade of 10 %. Angiographic and clinical safety measures were met with no occult or clinically evident hemorrhage or ischemic complications (four patients discharged without alteration in mRS, two patients with significant clinical improvement). No occurrence of TIA, stroke, or death was observed during follow-up. CONCLUSION The FBTS method in this series appeared to be safe and effective for the endovascular treatment of ICS.

We show that vaccination of hamsters with recombinant VSV-{Delta}G-spike results in rapid and potent induction of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, single-dose vaccination was able to protect hamsters against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, as demonstrated by the abrogation of body weight loss of the immunized hamsters compared to unvaccinated hamsters. Furthermore, whereas lungs of infected hamsters displayed extensive tissue damage and high viral titers, immunized hamsters lungs showed only minor lung pathology, and no viral load.

This study examines the evolution of anxiety over the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, testing for differential experiences among vulnerable populations. METHODS: Phase 1 of the Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey details the frequency of anxiety among a nationally representative sample of adults from April 23, 2020 through July 21, 2020. Negative binomial regression assessed differences in the frequency of anxiety among demographic, income, health and employment status cohorts. Propensity score matching to the 2019 National Health Interview Survey allowed previous anxiety and health status to be included in the model. RESULTS: Anxiety frequency for 944,719 individuals was observed over three months. Whites, blacks and Hispanics showed increasing frequency of anxiety over the time period, particularly blacks. Prior to COVID-19, 13% of respondents reported regular or semiregular anxiety, compared to 25C35% during the pandemic. Regression analysis suggests that frequent anxiety was highly and positively correlated with COVID-19 case fatality rate and higher levels of frequency were observed among those with poor health, incomes below $25,000, and without paid employment. LIMITATIONS: Causal inference was not able to be investigated due to the cross-sectional study design. CONCLUSIONS: While blacks showed lower levels of anxiety initially, the proportion of the population experiencing regular anxiety increased nearly 20% over the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. This rapid increase in anxiety could be due to inequity in health and economic outcomes among blacks.","output":"Anxiety during the Pandemic: Racial and ethnic differences in the trajectory of fear"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The present study aimed to investigate the current situation and future trends of online academic activities for oncologists during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic Methods: From April 22 to May 5, 2020, a multicenter survey was conducted using an online questionnaire platform To compare categorical variables, 2-test, the kappa consistency analysis, and Wilcoxon rank sum test were applied For all statistical hypotheses, P&lt;0 05 was considered significant Results: In the present study, 2,120 oncologists participated in the survey Of these, 2,035 respondents participated in online academic activities During the pandemic, online academic activities significantly increased [oncologists who participated in online academic activities 60%: 64 58% (during the pandemic) vs 10 90% (before the pandemic), Cohens kappa coefficient =0 0499, P&lt;0 001] The findings indicated that 90 6% of respondents considered that the online academic activities would become a future trend The main reason for the increase in online academic activities was due to in-person academic conferences and diagnoses/treatment being affected by the pandemic Both speakers/chairs and audiences agreed that online academic activities resulted in reduced stress (61 15% vs 67 26%, respectively;2=7 009, P=0 03) In the present study, 62 21% of audiences considered that the recording function of online activities was very important (score 5), while only 53 86% of the speakers had the same opinion (Z=C3 5340, P&lt;0 001) Compared with provincial capital cities and other cities, the participants from first-tier cities thought that online academic activities required significant physical energy (2=6 41, P=0 040), and were more reluctant for the playback of activity contents (2=9 33, P=0 002) and the screenshot of activity contents (2=41 99, P&lt;0 001) Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic, online academic activities have become the main form of academic exchanges for oncologists Taking full advantage of online academic activities and paying adequate attention to the participants requirements with different roles and titles, and from different cities, are key to improving the quality of and involvement in online academic activities","output":"Current situation and trends of online academic activities for oncologists during the COVID-19 pandemic: a multicenter survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A physician and researcher in China for the Covid-19 pandemic, Ewelina Biskup, MD, MPH, discusses that experience, and calls for a big data collection and analysis effort to address the many unanswered questions about the virus.","output":"Looking to the Future to Prepare for Covid-19s Second Wave"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sisonke is a multicentre, open-label, single-arm phase 3B vaccine implementation study of healthcare workers (HCWs) in South Africa, with prospective surveillance for 2 years.

Decreases in mass concentrations of particulate matter (PM) and its components were observed during the lockdown with reductions of 32-51%. The dominant contributor of PM was organic aerosol (OA), and results of a hybrid environmental receptor model indicated OA was composed of four primary OA (POA) factors (hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), cooking OA (COA), biomass burning OA (BBOA), and coal combustion OA (CCOA)) and two oxygenated OA (OOA) factors (less-oxidized OOA (LO-OOA) and more-oxidized OOA (MO-OOA)).

It play a pivotal role as an engine for industrial revolution, growth and support for the overall development of any nation. Metrology is essential to protect the planet, ensuring a dignified quality life for all people to achieve inclusive economic growth and prosperity. It is the main pillar for trade, scientific comparison, innovation of emerging technologies, technical cooperation and even for simple exchange of information. With the advent of better-quality products through metrological advancement, our industries can compete internationally by overcoming all the trade barriers/constraints to achieve the final exports targets. It ultimately translates into growth of industries through rapid industrialization, economic growth and societal upliftment. For industrial and scientific development of any country, the role of NMIs is significant and irreplaceable in the advancement of metrological fields and their related technologies. Dissemination of measurement standards through apex level traceable calibration certificates, training and consultancy services to the industry, government, strategists and academia in different parameters are extremely important. The dissemination of measurement standards in SI units, now related with fundamental constants of nature (FCN), is the prime responsibility of NMI of the country. As India wishes and approaching to become Atma Nirbhar or Self Reliant, the NMI of India i.e. CSIR-NPL has to play a significant role, not only for providing traceability of measurement standards but also to work in close association with industries, especially with Medium, Small and Micro Enterprises (MSMEs) which contributes almost 38% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). It would directly correlate with Indias economic growth and better quality of life for its citizens. The mandate of Physico-Mechanical Metrology (PMM) of CSIR-NPL is to establish, maintain, upgrade and disseminate the standards of mass, volume, density, viscosity; length, dimensions, angle, surface roughness and nanometrology; temperature and humidity; optical radiation (non-ionizing radiation-ultraviolet, visible and infrared region, LED lighting); force, torque and hardness; pressure, vacuum and ultrasonic; acoustic and vibration; and fluid flow. The PMM is the backbone and mainstay for Indian industries and other user organizations. As is evident, these measurements are ubiquitous and cross most strategic sectors and technologies. These parameters play a significant role in the industrial development and their traceable measurements to SI units provide basis for barrier free trade across the continent and the world. The services of these measurements underpin just about every area of human endeavour. The PMM of CSIR-NPL contributes enormously to the economic development of the country by providing traceability to almost all the strategic sectors, MSMEs, Public and Private Sector Undertakings, Government organizations, regulatory bodies, academic institutions as well SAARC nations and other countries through calibrations, testing, need based technical and consultancy services, organization of proficiency testing programmes, industrial trainings and development of academic expertise. The present Chapter of this book is mainly focused on highlighting the significance and importance of PMM, its role and impact in industrial and sectorial growths, applications and relevance with their global compatibility, and finally concludes with some futuristic perspectives.","output":"Physico-Mechanical Metrology: Part I: Impetus for Inclusive Industrial Growth"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nanostructure-based surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy has attracted tremendous interest as an ultrasensitive detection tool that supplies chemical-fingerprint information.

The complexes provide a unique structural example of ISG15 bound to another protein and reveal the molecular mechanism of an ISG15 cross-reactive deubiquitinase. To accommodate structural differences between Ub and ISG15, the viral protease binds the -grasp folds of Ub and C-terminal Ub-like domain of ISG15 in an orientation that is rotated nearly 75 with respect to that observed for Ub bound to a representative eukaryotic OTU domain from yeast. Distinct structural determinants necessary for binding either substrate were identified and allowed the reengineering of the viral OTU protease into enzymes with increased substrate specificity, either for Ub or for ISG15.

Pupils were faced with the task to organize learning and the use of learning time more independently. The children were primarily supported by parents in aspects of organization and learning content. Based on previous research on parental homework support and educational partnerships, it can be assumed that both the structuring and process-related learning support provided by parents depends on socio-demographic characteristics of the family, but is also associated with characteristics of the child (e.g., age, learning behavior) and the perceived school learning support (teacher commitment, level of requirements). These associations were investigated by regression analysis on the basis of data from a standardized online survey with N = 6685 parents of children at secondary schools in the German federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The findings speak in favor of adaptive learning support for parents, which is less intensive for older and female students with favorable learning behavior than for younger and male students with unfavorable learning behavior. School-based learning guidance also contributes to the prediction of parental behavior, with committed teacher behavior contributing to increased support for the child, especially in families with lower school leaving certificates of (surveyed) parents.","output":"Pr?diktoren von prozessbezogener und strukturierender elterlicher Untersttzung w?hrend des (coronabedingten) Distanzunterrichts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The sentinel node (SN) concept has been found to be feasible in gastric cancer. However, the lymphatic network of gastric cancer may be more complex, and it may be difficult to visualize all the SN distributed in unexpected areas by conventional modalities. In this study, we evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of CT lymphography for the detection of SN in gastric cancer. A total 24 patients with early gastric cancer were enrolled in the study. Three modalities (CT lymphography, dye and radioisotope [RI] methods) were used for the detection of SN. The images of CT lymphography were obtained at 10 min after injection of contrast agents. The SN were successfully identified by CT lymphography in 83.3% of patients; detection rates by the dye and RI methods were 95% and 100%, respectively. Most patients, in whom SN were successfully detected by CT lymphography, had positive results at 5 min after injection of the contrast material. The SN stations detected by CT lymphography were consistent with or included those detected by dye and/or RI methods. In conclusion, CT lymphography for the detection of SN in gastric cancer is feasible and has several advantages. However, based on this initial experience, CT lymphography had a relatively low detection rate compared with conventional methods, and further efforts will be necessary to improve the detection rate and widen the clinical application of CT lymphography for the detection of SN in gastric cancer.","output":"Computed tomography lymphography for the detection of sentinel nodes in patients with gastric carcinoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present technological era significantly makes use of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices for offering and implementing healthcare services.

Globally, the emergency and raised resistance rate of bacterial antimicrobial resistance is becoming a prominent problem, and it is difficult to treat patients having sepsis. In this review, we aimed to determine the pooled prevalence of bacterial isolates among presumptive patients with bloodstream infections in Ethiopia. METHODS: A systematic search was performed from PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, HINARI, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar electronic databases using PRISMA guidelines. The data analysis was carried out using STATA(TM) version 14 after the records were cleaned and sorted out. RESULTS: A total of 26 studies with 8,958 blood specimens and 2,382 culture-positive bacterial isolates were included for systematic review and meta-analysis. The meta-analysis derived a pooled culture-positive bacterial prevalence which was 25.78% (95% CI: 21.55C30.01%). The estimated pooled prevalence of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial isolates was 15.50% (95% CI: 12.84C18.15%) and 10.48 % (95% CI: 8.32C12.63%), respectively. The two common Gram-positive bacteria isolated from patients suspected of BSIs were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus with a pooled prevalence of 5.75% (95% CI: 4.58C6.92%) and S. aureus 7.04 % (95% CI: 5.37C8.72%). Similarly, the common Gram-negative bacterial isolates and their estimated pooled prevalence were E. coli 1.69% (95% CI: 1.21C2.16%), Klebsiella species 7.04 % (95% CI: 5.37C8.72%), Pseudomonas species 0.39% (95% CI: 0.08C0.70%), Salmonella species 1.09% (95% CI: 0.79C1.38%), and Streptococcus pyogenes 0.88% (95% CI: 0.54C1.22%).

We aimed to determine whether a resource- and culturally-appropriate lifestyle intervention could prevent glycaemic deterioration in South Asia.Methods: This was an open-label parallel-group randomised trial. Women with GDM from 19 urban hospitals in India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) 3-18 months post-partum. Those without T2DM were randomised to a 12-month lifestyle intervention focused on diet and physical activity or usual care. The primary outcome was the proportion with worsening category of glycaemia based on OGTT using American Diabetes Association criteria: 1) normal glucose tolerance to pre-diabetes (impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance) or T2DM;or 2) pre-diabetes to T2DM. Secondary outcomes included new-onset T2DM, and change in body weight.Findings: 1823 women underwent OGTT at a median of 69 months post-partum. After excluding 162 (89%) with T2DM, 1612 (375% with pre-diabetes and 625% with normoglycaemia) were randomised between November 2017 and January 2020. Baseline mean age was 309 years (SD 49), mean BMI was 266 kg/m 2 (SD 47). Among participants randomised to the intervention, 797% were exposed to all programme content although pandemic lockdowns impacted the delivery model. After 145 months median follow-up, 1308 (812%) participants had primary outcome data. The intervention, compared to usual care, did not reduce worsening glycaemic status (255% vs. 271%;hazard ratio, 092 [95% CI: 076?112]) or any secondary outcome. There was no evidence of heterogeneity of intervention effect by baseline characteristics. Interpretation: A large proportion of South Asian women in urban centres develop dysglycaemia soon after a GDM-affected pregnancy.

Despite a lack of robust evidence to support the use of HCQ for treatment of COVID-19, it was publicly endorsed and received widespread media coverage and public interest. The purpose of this report is to describe and contextualize the surges in public interest, demand, and adoption of HCQ for treatment of COVID-19 and outline implications for future public health policy and practice. METHODS: Using national and global events and Google Trends data as a measure of public interest, we describe the timeline and trends in the emergence of, interest in, and adoption of HCQ as a treatment of COVID-19. We additionally review reports on public demand for HCQ for treatment of COVID-19 and impacts on medication access among patients with indicated uses. RESULTS: Public interest and demand for HCQ surged in the United States and globally following endorsements from public officials and enaction of policies to facilitate off-label use of HCQ for treatment of COVID-19. Surges in demand for HCQ led to multiple documented shortages and barriers to accessing HCQ treatment for patients with indicated uses for HCQ. Although there have been reversals in policies to support HCQ use for treatment of COVID-19 in some regions, others have continued or expanded recommended uses. CONCLUSION: Insights from the global response to HCQ and COVID-19 can be used to inform prudent decision-making in the future to prevent premature action and promote informed and equitable responses to promote public health.","output":"Rise and Fall: Hydroxychloroquine and COVID-19 Global Trends: Interest, Political Influence, and Potential Implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current wildlife trade practices in China lead to significant interactions between humans and animals and drive the emergence of zoonotic diseases.

The estimated additional deaths from a mitigation strategy are 11,500 to 40,000, implying a Cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year saved by locking down of at least 11 times the generally employed figure of $100,000 for health interventions in Australia. The lockdowns do not then seem to have been justified by reference to the standard benchmark. Consideration of the information available to the Australian government in March 2020 yields a similar ratio and therefore the same conclusion that lockdown was not warranted. If Australia experiences a new outbreak, and cannot contain it without resort to a nationwide lockdown, the death toll from adopting a mitigation strategy at this point would be even less than had it done so in March 2020, due to the vaccination campaign, lessons learned since March 2020, and because the period over which the virus would then inflict casualties would now be much less than the period from March 2020. This would favour a mitigation policy even more strongly than in March 2020.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES To describe family involvement, communication practices and visiting policies in adult ICUs. DESIGN A cross-sectional survey. METHOD A questionnaire consisting of 11 sections was developed, pilot tested and e-mailed to 196 ICUs. The participants were intensive care nurses in adult ICUs in four Nordic countries. RESULTS The survey was conducted in October to December 2019. The response rate was 81% (158/196) of the invited ICUs. Most of the units had fewer than 11 beds. Family participation in patient care, including involvement in ward rounds and presence during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, varied between the countries, whereas most families in all countries were involved in decision-making. Family conferences were generally initiated by staff or family members. Children under 18 did not always receive information directly from the staff, and parents were not advised about how to inform their children. Although most respondents described open visiting, restrictions were also mentioned in free-text comments. CONCLUSIONS The level of family care in ICUs in the four Nordic countries is generally based on nurses' discretion. Although most Nordic ICUs report having an open or flexible visiting policy, a wide range of potential restrictions still exists. Children and young relatives are not routinely followed up.

The data of the patients in the inpatient ward and in the intensive care unit were recorded separately. The duration of QRS and presence of FQRS were evaluated by two experienced cardiologists. The patients were divided into two groups as FQRS positive and FQRS negative considering presence of FQRS. Moreover, the frequency of FQRS in the patients in the inpatient ward and in the intensive care unit were compared with each other. RESULTS: FQRS was found in 24% of the patients who had SARS-COV-2. There was no difference between FQRS positive and negative groups in terms of age and gender. Heart rate was higher in FQRS positive group. C-reactive protein (7.25  6.65 mg/dl vs. 4.80  4.48 mg/dl; p = .02) levels were also significantly higher in the FQRS positive group.

Thus, this study examines the influencing and moderating factors of depressive symptoms among individuals subjected to mandatory social isolation. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted to collect data from people under mandatory home or centralized social isolation in Shenzhen, China, from February 28 to March 6, 2020. The perceived risk of infection with COVID-19, perceived tone of media coverage, perceived quality of people-oriented public health services, and their depressive symptoms were assessed. Three rounds of stepwise multiple regression were performed to examine the moderating effects after controlling various variables, such as demographics, duration and venue of mandatory social isolation, infection and isolation status of family, time spent on COVID-related news, and online social support. RESULTS: Among the 340 participants, 57.6% were men, the average age was 35.5 years old (SD = 8.37), and 55.6% held a bachelors degree or above. Individuals subjected to mandatory social isolation generally reported low levels of depressive symptoms. Perceived susceptibility to infection was relatively low, whereas perceived tone of media coverage was mainly positive. In terms of perceived quality of public health services, 12 (3.5%), 103 (30.3%), and 225 (66.2%) participants reported low, medium, and high quality of people-oriented services, respectively. Perceived susceptibility was positively associated with depression, whereas perceived tone of media coverage was negatively associated. The quality of people-centered public health services moderated the association between perceived risk and depressive symptoms and between perceived tone of media coverage and depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the depressive symptoms among individuals subjected to mandatory social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic and highlighted that frontline public health workers play a critical role in protecting public mental health.

Moreover, depletion of lymphocytes is typically associated with an unfavorable disease course. We studied the role and impact of p53 and deacetylase Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) on lymph-monocyte homeostasis and their possible effect on T and B cell signalling. Methods Gene expression analysis and flow cytometry were performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 35 COVID-19 patients and 10 healthy donors (HD). Inflammatory cytokines, the frequency of Annexin + cells among CD3 + T cells and CD19 + B cell subsets were quantified. Results PBMC from COVID-19 patients had a higher p53 expression, and a higher concentrations of plasma proinflammatory cytokines (IL1, TNF-, IL8, IL6) than HD. Deacetylase Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) expression was significantly decreased in COVID-19 patients, and was negatively correlated with p53 (p = 0.003 r=-0.48). A lower expression of IL-7R and B Cell linker (BLNK), key genes for lymphocyte homeostasis and function, was observed in COVID-19 compared with HD. Reduction of IgK and IgL chains was seen in lymphopenic COVID-19 patients. A significant increase of both apoptotic B and T cells were observed. Inflammatory cytokines correlated positively with p53 (IL-1: r = 0.5, p = 0.05;IL-8: r = 0.5, p = 0.05) and negatively with SIRT1 (IL1-: r=-0.5,p = 0.04;TNF-: r=-0.4, p = 0.04). Conclusions Collectively, our data indicate that the inflammatory environment, the dysregulated p53/SIRT1 axis and low expression of IL7R and BLNK may impact cell survival, B cell signalling and antibody production in COVID-19 patients.

Patients were stratified based on filling pressure and output into four groups. Multivariable Cox-Hazard analyses determined the association between haemodynamic parameters with mortality. Among 531 consecutive patients, 44% of patients had normal left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) haemodynamic status. In contrast to LV haemodynamic parameters, RV parameters worsened with higher MEWS stage. While RV parameters did not have incremental risk prediction value above MEWS, LV stroke volume index, E/e' ratio, and LV stroke work index were all independent predictors of outcome, particularly in severe disease. Patients with LV or RV with high filling pressure and low output had the worse outcome, and patients with normal haemodynamics had the best (P < 0.0001).

OBJECTIVE: To determine the bleeding risk with various intensities of anticoagulation in critically ill patients with COVID-19 compared with other respiratory viral illnesses (ORVI). PATIENTS/METHODS: This retrospective cohort study compared the incidence of major bleeding in patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) within a single health system with COVID-19 versus ORVI. In the COVID-19 cohort, we assessed the effect of anticoagulation intensity received on ICU admission on bleeding risk. We performed a secondary analysis with anticoagulation intensity as a time-varying covariate to reflect dose changes after ICU admission. RESULTS: Four hundred and forty-three and 387 patients were included in the COVID-19 and ORVI cohorts, respectively. The hazard ratio of major bleeding for the COVID-19 cohort relative to the ORVI cohort was 1.26 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.86-1.86). In COVID-19 patients, an inverse-probability treatment weighted model found therapeutic-intensity anticoagulation on ICU admission had an adjusted hazard ratio of bleeding of 1.55 (95% CI: 0.88-2.73) compared with standard prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation. However, when anticoagulation was assessed as a time-varying covariate and adjusted for other risk factors for bleeding, the adjusted hazard ratio for bleeding on therapeutic-intensity anticoagulation compared with standard thromboprophylaxis was 2.59 (95% CI: 1.20-5.57). CONCLUSIONS: Critically ill patients with COVID-19 had a similar bleeding risk as ORVI patients.

RECENT FINDINGS: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased risk of SARS-CoV2 and other respiratory infections. Clinical trials in general demonstrate that correction of vitamin D deficiency reduces the risk of hospitalization, ICU admission, and death from SARS-CoV2 infection. The airway epithelium and alveolar macrophages express the enzyme, CYP27B1, that produces the active metabolite of vitamin D, 1,25(OH)(2)D, and the vitamin D receptor, VDR. Vitamin D and its metabolites promote the innate immune response, which provides the first line of defense against viral and bacterial infections while restricting the adaptive immune response, which if unchecked promotes the inflammatory response leading to the acute respiratory distress syndrome and death. SUMMARY: The rationale for treating vitamin D deficiency to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV2 infection and supplementing patients with vitamin D early in the course of SARS-CoV2 infection rests primarily on the ability of vitamin D metabolites to promote an effective immune response to the infection.","output":"Vitamin D Regulation of Immune Function"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To ensure continuing HIV care services during the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth has been recommended and implemented in numerous HIV-related facilities.

The catalase gene expression is regulated by various mechanisms involving e.g. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), tumour necrosis factor  (TNF-), p53 protein and hypermethylation of CpG islands in the catalase promoter. Transcription of the CAT gene is mainly influenced by the -262 C/T and -844 A/G polymorphisms. A common polymorphism -262 C/T in the promoter region has been found to be associated with altered CAT activities. Apart from genetic factors, the activities of CAT may be affected by age, seasonal variations, physical activity, or a number of chemical compounds. Future investigations are necessary to elucidate the role of CAT in pathogenesis of oxidative stress-related diseases.","output":"Human catalase, its polymorphisms, regulation and changes of its activity in different diseases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As medidas de combate  pandemia do novo coronavrus repercutem na vida das meninas e dos meninos desde o ambiente domstico de suas famlias e de suas comunidades at as institui??es e os espa?os pblicos frequentados por esta popula??o.

Analyses were conducted by considering several replacement ratios of virgin material by its recycled counterpart in the so-called wet and dry method. A case study considering the production of recycled-plastic asphalt to be applied in the construction of a typical surface layer of a road in Victoria was evaluated. In general, the results show that recycling plastics as a polymer for bitumen modification and as a synthetic aggregate replacement in asphalt mixes has the potential to be environmentally advantageous compared to their virgin counterpart (i.e. virgin polymers and natural quarry aggregates).","output":"Recycling waste plastics in roads: A life-cycle assessment study using primary data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since its launch in 2016, Chinas green bonds market has amassed a significant size and is currently ranked as the second largest in the world. This paper takes a pioneering step to analyze how a transitional economy can develop a burgeoning green bonds market within a short period, using China as a case study. It concludes that the Chinese government plays an instrumental but also evolving role in this process. The carefully designed use of government mechanisms in the context of unique government structures can constructively facilitate the growth of a green bonds market. At the emerging stage of this unique market, the government can play an active role in designing a conducive regulatory environment through law and policy, providing the necessary financial infrastructure and appropriate incentives for investors and green bond issuers. Government intervention is warranted at this stage, given the special characteristics of the green market, in particular, the desired positive externalities on environmental protection and climate change. In China, such a regime is implemented with a focus on inter-ministerial, central-local and international collaboration, centralized policy-making, and alignment of green goals with performance assessment of local officials. However, as the green bonds market matures, this paper suggests a transition towards a market-oriented model where the government should assume a limited role, providing funding and monitoring, and letting market forces play a greater role in achieving market efficiency. Unleashing the potential of market forces can mitigate several of the challenges faced by a topCdown approach. This paper also examines the challenges that have surfaced in China, including low-quality information disclosure and under-utilization of green bonds financing by private enterprises. In response, several solutions are proposed to address these specific challenges.","output":"Developing a Green Bonds Market: Lessons from China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had widespread social, psychological, and economic impacts. However, these impacts are not distributed equally: already marginalized populations, specifically racial/ethnic minority groups and sexual and gender minority populations, may be more likely to suffer the effects of COVID-19. The COVID-19 Resiliency Survey was conducted by the city of Chicago to assess the impact of COVID-19 on city residents in the wake of Chicago's initial lockdown, with particular focus on the experiences of minority populations. Chi-square tests of independence were performed to compare COVID-19-related outcomes and impacts on heterosexual vs. sexual minority populations, cisgender vs. gender minority populations, and White vs. racial/ethnic minority subgroups. Marginalized populations experienced significant disparities in COVID-19 exposure, susceptibility, and treatment access, as well as in psychosocial effects of the pandemic. Notably, Black and Latinx populations reported significant difficulties accessing food and supplies (p = 0.002). Healthcare access disparities were also visible, with Black and Latinx respondents reporting significantly lower levels of access to a provider to see if COVID-19 testing would be appropriate (p = 0.013), medical services (p = 0.001), and use of telehealth for mental health services (p = 0.001). Sexual minority respondents reported significantly lower rates of using telehealth for mental health services (p = 0.011), and gender minority respondents reported significantly lower levels of primary care provider access (p = 0.016). There are evident COVID-19 disparities experienced in Chicago especially for Black, Latinx, sexual minority, and gender minority groups.

The Ocean Literacy Principles were used to assess ocean awareness through surfing interactions. An online survey questionnaire was completed by 249 participants and reduced to a smaller sample focus group. Qualitative and quantitative data were triangulated to develop further understanding of surfer experiences, using the social-ecological systems framework to model surfing outcomes. The results found that surfers indeed receive ocean literacy benefits, specifically three out of the seven Ocean Literacy Principles and that ocean literacy is a direct benefit many surfers in the sample group receive.

Serologic tests were not routinely used and seroprevalence in this population was unknown. A single-center cross-sectional study was developed to determine the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (Abs) in cancer patients undergoing systemic antineoplastic treatment. One hundred patients were consecutively recruited in a two-week period (6th to 20th May, 2020) and serum samples were tested for the presence of IgM and IgG Abs directed against both spike and nucleocapsid SARS-CoV-2 proteins in two distinct timepoints (at recruitment and four to eight weeks later). IgG positive results were subject to confirmation, in the same serum sample, using two distinct assays. At the time of the first study visit, no patient had a previously confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, one reported previous contact with a COVID-19 patient and all had a baseline SARS-CoV-2 negative RT-PCR. Two patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG in the first study visit, which was not confirmed in either of the two confirmatory assays. Seventy-two patients were tested at the second study visit, all with negative IgG test. IgM was persistently positive at both study visits in one patient and was positive in another patient at the second study visit, both with negative RT-PCR and serum IgG. No patient tested RT-PCR positive within the study timeframe. No evidence of prior or acute SARS-CoV-2 infection was documented in this cohort of cancer patients undergoing systemic treatment and no additional exposure risk was documented compared to general population seroprevalence studies. The study was inconclusive regarding the role of SARS-CoV-2 serology in cancer patients in the early phase of the pandemic.

The purpose of this study was to assess spine surgeon reliance on virtual medicine during the pandemic and to discuss the future of virtual medicine in spine surgery. METHODS: A comprehensive survey addressing demographic data and virtual medicine practices was distributed to spine surgeons worldwide between March 27, 2020, and April 4, 2020. RESULTS: 902 spine surgeons representing seven global regions responded. 35.6% of surgeons were identified as high telehealth users, conducting more than half of clinic visits virtually. Predictors of high telehealth utilization included working in an academic practice (OR = 1.68, p = 0.0015) and practicing in Europe/North America (OR 3.42, p < 0.0001). 80.1% of all surgeons were interested in online education. Dedicating more than 25% of ones practice to teaching (OR = 1.89, p = 0.037) predicted increased interest in online education. 26.2% of respondents were identified as virtual medicine surgeons, defined as surgeons with both high telehealth usage and increased interest in online education. Living in Europe/North America and practicing in an academic practice increased odds of being a virtual medicine surgeon by 2.28 (p = 0.002) and 1.15 (p = 0.0082), respectively. 93.8% of surgeons reported interest in a centralized platform facilitating surgeon-to-surgeon communication.

However, by emerging vaccines of COVID, the thrombosis did not seem to be concerning anymore. Until new findings showed that, the vaccine of COVID itself can cause PVT. Method: We performed an electronic search in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Sciences to evaluate the possibility of occurring PVT due to infection and vaccination of COVID-19. The results were reported in a narrative method and categorized into tables. Result: Overall, 40 cases of PVT from 34 studies were reviewed in this article. The prevalence of PVT following COVID-19 was more remarkable in males. However, it was more common in females after vaccinations of COVID-19 in the reviewed cases. Regardless of etiology, 20 of PVT cases reviewed in this article had at least one comorbidity. The most common clinical presentation was abdominal pain (AP). After anticoagulant therapies, most of the patients improved or discharged. Conclusion: As long as the laboratory findings are not appropriate enough to predict PVT, the diagnosis of this complication with whatever underlying reason is challengeable, while rapid diagnosis and treatment of that are vital.

Various SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in healthcare facilities have been reported. Healthcare workers (HCWs) may play a critical role in the spread of the virus, particularly when asymptomatic. We examined four healthcare-associated outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 infections that occurred at a university hospital in Berlin, Germany. We aimed to describe and analyze the spread of the virus in order to draw conclusions for effective containment of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare facilities. METHODS: Healthcare-associated outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 infections were defined as two or more laboratory confirmed infections with SARS-CoV-2 where an epidemiological link within the healthcare setting appeared likely. We focused our analysis on one of three sites of the Charit-University Medicine hospital within a 2 month period (March and April 2020). RESULTS: We observed four healthcare-associated outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 infections, with a total of 24 infected persons (23 HCWs and one patient). The outbreaks were detected in the departments of nephrology and dialysis (n = 9), anesthesiology (n = 8), surgical pediatrics (n = 4), and neurology (n = 3). Each outbreak showed multiple unprotected contacts between infected HCWs. A combination of contact tracing, testing, physical distancing and mandatory continuous wearing of face masks by all HCWs was able to contain all four outbreaks. CONCLUSIONS: HCW to HCW transmission represented the likely source of the four outbreaks. Ensuring proper physical distancing measures and wearing of protective equipment, also when interacting with colleagues, must be a key aspect of fighting COVID-19 in healthcare facilities.","output":"SARS-Coronavirus-2 cases in healthcare workers may not regularly originate from patient care: lessons from a university hospital on the underestimated risk of healthcare worker to healthcare worker transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To provide a comprehensive summary of the implications of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on orthodontic treatment, contingency management, and provision of emergency orthodontic treatment, using currently available data and literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Orthodontically relevant sources of information were searched using electronic databases including PubMed and Google Scholar and current reports from major health bodies such as Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization, National Institutes of Health, and major national orthodontic associations. RESULTS: Where available, peer-reviewed and more recent publications were given priority. Due to the rapidly evolving nature of COVID-19 and limitations in quality of evidence, a narrative synthesis was undertaken. Relevant to orthodontics, human-to human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs predominantly through the respiratory tract via droplets, secretions (cough, sneeze), and or direct contact, where the virus enters the mucous membrane of the mouth, nose, and eyes. The virus can remain stable for days on plastic and stainless steel. Most infected persons experience a mild form of disease, but those with advanced age or underlying comorbidities may suffer severe respiratory and multiorgan complications. CONCLUSIONS: During the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, elective orthodontic treatment should be suspended and resumed only when permitted by federal, provincial, and local health regulatory authorities.

This research will focus on the post-9/11 and pre-COVID-19 disaster films, in an attempt to understand the representation and pre-presentation of the collective disaster psychology. Aligned with Jungian film studies, this essay regards films as a convergence of generations collective unconscious. Apocalypse may as well be considered the psychic archetypes that emerge in our civilization in the name of religion. This essay aims to construe the ways that apocalyptic archetypes appear and are elaborated in contemporary films, in hope of recognizing the new apocalyptic aesthetics formed in the interval between the two disastrous events. Consistent with the meaning in classic doomsday narratives, the archetypal symbols in these films are found to have carried a dual connotation of destruction and rebirth. Through empirical cinematographic style, these archetypal images are revealed in an immersive way. Disaster films from this time place emphasis on death itself, fiercely protesting against the stagnation of life, and in turn triggering a transcendental transformation of the psyche. Unlike those in the late 1990s, viewing the doomsday crisis through the lens of spectacularity, disaster in these films is seen as a state of body and mind, and death a thought-provoking life experience.","output":"The Appearance and Resonance of Apocalyptic Archetypes in Contemporary Disaster Films"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The nursing home sector has seen a disproportionately high number of deaths as part of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In response, the EUGMS published a set of medical standards of care developed in consultation with experts across its member national societies in 2015. The standards consisted of seven core principles of medical care for physicians working in nursing homes as a first step in developing a programme of clinical, academic and policy engagement in improving medical care for older people who are living and frequently also dying as residents in nursing homes. The gravity of the concerns arising for nursing home care from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as emerging insights on care improvement in nursing homes indicate that an update of these medical standards is timely. This was performed by the writing group from the original 2015 guidelines and is intended as an interim measure pending a more formal review incorporating a systematic review of emerging literature and a Delphi process.","output":"COVID-19 highlights the need for universal adoption of standards of medical care for physicians in nursing homes in Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a newly emerged strain that has never been found in humans before At present, the laboratory-based reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the main method to confirm COVID-19 infection The intensification of the COVID-19 epidemic overwhelms limited clinical resources in particular, but not only, in developing countries, resulting in many patients not being tested for the infection and in large queues of potentially infected individuals waiting to be tested while providing a breeding ground for the disease We describe here a rapid, highly sensitive, point-of-care, molecular test amenable for use at home, in the clinic, and at points of entry by minimally trained individuals and with minimal instrumentation Our test is based on loomediated isothermal amplification (COVID-19 LAMP) and for higher sensitivity on nested nucleic acid, two stage isothermal amplification (COVID-19 Penn-RAMP) Both tests can be carried out in closed tubes with either fluorescence or colorimetric (e g , leuco crystal violet LCV) detection COVID-19 LAMperforms on par with COVID-19 RT-PCR COVID-19 RAMhas 10 fold better sensitivity than COVID-19 LAMand COVID-19 RT-PCR when testing purified targets and 100 times better sensitivity than COVID-19 LAMand COVID-19 RT-PCR when testing rapidly prepared sample mimics Due to fortunate scarcity of COVID-19 infections in the USA, we were not able to test our assays and methods with patient samples We hope that such tests will be carried out by colleagues in impacted countries Our Closed-Tube Penn-RAMhas the potential to significantly reduce false negatives while being amenable to use with minimal instrumentation and training","output":"A Single and Two-Stage, Closed-Tube, Molecular Test for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) at Home, Clinic, and Points of Entry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the onslaught of SARS-CoV-2, the research community has been searching for a vaccine to fight against this virus. However, during this period, the virus has mutated to adapt to the different environmental conditions in the world and made the task of vaccine design more challenging. In this situation, the identification of virus strains is very much timely and important task. We have performed genome-wide analysis of 10664 SARS-CoV-2 genomes of 73 countries to identify and prepare a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) dataset of SARS-CoV-2. Thereafter, with the use of this SNP data, the advantage of hierarchical clustering is taken care of in such a way so that Average Linkage and Complete Linkage with Jaccard and Hamming distance functions are applied separately in order to identify the virus strains as clusters present in the SNP data. In this regard, the consensus of both the clustering results are also considered while Silhouette index is used as a cluster validity index to measure the goodness of the clusters as well to determine the number of clusters or virus strains. As a result, we have identified five major clusters or virus strains present worldwide. Apart from quantitative measures, these clusters are also visualized using Visual Assessment of Tendency (VAT) plot. The evolution of these clusters are also shown. Furthermore, top 10 signature SNPs are identified in each cluster and the non-synonymous signature SNPs are visualised in the respective protein structures. Also, the sequence and structural homology-based prediction along with the protein structural stability of these non-synonymous signature SNPs are reported in order to judge the characteristics of the identified clusters. As a consequence, T85I, Q57H and R203M in NSP2, ORF3a, Nucleocapsid respectively are found to be responsible for Cluster 1 as they are damaging and unstable non-synonymous signature SNPs. Similarly, F506L and S507C in Exon are responsible for both Clusters 3 and 4 while Clusters 2 and 5 do not exhibit such behaviour due to the absence of any non-synonymous signature SNPs.

Science-based conservation policy and strategy that focus on sustainable management are perceived as less irrelevant today and can often be in conflict with emerging attitudes and values. Sustainable wildlife management adheres to the conservation concept of effective combination of species conservation and sustainable utilization, with an aim to establish a long-acting species conservation model that promotes all-round development of ecology, society, and economy, and has traditionally formed the basis of conservation management. This study designed a semi-structured questionnaire, which aimed to assess attitudes of Chinese college students towards sustainable wildlife management and wildlife conservation, and investigate the role of demographic and other characteristics on attitude. From October 2018 to April 2019, nine universities (including Double First-Class universities, first-tier universities, second-tier universities), and four three-year colleges in China were selected as survey sites, where face-to-face interviews were conducted among students. The results show that students broadly support the sustainable wildlife management but not in issues relating to Animal Welfare and Rights and Trophy Hunting. Students with lowest support for the theory and practice of sustainable wildlife management are vegetarians, freshmen, and those who have taken environmental protection electives in their educational program. ABSTRACT: Wildlife conservation and management has become a very complex public policy issue in China as concerns over on animal welfare and empathy for animals have grown. Science-based conservation strategies that are oriented toward sustainable wildlife management (SWM) are under threat as these new attitudes and values emerge and take hold. This study accesses the attitudes of college students towards SWM and wildlife conservation, and investigates demographic characteristics influencing their attitudes in China, a country that is traditionally associated with consumptive use of wildlife and SWM, but where new ideas about wildlife conservation are emerging. From October 2018 to April 2019, nine universities (including Double First-Class universities, first-tier universities, second-tier universities), and four three-year colleges in China were selected as survey locations, and face-to-face interviews were conducted with 1991 students. A total of 1977 questionnaires were recovered, of which 1739 were valid, with a completion rate of 88%. A Likert seven-point scale method was used to score students attitudes, and a classification and regression tree (CART) was used to analyze whether their attitudes were affected by their demographic characteristics. The results show that although students are broadly supportive of the theory of SWM, some are deeply antagonistic about on SWM on issues that arouse strong emotions such as Animal Welfare and Rights and Trophy Hunting. Demographic characteristics of students affect their degree of support for the SWM with support for SWM lower among vegetarians, freshmen, and students who have taken environmental protection electives. This research suggests that the theory of SWM requires to be refreshed and adapted to appeal to the younger generation of Chinese students, with SWM principles integrated into the environmental education programs of universities and three-year colleges. More attention should also be attached to media publicity by the government about wildlife conservation so as to enhance awareness of the need for SWM.","output":"Current Societal Views about Sustainable Wildlife Management and Conservation: A Survey of College Students in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objetivo: analizar los factores facilitadores y las barreras para el cumplimiento del rol profesional de las enfermeras y enfermeros en tiempos de pandemia y desastres.

Orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) followed by pathway and enrichment analysis generated classification models and revealed significant metabolites that were associated with altered pathways. A clear association between maternal and cord blood altered metabolomic profile was evidenced in IUGR pregnancies. Increased levels of the amino acids alanine, leucine, valine, isoleucine and phenylalanine were prominent in IUGR pregnancies indicating a connection with impaired amino acid metabolism and transplacental flux. Tryptophan was individually connected with cord blood discrimination while 3-hydroxybutyrate assisted only maternal blood discrimination. Lower glycerol levels in IUGR samples ascribed to imbalance between gluconeogenesis and glycolysis pathways, suggesting poor glycolysis.

Oral samples were collected on the first day of glandular swelling in 53 patients (52.5%), and on the first two days in 74 patients (73.3%). Viruses were detected in 52 (51.5%) of samples: one virus (25 EBV, 8 PIV3, 4 adenovirus, 4 PIV2, 1 PIV1, 1 InVA, and 1 enterovirus) was detected in 44 patients (84.6%), two viruses in 7 patients, and three viruses in one patient. In 58 patients (57.5%) whose sample was collected in the first 2 days after onset of parotitis and had received two doses of MMR vaccine and in 15 patients (14.8%) whose sample was collected on the first day, it is very likely that the cause was not the mumps virus. This would mean that 72.3% (73/101) of the reported sporadic suspected mumps cases were not mumps cases.

Although all patients with HLH typically need intensive anti-inflammatory therapy, patients with FHL also need HSCT to be cured. In the international HLH-2004 study, 187 children aged <18 years fulfilling the study inclusion criteria (5 of 8 diagnostic criteria, affected sibling, or molecular diagnosis in FHL-causative genes) underwent 209 transplants (2004-2012), defined as indicated in patients with familial/genetic, relapsing, or severe/persistent disease. Five-year overall survival (OS) post-HSCT was 66% (95% confidence interval [CI], 59-72); event-free survival (EFS) was 60% (95% CI, 52-67). Five-year OS was 81% (95% CI, 65-90) for children with a complete response and 59% (95% CI, 48-69) for those with a partial response (hazard ratio [HR], 2.12; 95% CI, 1.06-4.27; P = .035). For children with verified FHL (family history/genetically verified, n = 134), 5-year OS was 71% (95% CI, 62-78) and EFS was 62% (95% CI, 54-70); 5-year OS for children without verified FHL (n = 53) was significantly lower (52%; 95% CI, 38-65) (P = .040; HR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.03-2.77); they were also significantly older. Notably, 20 (38%) of 53 patients without verified FHL had natural killer cell activity reported as normal at diagnosis, after 2 months, or at HSCT, suggestive of secondary HLH; and in addition 14 (26%) of these 53 children had no evidence of biallelic mutations despite having 3 or 4 FHL genes analyzed (natural killer cell activity not analyzed after 2 months or at HSCT). We conclude that post-HSCT survival in FHL remains suboptimal, and that the FHL diagnosis should be carefully investigated before HSCT.

We study the hedge behaviour and effectiveness for the class of affine jump diffusion models and infinite activity L\\\\'evy processes. First, market data is calibrated to SVI-implied volatility surfaces to price options. To cover a wide range of market dynamics, we generate Monte Carlo price paths using an SVCJ model (stochastic volatility with correlated jumps) assumption and a close-to-actual-market GARCH-filtered kernel density estimation. In these two markets, options are dynamically hedged with Delta, Delta-Gamma, Delta-Vega and Minimum Variance strategies. Including a wide range of market models allows to understand the trade-off in the hedge performance between complete, but overly parsimonious models, and more complex, but incomplete models. The calibration results reveal a strong indication for stochastic volatility, low jump frequency and evidence of infinite activity. Short-dated options are less sensitive to volatility or Gamma hedges. For longer-date options, good tail risk reduction is consistently achieved with multiple-instrument hedges.

The uncertainty associated with this change may have created a sense of anxiety and fear towards the virus. Objective: The objective of this study was to measure the level of fear associated with COVID-19 in Canadian undergrad university students and the influence fear may have on their health-related behaviours during an ongoing pandemic. Methods: Students enrolled in four large universities in the province of Alberta were invited to complete an online Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) from January 4th to February 15th, 2021. Results: Undergraduate students (n=680;73.4% female) with a mean age of 23 (SD 5) years had an average FCV-19 score of 17.1 (SD 6.1) out of 35. Many students (60%) categorized their fear in the moderate range and females were more likely to have a higher FCV-19 score (p<.05) than males.

However, this may leave patients more vulnerable to potential pathogen transmission routes via increased exposure to contaminated surfaces and contacts with individuals. Objective: This study aimed to quantify the association between the number of intrahospital transfers undergone during a hospital spell and the development of a hospital-acquired infection (HAI). Methods: A retrospective case-control study was conducted using data extracted from electronic health records and microbiology cultures of non-elective, medical admissions to a large urban hospital trust comprising 3 hospital sites between 2016 and 2018 (n=24,239). As elderly patients comprise a large proportion of hospital users and are a high-risk population for HAIs, the analysis focused on those over 65-years old. Logistic regression was conducted to obtain the odds ratio (OR) for developing a HAI as a function of intrahospital transfers until onset of HAI for cases, or hospital discharge for controls, while controlling for age, gender, time-at-risk, Elixhauser comorbidities, hospital site of admission, dominant treatment function code, intensive care admission, total number of procedures, and discharge destination. Results: Of the 24,239 spells, 2879 cases were included in the analysis. 72.2% of spells contained at least one intrahospital transfer. On multivariable analysis, each additional intrahospital transfer increased the odds of acquiring a HAI by 9% (OR 1.09; 95%CI 1.05 to 1.13). Conclusion: Intrahospital transfers are associated with increased odds of developing a HAI. Strategies for minimising intrahospital transfers should be considered, and further research is needed to identify unnecessary transfers.

According to the current reports, a situation has arisen when people need to understand the importance of social distancing and take enough precautionary measures more seriously. Maintaining social distancing and proper hygiene, staying at isolation or adopting the self-quarantine strategy are some common habits which people should adopt to avoid from being infected. And the growing information regarding COVID-19, its symptoms and prevention strategies help the people to take proper precautions. In this present study, we have considered a SAIRS epidemiological model on COVID-19 transmission where people in the susceptible environment move into asymptotically exposed class after coming contact with asymptotically exposed, symptomatically infected and even hospitalised people. The numerical study indicates that if more people from asymptotically exposed class move into quarantine class to prevent further virus transmission, then the infected population decreases significantly. The disease outbreak can be controlled only if a large proportion of individuals become immune, either by natural immunity or by a proper vaccine. But for COVID-19, we have to wait until a proper vaccine is developed and hence natural immunity and taking proper precautionary measures is very important to avoid from being infected. In the latter part, a corresponding optimal control problem has been set up by implementing control strategies to reduce the cost and count of overall infected individuals. Numerical figures show that the control strategy, which denotes the social distancing to reduce disease transmission, works with a higher intensity almost after one month of implementation and then decreases in the last few days. Further, the control strategy denoting the awareness of susceptible population regarding precautionary measures first increases up to one month after implementation and then slowly decreases with time. Therefore, implementing control policies may help to reduce the disease transmission at this current pandemic situation as these controls reduce the overall infected population and increase the recovered population.","output":"Modelling the role of optimal social distancing on disease prevalence of COVID-19 epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Roborovski dwarf hamster Phodopus roborovskii belongs to the Phodopus genus, one of seven within Cricetinae subfamily.

In addition, participants had to complete a survey regarding symptoms and their individual risk of infection. RESULTS: Symptoms suspicious for COVID-19 occurred in 72%, fever in 25% of all subjects. Four workers (2.6%, 95% confidence interval 0.8-7.1%) had a positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. None of these was free from COVID-19 suspicious symptoms. Source of infection was presumably professional in three of four individuals. CONCLUSION: Our systematic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cohort of health care workers in a large outpatient centre revealed an apparently low rate of 2.6% past SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Therefore, concerns regarding it being a possible enteric virus are abundant. Past history of SARS-CoV-1 outbreaks and viral survival information helps in establishing information regarding possible viral infectivity and survival of SARS-CoV-2. The paper examines the existing strategies and techniques including the efficacy of laboratory-based RT-qPCR technique for tracking environmental persistence and community transmission of COVID-19. Analysis of studies targeting untreated and treated wastewater as source of samples is carried out. The analysis shows that untreated samples were mostly positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the target studies. Infectivity estimation from viral load data was found to be about two orders of magnitude higher than actual case data in one of the studies. Additionally, relevant research on environmental survivability of SARS-CoV-2 and possible gaps are examined. Biosensors and excretion metabolite tracking in viral detection are also examined, which hold tremendous importance for future research. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) shows incredible promise in the near future for tracking environmental persistence and community transmission of highly infectious diseases such as SARS-CoV-2.

Design/methodology/approach The paper explores recurring thematic threads in scholarly overtourism texts, given the phrases coherence as a nodal-point is partially held in place by a collective body of texts authored by a network of scholars who have invested in it. The paper uses interdiscursivity as an interpretative framework to identify overlapping thematic trajectories found in existing discourses. Findings Overtourism, as a discursive formation, determines what can and should be said about the self-evident \\"truths\\" of excessive tourist arrivals, the changes tourists bring to destinations and the range of discursive solutions available to manage or end overtourism. As the interpellation of these thematic threads into scholarly texts is based on a sense of crisis and urgency, the authors find that the themes contain rhetoric, arguments and metaphors that problematise tourists and construct them as objects in need of control and correction.

The anticipated use of COVID-19 vaccines in patients with chronic liver disease and liver transplant recipients is reviewed and practical guidance is provided for health care providers involved in the care of patients with liver disease and liver transplantation about vaccine prioritization and administration. MAIN RESULTS: The Pfizer and Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are associated with a 94%-95% vaccine efficacy compared to placebo against COVID-19. Local site reactions of pain and tenderness were reported in 70%-90% of clinical trial participants, and systemic reactions of fever and fatigue were reported in 40%-70% of participants, but these reactions were generally mild and self-limited and occurred more frequently in younger individuals. Severe hypersensitivity reactions related to the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are rare and more commonly seen in women and individuals with a history of prior drug reactions for unclear reasons. Because patients with advanced liver disease and immunosuppressed patients were excluded from the vaccine licensing trials, additional data regarding the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines are eagerly awaited in these and other subgroups CONCLUSIONS: Remarkably safe and highly effective mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are now available for widespread use and should be given to all adult patients with chronic liver disease and liver transplant recipients.

METHOD: A mixed-methods study was performed. Quantitative data were collected to assess the provision of care and monitoring of health conditions in IVWEG through a survey that was self-completed by healthcare providers. Qualitative narrative data were collected to gain insight into IVWEG that seek care. We applied descriptive statistics, grouping analysis (GA) by hierarchical levels, and multiple correspondence analysis (MCA). Content analysis was applied to qualitative data. RESULTS: 106 healthcare providers participated in the study, with the following characteristics: 94 (88.7%) females, 67 (63.2%) pardo race/color, 40 (37.7%) working in primary healthcare, and 49 (46.2%) nurses. In addition, 43 (40.6%) of the healthcare providers reported providing care to IVWEG. Among the providers, 89 (84%) had received training for assisting IVWEG. Additionally, 30 IVWEG were enrolled for interviews in the qualitative phase. The barriers to seeking care were language, distance to health units, and lack of money for transportation.

Its hard to overestimate the value of adenoviruses during the COVID-19 pandemic as to date four out of four approved viral vector-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are developed on adenovirus platform. The vast majority of adenoviral vectors are based on the most studied human adenovirus type 5 (HAdV-C5), however, its immunogenicity often hampers the clinical translation of HAdV-C5 vectors. The search of less seroprevalent adenovirus types led to another species C adenovirus, Adenovirus type 6 (HAdV-C6). HAdV-C6 possesses high oncolytic efficacy against multiple cancer types and remarkable ability to induce the immune response towards carrying antigens. Being genetically very close to HAdV-C5, HAdV-C6 differs from HAdV-C5 in structure of the most abundant capsid protein, hexon. This leads to the ability of HAdV-C6 to evade the uptake by Kupffer cells as well as to distinct opsonization by immunoglobulins and other blood proteins, influencing the overall biodistribution of HAdV-C6 after systemic administration. This review describes the structural features of HAdV-C6, its interaction with liver cells and blood factors, summarizes the previous experiences using HAdV-C6, and provides the rationale behind the use of HAdV-C6 for vaccine and anticancer drugs developments.","output":"Adenovirus Type 6: Subtle Structural Distinctions from Adenovirus Type 5 Result in Essential Differences in Properties and Perspectives for Gene Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The current study examined trajectories of anxiety and depression symptoms at three-time points during the COVID-19 pandemic and examined correlates of those trajectories.

Ethical principles would have suggested allocating available vaccines to people by age, irrespective of where they live, because mortality risks from COVID-19 are much higher for older people. The World Health Organization recommended initial allocations of vaccines to countries based on their total population size, in part due to uncertainty about how COVID-19 would affect different countries. This paper estimates how many people would have died from COVID-19 up to 31 October 2021 if either of these allocation rules had been applied, compared to estimates of actual COVID-19 deaths. The estimates suggest that allocating vaccines by age would have resulted in between 500,000 and 1,500,000 fewer deaths globally (with a best estimate of 1,090,000 fewer deaths), while allocating vaccines between countries based on national population sizes would have reduced total deaths globally by between 450,000 and 2,100,000 (with a best estimate of 1,440,000 fewer deaths). Most low- and middle-income countries would have seen reductions in deaths, with the greatest absolute numbers in large middle-income countries (especially Bangladesh, India and Indonesia). More deaths would have taken place in many high-income countries, with the greatest absolute numbers in the United States and Turkey, and the greatest percentage changes in Arabian Peninsula countries, Israel and some island states. In most European Union countries, deaths would not have differed much if vaccines were allocated by age, because they would have received more vaccine doses during the early months of 2021 but fewer later in the year. Although allocation of vaccines by age should intuitively lead to fewest deaths, the estimated deaths would have been even lower if vaccines were allocated based on population size. Allocation by population would have directed disproportionate numbers of vaccines to a set of countries - especially India, Bangladesh and Indonesia - which experienced large outbreaks due to the Delta variant in 2021 after having previously limited infections through \\"flattening the curve\\". Sequencing of vaccination by age in national vaccination rollouts is critical to maximizing the numbers of lives saved. The estimated gains from fairer global vaccination allocation would be greater if high-income and upper-middle-income countries did not sequence vaccinations by age cohort, and would be lower if lower-middle-income and low-income countries did not vaccinate most of their elderly before the general population, whether due to policy choices or people not accepting vaccines made available to them or logistical difficulties in vaccine delivery. The estimates correspond to a reduction of between 8.5% and 10.7% (with a best estimate of 10.4%) of the total estimated actual deaths from COVID-19 between 1 January and 31 October 2021, if vaccines were allocated by age, and between 7.8% and 15.0% (with a best estimate of 13.6%) of total estimated actual deaths, if vaccines were allocated based on national population sizes. These percentages are small, despite the large differences in vaccine deployment between countries, because the mostly high-income countries which vaccinated their populations faster have disproportionately large numbers of elderly people. If a future SARS-CoV-2 variant, or a future pandemic, were to have fatality rates that are similar across age groups, or that are higher for children and young adults, then unequal global allocation of vaccines would have a much more severe effect on overall global mortality than it has for COVID-19 so far.","output":"Estimates of the impact on COVID-19 deaths of unequal global allocations of vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To elucidate the specific role of gastric vs. intestinal manipulations in the regulation of body weight and glucose homeostasis. DESIGN AND METHODS The effects of intestinal bypass alone (duodenal-jejunal bypass -DJB) and gastric resection alone (SG) in Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats were compared. Additional animals underwent a combination procedure (SG + DJB). Outcome measures included changes in weight, food intake (FI), oral glucose tolerance (GT) and gut hormones. RESULTS DJB did not substantially affect weight and FI, whereas SG significantly reduced weight gain and food consumption. DJB rats showed weight-independent improvement in GT, which improved less after SG. Furthermore, SG significantly suppressed plasma ghrelin and increased insulin, glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide and peptide YY response to oral glucose whereas DJB had no effects on postprandial levels of these hormones. DJB restored postprandial glucagon suppression in diabetic rats whereas SG did not affect glucagon response. The combination procedure (SG + DJB) induced greater weight loss and better GT than SG alone without reducing food intake further.

Sixty-four older women (age = 72  5 yrs) under home confinement who participated in a physical exercise/educational program had their levels of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and HRQL assessed before and during (11 to 13 weeks after the introduction of government recommendations to reduce virus transmission) COVID-19 pandemic. There were significant reductions in total physical activity (?259 METs/week, P = .02), as a result of a ~17.0% reduction in walking (?30.8 min/week, P = .004) and ~41.8% reduction in vigorous-intensity activity (?29.6 min/week, P < .001). Sedentary behavior also increased (2.24 h/week, P < .001;1.07 h/week days, P < .001;and 1.54 h/weekend days, P < .001). However, no significant change occurred in moderate-intensity physical activity, and HRQL domains and facets, except for an improvement in the environment domain.

Even prior to the pandemic, up to 30% of family members of ICU patients experience post-traumatic stress disorder and up to 50% sustain potentially prolonged anxiety and/or depression. Although family bedside engagement improves both short-and long-term outcomes for patients and their families, nationwide social distancing recommendations have curtailed hospital visitation, potentially heightening the risk of stress-related disorders in these family members. The goal of this analysis is to explore the experiences of physically distanced family members of COVID-19 ICU patients in order to inform future best practices. Methods: This qualitative analysis is part of a multisite, observational, mixed-methods study of 12 US hospitals. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 75 participants from five sites;14 interviews were analyzed in this preliminary analysis. Adult family members of COVID-19 positive patients admitted to the ICU from March-June 2020 were interviewed three months post-discharge. After sequential screening by site coordinators, participants were contacted by the qualitative team until all interviews (10-15 per site) were completed. Qualitative interviews explored the illness stories, communication perceptions, and explored stressors. Thematic analysis was applied to the verbatim transcripts of the phone interviews. Four coders utilized an iteratively-developed codebook to analyze transcripts using a round-robin method with two analysts per transcript. Discrepant codes were adjudicated by a third analyst to attend to inter-rater reliability. Results: Five preliminary themes and seven subthemes emerged (Table 1). Positive communication experiences were more common than negative ones. Communication themes were: 1) Participants were reassured by proactive and frequent communication, leaving them feeling informed and included in care;and 2) Mixed feelings were expressed about the value of video-conferencing technology. Themes from the emotional and stress experiences were: 3) Profound sadness and distress resulted from isolation from patients, clinicians, and supportive family;4) Stress was amplified by external factors;and 5) Positive experiences centered upon appreciation for healthcare workers and gratitude for compassionate care.

The E484K and L452R amino acid substitutions on the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 are associated with reduced neutralization by antibodies from acquired immunity. This study examines the respective association of these mutations with infection in persons who had previously received a COVID-19 vaccine. Methods. Genetic sequences from SARS-CoV-2 specimens collected from Maryland residents and reported to Maryland Department of Health were linked to vaccination history. The prevalence of infections in fully vaccinated persons -- defined as being at least two weeks past receiving the final scheduled dose of a COVID-19 vaccine series -- was compared between infections caused by viruses carrying E484K to those not carrying E484K, and between infections caused by viruses carrying L452R to those not carrying L452R, using logistic regression to adjust for confounding. Results. Of 9,048 sequenced SARS-CoV-2 specimens examined, 265 (2.9%) were collected from fully vaccinated persons. In adjusted analysis, the E484K substitution was associated with an increase in the odds of the sequenced specimen being collected from a fully vaccinated person (OR 1.96, 95% CI, 1.36 to 2.83). The L452R mutation was not significantly associated with infections in vaccinated persons (OR 1.07, 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.68). Conclusion. Though more than 97% of SARS-CoV-2 infections were in persons who were not fully vaccinated, the E484K mutation was associated with increased odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vaccinated persons.

In view of this, there is an urgent need to find a more appropriate therapeutic scheme against COVID-19. The study aimed to investigate whether lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) in combination with other pneumonia-associated adjuvant drugs has a better therapeutic effect on COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Totally 47 patients with COVID-19 infection who were admitted to Rui'an People's Hospital between January 22 and January 29, 2020 were collected. The patients were divided into the test group and the control group according to whether they had been treated with LPV/r or not during hospitalization. Patients in the test group were treated with LPV/r combined with adjuvant medicine, while those in the control group were just treated with adjuvant medicine. The changes of body temperature, blood routine and blood biochemistry between the two groups were observed and compared. RESULTS: Both groups achieved good therapeutic effect with the body temperature of patients decreased gradually from admission to the 10th day of treatment. But the body temperature of patients in the test group decreased faster than that of the control group. Blood routine indexes showed that compared with the control group, the abnormal proportion of white blood cells, lymphocytes and C-reactive protein of the test group could be reduced to some extent. Blood biochemical indexes exhibited that the proportion of patients with abnormal alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase in the test group were lower than the control group. The number of days for nCoV-RNA turning negative after treatment was significantly decreased in the test group than that in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the treatment of pneumonia-associated adjuvant drugs alone, the combination treatment with LPV/r and adjuvant drugs has a more evident therapeutic effect in lowering the body temperature and restoring normal physiological mechanisms with no evident toxic and side effects. In view of these conclusions, we suggested that the use of LPV/r combined with pneumonia-associated adjuvant drugs in the clinical treatment for patients with COVID-19 should be promoted.","output":"Clinical efficacy of lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of Coronavirus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"1.. The accelerating extinction rate of plant species and its effect on ecosystem functioning is a hotly debated topic in ecological research. Most research projects concerning the relationship between species diversity and productivity have been conducted in artificial plant communities, with only a few in natural ecosystems.

Land use affected the relationship between species diversity and ANPP in this semi\\\\arid steppe ecosystem. Exclusion of grazing without or with biomass removal by mowing increased ANPP, species richness and species diversity compared with free grazing; the effect was reflected mainly as enhanced importance of the perennial forbs functional group in terms of their relative contributions to ANPP, plant cover and plant abundance. 3.. Many mechanisms regulate the relationship between species diversity and productivity. Differential effects of anthropogenic activities on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning greatly complicate the analysis of such relationships. On grazing\\\\exclusion sites the relationship between ANPP and species richness can be best described as an exponential growth function (R (2) = 099, P < 0001, n = 24); whereas on the free\\\\grazing site the relationship takes the form of exponential decay (R (2) = 096, P < 0001, n = 24).

CX(3)CR1(+) CD8alpha(+) DC lack hallmarks of classical CD8alpha(+) DC, including IL-12 secretion, the capacity to cross-present antigen, and their developmental dependence on the transcriptional factor BatF3. Gene-expression profiling showed that CX(3)CR1(+) CD8alpha(+) DC resemble CD8alpha(-) cDC. The microarray analysis further revealed a unique plasmacytoid DC (PDC) gene signature of CX(3)CR1(+) CD8alpha(+) DC. A PDC relationship of the cells is supported further by the fact that they harbor characteristic D-J Ig gene rearrangements and that development of CX(3)CR1(+) CD8alpha(+) DC requires E2-2, the critical transcriptional regulator of PDC. Thus, CX(3)CR1(+) CD8alpha(+) DC represent a unique DC subset, related to but distinct from PDC. Collectively, the expression-profiling data of this study refine the resolution of previous DC definitions, sharpen the border of classical CD8alpha(+) and CD8alpha(-) DC, and should assist the identification of human counterparts of murine DC subsets.","output":"CX3CR1+ CD8alpha+ dendritic cells are a steady-state population related to plasmacytoid dendritic cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"All\\\\atom simulations of various antibodies bound to the receptor\\\\binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) are performed.

Body mass index (BMI) does not acknowledge the health burden associated this disease. The performance of the Edmonton Obesity Staging System (EOSS), a clinical classification tool that assesses obesity-related comorbidity, is compared with BMI, with respect to adverse COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: 1071 patients were evaluated in 11 COVID-19 hospitals in Mexico. Patients were classified into EOSS stages. Adjusted risk factors for COVID-19 outcomes were calculated and survival analysis for mechanical ventilation and death was carried out according to EOSS stage and BMI category. RESULTS: The risk for intubation was higher in patients with EOSS stages 2 and 4 (HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.02C1.97 and 2.78, 95% CI 1.83C4.24), and in patients with BMI classes II and III (HR 1.71, 95% CI 1.06C2.74, and 2.62, 95% CI 1.65C4.17). Mortality rates were significantly lower in patients with EOSS stages 0 and 1 (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.42C0.92) and higher in patients with BMI class III (HR 1.58, 95% CI 1.03C2.42). In patients with a BMI  25 kg/m(2), the risk for intubation increased with progressive EOSS stages. Only individuals in BMI class III showed an increased risk for intubation (HR 2.24, 95% CI 1.50C3.34). Mortality risk was increased in EOSS stages 2 and 4 compared to EOSS 0 and 1, and in patients with BMI class II and III, compared to patients with overweight. CONCLUSIONS: EOSS was associated with adverse COVID-19 outcomes, and it distinguished risks beyond BMI. Patients with overweight and obesity in EOSS stages 0 and 1 had a lower risk than patients with normal weight.

G. Sawicki, J. H. Lu, and K. V. Holmes, J. Virol. 69:5535-5543, 1995). Virus isolated from passage 600 of the persistently infected cells made smaller plaques on 17 Cl 1 cells than did MHV-A59. Unlike the parental MHV-A59, this variant virus also infected the BHK-21 (BHK) line of hamster cells. Virus plaque purified on BHK cells (MHV/BHK) grew more slowly in murine cells than did MHV-A59, and the rate of viral RNA synthesis was lower and the development of the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein was slower than those of MHV-A59. MHV/BHK was 100-fold more resistant to neutralization with the purified soluble recombinant MHV receptor glycoprotein (sMHVR) than was MHV-A59. Pretreatment of 17 Cl 1 cells with anti-MHVR monoclonal antibody CC1 protected the cells from infection with MHV-A59 but only partially protected them from infection with MHV/BHK. Thus, although MHV/BHK could still utilize MHVR as a receptor, its interactions with the receptor were significantly different from those of MHV-A59. To determine whether a hemagglutinin esterase (HE) glycoprotein that could bind the virions to 9-O-acetylated neuraminic acid moieties on the cell surface was expressed by MHV/BHK, an in situ esterase assay was used. No expression of HE activity was detected in 17 Cl 1 cells infected with MHV/BHK, suggesting that this virus, like MHV-A59, bound to cell membranes via its S glycoprotein. MHV/BHK was able to infect cell lines from many mammalian species, including murine (17 Cl 1), hamster (BHK), feline (Fcwf), bovine (MDBK), rat (RIE), monkey (Vero), and human (L132 and HeLa) cell lines. MHV/BHK could not infect dog kidney (MDCK I) or swine testis (ST) cell lines. Thus, in persistently infected murine cell lines that express very low levels of virus receptor MHVR and which also have and may express alternative virus receptors of lesser efficiency, there is a strong selective advantage for virus with altered interactions with receptor (D. S. Chen, M. Asanaka, F. S. Chen, J. E. Shively, and M. M. C. Lai, J. Virol. 71:1688-1691, 1997; D. S. Chen, M. Asanaka, K. Yokomori, F.-I. Wang, S. B. Hwang, H.-P. Li, and M. M. C. Lai, Proc. Natl.

Since then, researchers from all over the world have been looking for ways to fight this disease. Many cases of complications arise from insufficient immune responses due to low immunity, with intense release of pro-inflammatory cytokines that can damage the structure of organs such as the lung. Thus, the hypothesis arises that photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) with the use of a low-level laser (LLLT) may be an ally approach to patients with COVID-19 since it is effective for increasing immunity, helping tissue repair, and reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines. This systematic review was performed with the use of PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar databases with the following keywords: low-level laser therapy OR photobiomodulation therapy AND COVID-19. The inclusion criteria were complete articles published from January 2020 to January 2021 in English. The exclusion criteria were other languages, editorials, reviews, brief communications, letters to the editor, comments, conference abstracts, and articles that did not provide the full text. The bibliographic search found 18 articles in the Pubmed/MEDLINE database, 118 articles on the Web of Science, 23 articles on Scopus, and 853 articles on Google Scholar. Ten articles were included for qualitative synthesis, of which four commentary articles discussed the pathogenesis and the effect of PBMT in COVID-19. Two in vitro and lab experiments showed the effect of PBMT on prevention of thrombosis and positive results in wound healing during viral infection, using the intravascular irradiation (ILIB) associated with Phthalomethyl D. Two case reports showed PBMT improved the respiratory indexes, radiological findings, and inflammatory markers in severe COVID-19 patients. One case series reported the clinical improvement after PBMT on 14 acute COVID-19 patients, rehabilitation on 24 patients, and as a preventive treatment on 70 people. One clinical trial of 30 patients with severe COVID-19 who require invasive mechanical ventilation, showed PBMT-static magnetic field was not statistically different from placebo for the length of stay in the Intensive Care Unit, but improved diaphragm muscle function and ventilation and decreased the inflammatory markers. This review suggests that PBMT may have a positive role in treatment of COVID-19.

To demonstrate the efficacy of DEF201 against acute flaviviral disease, various concentrations of the construct were administered as a single intranasal dose prior to virus infection, which resulted in a dose-responsive, protective effect in a hamster model of yellow fever virus (YFV) disease. A DEF201 dose of 510(7) PFU/animal administered intranasally just prior to YFV challenge protected 100% of the animals, while a 10-fold lower DEF201 dose exhibited lower, although significant, levels of protection. Virus titers in the liver and serum and levels of serum alanine aminotransferase were all significantly reduced as a result of DEF201 administration at all doses tested. No toxicity, as indicated by weight loss or gross morbidity, was observed in non-YFV-infected animals treated with DEF201.

The studies evaluated the presence of viral RNA, IgG, IgM, and IgA in samples of unstimulated saliva from adults with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. The vast majority of the studies performed RT-qPCR on the saliva samples and compared the results with the gold standard (a nasopharyngeal swab of the same patient). RESULTS: Saliva samples analyzed by RT-qPCR, reverse transcription isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), spectroscopy, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) offer high sensitivity to detect SARS-CoV-2 in the early stages of the disease and among asymptomatic patients as compared to nasopharyngeal swab RT-qPCR.

Those decisions, which are guided in part by author characteristics, can impact the conduct and conclusions of knowledge syntheses, which assimilate much of the evidence base in medical education. Therefore, to better understand the evidence base, this study describes the characteristics of knowledge synthesis authors, focusing on gender, geography, and institution. Method In 2020, the authors conducted a case study of authors of 963 knowledge syntheses published between 1999 and 2019 in 14 core medical education journals using a publicly accessible dataset. Results The authors of the present study identified 4,110 manuscript authors across all authorship positions. On average there were 4.3 authors per knowledge synthesis (SD=2.51, Median=4, Range=1-22); 79 knowledge syntheses (8%) were single-author publications. Over time, the average number of authors per synthesis increased (M=1.80 in 1999; M=5.34 in 2019). Knowledge syntheses were authored by slightly more females (n=2047; 50.5%) than males (n=2005; 49.5%) across all author positions (Pearson X2=22.02, p<.001).

We performed an integrative meta-analysis to deeply characterize these clonotypes by TCR sequence, gene expression, HLA-restriction, and antigen-specificity, identifying strong and public CD4+ immunodominant responses with confirmed specificity. CD4+ COVID-enriched clonotypes show T follicular helper functional features, while clonotypes depleted in SARS-CoV-2 individuals preferentially had a central memory phenotype. In total we identify more than 1200 highly public CD4+ T cell clonotypes reactive to SARS-CoV-2. TCR similarity analysis showed six prominent TCR clusters, for which we predicted both HLA-restriction and cognate SARS-CoV-2 immunodominant epitopes. To validate our predictions we used an independent cohort of TCR repertoires before and after vaccination with ChAdOx1, a replication-deficient simian adenovirus-vectored vaccine, encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We find statistically significant enrichment of the predicted spike-reactive TCRs after vaccination with ChAdOx1, while the frequency of TCRs specific to other SARS-CoV-2 proteins remains stable. Thus, the CD4-associated TCR repertoire differentiates vaccination from natural infection. In conclusion, our study presents a novel reverse epitope discovery approach that can be used to infer HLA- and antigen-specificity of orphan TCRs in any context, such as viral infections, antitumor immune responses, or autoimmune disease.

Studies based on modelling estimated large indirect effects of the pandemic on services and health outcomes. The objective of this study was to prospectively document experiences of frontline maternal and newborn healthcare providers. METHODS: We conducted a global, cross-sectional study of maternal and newborn health professionals via an online survey disseminated through professional networks and social media in 12 languages. Information was collected between 24 March and 10 April 2020 on respondents' background, preparedness for and response to COVID-19 and their experience during the pandemic. An optional module sought information on adaptations to 17 care processes. Descriptive statistics and qualitative thematic analysis were used to analyse responses, disaggregating by low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) and high-income countries (HICs). RESULTS: We analysed responses from 714 maternal and newborn health professionals. Only one-third received training on COVID-19 from their health facility and nearly all searched for information themselves. Half of respondents in LMICs received updated guidelines for care provision compared with 82% in HICs. Overall, 47% of participants in LMICs and 69% in HICs felt mostly or completely knowledgeable in how to care for COVID-19 maternity patients. Facility-level responses to COVID-19 (signage, screening, testing and isolation rooms) were more common in HICs than LMICs. Globally, 90% of respondents reported somewhat or substantially higher levels of stress. There was a widespread perception of reduced use of routine maternity care services, and of modification in care processes, some of which were not evidence-based practices. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial knowledge gaps exist in guidance on management of maternity cases with or without COVID-19. Formal information-sharing channels for providers must be established and mental health support provided. Surveys of maternity care providers can help track the situation, capture innovations and support rapid development of effective responses.","output":"Voices from the frontline: findings from a thematic analysis of a rapid online global survey of maternal and newborn health professionals facing the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficiency of the Iranian Red Crescent Society in managing their non-monetary resources involved in COVID-19 response. METHODS: For this purpose, the data envelopment analysis approach was used to measure the efficiency, considering the number of personnel and vehicles and screened passengers as the input and output parameters, respectively. It was examined the efficiency of 10 IRCS's branches given 17 days of screening operation. For the analysis,the DEA SolverPro software 15a version was used. RESULTS: The results show that only one branch had been full efficient in using the resources while five branches showed less than 50% efficiency. This study reveals that it is unnecessary to use a fixed number of volunteers at different stations with different passenger numbers. CONCLUSIONS: Using resources without efficient planning can lead to direct costs such as food, transportation, and maintenance, as well as indirect costs such as burnout, fatigue, and stress when responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. This analysis should support IRCS's managers to move their valuable resources from inefficient to efficient centers to increase the screening rate and reduce the fatigue of aid workers for the next pandemic rounds.","output":"The efficiency of COVID-19 testing centers in Iran: A data envelopment analysis approach Hamed Seddighi, Hossein Baharmand, Ali Morovati Sharifabadi, Ibrahim Salmani, Saeideh Seddighi"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Combination therapy with hydroxychloroquine and darunavir/ritonavir or lopinavir/ritonavir has been suggested as an approach to improve the outcome of patients with moderate/severe COVID-19 infection.

During the quarantine period (from January 24 to February 7, 2020), the concentrations of atmospheric pollutants decreased significantly relative to the period before controls were imposed (from January 15 to 23, 2020). Specifically, except for an increase in the concentration of O3, concentrations of PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, and CO decreased for 72.6 gm-3 (45.86%), 47.4 gm-3(41.24%), 25.6 gm-3 (58.00%), 3.0 gm-3 (17.71%), and 0.5 mgm-3 (31.40%), respectively. RAMS-CMAQ simulation showed that meteorological diffusion had an essential role in improving air quality. Influenced by meteorological factors, emissions of PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, and CO were reduced 26.04%, 33.03%, 28.35%, 43.27%, and 23.29%, respectively. Furthermore, the concentrations of PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, and CO were reduced by 19.82%, 8.21%, 29.65%, -25.56%, and 8.12%, respectively, due to pollution emissions reductions during the quarantine period. O3 concentrations increased by 20.51% during quarantine, caused by both meteorological factors (10.47%) and human activities (10.04%). These results indicate that primary pollutants were more sensitive to emissions reductions; however, secondary pollutants demonstrated a lagged response the emissions reduction and were significantly affected by meteorological factors. The linear relationship between ozone and the emissions reduction was not significant, and was inverse overall.

Objectives To document the outcomes of individuals with primary or symptomatic secondary immunodeficiency following COVID-19 in the United Kingdom. Methods At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the United Kingdom Primary Immunodeficiency Network (UK PIN) established a registry of cases to collate the nationwide outcomes of COVID-19 in individuals with PID or symptomatic SID and determine risk factors associated with morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 in these patient groups. Results 100 patients had been enrolled by 1st July 2020, 60 with primary immunodeficiency (PID), 7 with other inborn errors of immunity including autoinflammatory diseases and C1 inhibitor deficiency and 33 with symptomatic secondary immunodeficiency (SID). In individuals with PID, 53.3% (n=32/60) were hospitalized, the infection fatality rate (IFR) was 20.0% (n=12/60), the case fatality rate (CFR) was 31.6% (n=12/38) and the inpatient mortality 37.5% (n=12/32). Individuals with SID had worse outcomes than those with PID. 75.8% (n=25/33) were hospitalized, the IFR was 33.3% (n=11/33), the CFR was 39.2% (n=11/28), and inpatient mortality 44.0% (n=11/25).

AIMS: We aimed to investigate the mental health problems of patients infected with COVID-19 and to identify the role of psychiatrists in the clinical treatment team during the pandemic. We also share the experience of psychiatric consultations of patients with COVID-19 in Shanghai, China. METHODS: We analysed data from the psychiatric medical records of 329 patients with COVID-19 in the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center from 20 January to 8 March 2020. We collected information including sociodemographic characteristics, whether patients received psychiatric consultation, mental health symptoms, psychiatric diagnoses, psychiatric treatments and severity level of COVID-19. RESULTS: Psychiatric consultations were received by 84 (25.5%) patients with COVID-19. The most common symptoms of mental health problems were sleep disorders (75%), anxiety (58.3%) and depressive symptoms (11.9%). The psychiatric consultation rate was highest in critically ill patients (69.2%), with affective symptoms or disturbed behaviour as their main mental health problems. Psychiatric diagnoses for patients who received consultation included acute stress reaction (39.3%), sleep disorders (33.3%), anxiety (15.5%), depression (7.1%) and delirium (4.8%). In terms of psychiatric treatments, 86.9% of patients who received psychiatric consultation were treated with psychotropic medications, including non-benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic agents (54.8%), antidepressants (26.2%), benzodiazepines (22.6%) and antipsychotics (10.7%). Among the 76 patients who were discharged from the hospital, 79% had recovered from mental health problems and were not prescribed any psychotropic medications. The symptoms of the remaining 21% of patients had improved and they were prescribed medications to continue the treatment.

Revisiting this issue with the same cross-sectional data we show that what matters in explaining pain through to age 65 is whether one is working or not. The incidence of pain across the life-course is nearly identical for workers in America and elsewhere, but it is greater for non-working Americans than it is for non-workers elsewhere. As in other countries, pain is hump-shaped in age among those Americans out of work but rises a little over the life-course for those in work. Furthermore, these patterns are apparent within educational groups. We show that, if one ascribes age-specific employment rates from other OECD countries to Americans, the age profile of pain in the United States is more similar to that found elsewhere in the OECD. This is because employment rates are lower in the United States than elsewhere between ages 30 and 60: the simulation reduces the pain contribution of these non-workers to overall pain in America, so it looks somewhat similar to pain elsewhere.

All adult patients (aged 18 years) with fever (38C) and respiratory symptoms were included. Primary endpoints were prevalence of influenza infections in the ED and staff sick days. Secondary endpoints were frequency of antiviral and antibacterial therapy, time between admission and test result or treatment initiation, patient disposition, ED length of stay (LOS) and for in-patients mortality and LOS. Nurses were interviewed about handling and integration of POC testing. The occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infections coincided with the second half of the study. Results: A total of 828 patients were enrolled in the study. All 375 patients of the intervention group were tested with Liat, 103 of them (27.6%) tested positive.

Once EA occurs, there are still no guidelines established for the treatment in adults. Propofol is excessively used in managing agitated patients in the PACU, but it lacks analgesia and can result in apnea. Intraoperative infusion of dexmedetomidine has been proven to have a preventive effect on EA, but the treatment effect of dexmedetomidine on EA remains unknown. This study aims to compare the effects between dexmedetomidine and propofol on relieving EA in adult patients after general anesthesia in the PACU. METHODS: In this randomized, superiority, controlled clinical study, a total of 120 adult patients aged 18C65 years of both genders, with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification I or II developing EA in the PACU after general anesthesia, will be enrolled. Patients will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio into two groups, receiving either a single dose of dexmedetomidine (0.7g/kg) or propofol (0.5 mg/kg). The primary outcome is the proportion of patients having a recurrent EA within 15 min after intervention in the PACU.

It also highlights the ways in which communities and programmes have demonstrated resourcefulness in responding to this unprecedented disruption in order to emerge healthy when COVID-19, and the measures to contain it, subside.","output":"The effects of COVID-19 on the health and socio-economic security of sex workers in Nairobi, Kenya: Emerging intersections with HIV."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We here report a case of COVID-19 with effusion prior to the development of pneumonia in an adult with Down syndrome. Serositis due to rheumatic disease was initially suspected because of a high titer of serum autoantibodies and leukocytopenia; however, SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on admission after previous negative tests. Several cases of COVID-19 have been associated with autoimmune responses along with some cases of COVID-19 with autoimmune manifestations. Furthermore, patients with Down syndrome have a higher mortality risk from COVID-19 than the general population, and it is believed that a high sensitivity to the interferon response may contribute to the increased severity of the disease. Thus, careful attention should be paid to autoimmune manifestations due to SARS-CoV-2 infection for ensuring a proper and timely diagnosis, especially in patients with Down syndrome.","output":"COVID-19 in an Adult with Down Syndrome: Impact on Autoimmune Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Telemedicine is being increasingly used to provide healthcare to patients, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. AIMS: The study aimed to study patient perception and satisfaction with a smartphone-based hybrid teledermatology service initiated during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional telephonic survey including patients 18 years of age who had received a teledermatology consultation. After noting the demographic, clinical and teleconsultation details, patients were administered the Telemedicine Satisfaction Questionnaire and an additional 6-item questionnaire. Patients were also asked to give qualitative feedback and suggestions for improvement using a semi-structured interview guide. RESULTS: We interviewed 201 subjects. The most common diagnoses were pemphigus (27, 13.4%), superficial fungal infections (24, 11.8%), psoriasis (22, 10.9%) and dermatitis (21, 10.4%). The overall mean Telemedicine Satisfaction Questionnaire score was 4.20 0.71. One hundred seventy-one (85.1%) patients responded that they would use teledermatology services again, while 168 (83.6%) reported satisfaction with the quality of services. A majority of the patients were largely satisfied with the various components involved, though some concerns were raised about the care perceived as not at par with physical consultations, difficulty in procuring medicines, lack of confidence in photographic diagnoses and the lack of a personal touch. Patients with urticaria (P=0.020), those who were advised a change in treatment (P=0.029) and those with improvement in their skin disease (P=0.026) were more likely to be satisfied. LIMITATIONS: Our study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic when patient acceptability was likely to be higher. Only follow-up patients were included in the study. CONCLUSION: Patient satisfaction levels were generally high with teledermatology. Addressing lacunae that negatively impact patient perception and satisfaction will help in greater acceptance of teledermatology services.","output":"Patient perception and satisfaction with a smartphone-based teledermatology service initiated during the COVID-19 pandemic at a tertiary care hospital in North India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Refractive changes may be caused by systemic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, lupus erythematosus, or hypothyroidism.

METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted of ASL users in North Carolina. Respondents completed an online survey presented in ASL and English (N = 189). McNemar's tests were used to compare rates of preferred and actual methods of communication. Logistic regression models explored relationships of accessible communication with dissatisfaction and unmet need. Qualitative interviews explored satisfaction with communication and reflections on what works, what does not, and outcomes (N = 54). RESULTS While 45% of respondents used a professional sign language interpreter, 65% of respondents preferred to do so. Accessible communication was associated with lower odds of dissatisfaction with communication (OR = .19, p < .05). Dissatisfaction with communication was associated with greater odds of unmet need for healthcare (OR = 8.95, p < .05). Interview respondents emphasized their preference for on-site interpreters, explaining how video remote interpreting was subject to technical difficulties while writing back-and-forth led to important gaps in understanding. CONCLUSIONS While ASL users prefer to use professional, on-site sign language interpreters to communicate with providers, most use some other form of communication instead.

METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted from January 2016 through December 2019. Data was collected from the patients records and analyzed. RESULTS: During this study period, 283 children were ventilated, of which 26 (9.1%) required tracheostomy. Among this 73% were boys. The median age of the children who underwent tracheostomy was 6.32 y. The most common indication for tracheostomy was prolonged mechanical ventilation [24 cases (92%)] followed by upper airway obstruction [2 cases (8%)]. The average time of tracheostomy was 11.65 d, range (1C21 d). Complications were seen in 14 patients (55%). The most common complications were accidental decannulation, occlusion, pneumothorax, and granulation tissue. Twenty one (80%) patients were successfully discharged, out of which 16 (61%) patients were discharged after decannulation and 5 (21%) were sent home with a tracheostomy tube in situ. Overall mortality in present study was 11.5%; none was directly related to tracheostomy. CONCLUSIONS: The indication for tracheostomy has been changed from emergency to more elective one.

This study examines the risks that the COVID-19 pandemic poses to equitable access to essential medicines and vaccines (EMV) for universal health coverage in Africa. METHODS: We searched medical databases and grey literature up to 2 October 2020 for studies reporting data on prospective pathways and innovative strategies relevant for the assessment and management of the emerging risks in accessibility, safety, quality, and affordability of EMV in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We used the resulting pool of evidence to support our analysis and to draw policy recommendations to mitigate the emerging risks and improve preparedness for future crises. RESULTS: Of the 310 records screened, 134 were included in the analysis. We found that the disruption of the international system affects more immediately the capability of low- and middle-income countries to acquire the basket of EMV. The COVID-19 pandemic may facilitate dishonesty and fraud, increasing the propensity of patients to take substandard and falsified drugs. Strategic regional cooperation in the form of joint tenders and contract awarding, joint price negotiation and supplier selection, as well as joint market research, monitoring, and evaluation could improve the supply, affordability, quality, and safety of EMV. Sustainable health financing along with international technology transfer and substantial investment in research and development are needed to minimize the vulnerability of African countries arising from their dependence on imported EMV. To ensure equitable access, community-based strategies such as mobile clinics as well as fees exemptions for vulnerable and under-served segments of society might need to be considered. Strategies such as task delegation and telephone triage could help reduce physician workload. This coupled with payments of risk allowance to frontline healthcare workers and health-literate healthcare organization might improve the appropriate use of EMV.

The universal primers and specific TaqMan probes for each of the three genotypes, genotypes 1, 2, and 3, were designed within the 3-UTR of the CSFV. Non-CSFV swine virus and clinical samples from specific pathogen-free (SPF) pigs were both demonstrated to be CSFV-negative by RT-MRT-PCR. The diagnostic sensitivity of RT-MRT-PCR was determined to be 1 viral copy/l for each genotype of standard plasmid. For the analytical sensitivity experiment, 100 samples of 14 CSFV genotype 1 strains and 86 samples from CSFV outbreak farms were all detected as CSFV-positive by RT-MRT-PCR, and the genotype results were consistent with the results of sequencing from a previous study. The intra-assay and inter-assay variations of RT-MRT-PCR were below 3% in all experiments. The sensitivity of RT-MRT-PCR was the same as the reverse transcription nested PCR (RT-nPCR) and higher than reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and viral isolation from clinical samples. This assay was used further to evaluate the duration of viremia of wild-type CSFV in vaccinated exposed pigs. The results indicated that pigs vaccinated with the E2 subunit vaccine had longer viremia than pigs given the C-strain vaccine, which is compatible with the findings of previous studies.

Accordingly, much research has focused on the molecular pharmacology of AT(1)R activation and signaling. An emerging theme is that the AT(1)R generates G protein dependent as well as independent signals and that these transduction systems separately contribute to AT(1)R biology in health and disease. Regulatory molecules termed arrestins are central to this process as is the capacity of AT(1)R to crosstalk with other receptor systems, such as the widely studied transactivation of growth factor receptors. AT(1)R function can also be modulated by polymorphisms in the AGTR gene, which may significantly alter receptor expression and function; a capacity of the receptor to dimerize/oligomerize with altered pharmacology; and by the cellular environment in which the receptor resides. Together, these aspects of the AT(1)R flavour the response to angiotensin; they may also contribute to disease, determine the efficacy of current drugs and offer a unique opportunity to develop new therapeutics that antagonize only selective facets of AT(1)R function.","output":"Type 1 angiotensin receptor pharmacology: Signaling beyond G proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) control is mainly based on wide vaccine administration. Although effective, its efficacy is not absolute, the viral circulation is not prevented and some side effects cannot be denied. Despite this, the determinants of IBV epidemiology and the factors affecting its circulation are still largely unknown and poorly investigated. In the present study, 361 IBV QX (the most relevant field genotype in Italy) sequences were obtained between 2012 and 2016 from the two main Italian integrated poultry companies. Several biostatistical and bioinformatics approaches were used to reconstruct the history of the QX genotype in Italy and to assess the effect of different environmental, climatic and social factors on its spreading patterns. Moreover, two structured coalescent models were considered in order to investigate if an actual compartmentalization occurs between the two integrated poultry companies and the role of a third ghost deme, representative of minor industrial poultry companies and the rural sector. The obtained results suggest that the integration of the poultry companies is an effective barrier against IBV spreading, since the strains sampled from the two companies formed two essentially-independent clades. Remarkably, the only exceptions were represented by farms located in the high densely populated poultry area of Northern Italy. The inclusion of a third deme in the model revealed the likely role of other poultry companies and rural farms (particularly concentrated in Northern Italy) as sources of strain introduction into one of the major poultry companies, whose farms are mainly located in the high densely populated poultry area of Northern Italy. Accordingly, when the effect of different environmental and urban parameters on IBV geographic spreading was investigated, no factor seems to contribute to IBV dispersal velocity, being poultry population density the only exception. Finally, the different viral population pattern observed in the two companies over the same time period supports the pivotal role of management and control strategies on IBV epidemiology. Overall, the present study results stress the crucial relevance of human action rather than environmental factors, highlighting the direct benefits that could derive from improved management and organization of the poultry sector on a larger scale.","output":"Phylodynamic analysis and evaluation of the balance between anthropic and environmental factors affecting IBV spreading among Italian poultry farms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Word representation has always been an important research area in the history of natural language processing (NLP).

In order to prevent the spread of an infectious disease, infected people must be quickly identified and isolated, and contact with the infected must be blocked early. This study attempted to verify the intervention effects on the spread of an infectious disease by using these measures in a mathematical model. METHODS: We used the susceptible-infectious-recovery (SIR) model for a virtual population group connected by a special structured network. In the model, the infected state (I) was divided into I in which the infection is undetected and I(x) in which the infection is detected. The probability of transitioning from an I state to I(x) can be viewed as the rate at which an infected person is found. We assumed that only those connected to each other in the network can cause infection. In addition, this study attempted to evaluate the effects of isolation by temporarily removing the connection among these people. RESULTS: In Scenario 1, only the infected are isolated; in Scenario 2, those who are connected to an infected person and are also found to be infected are isolated as well. In Scenario 3, everyone connected to an infected person are isolated. In Scenario 3, it was possible to effectively suppress the infectious disease even with a relatively slow rate of diagnosis and relatively high infection rate.

This latter purpose is particularly important due to the high consequences and cost of delayed detection of a disease moving to a new population. Quantifying the sensitivity of early detection surveillance allows important aspects of the performance of different systems, approaches and authorities to be evaluated, compared and improved. While quantitative evaluation of the sensitivity of other branches of surveillance has been available for many years, development has lagged in the area of early detection, arguably one of the most important purposes of surveillance. This paper, using mostly animal health examples, develops a simple approach to quantifying the sensitivity of early detection surveillance, in terms of population coverage, temporal coverage and detection sensitivity. This approach is extended to quantify the benefits of risk-based approaches to early detection surveillance. Population-based clinical surveillance (based on either farmers and their veterinarians, or patients and their local health services) provides the best combination of sensitivity, practicality and cost-effectiveness. These systems can be significantly enhanced by removing disincentives to reporting, for instance by implementing effective strategies to improve farmer awareness and engagement with health services and addressing the challenges of well-intentioned disease notification policies that inadvertently impose barriers to reporting.","output":"Quantification of the sensitivity of early detection surveillance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using high-throughput BioPlex assays, we determined that six fractions from the venom of Conus nux inhibit the adhesion of various recombinant PfEMP-1 protein domains (PF08_0106 CIDR1&#945;3.1, PF11_0521 DBL2?3, and PFL0030c DBL3X and DBL5e) to their corresponding receptors (CD36, ICAM-1, and CSA, respectively). The protein domain-receptor interactions permit P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes (IE) to evade elimination in the spleen by adhering to the microvasculature in various organs including the placenta. The sequences for the main components of the fractions, determined by tandem mass spectrometry, yielded four T-superfamily conotoxins, one (CC-Loop-CC) with I-IV, II-III connectivity and three (CC-Loop-CXaaC) with a I-III, II-IV connectivity. The 3D structure for one of the latter, NuxVA = GCCPAPLTCHCVIY, revealed a novel scaffold defined by double turns forming a hairpin-like structure stabilized by the two disulfide bonds. Two other main fraction components were a miniM conotoxin, and a O2-superfamily conotoxin with cysteine framework VI/VII. This study is the first one of its kind suggesting the use of conotoxins for developing pharmacological tools for anti-adhesion adjunct therapy against malaria. Similarly, mitigation of emerging diseases like AIDS and COVID-19, can also benefit from conotoxins as inhibitors of protein-protein interactions as treatment. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Among the 850+ species of cone snail species there are hundreds of thousands of diverse venom exopeptides that have been selected throughout several million years of evolution to capture prey and deter predators. They do so by targeting several surface proteins present in target excitable cells. This immense biomolecular library of conopeptides can be explored for potential use as therapeutic leads against persistent and emerging diseases affecting non-excitable systems. We aim to expand the pharmacological reach of conotoxins/conopeptides by revealing their in vitro capacity to disrupt protein-protein and protein-polysaccharide interactions that directly contribute to pathology of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. This is significant for severe forms of malaria, which might be deadly even after treated with current parasite-killing drugs because of persistent cytoadhesion of P. falciparum infected erythrocytes even when parasites within red blood cells are dead. Anti-adhesion adjunct drugs would de-sequester or prevent additional sequestration of infected erythrocytes and may significantly improve survival of malaria patients. These results provide a lead for further investigations into conotoxins and other venom peptides as potential candidates for anti-adhesion or blockade-therapies. This study is the first of its kind and it suggests that conotoxins can be developed as pharmacological tools for anti-adhesion adjunct therapy against malaria. Similarly, mitigation of emerging diseases like AIDS and COVID-19, can also benefit from conotoxins as potential inhibitors of protein-protein interactions as treatment.","output":"Conus venom fractions inhibit the adhesion of Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 domains to the host vascular receptors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016/j.parepi.2019.e00086.][This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016/j.parepi.2018.e00082.][This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016/j.parepi.2019.e00119.][This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016/j.parepi.2018.e00070.][This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016/j.parepi.2020.e00151.][This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016/j.parepi.2018.02.002.][This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016/j.parepi.2018.e00072.][This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016/j.parepi.2019.e00101.][This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016/j.parepi.2020.e00168.][This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016/j.parepi.2018.e00074.][This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016/j.parepi.2018.e00079.][This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016/j.parepi.2019.e00129.][This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016/j.parepi.2020.e00171.][This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016/j.PAREPI.2018.e00069.][This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016/j.parepi.2019.e00098.].","output":"Erratum regarding missing Declaration of Competing Interest statements in previously published articles."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Speeding is one of the most relevant risk behaviours for serious and fatal road traffic accidents, particularly among young drivers, being the cause of approximately every third road traffic accident.

We hypothesized that (1) employment change would be associated with increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic and (2) the combined effects of depressive symptoms with pandemic-related-employment-change would strengthen the association with alcohol consumption.Methods: A self-report, web-based survey collected information on sociodemographics, COVID-19-related employment impact (e.g., decreased pay, laid off), change in alcohol consumption since the pandemic, reasons for consumption change, and depressive symptoms. Multinomial regression modeling explored the associations between variables.Results: One-third (33%) of participants (n = 2,441; 67% female) reported consuming more alcohol compared to pre-pandemic and 11% reported that COVID-19 had a negative impact on their employment. Participants reported drinking more alcohol due to having more time (28%) or boredom (22%). The adjusted odds of increased alcohol consumption were 47% greater among those who reported negative employment impact compared to those who reported no employment impact (AOR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.03-2.11); depression did not moderate this relationship.Conclusion: Given the pandemic's far-reaching impact, the potential for alcohol harm is demonstrably great.

Methods An automatic quantitative analysis model based on a deep network called VB-Net for infection region segmentation was developed. A quantitative analysis was performed for patients diagnosed as severe COVID 19. The quantitative assessment included volume and density among the infectious area. The primary clinical outcome was the existence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A univariable and multivariable logistic analysis was done to explore the relationship between the quantitative results and ARDS existence. Results The VB-Ne model was sensitive and stable for pulmonary lesion segmentation, and quantitative analysis indicated that the total volume and average density of the lung lesions were not related to ARDS. However, lesions with specific density changes showed some influence on the risk of ARDS. The proportion of lesion density from -549 to -450 Hounsfield unit (HU) was associated with increased risk of ARDS, while the density was ranging from -149 to -50 HU was related to a lowered risk of ARDS.

We aimed to develop an assessment tool to predict IMV among Flu-p patients within 14 days of admission. METHODS: In total, 1107 Flu-p patients from five teaching hospitals were retrospectively enrolled from January 2012 to December 2019, including 895 patients in the derivation cohort and 212 patients in the validation cohort. The predictive model was established based on independent risk factors for IMV in the Flu-p patients from the derivation cohort. RESULTS: Overall, 10.6% (117/1107) of patients underwent IMV within 14 days of admission. Multivariate regression analyses revealed that the following factors were associated with IMV: early neuraminidase inhibitor use (? 3 points), lymphocytes < 0.8  10(9)/L (1 point), multi-lobar infiltrates (1 point), systemic corticosteroid use (1 point), age  65 years old (1 points), PaO(2)/FiO(2) < 300 mmHg (2 points), respiratory rate  30 breaths/min (3 points), and arterial PH < 7.35 (4 points). A total score of five points was used to identify patients at risk of IMV. This model had a sensitivity of 85.5%, a specificity of 88.8%, and exhibited better predictive performance than the ROX index (AUROC = 0.909 vs. 0.594, p = 0.004), modified ROX index (AUROC = 0.909 vs. 0.633, p = 0.012), and HACOR scale (AUROC = 0.909 vs. 0.622, p < 0.001) using the validation cohort.

We showed that the pandemic would have failed to establish in the US if a nationwide mask mandate, based on using respirators with moderately-high compliance, had been implemented during the first two months of the pandemic. The other mask types would fail to prevent the pandemic from becoming established. When mask usage compliance is low to moderate, respirators are far more effective in reducing disease burden. Using data from the third wave, we showed that the epidemic could be eliminated in the US if at least 40% of the population consistently wore respirators in public. Surgical masks can also lead to elimination, but requires compliance of at least 55%. Daily COVID-19 mortality could be eliminated in the US by June or July 2021 if 95% of the population opted for either respirators or surgical masks from the beginning of the third wave. We showed that the prospect of effective control or elimination of the pandemic using mask-based strategy is greatly enhanced if combined with other nonpharmaceutical interventions that significantly reduce the baseline community transmission. This study further emphasizes the role of human behavior towards masking on COVID-19 burden, and highlights the urgent need to maintain a healthy stockpile of highly-effective respiratory protection, particularly respirators, to be made available to the general public in times of future outbreaks or pandemics of respiratory diseases that inflict severe public health and socio-economic burden on the population.","output":"Assessing the impact of widespread respirator use in curtailing COVID-19 transmission in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Hashtags plays a vital role in the social media and it is easily highlighted by each and every people when they tag it for their own views.

The MesAur1.0 genome assembly was generated in 2013 using whole-genome shotgun sequencing with short-read sequence data. Current more advanced sequencing technologies and assembly methods now permit the generation of near-complete genome assemblies with higher quality and greater continuity. Findings Here, we report an improved assembly of the M. auratus genome (BCM_Maur_2.0) using Oxford Nanopore Technologies long-read sequencing to produce a chromosome- scale assembly. The total length of the new assembly is 2.46 Gbp, similar to the 2.50 Gbp length of a previous assembly of this genome, MesAur1.0. BCM_Maur_2.0 exhibits significantly improved continuity with a scaffold N50 that is 6.7 times greater than MesAur1.0. Furthermore, 21,616 protein coding genes and 10,459 noncoding genes are annotated in BCM_Maur_2.0 compared to 20,495 protein coding genes and 4,168 noncoding genes in MesAur1.0. This new assembly also improves the unresolved regions as measured by nucleotide ambiguities, where approximately 17.11% of bases in MesAur1.0 were unresolved compared to BCM_Maur_2.0 in which the number of unresolved bases is reduced to 3.00%.

PARTICIPANTS A pooled derivation cohort of 1008 COVID-19 patients from Jinyintan Hospital, Union Hospital in Wuhan and an external validation cohort of 1031 patients from Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality, treating discharged alive from hospital as the competing event. Fine-Gray models, using backward elimination for inclusion of predictor variables and allowing non-linear effects of continuous variables, were used to derive a prognostic model for predicting in-hospital mortality among COVID-19 patients. Internal validation was implemented to check model overfitting using bootstrap approach. External validation to a separate hospital was implemented to evaluate the generalizability of the model. RESULTS The derivation cohort was a case-mix of mild-to-severe hospitalized COVID-19 patients (n=1008, 43.6% females, median age 55). The final model (PLANS), including five predictor variables of platelet count, lymphocyte count, age, neutrophil count, and sex, had an excellent predictive performance (optimism-adjusted C-index: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.83 to 0.87; averaged calibration slope: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.82 to 1.08). Internal validation showed little overfitting.

We extract four different types of features from the skeletal data namely: Distance, Distance Velocity, Angle, and Angle Velocity, which capture complementary information from the skeleton joints for encoding them into images.

Overall, significant group-by-time effects were reported for 26% of mental health outcomes examined. In the fixed-effects meta-analyses, small-to-medium intervention effects were observed for mental health-related quality of life (SMD = 0.24), self-esteem (SMD = 0.51), and positive affect (SMD = 0.58). Insights into effective study or intervention features were limited because of the low number of heterogeneous studies.

The genes are best described in regional units. Among these, the best known is the polymorphic major histocompatibility complex-B (MHC-B) region containing genes for classical peptide antigen presentation. Nearby MHC-B is a small region containing two CD1 genes, which encode molecules known to bind lipid antigens and which will likely be found in chickens to present lipids to specialized T cells, as occurs with CD1 molecules in other species. Another region is the MHC-Y region, separated from MHC-B by an intervening region of tandem repeats. Like MHC-B, MHC-Y is polymorphic. It contains specialized class I and class II genes and c-type lectin-like genes. Yet another region, separated from MHC-Y by the single nucleolar organizing region (NOR) in the chicken genome, contains olfactory receptor genes and scavenger receptor genes, which are also thought to contribute to immunity. The structure, distribution, linkages and patterns of polymorphism in these regions, suggest GGA 16 evolves as a microchromosome devoted to immune defense. Many GGA 16 genes are polymorphic and polygenic. At the moment most disease associations are at the haplotype level. Roles of individual MHC genes in disease resistance are documented in only a very few instances. Provided suitable experimental stocks persist, the availability of increasingly detailed maps of GGA 16 genes combined with new means for detecting genetic variability will lead to investigations defining the contributions of individual loci and more applications for immunogenetics in breeding healthy poultry.","output":"Brief review of the chicken Major Histocompatibility Complex: the genes, their distribution on chromosome 16, and their contributions to disease resistance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The critical need for reliable methods to validate decontamination protocols for personal protective equipment (PPE) for re-use during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is limited by the need for specialized containment facilities to handle the virus.

In spite of this improvement, the region remains the worlds second largest rice importer. The situation of Benin, Burkina Fasso, Gambia and Niger remains challenging with rice import dependency still exceeding 70%. Production in some countries has fallen even below the 2010 level due to civil strife, climatic changes and macroeconomic difficulties. Countries of the region, on average, allocate less than 5% of their budget to agriculture, less than half the share committed in the Maputo Agreement. The Covid-19 outbreak and corresponding preventive lockdowns have posed a new challenge as food supply chains were stretched; production, transportation and consumption fell sharply; and household income was affected. In addition, closure of frontiers and temporary trade disruption in major Asian rice exporters has led to increase in rice prices in the international market. In late April, rice futures rose to reach a level not surpassed since 2011. This threatens to further aggravate an already fragile food security situation in the region.

An analysis of poultry vaccination policy was used to explore the broader policy of influenza A H5N1 control in the region. The policy of antiviral stockpiling with oseltamivir, a scarce regional resource, was used to explore human pandemic influenza preparedness policy. Several policy analysis theories were applied to analyse the debate on the use of vaccination for poultry and stockpiling of antiviral drugs in each country case study. We conducted a comparative analysis across emergent themes. The study found that whilst Indonesia and Vietnam introduced poultry vaccination programmes, Thailand rejected this policy approach. By contrast, all three countries adopted similar strategic policies for antiviral stockpiling in preparation. In relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza, economic imperatives are of critical importance. Whilst Thailand's poultry industry is large and principally an export economy, Vietnam's and Indonesia's are for domestic consumption. The introduction of a poultry vaccination policy in Thailand would have threatened its potential to trade and had a major impact on its economy. Powerful domestic stakeholders in Vietnam and Indonesia, by contrast, were concerned less about international trade and more about maintaining a healthy domestic poultry population. Evidence on vaccination was drawn upon differently depending upon strategic economic positioning either to support or oppose the policy. With influenza A H5N1 endemic in some countries of the region, these policy differences raise questions around regional coherence of policies and the pursuit of an agreed overarching goal, be that eradication or mitigation. Moreover, whilst economic imperatives have been critically important in guiding policy formulation in the agriculture sector, questions arise regarding whether agriculture sectoral policy is coherent with public health sectoral policy across the region.","output":"Avian and pandemic human influenza policy in South-East Asia: the interface between economic and public health imperatives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a complete lockdown in many countries and Italy was the first country interested in Europe, as the cases spread very quickly with a high rate of mortality.

Among several candidates, a 5.9 kDa peptide identified as a fragment of the fibrinogen alpha C chain (FIC5.9) was the most promising. To move FIC5.9 toward potential diagnostic use, we developed an enzyme immunoassay that enables measurement of serum FIC5.9 levels. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN Two monoclonal antibodies specific to the N and C-termini of the 5.9-kDa peptide were used to develop a FIC5.9 sandwich ELISA. The assay was evaluated by comparing the results with those obtained by the stable isotope-labeled dilution mass spectrometry (SID-MS) using the ClinProt? system.

Standard lungs are ventilated using volume-controlled ventilation (VCV). We investigated the effects of flow-controlled ventilation (FCV) in a large animal EVLP model. Fourteen porcine lungs were mounted on EVLP after a warm ischemic interval of 2 h and randomized in two groups (n = 7/group). In VCV, 7 grafts were conventionally ventilated and in FCV, 7 grafts were ventilated by flow-controlled ventilation. EVLP physiologic parameters (compliance, pulmonary vascular resistance and oxygenation) were recorded hourly. After 6 h of EVLP, broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) was performed and biopsies for wet-to-dry weight (W/D) ratio and histology were taken. The left lung was inflated, frozen in liquid nitrogen vapors and scanned with computed tomography (CT) to assess regional distribution of Hounsfield units (HU). RESULTS: All lungs endured 6 h of EVLP. Oxygenation was better in FCV compared to VCV (p = 0.01) and the decrease in lung compliance was less in FCV (p = 0.03). W/D ratio, pathology and BAL samples did not differ between both groups (p = 0.16, p = 0.55 and p = 0.62). Overall, CT densities tended to be less pronounced in FCV (p = 0.05). Distribution of CT densities revealed a higher proportion of well-aerated lung parts in FCV compared to VCV (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: FCV in pulmonary grafts mounted on EVLP is feasible and leads to improved oxygenation and alveolar recruitment.

Methods: We applied the summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) method to identify genes that were pleiotropically/potentially causally associated with the risk and various outcomes of COVID-19, including severe respiratory confirmed COVID-19 and hospitalized COVID-19. The GWAS summarized data for COVID-19 were provided by the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative and the Severe Covid-19 GWAS Group. Analyses were done for blood and lung, respectively. Results: In blood, we identified 2 probes, ILMN_1765146 and ILMN_1791057 tagging IFNAR2, that showed pleiotropic association with hospitalized COVID-19 (beta [SE]=0.42 [0.09], P=4.75E06 and beta [SE]=-0.48 [0.11], P=6.76E06, respectively). Although no other probes were significant after correction for multiple testing in both blood and lung, multiple genes as tagged by the top 5 probes were involved in inflammation or antiviral immunity, and several other tagged genes, such as PON2 and HPS5, were involved in blood coagulation.

Two hundred thirty-six patients unselected for ancestry were also assessed for mutations by full gene sequencing. RESULTS: The FC founder mutation prevalence among the 150 patients was 5.3% (95% CI, 2.6% to 10.3%), and the nonfounder mutation prevalence across the four genes among the 114 patients tested was 2.6% (95% CI, 0.6% to 7.8%). In the case series unselected for ancestry, 10.0% (95% CI, 2.7% to 26.4%) of patients reporting Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) ancestry carried an AJ founder mutation, with no nonfounder mutations identified. The mutation prevalence among patients without FC/AJ ancestry was 4.9% (95% CI, 2.6% to 8.8%). Mutations were more frequent in patients diagnosed at  50 years of age (P = .03) and in patients with either two or more first- or second-degree relatives with pancreas, breast, ovarian or prostate cancer, or one such relative and a second primary of one of these cancer types (P < .001).

OBJECTIVE: An on-site wellness program for physicians-in-training and faculty was assessed by examining (a) were participants representative of those eligible for services and (b) demographic and trainee vs. faculty differences in burnout, distress, suicide risk, and presenting concerns of participants who utilized services. METHODS: From 2013C2018, 73% (N = 468; 316 residents/fellows, 152 faculty) of individuals seeking services also consented to research. At intake, participants completed a distress measure (ACORN) and two items from the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), and clinicians categorized presenting concerns and suicide risk. Using Chi-square analyses, participants characteristics were compared to physicians eligible for treatment. The association between demographics, faculty vs. trainee status, specialty, and distress, burnout, suicide risk, and presenting concerns was evaluated with ANOVAs and logistic regressions. RESULTS: Women, trainees, and primary care physicians were more likely to access services. On the ACORN, 63% were in the clinical range (M =1.7, SD =0.6). On the MBI, 36% scored in the clinical range. Clinicians rated 9% of participants with suicide risk. Neither gender, racial/ethnic minority status, nor specialty were associated with distress, burnout or suicide risk. Trainees reported greater distress than faculty (F (1,447) = 8.42, P = .004, [Formula: see text] = .018). Participants reported multiple presenting concerns (M = 3.0, SD = 1.18) with faculty more commonly endorsing work-related issues. Trainees more commonly reported new or worsening psychological symptoms, performance and family concerns. CONCLUSIONS: Two physician groups which often report higher levels of burnout and distress when surveyed, women physicians and residents/fellows, were the most likely to get professional help in an on-site wellness program. Physician wellness programs need to be prepared to address work and personal stressors and different levels of distress and risk.","output":"Seeking Help in the Perfect Storm: Why Residents and Faculty Access an On-Site Wellness Program"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we propose an improved version of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for forecasting the air quality index in Wuhan City, China. We propose a hybrid optimization method to improve ANFIS performance, called PSOSMA, using a new modified meta-heuristics (MH) algorithm, Slime mould algorithm (SMA), which is improved by using the particle swarm optimizer (PSO). The proposed PSOSMA-ANFIS has been trained with air quality index time series data of three years and has been applied to forecast the fine particulate matter (PM2.5), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) for one year. We also compared the proposed PSOSMA to other MH algorithms used to train ANFIS. We found that the modified ANFIS using PSOSMA achieved better performance than compared algorithms. Moreover, we analyzed the impacts of the lockdown of Wuhan City on the concentrations of PM2.5, NO2, CO2, and SO2. We compared the correspondence period with previous years, and we concluded that there are significant decreases in the concentrations of PM2.5, CO2, SO2, and NO2.","output":"Improved ANFIS model for forecasting Wuhan City Air Quality and analysis COVID-19 lockdown impacts on air quality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has unearthed many weaknesses in healthcare systems worldwide. In doing so, it has caused high-income countries to deal with the uncomfortable situation of resource allocation that has long been a daily occurrence in low- and middle-income countries. The shortage of equipment continues to be a major problem in low- and middle-income countries, but there is an even greater shortage of human resources in the form of trained individuals capable of caring for critically ill patients. With physicians being in short supply in many areas throughout Africa, the question becomes where do these human resources come from? In Kenya, clinical officers are the frontline workers and backbone of care in many healthcare settings and outnumber physicians four to one. AIC Kijabe Hospital, located in rural Kenya, recognized this need and identified this cohort of clinicians as a means of ramping up local emergency and critical care. In doing so, the Emergency and Critical Care Clinical Officer training program was created in 2015. Since its inception, the Emergency and Critical Care Clinical Officer program has been training nonphysician clinicians to care for critically ill patients with physician support. In this perspective piece, we outline our attempt at capitalizing on this pool of human resources to advance the care of critically ill patients, describe lessons learned along the way, and try to highlight the utility of their unique skill set in the setting of a pandemic.","output":"COVID-19 and the Need for Global Critical Care Training.

Although more and more scholars and companies have paid attention to the importance of enterprise transformation, most of the research on it is still at the qualitative level of theoretical descriptions and lacks a comprehensive consideration and empirical research on its motivation and performance. In view of this, this study analyzes the overall driving effect of technological innovation and the internal and external environment on enterprise transformation from the perspective of its drivers and analyzes in depth its causes and consequences for different industries (construction and real estate industries). The study also analyzes the antecedents and consequences of enterprise transformation and its differences in different industries (construction and real estate). In this study, a sample of middle and senior management of 10 companies with a valid sample of 401 is collected. Structural equation modeling results indicate that competitive advantage, technological innovation, and market pressure significantly affect enterprise transformation, which is an antecedent of corporate performance.

To enhance human-robot interaction, it is essential for robots to become more socialised, via processing multiple social cues in a complex real-world environment. Our study adopted a neurorobotic paradigm of gaze-triggered audio-visual crossmodal integration to make an iCub robot express human-like social attention responses. At first, a behavioural experiment was conducted on 37 human participants. To improve ecological validity, a round-table meeting scenario with three masked animated avatars was designed with the middle one capable of performing gaze shift, and the other two capable of generating sound. The gaze direction and the sound location are either congruent or incongruent. Masks were used to cover all facial visual cues other than the avatars' eyes. We observed that the avatar's gaze could trigger crossmodal social attention with better human performance in the audio-visual congruent condition than in the incongruent condition. Then, our computational model, GASP, was trained to implement social cue detection, audio-visual saliency prediction, and selective attention. After finishing the model training, the iCub robot was exposed to similar laboratory conditions as human participants, demonstrating that it can replicate similar attention responses as humans regarding the congruency and incongruency performance, while overall the human performance was still superior. Therefore, this interdisciplinary work provides new insights on mechanisms of crossmodal social attention and how it can be modelled in robots in a complex environment.","output":"A trained humanoid robot can perform human-like crossmodal social attention conflict resolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the novel coronavirus disease sweeps across the world, there is growing speculation on the role that atmospheric factors may have played on the different distribution of SARS-CoV-2, and on the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19. Knowing the role that environmental factors play in influenza virus outbreaks, environmental pollution and, in particular, atmospheric airborne (particulate matter, PM) has been considered as a potential key factor in the spread and mortality of COVID-19. A possible role of the PM as the virus carrier has also been debated. The role of PM in exacerbating respiratory and cardiovascular disease has been well recognized. Accumulating evidence support the hypothesis that PM can trigger inflammatory response at molecular, cellular and organ levels. On this basis, we developed the hypothesis that PM may play a role as a booster of COVID-19 rather than as a carrier of SARS-CoV-2. To support our hypothesis, we analyzed the molecular signatures detected in cells exposed to PM samples collected in one of the most affected areas by the COVID-19 outbreak, in Italy. T47D human breast adenocarcinoma cells were chosen to explore the global gene expression changes induced by the treatment with organic extracts of PM 2.5. The analysis of the KEGGs pathways showed modulation of several gene networks related to the leucocyte transendothelial migration, cytoskeleton and adhesion system. Three major biological process were identified, including coagulation, growth control and immune response. The analysis of the modulated genes gave evidence for the involvement of PM in the endothelial disease, coagulation disorders, diabetes and reproductive toxicity, supporting the hypothesis that PM, directly or through molecular interplay, affects the same molecular targets as so far known for SARS-COV-2, contributing to the cytokines storm and to the aggravation of the symptoms triggered by COVID-19. We provide evidence for a plausible cooperation of receptors and transmembrane proteins, targeted by PM and involved in COVID-19, together with new insights into the molecular interplay of chemicals and pathogens that could be of importance for sustaining public health policies and developing new therapeutic approaches.","output":"The Secretive Liaison of Particulate Matter and SARS-CoV-2.

Clinical features, chest imaging findings, laboratory tests results, treatments and clinical outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: The mean age of the infected infants was 6.43 months, with a range of 2-12 months. 61.11% of the patients were males and 38.89% females. 86.11% of the infants were infected due to family clustering. Cough (77.78%) and fever (47.22%) were the most common clinical manifestations. Chest CT scan revealed 61.11% bilateral pneumonia and 36.11% unilateral pneumonia. 47.22% of the infants developed complications. Increased leucocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and thrombocytes were observed in 11.11, 8.33, 36.11 and 44.44% of infants, respectively. Decreased leucocytes, neutrophils, thrombocyte and hemoglobin were observed in 8.33, 19.44, 2.78 and 36.11% of infants, respectively.

The global prevalence of AF (age-adjusted) is 0.60% for men and 0.37% for women and the prevalence of AF in China is 0.65%. It is expected that the number of patients with AF will continue to rise in the future worldwide due to population aging. OBJECTIVE: To explore the prevalence of AF in Chinese community population in 2019 and clarify the prevalence of AF complicated with other arrhythmias and myocardial ischemia (MI) events. METHODS: The remote electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis system of Xinhua Hospital was assessed to the screen participants with ECG evidence of AF between January 1 and December 31, 2019. The prevalence rates of AF and its association with other arrhythmias and MI events were analyzed and subgroup analysis was performed between different sexes and age groups. RESULTS: A total of 22,016 AF cases were identified out of all ECGs derived from the remote ECG diagnosis system in 2019. It is estimated that AF was presented in nearly 10.15 million people in China (age-adjusted standardized rate 0.72%, 95% CI 0.20C1.25%) in 2019 and 62% of the AF cases (6.27 million) affected people aged 65 years and above (age-adjusted standardized rate 3.56%, 95% CI 3.28C3.85%). The prevalence rate of AF in males was higher than that in females (p < 0.001), and the ventricular rate of AF patients was faster in females (p < 0.001) and younger patients (p < 0.001). AF patients with lower ventricular rate (under 60 beats per min) were associated with increased prevalence of ventricular escape/escape rhythm [p < 0.001, odds ratio (OR) 5.14] and third-degree atrioventricular block (p < 0.001, OR 32.05). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of AF is higher in the Chinese community population than that was previously reported.

These encounters can lead to multiple outcomes from symbiotic homeostasis to mutual annihilation, undergo multiple cycles of latency and lysogeny, and lead to coevolution of the interacting genomes. Such systems pose numerous challenges but also some advantages to modeling, especially in terms of functional, mathematical genome representations. The main challenges for the modeling process start with the conceptual definition of a genome for instance in the case of host-integrated viral genomes. Furthermore, hardly understood influences of the activity of either genome on the other(s) via direct and indirect mechanisms amplify the needs for a coherent description of genome activity. Finally, genetic and local environmental heterogeneities in both the hosts cellular and the pathogen populations need to be considered in multiscale modeling efforts.

Neonates underwent a brain magnetic resonance imaging scan. Their cognitive performance and EF was characterized at 2.0a?a?0.1 years (Na?=a?53) and at 4.9a?a?0.8 years (Na?=a?36) of age. Maternal sensitivity was coded based on observation of a standardized play situation at 6-mo postpartum. Neonatal TBV moderated the association between maternal sensitivity and 2-year working memory as well as all 5-year cognitive outcomes, suggesting that the positive association between maternal sensitivity and child cognition was observed only among children with large or average but not small TBV as neonates. Similar patterns were observed for TBV-corrected HC and ACG volumes.

Therefore, an unsupervised water scene dehazing network using atmospheric multiple scattering model is proposed. Unlike previous image dehazing methods, our method uses the unsupervised neural network and the atmospheric multiple scattering model and solves the problem of difficult acquisition of ideal datasets and the effect of multiple scattering on the image. In our method, in order to embed the atmospheric multiple scattering model into the unsupervised dehazing network, the unsupervised dehazing network uses four branches to estimate the scene radiation layer, transmission map layer, blur kernel layer and atmospheric light layer, the hazy image is then synthesized from the four output layers, minimizing the input hazy image and the output hazy image, where the output scene radiation layer is the final dehazing image. In addition, we constructed unsupervised loss functions which applicable to image dehazing by prior knowledge, i.e., color attenuation energy loss and dark channel loss. The method has a wide range of applications, with haze being thick and variable in marine, river and lake scenes, the method can be used to assist ship vision for target detection or forward road recognition in hazy conditions. Through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world images, the proposed method is able to recover the details, structure and texture of the water image better than five advanced dehazing methods.","output":"Unsupervised water scene dehazing network using multiple scattering model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in the disagreement or dissonance between travel attitudes and behaviours. This has shown that when people experience travel-related dissonance they are less satisfied with their travel experience. However, what remains unclear is whether people experiencing dissonance are more likely to change their travel attitude or their behaviour, so that they are more closely aligned. Moreover, it is unclear whether and how life events, such as having a child, interact with creating or reducing travel-related dissonance. Using data from a large and well-designed longitudinal study, this paper addresses these two gaps in the literature on travel-related cognitive dissonance through an exploratory study. The findings suggest that dissonant travellers are more likely to change their segment membership than consonant travellers. Furthermore, in line with the theory of cognitive dissonance, people may adjust either their attitudes or behaviours to achieve a state of consonance. This suggests that policymakers should not only focus on subtle nudges aimed at changing attitudes (and subsequently behaviours) in desirable directions but also on implementing policies aimed at directly influencing behaviours, assuming that attitudes will follow.","output":"Travel attitudes or behaviours: Which one changes when they conflict?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To design an effective and safe vaccine against betacoronaviruses, it is necessary to use their evolutionarily conservative antigenic determinants that will elicit the combination of strong humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Targeting such determinants minimizes the risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of viral infection. This phenomenon was observed in animal trials of experimental vaccines against SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV that were developed based on inactivated coronavirus or vector constructs expressing the spike protein (S) of the virion. The substitution and glycosylation of certain amino acids in the antigenic determinants of the S-protein, as well as its conformational changes, can lead to the same effect in a new experimental vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Using more conservative structural and accessory viral proteins for the vaccine antigenic determinants will help to avoid this problem. This review outlines approaches for developing vaccines against the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that are based on non-pathogenic viral vectors. For efficient prevention of infections caused by respiratory pathogens the ability of the vaccine to stimulate mucosal immunity in the respiratory tract is important. Such a vaccine can be developed using non-pathogenic Sendai virus vector, since it can be administered intranasally and induce a mucosal immune response that strengthens the antiviral barrier in the respiratory tract and provides reliable protection against infection.","output":"The Challenges of Vaccine Development against Betacoronaviruses: Antibody Dependent Enhancement and Sendai Virus as a Possible Vaccine Vector"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Simulation-based education has become the most important part of resident training in anesthesiology, especially during the pandemic. It allows learning the skills and the management of different situations without putting residents in risk of contamination, considering COVID-19 is highly contagious. The hypothesis was that simulation is still associated with improvement of knowledge acquisitions despite the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Residents of anesthesiology and intensive care subjected to an anaphylaxis simulation scenario. Their knowledge levels were assessed by true/false questions before and one month after the simulation session. The STAI test was used to measure anxiety levels before and after the scenario. Data were analyzed statistically using Wilcoxon and Mc Nemar tests. RESULTS: Junior residents (< 2 years) received significantly higher scores in post-training theoretical tests compared to their pre-training scores (79.2  9.6, 84.5  8.2, p = 0.002, n = 21).

An increase in the apoptosis of lymphocytes leads to lymphopenia and elevated thrombopoietin (THPO) promotes megakaryocyte production. The reflections of these inflammatory changes can be vital in gauging the progression of the disease. This study aimed at examining the prognostic value of normal and derived neutrophil-to-lymphocyte, lymphocyte-to-monocyte, platelet-to-lymphocyte, and mean platelet volume (MPV)-to-platelet count ratios in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methodology This was a retrospective cross-sectional study conducted in the wards of Chigateri General Hospital, Davangere for a period of two months. Complete blood count was ordered for all patients at the time of admission along with confirmation of the disease by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results The final study population consisted of 100 patients. The mean age of patients who survived (43 years) was significantly lower than the mean age of non-survivors (59.1 years), with a p-value of <0.001. NLR was raised in 60% of the population and was significantly higher in patients who survived the disease, with a p-value of 0.004. The platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) also followed a similar trend with a p-value of 0.017. Even though the lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) also mimicked the trend, the statistical association was not significant (p-value: 0.09). The derived NLR and MPV-to-platelets ratios were not found to be significantly associated with mortality in this study. Discussion Younger patients had better clinical outcomes in our study population compared to the geriatric age group. A significant correlation between LMR and mortality was observed when a cut-off of 2.5 was considered as a differentiating benchmark. Conflicting trends were observed in NLR and PLR in our study; however, LMR was in accordance with most other studies. The phase that a patient is in with regard to the natural history of the disease also influences the blood cell ratios. Nonetheless, all three ratios can be used as crucial screening and prognostic tools as they are readily available with the help of a complete hemogram. This is an investigation modality that is widely accessible even in remote areas and resource-limited settings. Conclusion These hematological ratios can facilitate in categorizing the disease severity and progression in patients, thereby enabling us to make appropriate and informed clinical decisions. Since the second wave of the novel coronavirus is on the verge of arrival, it is imperative to channel resources for the patients early in their disease course to ultimately prevent complications and reduce mortality.","output":"Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte, Lymphocyte-to-Monocyte, and Platelet-to-Lymphocyte Ratios: Prognostic Significance in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2020/21 academic year was marked by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The authors describe the rapid implementation of real-time interactive telehealth experience (RITE) courses for clerkship students to allow for meaningful engagement in remote patient care and continuation of academic progress during the pause.Methods of Course Development. Medical school administration disseminated a request for proposals for RITE courses conforming to the WCM electives format with rapid turnaround time of 1 week or less. Requirements included remote care activities, goals and objectives, general logistics, supervision methods and standards of achievement. RITE courses were developed in outpatient medicine, inpatient medicine, psychiatry and women's health. A lottery process was developed to register students for the approved courses.Course Implementation and Evaluation. Using the technical platform and standard course registration process, students were assigned to 74 of 76 available RITE course slots. Students participated in supervised remote direct patient care and also provided critical support for frontline healthcare workers by performing remote clinical tasks. Online teaching and reflection sessions were incorporated into each RITE curricular offering. Student feedback was overall positive ranging from 3.33-4.57 out of 5.Discussion. The COVID-19 pandemic created a need to rapidly incorporate telehealth models in order to continue to deliver patient care and an opportunity to develop innovative remote educational experiences.

Laboratory-based surveillance of MDROs in LTCFs is aimed at providing useful epidemiological information to healthcare providers operating in the facility, but it is only effective if the collected data are used for infection prevention and control purposes, targeting the peculiar aspects of LTCFs.","output":"Recommendations for the surveillance of multidrug-resistant bacteria in Italian long-term care facilities by the GLISTer working group of the Italian Association of Clinical Microbiologists (AMCLI)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Repurposing broad-spectrum antivirals is an immediate treatment opportunity for 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) Favipiravir is an antiviral previously indicated for influenza and Ebola, which has shown some promise in early trials for treatment of COVID-19 We aim to review existing favipiravir safety evidence, which is vital to informing the potential future use of favipiravir in COVID-19 Methods: A search was conducted across EMBASE and MEDLINE databases, supplemented by relevant grey-literature and ClinicalTrials gov All studies assessing the use of favipiravir in humans by 27 March 2020 were considered for inclusion Further analysis of available safety data from phase 2 and 3 studies was undertaken Data extracted were adverse events (AEs) grade 1-4, serious AEs and discontinuation for AEs Specific AEs of interest highlighted in early-phase studies, including gastrointestinal AEs and hyperuricaemia, were also examined Results: Twenty-nine studies were identified as potential sources of evidence of the clinical safety of favipiravir Six were phase 2 and 3 studies reporting relevant safety data for statistical comparison, representing a total of 4299 participants, an estimated 175 person-years-of-follow-up (PYFU) Comparator drugs were oseltamivir, umifenovir, lopinavir/ritonavir or placebo Study follow-up was between 5 and 21 days The proportions of grade 1-4 AEs on favipiravir was 28 2% vs 28 4% (P = n s ) in the comparison arms The proportion of discontinuations due to AEs on favipiravir was 1 1% vs 1 2% (P = n s ) in the comparison arms For serious AEs the proportion was 0 4% in both arms (P = n s ) There were significantly fewer gastrointestinal AEs occurring on favipiravir vs comparators [8 7% vs 11 5%;P = 0 003] Favipiravir showed significantly more uric acid elevations than comparators [5 8% vs 1 3%;P&lt;0 0001] Conclusions: Favipiravir demonstrates a favourable safety profile regarding total and serious AEs However, safety concerns remain: hyperuricaemia, teratogenicity and QTc prolongation have not yet been adequately studied Favipiravir may be safe and tolerable in short-term use, but more evidence is needed to assess the longer-term effects of treatment Given the limitations of the evidence and unresolved safety concerns, caution is warranted in the widespread use of favipiravir against pandemic COVID-19","output":"A review of the safety of favipiravir - a potential treatment in the COVID-19 pandemic?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper analyzes crime reports and police activity in Rio de Janeiro during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results indicate there was an overall drop in crime rates starting in April, especially in property crimes, which plummet to extremely unusual levels when compared with previous patterns. This pattern is most likely associated with an unprecedented decline in public mobility in some areas of the state. We show that the most significant reductions in street robberies occurred in neighborhoods where there was a greater decline in presence on the streets. Measures of police activity, in particular drug seizures and different types of arrests, displayed a reduction comparable with the drop in criminal indicators. In contrast, the number of police killings followed a unique pattern: in April, immediately after the adoption of social distance measures, this indicator increased above the average from the previous four years; as of May, however, it assumed a downward trend, which turned into extraordinarily low levels in June. The extreme variation in the use of force by the police during the pandemic reinforces the documented dissonance between police lethality and criminal dynamics in Rio de Janeiro, shedding light on the mechanisms that regulate police violence in the state.","output":"Crime and police activity during the COVID-19 pandemic in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The early 2000's encompassed a rising awareness by the scientific community, the general public and policy makers of the impending environmental catastrophe caused by the increasing prevalence of plastics in the environment. Soon thereafter, a slew of regulatory initiatives and policies and actions targeting plastic pollution were put forth by governments, international institutions, non-governmental organizations, companies and even by citizen groups. However, the 2020 COVID19 pandemic has disrupted this momentum, and, presently, many fear that plastic pollution will increase, not only due to the increased consumption of single-use plastic items, but also due to the ever growing need of personal protective equipment. Many plastic pollution reduction policies have been suspended, cancelled or postponed. Herein, some of these delayed policies and initiatives are overviewed and, based on publicly available data, the questions as to whether, at a global level, increased government action to address plastic pollution will continue, or will the pandemic change this paradigm, are tentatively answered, as well as whether the pandemic will affect plastic production, in particular, single-use plastics, and what the potential routes to overcome these tendencies may be. As such, the dynamics of the interaction between the restrictive measures adopted in the wake of this pandemic and plastic pollution are examined, as are the roles of different legislative and regulatory bodies, whether at the local, regional or international levels.","output":"The 2019 global pandemic and plastic pollution prevention measures: Playing catch-up"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak and worldwide pandemic of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have a significant impact on global economy and human health.

For the low-grade gliomas (Grades II-III), TERT-p mutant patients have a better prognosis than the wildtype patients, whereas for the GBMs (Grade IV), TERT-p mutation is related to a poor prognosis. We hypothesize that there exist high-risk patients in LGGs who share GBM-like molecular features, including TERT-p mutation, and need more intensive treatment than other LGGs. A molecular signature is needed to identify these high-risk patients for an accurate and timely treatment. Methods: Using the within-sample relative expression orderings of gene pairs, we identified the gene pairs with significantly stable REOs, respectively, in both the TERT-p mutant LGGs and GBMs but with opposite directions in the two groups. These reversely stable gene pairs were used as the molecular signature to stratify the LGGs into high-risk and low-risk groups. Results: A signature consisting of 21 gene pairs was developed, which can classify LGGs into two groups with significantly different overall survival. The high-risk group has a similar genetic mutation profile and a similar survival profile as GBMs, and these high-risk tumors may progress to a more malignant state. Conclusion: The 21 gene-pair signature based on REOs is capable of identifying high-risk patients in LGGs and guiding the clinical choice for appropriate and timely intervention.","output":"A Qualitative Signature to Identify TERT Promoter Mutant High-Risk Tumors in Low-Grade Gliomas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Chemosensory loss is a common symptom of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has been associated with a milder clinical course in younger patients. Whereas several studies have confirmed this association, knowledge about the improvement and recovery of olfactory and gustatory loss is lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate the temporal dynamics of improvement and recovery from sudden olfactory and gustatory loss in patients with confirmed and suspected COVID-19. METHODS Subjective chemosensory function, symptoms of COVID-19, COVID-19 tests results, demographics and medical history were collected through a questionnaire. RESULTS Among the 109 study participants, 95 had a combined olfactory and gustatory loss, five participants had isolated olfactory loss and nine participants has isolated taste loss. The mean age of participants was 39.4 years and 25% of participants were under the age of 30 years. Young age was not associated with a higher recovery rate. After a mean time of > 30 days since the chemosensory loss, participants reported relatively low recovery and improvement rates. For participants with olfactory loss, only 44% had fully recovered, whereas 28% had not yet experienced any improvement of symptoms. After gustatory loss, 50% had fully recovered, whereas 20% had not yet experienced any improvement. Olfactory and gustatory deficits were predominantly quantitative and mainly included complete loss of both olfactory and gustatory function. CONCLUSIONS Chemosensory loss was frequent in young individuals and persisted beyond a month after symptom onset, often without any improvement during this time.

However, the prevalence of ongoing care needs among those experiencing severe COVID-19 illness is unclear. AIM: This pilot study aimed to address this knowledge gap by examining GP attendance trends among patients attending a post-COVID-19 hospital follow-up clinic, 3-6 months after an initial clinic visit. DESIGN & SETTING: Data were collected from adult patients attending a post-COVID-19 follow-up clinic at the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital (MMUH), Dublin, Ireland. METHOD: Participants completed questionnaires outlining their demographics; medical histories; emergency hospital admissions and readmissions where applicable; and, where relevant, GP attendances following hospital discharge. Analyses were conducted using descriptive and inferential statistics. RESULTS: Participants' (n = 153) median age was 43.5 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 30.9-52.1 years). There were 105 females (68.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 61.3% to 75.9%). Various medical histories were reported among participants. Sixty-seven (43.2%, 95% CI = 35.9% to 51.6%) received emergency COVID-19 hospital care. Older adults, males, intensive care unit [ICU] admissions, and readmissions were common among hospital attendees. Of the hospital attendees, 16 (24%, 95% CI = 13.7% to 34.2%) attended GPs within 7 days of hospital discharge, and 26 (39%, 95% CI = 27.3% to 50.7%) within 30 days. Older adults, people with pre-existing medical conditions, and individuals admitted to ICU and/or readmitted to hospital were common among general practice attendees. CONCLUSION: Persistent health issues appear to be common among patients with severe COVID-19, particularly those who are older adults, have pre-existing health problems, and who had been in ICU and/or readmission care.

Nevertheless, empirical evidence of the effectiveness of different interventions on the containment of the epidemic was inconsistent. METHODS: We retrieved time-series intervention policy data for 145 countries from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker from December 31, 2019, to July 1, 2020, which included 8 containment and closure policies. We investigated the association of timeliness, stringency, and duration of intervention with cumulative infections per million population on July 1, 2020. We introduced a novel counterfactual estimator to estimate the effects of these interventions on COVID-19 time-varying reproduction number (R(t)). RESULTS: There is some evidence that earlier implementation, longer durations, and more strictness of intervention policies at the early but not middle stage were associated with reduced infections of COVID-19. The counterfactual model proved to have controlled for unobserved time-varying confounders and established a valid causal relationship between policy intervention and R(t) reduction. The average intervention effect revealed that all interventions significantly decrease R(t) after their implementation. R(t) decreased by 30% (22%-41%) in 25 to 32 days after policy intervention. Among the 8 interventions, school closing, workplace closing, and public events cancellation demonstrated the strongest and most consistent evidence of associations. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides more reliable evidence of the quantitative effects of policy interventions on the COVID-19 epidemic and suggested that stricter public activity interventions should be implemented at the early stage of the epidemic for improved containment.","output":"Quantifying the Effect of Public Activity Intervention Policies on COVID-19 Pandemic Containment Using Epidemiologic Data From 145 Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Almost 140 years after the identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis as the etiological agent of tuberculosis, important aspects of its biology remain poorly described.

We have carried out a detailed investigation of the M. tuberculosis sRNA, F6, and show it to be dependent on SigF for expression and significantly induced during in vitro starvation and in a mouse model of infection. However, we found no evidence of attenuation of a F6 strain within the first 20 weeks of infection. A further exploration of F6 using in vitro models of infection suggests a role for F6 as a highly specific regulator of the heat shock repressor, HrcA.

In this review, we discuss the virological, immunological, and imaging approaches harnessed for COVID-19 diagnosis and research. COVID-19 shares many clinical characteristics with other respiratory illnesses. Accurate and early detection of the infection is pivotal to controlling the outbreak, as this enables case identification, isolation, and contact tracing. We summarize the available literature on current laboratory and point-of-care diagnostics, highlight their strengths and limitations, and describe the emerging diagnostic approaches on the horizon. We also discuss the various research techniques that are being used to evaluate host immunity in laboratory-confirmed patients. Additionally, pathological imaging of tissue samples from affected patients has a critical role in guiding investigations on this disease. Conventional techniques, such as immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence, have been frequently used to characterize the immune microenvironment in COVID-19. We also outline the emerging imaging techniques, such as the RNAscope, which might also aid in our understanding of the significance of COVID-19-specific biomarkers, such as the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cellular receptor. Overall, great progress has been made in COVID-19 research in a short period.

AIMS: Examine the impact of harassment and discrimination on NHS staff working in London trusts, utilising data from the 2019 TIDES cross-sectional survey. METHOD: In total, 931 London-based healthcare practitioners participated in the TIDES survey. Regression analysis was used to examine associations between the sociodemographic characteristics of participants, exposure to discrimination and harassment, and how such exposures are associated with physical and mental health, job satisfaction and sickness absence. RESULTS: Women, Black ethnic minority staff, migrants, nurses and healthcare assistants were most at risk of discrimination and/or harassment. Experiencing either of the main exposures was associated with probable anxiety or depression. Experiencing harassment was also associated with moderate-to-severe somatic symptoms. Finally, both witnessing and experiencing the main exposures were associated with low job satisfaction and long periods of sickness absence.

Reduction of perioperative cardiovascular risk in relation to non-cardiac surgery requires a stepwise patient evaluation that integrates clinical risk factors, functional status and the estimated stress of the planned surgical procedure. Major guidelines on preoperative cardiovascular risk assessment recommend to establish, firstly, the risk of surgery per se (low, moderate, high) and the related timing (elective vs. urgent/emergent), evaluate the presence of unstable cardiac conditions or a recent coronary revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting), assess the functional capacity of the patient (usually expressed in metabolic equivalents), determine the value of non-invasive and/or invasive cardiovascular testing and then combine these data in estimating perioperative risk for major cardiac adverse events using validated scores (Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) or National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP)). This stepwise approach has the potential to guide clinicians in determining which patients could benefit from cardiovascular therapy and/or coronary artery revascularization before non-cardiac surgery towards decreasing the incidence of perioperative morbidity and mortality.

The normal brain function in modern man rarely supports the creation of highly detailed paintings, particularly the convincing representation of animal movement, without extensive training and access to modern technology. Differences in neuro-signaling and brain anatomy between modern and archaic Homo sapiens could also cause differences in perception. The brain of archaic Homo sapiens could perceive raw detailed information without using pre-established top-down concepts, as opposed to the common understanding of the normal modern non-savant brain driven by top-down control. Some ancient genes preserved in modern humans may be expressed in rare disorders. Researchers have compared Cave Art with art made by people with autism spectrum disorder. We propose that archaic primary consciousness, as opposed to modern secondary consciousness, included a savant-like perception with a superior richness of details compared to modern man. Modern people with high frequencies of Neanderthal genes, have notable anatomical features such as increased skull width in the occipital and parietal visual areas.

For the development of optimal strategies, assessing the conditions and constrains in treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic is pertinent. This study reported about a nationwide survey conducted by the Japan Society of Gynecologic Oncology. METHODS: We interviewed 265 designated training facilities about the state of their clinical practice from the time period between March and December 2020. We asked the facility doctors in charge to fill a web-based questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 232 facilities (87.5%) responded. A decrease in the number of outpatient visits was reported, and the major reason attributed was reluctance of patients to visit hospitals rather than facility restrictions. The actual number of surgeries decreased by 3.9%, compared to 2019. There was a significant difference when the variable of Prefectures operating under special safety precautions or not was introduced. There was no increase in the rate of advanced stages in the three cancer types studied. However, 34.1% participants perceived COVID-19 affected management and prognosis. CONCLUSION: Refraining from visiting hospitals based on the patient's judgment may be expected to be an issue in the future. No significant decrease in surgeries was observed, and it would seem that there were few forced changes in treatment plans, but the State of Emergency had an impact.

Despite comprising only a monolayer of cells, dysfunction of this layer renders millions of people visually impaired worldwide. Currently, corneal endothelial transplantation is the only viable means of restoring vision for these patients. However, because the supply of corneal endothelial grafts does not meet the demand, many patients remain on waiting lists, or are not treated at all. Possible alternative treatment strategies include intracameral injection of human corneal endothelial cells (HCEnCs), biomedical engineering of endothelial grafts and increasing the HCEnC density on grafts that would otherwise have been unsuitable for transplantation. Unfortunately, the limited proliferative capacity of HCEnCs proves to be a major bottleneck to make these alternatives beneficial. To tackle this constraint, proliferation enhancing genetic engineering is being investigated. This review presents the diverse array of genes that have been targeted by different genetic engineering strategies to increase the proliferative capacity of HCEnCs and their relevance for clinical and research applications. Together these proliferation-related genes form the basis to obtain a stable and safe supply of HCEnCs that can tackle the corneal endothelial donor shortage.","output":"Proliferation Increasing Genetic Engineering in Human Corneal Endothelial Cells: A Literature Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"JUUL is a groundbreaking electronic cigarette (e-cig) and the preeminent vaping product on the market.

AF is also already known to be associated with increased risk for all cause death. Purpose: In the present study we sought to investigate the impact of AF on the clinical trajectory of patients suffering from COVID-19. Methods:We included all patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 in 2020 in our Hospital. A poor clinical trajectory was defined as transfer to intensive care unit (ICU), intermediate care unit (IMC) or death from any cause. Initial ECGs were analyzed in consensus by two experienced readers. First, we compared patients with poor clinical trajectory vs. good clinical course. Secondly, the study population was categorized into two groups with or without AF on admission. A subgroup analysis was performed to differentiate between new onset AF and patients with known history of AF. To compensate for confounders (age, BMI, known cardiomyopathy (CMP), known coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic airway disease, renal insufficiency, diabetes, arterial hypertension and sex), a full clinically validated multiple logistic regression model with poor clinical trajectory as dependent target variable was performed. Results: From our enrolled 666 patients in 2020 (58% male, average age: 66 (IQR:58-80)) 223 patients (33.5%) experienced a poor clinical course. 179 (27%) patients were transferred to IMC/ICU and 86 (13%) patients died. All in all, patients with poor clinical trajectory were more frequently male (70% vs. 52%;P<0.001), older (7114 vs. 6420;P<0.001) and had significantly more co-morbidities such as CAD, CMP, hypertension and diabetes in comparison to patients with a good clinical course. 96 (14.4%) had AF on admission. Among these 37.5% had new-onset AF, which showed similar baseline characteristics as patients without AF. Indeed, patients with COVID-19 and new onset AF were more likely to die (25% vs 12%;P=0.038), or be in need for ICU/IMC (25% vs. 62%;P<0.001) and therefore experienced a poor clinical trajectory more frequently (75% vs. 31%;P<0.001) with a confounder adjusted OR of 5.89. In the subgroup analysis of all patients with AF on admission. Patients with new onset of AF had significantly more underlying CMP, Diabetes and chronic airways disease. While mortality was not higher in patients with new onset of AF, IMC/ICU transfers (62% vs 24%;P<0.001) and as a result poor clinical trajectory (75% vs 40%;P=0.001) was significantly increased in comparison to patients with known AF. Conclusion: In patients suffering from COVID-19, new onset of AF on admission was associated with a poor clinical course and higher in-hospital mortality.","output":"Atrial fibrillation is associated with poor clinical trajectory of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a worldwide pandemic is unavoidable, its spread must be observed to reduce and contain it. The Kingdom of Bahrain sought to implement the World Health Organization (WHO) directives to take precautionary measures and appropriate preventive steps to limit the spread of the coronavirus among people and developed an integrated plan to contain it. This study purposes to investigate the effect of precautionary and preventive measures in limiting the spread of coronavirus in Bahrain. Statistics and the details of precautionary measures described in this study are obtained from websites maintained by the Ministry of Health (MOH) in Bahrain. The calculated number of infected and death cases is determined by using polynomial functions that fit the data. The outcomes obtained showed that the number of cumulative infected and death cases were less than the expected numbers except for certain periods. Reopening stores and businesses that provide direct services to people after their two-week closing resulted in a 36% increased in infected cases than expected in the closing period. When the lockdown continued, the number of infected people dropped to 64% of the total number of detected infections. In accordance with our results, it is expected that the number of infected cases will gradually decrease till late March 2021.

At present, there is no reliable risk stratification tool for non-severe COVID-19 patients at admission. We aimed to construct an effective model for early identifying cases at high risk of progression to severe COVID-19. Methods SARS-CoV-2 infected patients from one center in Wuhan city and two centers in Guangzhou city, China were included retrospectively. All patients with non-severe COVID-19 during hospitalization were followed for more than 15 days after admission. Patients who deteriorated to severe or critical COVID-19 and patients who kept non-severe state were assigned to the severe and non-severe group, respectively. We compared the demographic, clinical, and laboratory data between severe and non-severe group. Based on baseline data, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm and logistic regression model were used to construct a nomogram for risk prediction in the train cohort. The predictive accuracy and discriminative ability of nomogram were evaluated by area under the curve (AUC) and calibration curve. Decision curve analysis (DCA) and clinical impact curve analysis (CICA) were conducted to evaluate the clinical applicability of our nomogram. Findings The train cohort consisted of 189 patients, while the two independent validation cohorts consisted of 165 and 18 patients. Among all cases, 72 (19.35%) patients developed severe COVID-19 and 107 (28.76%) patients had one of the following basic disease, including hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, chronic respiratory disease, tuberculosis disease. We found one demographic and six serological indicators (age, serum lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, the coefficient of variation of red blood cell distribution width (RDW), blood urea nitrogen, albumin, direct bilirubin) are associated with severe COVID-19. Based on these features, we generated the nomogram, which has remarkably high diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing individuals who exacerbated to severe COVID-19 from non-severe COVID-19 (AUC 0.912 [95% CI 0.846-0.978]) in the train cohort with a sensitivity of 85.71 % and specificity of 87.58% ; 0.853 [0.790-0.916] in validation cohort with a sensitivity of 77.5 % and specificity of 78.4%. The calibration curve for probability of severe COVID-19 showed optimal agreement between prediction by nomogram and actual observation. DCA and CICA further indicated that our nomogram conferred significantly high clinical net benefit. Interpretation Our nomogram could help clinicians to early identify patients who will exacerbate to severe COVID-19. And this risk stratification tool will enable better centralized management and early treatment of severe patients, and optimal use of medical resources via patient prioritization and thus significantly reduce mortality rates. The RDW plays an important role in predicting severe COVID-19, implying that the role of RBC in severe disease is underestimated.","output":"A Tool to Early Predict Severe 2019-Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (COVID-19) : A Multicenter Study using the Risk Nomogram in Wuhan and Guangdong, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: There is discussion evolving around the emergence of different phenotypes of Covid-19-associated thromboembolic disease, i.e. acute pulmonary embolism vs pulmonary thrombosis and different phenotypes of in situ thrombosis. With this study, we wish to provide hospitalization, treatment and in-hospital outcome data for pulmonary embolism during the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic and a corresponding 2016-2019 control period. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of claims data of Helios hospitals in Germany. Consecutive cases with a hospital admission between January 1 and December 15, 2020 and pulmonary embolism as primary discharge diagnosis were analyzed and compared to a corresponding period covering the same weeks in 2016-2019. Results: As previously reported for other emergent medical conditions, there was a hospitalization deficit coinciding with the 1st pandemic wave. Beginning with the 12-week interval May 6 - July 28, there was a stable surplus of hospital admissions in 2020. During this surplus period (May 6 - December 15, 2020), there were 2,449 hospitalizations including 45 PCR-confirmed Covid-19 cases (1.8%) as opposed to 8,717 in 2016-2019 (IRR 1.12, 95% CI 1.07-1.18, P<0.01). When excluding Covid-19 cases IRR was 1.10 (95% CI 1.05-1.15, P<0.01). While overall comorbidities expressed as weighted AHRQ Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (14.1+/-10.1 vs. 13.9+/-10.3, P=0.28), the presence of thrombosis (46.1 vs 45.4%, P=0.55) and surgery (3.8 vs. 4.3%, P=0.33) were comparable, coagulopathy (3.3 vs 4.5%, P=0.01) and metastatic cancer (3.0 vs 4.0%, P=0.03) as contributing factors were less frequently observed during the 2020 surplus. Interventional treatments (thrombolytic therapy, thrombectomy or inferior vena cava filter placement) were less frequently used (4.7 vs 6.6%, OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.58-0.89, P< 0.01). Similarly, intensive care (35.1 vs 38.8%, OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.75-0.92, P< 0.01) and mechanical ventilation utilization (7.2 vs 8.1%, OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74-1.04, P=0.14) as well as in-hospital-mortality rates (7.8 vs 9.8%, OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.64-0.90, P< 0.01) were lower in 2020 compared with 2016-2019. This was associated with a shorter length of hospital stay (6.4+/-5.4 vs. 7.2+/-5.7 days, P< 0.01) during the 2020 surplus period. Conclusions: Only a minority of cases were associated with PCR-confirmed Covid-19 but this does not rule out preceding or undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although there is a shift towards milder disease course, the increased incidence of hospitalizations for pulmonary embolism requires immediate attention, close surveillance and further studies.","output":"Hospitalizations, resource use and outcomes of acute pulmonary embolism in Germany during the Covid-19 pandemic - Emergence of different phenotypes of thrombotic disease?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The digital divideand, in particular, the homework gap have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, laying bare not only the inequities in broadband Internet access but also how these inequities ultimately affect citizens ability to learn, work, and play.

Perceiver participants assessed the warmth and competence of the selfies and texts as well (others perception). Meta-accuracy was measured as the absolute difference between metaperception and others perception. Through correlational analyses, we confirmed that meta-accuracy of first impressions on the Internet aligned with the universal dimensions of social cognition (warmth and competence), found sporadic evidence for the positive association between meta-accuracy and social competence, and showed that meta-accuracy for specific Internet expressive means varied with varying proficiency in these means. Through t-tests, we demonstrated positive meta-accuracy bias for selfies along the warmth dimension and negative bias for text along the competence dimension. Overall, our results suggest the primacy of warmth and uniqueness of the male targets-female perceivers combination for meta-accuracy on the Internet. Our findings expand knowledge about first impressions meta-accuracy on the Internet.","output":"Meta-Accuracy on the Internet: Initial Tests of Underlying Dimensions, Contributing Factors, and Biases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a new disease that we do not know yet how to treat, is rapidly evolving and has forced us to stay indoors. Surprisingly, a broad range of symptoms has been reported since COVID-19 emergence. Individual variations in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 can be due to non-genetic and genetic factors. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is an inherited condition that is associated with an increased risk of liver and lung diseases which may increase susceptibility to COVID-19 infection. At the same time, there could be a possibility of developing non-hereditary AATD. DISCUSSION: In addition to some evidence showing the role of vitamin D deficiency in COVID-19 pathology, it has been recognized that there is a biological link between AAT and vitamin D. Therefore, here we offer a new perspective that lower vitamin D levels in COVID-19 patients can cause acquired AATD that provide a condition with more disease severity and a higher risk of death. As a consequence, COVID-19 individuals with vitamin D deficiency may have a higher risk of morbidity and mortality. CONCLUSION: Therefore, early vitamin D and AAT assessments and optimal interventions could be helpful to prevent severe COVID-19 outcomes.","output":"Association of alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency with vitamin D status: who is most at risk of getting severe COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted many areas of the human and organizational ventures worldwide. This includes new innovative technologies and strategies being developed by educators to foster the rapid learning-recovery and reinstatement of the stakeholders (e.g., teachers and students). Indeed, the main challenge for educators has been on what appropriate steps should be taken to prevent learning loss for the students; ranging from how to provide efficient learning tools/curriculum that ensures continuity of learning, to provision of methods that incorporate coping mechanisms and acceleration of education in general. For several higher educational institutions (HEIs), technology-mediated education has become an integral part of the modern teaching/learning instruction amidst the Covid-19 pandemic, when digital technologies have consequently become an inevitable and indispensable part of learning. To this effect, this study defines a hybrid educational model (HyFlex + Tec) used to enable virtual and in-person education in the HEIs. Practically, the study utilized data usage report from Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and Emotions and Experience Survey questionnaire in a higher education setting for its experiments. To this end, we applied an Exponential Linear trend model and Forecasting method to determine overall progress and statistics for the learners during the Covid-19 pandemic, and subsequently performed a Text Mining and Univariate Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to determine effects and significant differences that the teaching-learning experiences for the teachers and students have on their energy (learning motivation) levels. From the results, we note that the hybrid learning model supports continuity of education/learning for teachers and students during the Covid-19 pandemic. The study also discusses its innovative importance for future monitoring (tracking) of learning experiences and emotional well-being for the stakeholders in leu (aftermath) of the Covid-19 pandemic.","output":"Technology-mediated teaching and learning process: A conceptual study of educators' response amidst the Covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose - This study aims to research how the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) impacts the selected sector price indices in Borsa Istanbul (BIST), Turkey.

Specimens were screened for HCoV by real-time RT-PCR, and 7 other common respiratory viruses were tested simultaneously by PCR or real-time PCR. HCoV was detected in 294 cases (2.25%) of the 13048 samples, with most of them inpatients (251 cases, 85.4% of HCoV positive cases) and young children not in nursery (53.06%, 156 out of 294 HCoV positive cases). Four HCoVs, as OC43, 229E, NL63 and HKU1 were detected prevalent during 2010C2015 in Guangzhou, and among the HCoV positive cases, 60.20% were OC43, 16.67% were 229E, 14.97% were NL63 and 7.82% were HKU1. The month distribution showed that totally HCoV was prevalent in winter, but differences existed in different species. The 5 year distribution of HCoV showed a peak-valley distribution trend, with the detection rate higher in 2011 and 2013 whereas lower in 2010, 2012 and 2014. The age distribution revealed that children (especially those <3 years old) and old people (>50 years) were both high risk groups to be infected by HCoV. Of the 294 HCoV positive patients, 34.69% (101 cases) were co-infected by other common respiratory viruses, and influenza virus was the most common co-infecting virus (30/101, 29.70%). Fifteen HCoV-OC43 positive samples of 2013C2014 were selected for S gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, and the results showed that the 15 strains could be divided into 2 clusters in the phylogenetic tree, 12 strains of which formed a separate cluster that was closer to genotype G found in Malaysia.

Evidence states that tissue RAAS locally generates mediators with regulatory homeostatic functions, thus contributing, at some extent, to organ dysfunction or disease. Specifically, RAAS can be divided into the traditional RAAS pathway (or classic RAAS) mediated by angiotensin II (AII), and the non-classic RAAS pathway mediated by angiotensin 1-7. Both pathways operate in the heart and lung. In the heart, the classic RAAS plays a role in both hemodynamics and tissue remodeling associated with cardiomyocyte and endothelial dysfunction, leading to progressive functional impairment. Moreover, the local classic RAAS may predispose the onset of atrial fibrillation through different biological mechanisms involving inflammation, accumulation of epicardial adipose tissue, and electrical cardiac remodeling. In the lung, the classic RAAS regulates cell proliferation, immune-inflammatory response, hypoxia, and angiogenesis, contributing to lung injury and different pulmonary diseases (including COVID-19). Instead, the local non-classic RAAS counteracts the classic RAAS effects exerting a protective action on both heart and lung. Moreover, the non-classic RAAS, through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), mediates the entry of the etiological agent of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) into cells. This may cause a reduction in ACE2 and an imbalance between angiotensins in favor of AII that may be responsible for the lung and heart damage. Drugs blocking the classic RAAS (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers) are well known to exert a cardiovascular benefit. They are recently under evaluation for COVID-19 for their ability to block AII-induced lung injury altogether with drugs stimulating the non-classic RAAS. Herein, we discuss the available evidence on the role of RAAS in the heart and lung, summarizing all clinical data related to the use of drugs acting either by blocking the classic RAAS or stimulating the non-classic RAAS.","output":"The Role of Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System in the Heart and Lung: Focus on COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The initial COVID-19 pandemic surge in New York City caused widespread delays and disruption in end-of-life services.

We also adapt the assay for use in compound screening and in doing so uncover additional SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors. We observe strong concordance between data emerging from this assay and those obtained from live virus testing. The reported approach democratizes the testing of 3CLpro inhibitors by developing a simplified method for identifying coronavirus 3CLpro inhibitors that can be used by the majority of laboratories, rather than the few with extensive biosafety infrastructure. We identify two lead compounds, GC376 and compound 4, with broad activity against all 3CL proteases tested including 3CLpro enzymes from understudied zoonotic coronaviruses.ImportanceMultiple coronavirus pandemics have occurred over the last two decades.

METHODS: We performed an international retrospective study of COVID-19 patients on ECMO from 13 intensive care units from March 1 to April 30, 2020. Demographic data, ECMO characteristics and clinical outcomes were collected. The primary outcome was to assess the complication rate and 28-day mortality; the secondary outcome was to compare patient and ECMO characteristics between COVID-19 patients on ECMO and non-COVID-19 related ARDS patients on ECMO (non-COVID-19; January 1, 2018 until July 31, 2019). RESULTS: During the study period 71 COVID-19 patients received ECMO, mostly veno-venous, for a median duration of 13 days (IQR 7-20). ECMO was initiated at 5 days (IQR 3-10) following invasive mechanical ventilation. Median PaO2/FiO2 ratio prior to initiation of ECMO was similar in COVID-19 patients (58 mmHg [IQR 46-76]) and non-COVID-19 patients (53 mmHg [IQR 44-66]), the latter consisting of 48 patients. 28-day mortality was 37% in COVID-19 patients and 27% in non-COVID-19 patients. However, Kaplan-Meier curves showed that after a 100-day follow-up this non-significant difference resolves. Non-surviving COVID-19 patients were more acidotic prior to initiation ECMO, had a shorter ECMO run and fewer received muscle paralysis compared to survivors. CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences in outcomes were found between COVID-19 patients on ECMO and non-COVID-19 ARDS patients on ECMO.

Thus, imaging ATP molecule in both cellular and extracellular contexts has many applications in biology, engineering, and clinics. A sensitive and selective fluorescence signal-on probe for ATP detection was constructed, based on the base recognition between a black hole quencher (BHQ)-labeled aptamer oligonucleotide and a fluorophore (Cy5)-labeled reporter flare. The probe was able to detect ATP in solution with single digit M detection limit. With the assistance of lipofectamine, this probe efficiently entered and shined in the model cells U2OS within 3 h. Further application of the probe in specific scenery, cardio-tissue engineering, was also tested where the ATP aptamer complex was able to sense cellular ATP status in a semi-quantitative manner, representing a novel approach for selection of functional cardiomyocytes for tissue engineering. At last a slight change in probe configuration in which a flexible intermolecular A14 linker was introduced granted regeneration capability.

Gaining insight into factors regarding willingness or refusal for vaccination might guide our goals in raising the awareness and target efforts to increase acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine and maximize the uptake. Therefore, this study aims to assess the intent to receive the COVID-19 vaccine among Lebanese adults and the factors associated with vaccine refusal. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study during November-December 2020 among Lebanese adults from all Lebanese regions using a survey tool with closed-ended questions that included sociodemographic data and questions about vaccine hesitancy, knowledge, attitude, practice, and fear of COVID-19. We used the snowball technique to collect the data because of the COVID-19 imposed lockdown. RESULTS: Of the 579 participants, 21.4% were willing to receive the vaccine, 40.9% refused, and the remainder were unsure of their response. More vaccine hesitancy (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.06; 95% CI 1.03-1.09) was significantly associated with more odds of disagreeing/ strongly disagreeing on receiving the COVID-19 vaccine compared to being neutral. More vaccine hesitancy (aOR = 0.95; 95% CI 0.91-0.99), female gender compared to males (aOR = 0.53; 95% CI 0.32-0.87), and being married compared to single (aOR = 0.53; 95% CI 0.29-0.98) were significantly associated with lower odds of agreeing/strongly agreeing on receiving the COVID-19 vaccine compared to being neutral. CONCLUSION: Overall, our findings revealed a high percentage of people (40%) who strongly disagreed with receiving the vaccine, mainly females, married participants, and those who have a general vaccine hesitancy. Moreover, no significant association was found with knowledge, attitude, or prevention practice regarding COVID-19. Targeted efforts are necessary to increase acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine among the Lebanese population to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Further studies with a larger sample size are warranted to validate our results and provide better insights into the underlying reasons for refusing vaccination.","output":"Attitudes of Lebanese adults regarding COVID-19 vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The RIKEN BioResource Research Center (BRC) was established in 2001 as a comprehensive biological resource center in Japan.

The extent to which repeated doses of ketamine (versus placebo) reduce depression in the short and long term among outpatients with TRD and chronic, current suicidal ideation remains unknown. METHODS Twenty-six medicated outpatients with severe major depressive disorder with current, chronic suicidal ideation were randomized in a double-blind fashion to six ketamine infusions (0.5 mg/kg over 45 minutes) or saline placebo over three weeks. Depression and suicidal ideation were assessed at baseline, 240 min post-infusion, and during a three-month follow-up phase. RESULTS During the infusion phase, there was no differences in depression severity or suicidal ideation between placebo and ketamine (p = 0.47 and p = 0.32, respectively). At the end of the infusion phase, two patients in the ketamine group and one in the placebo group met criteria for remission of depression. At three-month follow-up, two patients in each group met criteria for remission from depression. LIMITATIONS Limitations include the small sample size, uncontrolled outpatient medication regimens, and restriction to outpatients, which may have resulted in lower levels of suicidal ideation than would be seen in emergency or inpatient settings. CONCLUSIONS Repeated, non-escalating doses of ketamine did not outperform placebo in this double-blind, placebo controlled study of patients with severe TRD and current, chronic suicidal ideation. This result may support our previously published open-label data that, in this severely and chronically ill outpatient population, the commonly used dose of 0.5 mg/kg is not sufficient.","output":"Repeat-dose ketamine augmentation for treatment-resistant depression with chronic suicidal ideation: A randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Three-dimensional networks-on-chip appear as a new on-chip communication solution in many-core based systems.

However, the mechanism and function of the mammalian RNA interference (RNAi) response are poorly understood. Here, we characterized antiviral RNAi in a mouse model of infection with Nodamura virus (NoV), a mosquito-transmissible positive-strand RNA virus encoding a known double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding viral suppressor of RNAi (VSR), the B2 protein. We show that inhibition of NoV RNA replication by antiviral RNAi in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) requires Dicer-dependent vsiRNA biogenesis and Argonaute-2 slicer activity. We found that VSR-B2 of NoV enhances viral RNA replication in wild-type but not RNAi-defective MEFs such as Argonaute-2 catalytic-dead MEFs and Dicer or Argonaute-2 knockout MEFs, indicating that VSR-B2 acts mainly by suppressing antiviral RNAi in the differentiated murine cells. Consistently, VSR-B2 expression in MEFs has no detectable effect on the induction of interferon-stimulated genes or the activation of global RNA cleavages by RNase L. Moreover, we demonstrate that NoV infection of adult mice induces production of abundant vsiRNA active to guide RNA slicing by Argonaute-2. Notably, VSR-B2 suppresses the biogenesis of both vsiRNA and the slicing-competent vsiRNA-Argonaute-2 complex without detectable inhibition of Argonaute-2 slicing guided by endogenous microRNA, which dramatically enhances viral load and promotes lethal NoV infection in adult mice either intact or defective in the signaling by type I, II, and III interferons.

With an increased focus on avoiding mechanical ventilation, particularly in preterm infants, there are fewer opportunities for clinicians to gain proficiency in this important emergency skill. Rates of successful intubation at the first attempt are relatively low, and adverse event rates are high, when compared with intubations in paediatric and adult populations. Interventions to improve operator success and patient stability during neonatal endotracheal intubations are needed. Using nasal high flow therapy extends the safe apnoea time of adults undergoing upper airway surgery and during endotracheal intubation. This technique is untested in neonates. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Stabilisation with nasal High flow during Intubation of NEonates (SHINE) trial is a multicentre, randomised controlled trial comparing the use of nasal high flow during neonatal intubation with standard care (no nasal high flow). Intubations are randomised individually, and stratified by site, use of premedications, and postmenstrual age (<28 weeks gestation; 28 weeks gestation). The primary outcome is the incidence of successful intubation on the first attempt without physiological instability of the infant. Physiological instability is defined as an absolute decrease in peripheral oxygen saturation >20% from preintubation baseline and/or bradycardia (<100 beats per minute). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The SHINE trial received ethical approval from the Human Research Ethics Committees of The Royal Womens Hospital, Melbourne, Australia and Monash Health, Melbourne, Australia.

CASE PRESENTATION: A 29-year-old African American female presented to the emergency department with numbness and paresthesia of 2-month duration in her left lower extremity and 2-week duration in her right lower extremity. The patient reported difficulty ambulating, paresthesia below the umbilicus, and back pain radiating to bilateral lower extremities. She endorsed 9-month history of cough, subjective fevers, night sweats, and unintentional 15 kg weight loss. Examination revealed 4/5 strength in the left lower extremity. MRI of the brain and spinal cord revealed enhancing extradural lesions, with spinal cord compression at T8 measuring 1.3  1.9 cm. Lumbar puncture demonstrated oligoclonal bands and increased CSF neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and protein. T8 laminectomy with resection of the epidural lesion was performed. Histology showed granulomas, consistent with neurosarcoidosis. At follow-up, repeat spinal MRI revealed disease progression with intramedullary involvement. Long-term immunosuppressive treatment was eventually initiated with satisfactory response. DISCUSSION: This is a rare case of myelopathy secondary to spinal extradural neurosarcoidosis.

RESULTS: Ten patients with COVID-19 related shock were treated with angiotensin II. Over the initial 6 hours, the average the norepinephrine equivalent dose decreased by 30.4% (from 64.6 mcg/min to 44 mcg/min) without a significant change in the mean arterial pressure (0.7% decrease). Six patients experienced at least a 25% reduction in norepinephrine equivalent dose by 6 hours, and two experienced at least a 50% reduction.

Unfortunately, these apps have not yet proven sufficiently effective, partly owing to low adoption rates, but also due to the difficult tradeoff between utility and privacy and the fact that, in COVID-19, most individuals do not infect anyone but a few superspreaders infect many in superspreading events.

Feeding sites can favour high densities, home range overlap, greater sedentary behaviour and increased interspecific contacts, all of which might promote parasite transmission. In the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus bieti), human interventions via provisioning monkeys at specific feeding sites have led to the sub-structuring of a group into genetically differentiated sub-groups. The fed subgroup is located near human hamlets and interacts with domesticated animals. Using high-throughput sequencing, we investigated Entamoeba species diversity in a local host assemblage strongly influenced by provisioning for wildlife-related tourism. We identified 13 Entamoeba species or lineages in faeces of Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys, humans and domesticated animals (including pigs, cattle, and domestic chicken). In Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys, Entamoeba prevalence and OTU richness were higher in the fed than in the wild subgroup. Entamoeba polecki was found in monkeys, pigs and humans, suggesting that this parasite might circulates between the wild and domestic components of this local socialCecological system. The highest proportion of faeces positive for Entamoeba in monkeys geographically coincided with the presence of livestock and humans.

The implementation of such sites should carefully consider the risk of creating hotspots of disease transmission, which should be prevented by maintaining a buffer zone between monkeys and livestock/humans.

Such concern is driven by the widespread availability of radiological materials and the intentions of malfeasants and organizations around the world to do harm to others. In contrast to nuclear materials, radiological materials are ubiquitous and are found in most cities throughout the country at academic institutions, hospitals, and many businesses and industrial settings. In contrast, nuclear materials are difficult to access because of their rarity and the security of the settings in which they are found. A radiological or nuclear incident of any kind will require prompt assessment of the location and nature of the incident, activation of mass casualty response systems, followed by immediate consultation of hematology, health and medical physics, and nuclear medicine personnel. Radiation-induced injuries and illnesses are typically delayed. Successful assessment and management of individuals with acute radiation syndrome (ARS), including the hematopoietic subsyndrome (HS), is required to support management of injuries resulting from a high radiation dose, including injuries to the gastrointestinal and neurovascular systems. Administration of cytokines within 24 h of exposure shortens the period of granulocytopenia and is strongly recommended by subject matter experts in the management of the HS. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation after failure of a 2C3 week trial of cytokines has been clearly documented and is weakly recommended in selected individuals with the HS. Administration of prophylactic and therapeutic broad-spectrum antimicrobials (including antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal agents) is recommended and should be guided by recommendations of the Infectious Diseases Society of America for management of febrile neutropenia. This article provides an overview for clinicians who are called upon in a radiological and/or nuclear incident to manage individuals with ARS and other radiation-related illnesses.","output":"Radiological and Nuclear Terrorism: The Oncologic Emergency Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) is a cyclic sequence of physical and behavioral symptoms that arise in the second half of the menstrual cycle. The extreme type of PMS is Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD). The current study aims at examining 1) the effects of childhood maltreatment and current lifes stressful events on PMDD, and 2) the mediating role of depression in these associations among Lebanese university female students. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted between February and March 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lebanese students were recruited using a snowball technique from all national universities in Lebanon via an auto-administrated online survey. Structural equation modeling was performed to examine the structural relationship between childhood maltreatment and lifes stressful events, depression and PMDD. RESULTS: Higher lifes stressful events (Beta = 0.18; p < 0.001), physical (Beta = 0.19; p < 0.001), sexual (Beta = 0.18; p < 0.001) and psychological (Beta = 0.33; p < 0.001) abuse were significantly associated with higher depression. Moreover, higher sexual (Beta = 0.11; p = 0.021) and psychological (Beta = 0.11; p = 0.040) abuse and higher depression (Beta = 0.37; p < 0.001) were significantly associated with higher PMDD. The indirect relationships between psychological abuse/sexual abuse, depression and PMDD showed that depression mediated the association between both psychological (Beta = 0.22; p = 0.001) and sexual (Beta = 0.38; p = 0.004) abuse and PMDD. CONCLUSION: This work presents a unique analysis using the structural equation model that enlightens the effect of childhood maltreatment, particularly sexual and psychological abuse on PMMD symptoms, with depression playing the role of a mediating factor. It would be interesting to test, in future studies, whether there are other mediating factors besides depression that could be indirect indicators of PMDD.","output":"Premenstrual dysphoric disorder and childhood maltreatment, adulthood stressful life events and depression among Lebanese university students: a structural equation modeling approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study mainly examined student's technology capability and their perception of social presence in online learning during COVID-19 pandemic.

Hence, there is an important role for antiviral therapy in the management of influenza. While amantadine and rimantadine have been available for the treatment of influenza in some countries for several years, they are only effective against influenza A viruses, they can have neurological and gastrointestinal adverse effects, and resistant virus is rapidly generated. Neuraminidase inhibitors, a new class of drug, are potent and specific inhibitors of all strains of influenza virus, and they have minimal adverse effects. The greatest benefit is seen in those patients presenting <30 hours after development of influenza symptoms, those with severe symptoms or those in high-risk groups. In addition to treatment of the infection, both drugs are effective prophylactically and have been shown to limit spread of infection in close communities, such as families and in nursing homes. No resistant virus strains have been isolated from normal individuals treated with zanamivir. Resistant virus can be isolated from approximately 1% of adults and 5% of paediatric patients with influenza treated with oseltamivir. However, infectivity of mutant viruses is generally compromised. Governments spend millions of dollars on influenza vaccination campaigns; however, once influenza virus is circulating in the community, vaccination cannot limit the spread of disease. A greater promotion of the use of neuraminidase inhibitors for the treatment and prevention of influenza could have a significant impact on limiting its spread. This could result in saving millions of dollars, not only in direct costs associated with medical and hospital care, but also significant savings in indirect costs associated with the loss of productivity at work, school and home environments. For the benefit of all communities, there needs to be a greater awareness of the symptoms of influenza and the efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in disease treatment.","output":"Management of Influenza Virus Infections with Neuraminidase Inhibitors: Detection, Incidence, and Implications of Drug Resistance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world has seen an explosion in mobile device technology over the past decade, in addition to the impact that COVID-19 has placed on nursing education programs.

However, the relationship between MVPA and MSE and overweight/obesity has not been examined among German adults. Aim of this study was to examine whether meeting the guidelines for both MVPA and MSE is associated with a lower prevalence of overweight/obesity compared to meeting MVPA or MSE alone or none of them, among a nationally representative sample of German adults. Methods: The cross-sectional study drew data from the 2014 German Health Update (GEDA) (n=22,822; 18 years). Physical activity (MVPA-MSE), height/weight, socio-demographic, health and lifestyle factors were assessed by self-report via validated questionnaires. Generalized linear models with Poisson regression were used to assess prevalence ratios of Body Mass Index-derived (BMI) overweight/obesity across categories of physical activity guideline adherence (met neither; MSE only; MVPA only; met both). Results: Compared to other physical activity groups, meeting both the MVPA-MSE guidelines was associated with the lowest prevalence rate of overweight/obesity (Adjusted Prevalence Ratios [APR] range: 0.25-0.73). Associations between BMI and physical activity were strongest among Class II obesity (APR range: 0.25-0.45). The associations remained consistent after adjusting sociodemographic and lifestyle factors. Conclusions: Meeting the combined MVPA-MSE guideline, as suggested in the German national physical activity recommendations, showed the lowest overweight/obesity prevalence. Promoting uptake and adherence of both MVPA and MSE at the population level could help to reduce the public health burden of obesity.","output":"Association of meeting both muscle strengthening and aerobic exercise guidelines with prevalent overweight and obesity classes - results from a nationally representative sample of German adults."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Orodispersible films (ODFs) are an attractive delivery system for a myriad of clinical applications and possess both large economical and clinical rewards. However, the manufacturing of ODFs does not adhere to contemporary paradigms of personalised, on-demand medicine, nor sustainable manufacturing. To address these shortcomings, both three-dimensional (3D) printing and machine learning (ML) were employed to provide on-demand manufacturing and quality control checks of ODFs. Direct ink writing (DIW) was able to fabricate complex ODF shapes, with thicknesses of less than 100 m. ML algorithms were explored to classify the ODFs according to their active ingredient, by using their near-infrared (NIR) spectrums. A supervised model of linear discriminant analysis was found to provide 100% accuracy in classifying ODFs. A subsequent partial least square algorithm was applied to verify the dose, where a coefficient of determination of 0.96, 0.99 and 0.98 was obtained for ODFs of paracetamol, caffeine, and theophylline, respectively. Therefore, it was concluded that the combination of 3D printing, NIR and ML can result in a rapid production and verification of ODFs.

The current COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased adoption of telemedicine with national orthopaedic governing bodies advocating its use, as evidence suggests that social distancing maybe necessary until 2022. This systematic review aims to explore evidence for telemedicine in orthopaedics to determine its advantages, validity, effectiveness and utilisation. METHODS Databases of PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and CINHAL were systematically searched and articles were included if they involved any form of telephone or video consultation in an orthopaedic population. Findings were synthesised into four themes: patient/clinician satisfaction, accuracy and validity of examination, safety and patient outcomes and cost effectiveness. Quality assessment was undertaken using Cochrane and Joanna Briggs Institute appraisal tools. RESULTS Twenty-one studies were included consisting of nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Studies revealed high patient satisfaction with telemedicine for convenience, less waiting and travelling time. Telemedicine was cost effective particularly if patients had to travel long distances, required hospital transport or time off work. No clinically significant differences were found in patient examination nor measurement of patient-reported outcome measures. Telemedicine was reported to be a safe method of consultation. DISCUSSION Evidence suggests that telemedicine in orthopaedics can be safe, cost effective, valid in clinical assessment and with high patient/clinician satisfaction.

METHODS: Using COVID-19-associated mortality data from England, we fitted multiple functional forms linking density with transmission. We projected forwards beyond lockdown to ascertain the consequences of different functional forms on infection resurgence. RESULTS: COVID-19-associated mortality data from England show evidence of increasing with population density until a saturating level, after adjusting for local age distribution, deprivation, proportion of ethnic minority population and proportion of key workers among the working population. Projections from a mathematical model that accounts for this observation deviate markedly from the current status quo for SARS-CoV-2 models which either assume linearity between density and transmission (30% of models) or no relationship at all (70%). Respectively, these classical model structures over- and underestimate the delay in infection resurgence following the release of lockdown. CONCLUSION: Identifying saturation points for given populations and including transmission terms that account for this feature will improve model accuracy and utility for the current and future pandemics.","output":"The importance of saturating density dependence for population-level predictions of SARS-CoV-2 resurgence compared with density-independent or linearly density-dependent models, England, 23 March to 31 July 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease of the 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has increasingly spread worldwide with tremendous damage.

The full length of CCNL was obtained by 5 and 3 rapid amplification of cDNA ends. CCNL roles in granulosa cell apoptosis, mitochondrial function, and glucose uptake were evaluated. The binding relationship between CCNL and forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) was determined by RPISeq, RNA immunoprecipitation, subcellular fractionation, and immunofluorescence. In KGN cells and hLGCs, CCNL overexpression upregulated FOXO1 expression, promoted cell apoptosis, reduced glucose transport capability, and impaired mitochondrial function, and these effects were partially abolished by silencing FOXO1. The interaction of CCNL with FOXO1 might prevents FOXO1 exclusion from the nucleus and subsequent degradation in the cytosol. We determined that CCNL serve as a facilitator in the processes of PCOS.

Tonsillectomy, alone or with adenoidectomy, is one of the most common surgeries performed by otolaryngologists. Although they are generally accepted as elective surgeries, they significantly improve the quality of life, and postponing these surgeries for a long time can have deteriorative effects on the patients. We aimed to investigate the presence of SARS CoV-2 in the adenotonsillectomy materials to find out if performing adenotonsillectomy is safe during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Forty-eight tissue samples from 32 patients that underwent tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy were investigated whose SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test in the samples obtained from nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs were negative within 24 h before the operation. While 16 patients underwent only tonsillectomy and one of their tonsils was investigated, 16 of the patients underwent adenotonsillectomy and their adenoid tissues were sent along with one of their tonsils. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was investigated with Real-Time PCR in tissue samples. Results Two (4.2%) tissue samples had positive PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2, while 46 of them were negative.

Analyses revealed that non-progressors demonstrated a reduction in expression of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes, which were positively correlated with the expression of DNA repair enzymes, namely genes involved in base excision repair (BER) machinery. Reduced expression of OXPHOS and BER genes was linked to decrease in expression of inflammation-related genes, higher glucose disposal rate and reduced measures of hepatic fatty liver.

Specific risk factors include sufficient interaction between infected humans and recipient animals, suitability of the animal host factors for productive virus infection, and suitability of the animal host population for viral persistence. Of particular concern is virus spread to susceptible animal species, in which group housing and contact network structure could potentially result in an alternative virus reservoir, from which reintroduction into humans can take place. Virus exposure in high-density populations could allow sustained transmission in susceptible animal species.

Although dementia-friendly communities provide valued support for carers, access to them is limited as they are few and geographically dispersed. OBJECTIVE This study's aim was to increase support and services for rural informal carers of people living with dementia by using information and communication technologies accessed through an integrated website and mobile app-the Verily Connect app. The objective of this protocol is to detail the research design used in a complex study that was situated in a challenging real-world setting integrating web-based and on-ground technology and communication. Therefore, it is anticipated that this protocol will strengthen the research of others exploring similar complex concepts. METHODS A stepped-wedge, open-cohort cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted to implement Verily Connect across 12 rural Australian communities. The Verily Connect intervention delivered web-based, curated information about dementia, a localized directory of dementia services and support, group and individual chat forums, and peer support through videoconference. During the implementation phase of 32 weeks, Verily Connect was progressively implemented in four 8-weekly waves of 3 communities per wave. Usual care, used as a comparator, was available to carers throughout the study period. Participants and researchers were unblinded to the intervention. There were 3 cohorts of participants: carers, volunteers, and staff; participants were recruited from their communities. The primary outcome measure was perceived carer social support measured using the Medical Outcomes Study-Social Support Survey. Volunteers and staff provided feedback on their participation in Verily Connect as qualitative data. Qualitative data were collected from all cohorts of participants through interviews and focus groups. Process evaluation data were collected through interviews and memos written by research staff. Data on the costs of implementing Verily Connect were collected by the research team members and evaluated by a health economist. RESULTS Between August 2018 and September 2019, a total of 113 participants were recruited. There were 37 (32.7%) carers, 39 (34.5%) volunteers, and 37 (32.7%) health service staff. The study was complex because of the involvement of multiple and varied communities of carers, volunteers, health service staff, and research team members originating from 5 universities. Web-based technologies were used as intervention strategies to support carers and facilitate the process of undertaking the study. CONCLUSIONS The Verily Connect trial enabled the testing and further development of a web-based approach to increasing support for carers of people living with dementia across a diverse rural landscape in Australia. This protocol provides an example of how to conduct a pragmatic evaluation of a complex and co-designed intervention involving multiple stakeholders.

In this article, we propose a CNN called depthwise separable convolution network with wavelet multiresolution analysis module (WMR-DepthwiseNet) that is robust to automatically learn details from both spatialwise and channelwise for COVID-19 identification with a limited radiograph dataset, which is critical due to the rapid growth of COVID-19. This model utilizes an effective strategy to prevent loss of spatial details, which is a prevalent issue in traditional convolutional neural network, and second, the depthwise separable connectivity framework ensures reusability of feature maps by directly connecting previous layer to all subsequent layers for extracting feature representations from few datasets.

During the first coronavirus disease (COVID-19 ) outbreak in Spain from March to June 2020, we designed a model of remote monitoring of our patients with amino acid disorders using telephone and/or online clinical assessments and using filter paper samples to continue the biochemical control. Results: . Fourteen patients with inborn errors of amino acid metabolism other than PKU received filter papers and instructions to collect blood and urine samples home and send them to our reference laboratory. Conclusions: . Considering the COVID19 pandemic evolution, new strategies to ensure IEM patients have an evaluation continuity need to be implemented. We believe that blood and urine filter paper biochemical follow-up, together with online or telephone clinical assessments, can help minimize the need for in-hospital visits.","output":"Successful Remote Monitoring During COVID-19 Pandemic of Patients with Inborn Errors of the Amino acid Metabolism not including PKU from a Single Reference center using Filter Paper Samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, knowledge about the natural course of recovery of COVID-19 is limited We therefore describe - based on generic knowledge of post IC syndrome (PICS) and (pulmonary) rehabilitation - the possibilities to organize personalized rehabilitation programs in several care settings To illustrate variety in need for rehabilitation, we described three cases of critical COVID-19 disease survivors after treatment in the intensive care unit Some patients require immediate rehabilitation following hospitalization, but rehabilitation may also be initiated in the home environment For the latter population monitoring of progress and recovery should be organized to assess whether a more intensified multidisciplinary rehabilitation program is needed This may be initiated in one of the medical rehabilitation centers or in pulmonary rehabilitation centers Post-COVID-19 rehabilitation, regardless of the specific form, should be patient-centered and multidisciplinary organized","output":"[Post-COVID-19 rehabilitation;a matter of customisation]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has been growing exponentially, affecting over 4 million people and causing enormous distress to economies and societies worldwide. A plethora of analyses based on viral sequences has already been published both in scientific journals and through non-peer-reviewed channels to investigate the genetic heterogeneity and spatiotemporal dissemination of SARS-CoV-2. However, a systematic investigation of phylogenetic information and sampling bias in the available data is lacking. Although the number of available genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 is growing daily and the sequences show increasing phylogenetic information, country-specific data still present severe limitations and should be interpreted with caution. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the quality of the currently available SARS-CoV-2 full genome data in terms of sampling bias as well as phylogenetic and temporal signals to inform and guide the scientific community. METHODS: We used maximum likelihood-based methods to assess the presence of sufficient information for robust phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies in several SARS-CoV-2 sequence alignments assembled from GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) data released between March and April 2020. RESULTS: Although the number of high-quality full genomes is growing daily, and sequence data released in April 2020 contain sufficient phylogenetic information to allow reliable inference of phylogenetic relationships, country-specific SARS-CoV-2 data sets still present severe limitations. CONCLUSIONS: At the present time, studies assessing within-country spread or transmission clusters should be considered preliminary or hypothesis-generating at best. Hence, current reports should be interpreted with caution, and concerted efforts should continue to increase the number and quality of sequences required for robust tracing of the epidemic.","output":"A Snapshot of SARS-CoV-2 Genome Availability up to April 2020 and its Implications: Data Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There have been more than 2.2 million confirmed cases and over 120a?000 deaths from the human coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), in the United States alone. However, there is currently a lack of proven effective medications against COVID-19. Drug repurposing offers a promising route for the development of prevention and treatment strategies for COVID-19. This study reports an integrative, network-based deep-learning methodology to identify repurposable drugs for COVID-19 (termed CoV-KGE). Specifically, we built a comprehensive knowledge graph that includes 15 million edges across 39 types of relationships connecting drugs, diseases, proteins/genes, pathways, and expression from a large scientific corpus of 24 million PubMed publications. Using Amazon's AWS computing resources and a network-based, deep-learning framework, we identified 41 repurposable drugs (including dexamethasone, indomethacin, niclosamide, and toremifene) whose therapeutic associations with COVID-19 were validated by transcriptomic and proteomics data in SARS-CoV-2-infected human cells and data from ongoing clinical trials. Whereas this study by no means recommends specific drugs, it demonstrates a powerful deep-learning methodology to prioritize existing drugs for further investigation, which holds the potential to accelerate therapeutic development for COVID-19.","output":"Repurpose Open Data to Discover Therapeutics for COVID-19 Using Deep Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Vaccination is the most effective way to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and to protect people who have a higher risk of developing severe illness and death from COVID-19 such as cancer patients. We aimed in this study to determine the acceptance rate of COVID-19 vaccination of the Salah Azaiez Institute (SAI) of cancer of Tunisia patients and to identify its associated factors. METHODS: It was a cross sectional study about patients admitted to the SAI for treatment during the month of February 2021. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors associated with the COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among Tunisian cancer patients. RESULTS: A total of 200 patients were included in this study with a mean age of 54.412.7 years and a gender ratio of 0.5. Only 35.0% of surveyed patients reported their acceptance to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Multivariate analysis showed that believing in COVID-19 vaccine safety and efficacy (OR=3.1 [1.3-7.4]), enrollment in the COVID-19 vaccine platform (OR=8.3 [1.8-38.1]) and the willingness to receive influenza vaccine (OR=3.9 [1.6-9.3]) were independently associated with the COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among SAI cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rate found in this study was low. Communication strategies of the vaccination campaigns should provide clear, simple and detailed messages about the efficacy and the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccines. More engagement of health authorities to promote COVID-19 vaccination is necessary.","output":"COVID-19 Vaccination Acceptance and Its Associated Factors among Cancer Patients in Tunisia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronaviruses cause respiratory diseases in many animals, including humans. Spike protein is an important component of coronavirus structure and the formation of ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2)Cspike complex mediates virus entry to host cells. CCtype lectin family are widely distribute on the surface of human cells and have been shown to activate the immune system. In this article, we first illustrate why we can learn from SARS with phylogenetic analysis. Then, we use SARS spike protein structure, to inferring our molecular docking experiment, revealing the potential capacity of CCtype lectin to directly interact with spike protein obstructs the formation of spikeCACE2 complex. Considering the expression profile of CCtype lectin family changing significantly during infection, we predict certain members of this kind of protein as potential therapeutic target and verify their assumed function by inferring an CCtype lectinCdependent CD4/CD28 T cell survival molecular network with endogenous molecular network theory (EMT) and comparing the predicted expression trend corresponding to each molecular with experiment data. Methods Alignments are inferred by MAFFT V7 ( GCinsCi, Blosom). Maximum likelihood analyses and bootstrap test carried out by RAXML V8.2 ML+BP online platform. Protein structure is predicted by SWISSMODELLING online platform. Molecular docking experiment is carried out by ZCdock Version 3.0.2. CCtype lectinCdependent CD4/CD28 T cell Network is inferred by EMT theory. Result Our molecular docking experiment revealing the potential capacity of CCtype lectin to directly interact with spike protein obstructs the formation of spikeCACE2 complex. Based on the expression profile of CCtype lectin family during infection, we predicting certain member of this kind of protein as potential therapeutic target such as Clec7a, Clec12a and Clec11a, corresponding immune cell types such as CD4/CD28 T cell simulated by EMT theory and verified by experiment data, antigen adjuvant with similar CCtype lectin receptorCTDM and some immuneCboosting drugsCradix sophorae, lactoferrin and Astragalus membranaceus, for future testing. Conclusions CCtype lectin and their corresponding immune cells predicted in this work may be the potential therapeutic targets for the disease caused by COVIDC19. CClectin with the capacity of directly interact with spike protein inhibiting the formation of ACE2Cspike complex may be the way they execute antiCvirus function. The corresponding cell type such as CD4/CD28 T cell may participate and against virus while Clec7a, Clec12a and Clec11a presumed capacity for facilitating CD4/CD28 T cell survival during infection being verified by EMT combining with experiment data.

Otters are widely spread through Portugal, and scats have been extensively used in ecology studies; however, valid information on their microbiota is scarce. This work represents a first approach to characterise the otter faecal microflora in samples collected in river stretches of the Sado river basin (Portugal) during winter 2006. Eight sampling stretches of 8 km were selected, and from each, six to eight sampling sites were visited. A total of 31 scats were analysed. The microflora studied included aerobic bacteria, spore-forming anaerobic bacteria and viruses (coronavirus, parvovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus). Bacterial isolates were identified based on morphology and metabolic pathways, and virus detection was performed by polymerase chain reaction. The results revealed the high degree of bacterial diversity in the faecal microflora of L. lutra. A total of 88 Gram-negative (23 genera) and 44 Gram-positive isolates (ten genera) were identified. The identification of four isolates was inconclusive, and their identification was performed by 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid sequencing, which confirms the need for biochemical testing optimisation regarding animal isolates. None of the scats was positive for virus detection. Identification of otter faecal microflora and of potential pathogens is an important first step towards understanding and monitoring their importance in otter population health.","output":"First assessment of microbial diversity in faecal microflora of Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra Linnaeus, 1758) in Portugal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Co-sponsored by the Disasters and Older Adults, Loneliness and Social Isolation, and Rural Aging Interest Groups, five presenters will highlight multiple circumstances regarding the intersection of social isolation or loneliness and the impact of COVID-19.
