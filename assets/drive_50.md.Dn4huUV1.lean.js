In addition, prevalence rates as high as 7% have been reported in blood donors, raising the risk of transfusion-related transmission. Several laboratories have utilized microneutralization assays as a surrogate marker for detection of anti-MLV serologic responses--with up to 25% of prostate cancer patients reported to harbor neutralizing antibody responses. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS We developed a high-throughput microneutralization assay for research studies on blood donors using retroviral vectors pseudotyped with XMRV-specific envelopes. Infection with these pseudotypes was neutralized by sera from both macaques and mice challenged with XMRV, but not preimmune serum. A total of 354 plasma samples from blood donors in the Reno/Tahoe area were screened for neutralization. RESULTS A total of 6.5% of donor samples gave moderate neutralization of XMRV, but not control pseudotypes. However, further testing by Western blot revealed no evidence of antibodies against MLVs in any of these samples. Furthermore, no evidence of infectious virus or viral nucleic acid was observed. CONCLUSION A microneutralization assay was developed for detection of XMRV and can be applied in a high-throughput format for large-scale studies. Although a proportion of blood donors demonstrated the ability to block XMRV envelope-mediated infection, we found no evidence that this inhibition was mediated by specific antibodies elicited by exposure to XMRV or MLV. It is likely that this moderate neutralization is mediated through another, nonspecific mechanism.","output":"Development and application of a high-throughput microneutralization assay: lack of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus and/or murine leukemia virus detection in blood donors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the leading causes of death globally. Although abdominal or peritoneal TB is a recognised site for extrapulmonary TB to manifest, the diagnosis is often delayed due to the non-specific nature of the presenting clinical features. We present the diagnostically challenging case of a 32-year-old patient with recurrent episodes of fever and a non-productive cough that was initially treated as community-acquired pneumonia with oral antibiotics. A computed tomography scan of the thorax was unrevealing, aside from a large volume of ascites within the partially imaged upper abdomen. The patient did not report any abdominal symptoms and the abdominal examination was unremarkable. Subsequently, a transvaginal ultrasound, a contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis, and magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen and pelvis confirmed a large volume of ascites in the absence of any definite aetiology. A peritoneal biopsy was required before the diagnosis of peritoneal TB was eventually confirmed. This case highlights the importance of considering peritoneal TB in patients presenting with treatment-resistant chest symptoms and persistent pyrexia of undetermined aetiology, even in the absence of abdominal signs and symptoms.","output":"Asymptomatic peritoneal tuberculosis in a patient with a non-remitting fever and isolated pulmonary symptoms: a case report and literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Delirium, a form of acute brain dysfunction, is very common in the critically ill adult patient population. Although its pathophysiology is poorly understood, multiple factors associated with delirium have been identified, many of which are coincident with critical illness. To date, no drug or non-drug treatments have been shown to improve outcomes in patients with delirium. Clinical trials have provided a limited understanding of the contributions of multiple triggers and processes of intensive care unit (ICU) acquired delirium, making identification of therapies difficult. Delirium is independently associated with poor long term outcomes, including persistent cognitive impairment. A longer duration of delirium is associated with worse long term cognition after adjustment for age, education, pre-existing cognitive function, severity of illness, and exposure to sedatives. Interestingly, differences in prevalence are seen between ICU survivor populations, with survivors of acute respiratory distress syndrome experiencing higher rates of cognitive impairment at early follow-up compared with mixed ICU survivor populations. Although cognitive performance improves over time for some ICU survivors, impairment is persistent in others.

To overcome the challenges coming up during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, health-care sector was majorly helped by telehealth, e-health, and technologies involved in consultation, diagnosis, and treatment of patients from a distance. However, it has own benefits and barriers, which are discussed in this review. This review has been conducted through searching five databases including PubMed, ResearchGate, Google Scholar, Cochrane, and ScienceDirect. Inclusion criteria included studies clearly defining any use of telehealth services during COVID-19 pandemic and its effects and barriers, written in English language, published from 2019 to till date, and including studies from different countries. Narrative synthesis was undertaken to summarize and report the findings. Ten studies met the inclusion criteria out of the 97 search results. The articles included in our studies showed a significant increase in the uptake of telehealth services during this COVID-19 pandemic. Countries like the U.S.A showed an 80% decline in-person visits among the Canadian population 41% of them wanted virtual visits compared to in-person visits. The patients have reported high satisfaction with telehealth services according to the related studies although have reported hindrances and potential barriers to it like limited access to Internet availability, devices, lack of awareness about technology, high cost for implementation, and legal framework related to policies that includes privacy and confidentiality. Based on the findings of this review study, telehealth has been found as an effective way of health delivery system in these difficult times, but there are certain factors and issues related to its use which need to be looked upon. This narrative review indicates that the use of telemedicine and telehealth services during this COVID-19 pandemic has a plan of much help, as when compared to the barriers, it may produce to reach a large population at their home without putting the lives of health-care workers and the patients themselves at risk.","output":"Effectiveness and barriers of telehealth services during COVID-19 pandemic: A narrative review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"TRPV4 (transient receptor potential vanilloid 4), a calcium permeable TRP ion channel, is known to play a key role in endocytosis.

We show here that, upon application of TRPV4-specific agonists, prominent vesicle priming from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was observed, followed by morphological changes of mitochondrial crista may lead to cell ferroptosis. We further identified interactions between TRPV4 and folding/vesicle trafficking proteins, which were triggered by calcium entry through activated TRPV4. This interplay, in turn, enhanced TRPV4-mediated activation of folding and vesicle trafficking proteins to promote exocytosis.

DESIGN: Qualitative interview study. METHOD: Ten NHS commissioners and managers participated in a semi-structured, co-produced interview. Each transcribed interview was double-coded and thematically analysed using The Framework Method. RESULTS: Interviews generated three main themes. (1) Capacity issues across psychological therapy services create barriers to face-to-face therapies, and Internet-based interventions offer a solution. (2) Despite reservations, there is growing acceptance of Internet-based therapies. Different ways of connecting with patients are required, and Internet-based treatments are accessible and empowering treatment options, with guided self-help (GSH) preferred. Internet-based interventions may however exclude some individuals and be a threat to the therapeutic relationship between patient and practitioner. (3) Successful roll-out of Internet-based interventions would be facilitated by a strong empirical- or practice-based evidence, a national coordinated approach and timely training and supervision. Barriers to the roll-out include digital intervention set-up costs and delays due to NHS inflexibility. CONCLUSIONS: The study highlights factors influencing access to Internet-based therapies, important given the rapid evolution of e-therapies, and particularly timely given increasing use of remote therapies due to COVID-19 restrictions. Interviewees were open to Internet-based approaches, particularly GSH interventions, so long as they do not compromise on therapy quality. Interviewees acknowledged implementation may be challenging, and recommendations were offered. PRACTITIONER POINTS: There is a shift in practice and increasingly positive views from NHS staff around remote psychological therapies and different ways of connecting with patients, particularly since the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a strong preference for Internet-based psychological interventions that are guided and that include built-in outcome measures co-produced with service users. There is a need to raise awareness of the growing evidence base for Internet-based psychological therapies, including research examining therapeutic alliance across Internet-based and face-to-face therapies. Challenges implementing Internet-based psychological therapies include therapist resistance to changing working practices in general, and inflexibility of the NHS, and national, coordinated implementation efforts are encouraged.","output":"Internet-based psychological therapies: A qualitative study of National Health Service commissioners and managers views"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The wide spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has declared a global health emergency. As one of the most important targets for antibody and drug developments, Spike RBD-ACE2 interface has received extensive attention. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations, we explicitly evaluated the binding energetic features of the RBD-ACE2 complex of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to find the key residues. Although the overall ACE2-binding mode of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD is nearly identical to that of the SARS-CoV RBD, the difference in binding affinity is as large as -16.35 kcal/mol. Energy decomposition analyses identified three binding patches in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and eleven key residues (Phe486, Tyr505, Asn501, Tyr489, Gln493, Leu455 and etc) which are believed to be the main targets for drug development. The dominating forces are from van der Waals attractions and dehydration of these residues. It is also worth mention that we found seven mutational sites (Lys417, Leu455, Ala475, Gly476, Glu484, Gln498 and Val503) on SARS-CoV-2 which unexpectedly weakened the RBD-ACE2 binding. Very interestingly, the most repulsive residue at the RBD-ACE2 interface (E484), is found to be mutated in the latest UK variant, B1.1.7, cause complete virus neutralization escapes from highly neutralizing COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Our present results indicate that at least from the energetic point of view such E484 mutation may have beneficial effects on ACE2 binding. The present study provides a systematical understanding, from the energetic point of view, of the binding features of SARS-CoV-2 RBD with ACE2 acceptor. We hope that the present findings of three binding patches, key attracting residues and unexpected mutational sites can provide insights to the design of SARS-CoV-2 drugs and identification of cross-active antibodies.","output":"Quantitative Interpretations of Energetic Features and Key Residues at SARS Coronavirus Spike Receptor-Binding Domain and ACE2 Receptor Interface"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a rare syndrome resulting from the accumulation of intra-alveolar red blood cells originating most often from the alveolar capillaries and, less frequently, from precapillary arterioles or postcapillary venules.

A total of 1327 microRNAs (miRNAs), including 368 novel miRNAs, were identified, among which, 171 (named DEmiRs) exhibited significantly differential expressions during viral infection in a time-dependent manner. For these DEmiRs, 805 differentially expressed target mRNAs (DETmRs) were predicted, whose expressions not only significantly changed after megalocytivirus infection but were also negatively correlated with their paired DEmiRs. Integrative analysis of immune-related DETmRs and their target DEmiRs identified 12 hub DEmiRs, which, together with their corresponding DETmRs, formed an interaction network containing 84 pairs of DEmiR and DETmR. In addition to DETmRs, 19 DEmiRs were also found to regulate six key immune genes (mRNAs) differentially expressed during megalocytivirus infection, and together they formed a network consisting of 21 interactive miRNA-messenger RNA (mRNA) pairs. Further analysis identified 9434 circular RNAs (circRNAs), 169 of which (named DEcircRs) showed time-specific and significantly altered expressions during megalocytivirus infection. Integrated analysis of the DETmR-DEmiR and DEcircR-DEmiR interactions led to the identification of a group of competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) constituted by interacting triplets of circRNA, miRNA, and mRNA involved in antiviral immunity.

This commentary aims to explore two issues related to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on family violence in China, with intimate partner violence as its most common form. These two issues are whether the COVID-19 pandemic has indeed had a negative impact on family violence and, if so, what its specific influences upon family violence in China have been. This commentary is largely descriptive and based upon previously published literature and public statistical reports from newspaper, government, and criminal justice sources on family violence during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Despite the lack of relevant and accurate nationwide statistics on family violence in China, multiple reports seem to suggest that family violence has surged during the COVID-19 pandemic. This increase in family violence may be primarily due to the large-scale lockdown that aggravates family conflicts, economic distress and tension caused by the pandemic among family members, and inadequate support for victims of family violence during the pandemic. Family violence has become an important social issue that needs to be dealt properly and swiftly during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Since there is no effective medication yet, to minimize and control the transmission of the COVID-19, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are followed globally. However, for the implementation of needful NPIs through effective management strategies and planning, space-time-based information on the nature, magnitude, pattern of transmission, hotspots, the potential risk factors, vulnerability, and risk level of the pandemic are important. Hence, this study was an attempt to in-depth assess and analyze the COVID-19 outbreak and transmission dynamics through space and time in Bangladesh using 154 day real-time epidemiological data series. District-level data were analyzed for the geospatial analysis and modelling using GIS. Getis-Ord Gi* statistics was applied for the hotspot analysis, and on the other hand, the analytical hierarchy process-based weighted sum method (AHP-WSM) was used for the modelling of vulnerability zoning of COVID-19. In Bangladesh, the status of the pandemic COVID-19 still is in exposure level. Disease transmitted at a high rate (20.37%), and doubling time of the cases were 11 days (latest week of the study period). The fatality rate was comparatively low (1.3%), and the recovery rate was about 57.50%. Geospatial analysis exhibits the disease propagates from the central parts, and Dhaka was the most exposed district followed by Chattogram, Narayanganj, Cumilla, and Bogra. A single strong clustering pattern in the central part, which spread out mainly to the south-eastern part, was identified as a prime hotspot in both the cases and deaths distributions. Additionally, potential linkages between the transmission of disease and the selected factors that gear up the spreading of the disease were identified. The central, eastern, and south-eastern parts were recognized as high vulnerable zone, and conversely, the western, south-western, north-western, and north-eastern parts as medium vulnerable zone. The vulnerable zoning exercise made it possible to identify vulnerable areas with the different magnitude that require urgent intervention through proper management and action plan, and accordingly, comprehensive management strategies were anticipated. Thus, this study will be a useful guide towards understanding the space-time-based investigations and vulnerable area delineation of the COVID-19 and assist to formulate an effective management action plan to reduce and control the disease propagation and impacts. By appropriate adjustment of some factors with local relevance, COVID-19 vulnerability zoning derived here can be applied to other regions, and generally can be used for any other infectious disease.

Initially, a 19-nucleotide tag was inserted into the start of gene 4a of MHV strain A59 with the N gene deletion mutant Alb4 as the recipient virus. In further work, the entire gene for the green fluorescent protein (GFP) was inserted in place of gene 4, creating the currently largest known RNA virus.

Northern blot analysis of transcripts of GFP recombinants showed the expected alteration of the pattern of the nested MHV subgenomic mRNAs. Surprisingly, though, GFP recombinants also produced an RNA species that was the same size as wild-type mRNA4. Analysis of the 5' end of this species revealed that it was actually a collection of mRNAs originating from 10 different genomic fusion sites, none possessing a canonical intergenic sequence.

In this investigation, we report that splenic B cells and a B cell hybridoma induced the fragmentation of MHV-infected target cell DNA into a nucleosomal ladder pattern, characteristic of apoptosis. To determine the mechanism by which B cells mediated this killing event, we used criteria previously established for the killing of target cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and compared this B-cell-mediated killing to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)-specific CTL killing of LCMV-infected target cells. Unlike CTL-mediated cytotoxicity, B cells efficiently lysed and induced the fragmentation of the DNA in their target cells in the presence of EGTA, arguing against a Ca(2+)-dependent granule exocytosis model for killing. In addition, paraformaldehyde-fixed B cells were able to kill MHV-infected targets. We were unable to detect TNF-alpha-associated cytotoxicity via bioassay with nonimmune effector B cells against the TNF-sensitive cell line, LM, or the TNF-alpha-resistant subline, L929.w, infected with MHV. Serine esterase inhibitors (benzamidine hydrochloride and N alpha-p-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester) blocked CTL-induced 51Cr release and DNA fragmentation. In contrast, the inhibitors did not block the B-cell-induced 51Cr release, but did cause an inhibition in the fragmentation of the DNA of the target cell. These data indicate that B cells are capable of inducing the lysis and DNA fragmentation of MHV-infected target cells similar to CTL-induced apoptosis.

STUDY DESIGN We identified 65 patients who underwent an MIE with thoracoscopy/laparotomy (n = 11), Ivor Lewis (n = 2), or 3-hole approach (n = 52). These patients were compared with 53 patients who underwent open Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy (n = 15) or 3-hole esophagectomy (n = 38) over the past 10 years. RESULTS The MIE and open groups were similar regarding gender and average age. The majority of patients in the open group underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (81%); a significantly smaller (43%) number of patients in the MIE group underwent neoadjuvant therapy (p < 0.0001). Regarding oncologic efficacy, 97% and 94% of patients in both groups underwent R0 resections. Patients undergoing MIE had a significant increase in the number of harvested lymph nodes (median 20 vs 9; p < 0.0001). Length of stay was significantly decreased in patients who underwent MIE (8.5 days vs 16 days; p = 0.002).

Beyond investigating the privacy features, design, and implications of these apps, this research examined the underlying technologies used in contact tracing apps. It also attempted to provide some insights into their level of penetration and to gauge their public reception. This research also investigated the data collection, reporting, retention, and destruction procedures used by each of the apps under review. METHODS: This research study evaluated 13 apps corresponding to 10 countries based on the underlying technology used. The inclusion criteria ensured that most COVID-19-declared epicenters (ie, countries) were included in the sample, such as Italy. The evaluated apps also included countries that did relatively well in controlling the outbreak of COVID-19, such as Singapore. Informational and unofficial contact tracing apps were excluded from this study. A total of 30,000 reviews corresponding to the 13 apps were scraped from app store webpages and analyzed. RESULTS: This study identified seven distinct technologies used by COVID-19 tracing apps and 13 distinct apps. The United States was reported to have released the most contact tracing apps, followed by Italy. Bluetooth was the most frequently used underlying technology, employed by seven apps, whereas three apps used GPS. The Norwegian, Singaporean, Georgian, and New Zealand apps were among those that collected the most personal information from users, whereas some apps, such as the Swiss app and the Italian (Immuni) app, did not collect any user information. The observed minimum amount of time implemented for most of the apps with regard to data destruction was 14 days, while the Georgian app retained records for 3 years. No significant battery drainage issue was reported for most of the apps. Interestingly, only about 2% of the reviewers expressed concerns about their privacy across all apps. The number and frequency of technical issues reported on the Apple App Store were significantly more than those reported on Google Play; the highest was with the New Zealand app, with 27% of the reviewers reporting technical difficulties (ie, 10% out of 27% scraped reviews reported that the app did not work). The Norwegian, Swiss, and US (PathCheck) apps had the least reported technical issues, sitting at just below 10%. In terms of usability, many apps, such as those from Singapore, Australia, and Switzerland, did not provide the users with an option to sign out from their apps. CONCLUSIONS: This article highlighted the fact that COVID-19 contact tracing apps are still facing many obstacles toward their widespread and public acceptance. The main challenges are related to the technical, usability, and privacy issues or to the requirements reported by some users.","output":"Technology, Privacy, and User Opinions of COVID-19 Mobile Apps for Contact Tracing: Systematic Search and Content Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose>This study aims to examine live streaming experiences of business students at the tertiary education level, and how the use of this interactive platform satisfies their affective, cognitive, social and hedonic needs in learning.

This paper examines the perceptions of old age in the context of establishing a priority order for the COVID-19 vaccine from the perspective of online newspaper commenters. Two research questions are investigated: (1) how do commenters place older people in line for the COVID-19 vaccine? and (2) what frames and factors do commenters use as reasoning for their proposed position of older adults? RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: : This study involves a frame analysis of 440 online comments on an article published by The New York Times on December 1, 2020 about the U.S. recommendations for distributing the coronavirus vaccine. RESULTS: Older adults were referenced as belonging to one of three groups: older long-term care residents, older workers, and older adults retired and/or isolating at home. Two frames emerged from the data as criteria for prioritization: social contribution and vulnerability. Older commenters themselves frequently stated that they should be deprioritized so that others can be inoculated earlier. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The findings may be interpreted as demonstrative of pervasive ageism throughout the pandemic; older commenters sacrificial remarks may reflect generativity, internalized ageism, social pressure from online forums, or some combination thereof.","output":"We Should Be at the Back of the Line: A Frame Analysis of Old Age within the Distribution Order of the COVID Vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The disease burden of de novo mutations (DNMs) has been evidenced only recently when the common application of next-generation sequencing technologies enabled their reliable and affordable detection through family-based clinical exome or genome sequencing.

Apparent DNMs have been considered to primarily occur as germline or zygotic events, with consequently negligible recurrence risks. However, there is now evidence that a considerable proportion of them are in fact inherited from a parent mosaic for the variant. Here, we review the burden of DNMs in prenatal diagnostics and the influence of parental mosaicism on the interpretation of apparent DNMs and discuss the challenges with detecting and quantifying parental mosaicism and its effect on recurrence risk.

Relative to WT Mtb cell wall lipids, the non-polar lipid extracts from mce1 enhanced the mRNA expression of lipid-sense nuclear receptors TR4 and PPAR- and dampened the macrophage expression of genes encoding TNF-, IL-6, and IL-1. Relative to untreated control, WT lipid-pre-stimulated macrophages from healthy individuals induced a higher level of CD4-CD8- double negative T-cells (DN T-cells) producing TNF-. Conversely, compared to WT, stimulation with mce1 lipids induced higher mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) in IL-10-producing DN T cells. Mononuclear cells from TB patients stimulated with WT Mtb lipids induced an increased production of TNF- by CD8+ lymphocytes. Taken together, these observations suggest that changes in mce1 operon expression during a course of infection may serve as a strategy by Mtb to evade the host pro-inflammatory responses.","output":"Differential Host Pro-Inflammatory Response to Mycobacterial Cell Wall Lipids Regulated by the Mce1 Operon."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Hydroxychloroquine and protease inhibitors were widely used as off\\\\label treatment options for COVID\\\\19 but the safety data of these drugs among the COVID\\\\19 population are largely lacking. Drug\\\\induced QTc prolongation is a known adverse reaction of hydroxychloroquine, especially during chronic treatment. However, when administered concurrently with potential pro\\\\arrhythmic drugs such as protease inhibitors, the risk of QTc prolongation imposed on these patients is not known. We aim to investigate the incidence of QTc prolongation events and potential factors associated with its occurrence in COVID\\\\19 population. METHODS: We included 446 SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 RT\\\\PCR\\\\positive patients taking at least one treatment drug for COVID\\\\19 within a period of one month (MarchCApril 2020). In addition to COVID\\\\19\\\\related treatment (HCQ/PI), concomitant drugs with risks of QTc prolongation were considered. We defined QTc prolongation as QTc interval of 470 ms in postpubertal males, and 480 ms in postpubertal females. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: QTc prolongation events occurred in 28/446 (6.3%) patients with an incidence rate of 1 case per 100 person\\\\days. A total of 26/28 (93%) patients who had prolonged QTc intervals received at least two pro\\\\QT drugs. Multivariate analysis showed that HCQ and PI combination therapy had five times higher odds of QTc prolongation as compared to HCQ\\\\only therapy after controlling for age, cardiovascular disease, SIRS and the use of concurrent QTc\\\\prolonging agents besides HCQ and/or PI (OR 5.2; 95% CI, 1.11\\\\24.49; p = 0.036). Independent of drug therapy, presence of SIRS resulted in four times higher odds of QTc prolongation (OR 4.3; 95% CI, 1.66\\\\11.06; p = 0.003). In HCQ\\\\PI combination group, having concomitant pro\\\\QT drugs led to four times higher odds of QTc prolongation (OR 3.8; 95% CI, 1.53\\\\9.73; p = 0.004).

WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: In our cohort, hydroxychloroquine monotherapy had low potential to increase QTc intervals. However, when given concurrently with protease inhibitors which have possible or conditional risk, the odds of QTc prolongation increased fivefold. Interestingly, independent of drug therapy, the presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) resulted in four times higher odds of QTc prolongation, leading to the postulation that some QTc events seen in COVID\\\\19 patients may be due to the disease itself.

METHODS: In November 2020, we conducted the LOST in Lombardia survey, a telephone-based cross-sectional study on a sample of 4,400 individuals representative of the general population aged 65 years from Lombardy region, Northern Italy. Individuals with diagnosed tinnitus and/or hearing loss were asked whether their conditions had improved or deteriorated in 2020 compared to 2019. RESULTS: Overall, 8.1% of older adults reported a diagnosis of tinnitus and 10.5% of hearing loss. In 2020 compared to 2019, among individuals with tinnitus, those with increasing severity (5.0%) were similar to those decreasing it (5.3%). Among individuals with hearing loss, more people reported an increase (13.6%) than a decrease (3.2%) in their disease severity. No individual with a diagnosis in 2020 of tinnitus (n = 6) or hearing loss (n = 13) had COVID-19. The incidence of tinnitus was lower in 2020 (rate: 14.8 per 10,000 person-years) than in previous years (rate in 1990C2019: 36.0 per 10,000 person-years; p = 0.026). There was no change in the incidence of hearing loss (p = 0.134). CONCLUSIONS: In this large representative sample of older adults, on average neither COVID-19 confinement nor SARS-CoV-2 infection appeared to increase the severity or incidence of tinnitus. The increased severity of hearing difficulties may totally or partially be explained by physiologic deterioration of the condition, or by a misperception due to the use of face-masks.","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 Confinement on Tinnitus and Hearing Loss in Older Adults: Data From the LOST in Lombardia Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic due to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus have directly impacted the public health and economy.

At the end of each EI, measurements of forearm blood flow (FBF; ml/min) via brachial artery Doppler and echo ultrasound, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP; mmHg) via finger photoplethysmography, and exercising forearm venous effluent via antecubital vein catheter revealed distinct cardiovascular response groups: n = 6 with compensatory vasodilation vs. n = 4 without compensatory vasodilation. Compensatory vasodilators were able to blunt the perfusion pressure-evoked reduction in submaximal O2D in the arm-above-heart condition, whereas nonvasodilators did not (-22.5  13.6 vs. -65.4  14.1 ml O2/min; P < 0.05), and in combination with being able to increase O2 extraction, nonvasodilators defended submaximal V?o2 and experienced less of an accumulated submaximal O2D deficit (-80.7  24.7 vs. -219.1  36.0 ml O2/min; P < 0.05).

However, research findings about the role of the tumor microenvironment in the progression and immunosuppression of cancer, particularly in lymphomas, have increased considerably in recent years, allowing for a better understanding of the disease. Consequently, epigenetic mechanisms that are implicated in the interplay between tumor cells and the different components around them, promoting the survival and progression of the tumor, have been described. This review tries to summarize the complex interplay between lymphoma tumor cells and immune cells as well as the epigenetic alterations that result from this cross-talk, aiming at contributing towards underlining the value of epigenetic modifications as new biomarkers and the use of epigenetic drugs as an interesting therapeutic option. ABSTRACT: Lymphoma is a neoplasm arising from B or T lymphocytes or natural killer cells characterized by clonal lymphoproliferation. This tumor comprises a diverse and heterogeneous group of malignancies with distinct clinical, histopathological, and molecular characteristics. Despite advances in lymphoma treatment, clinical outcomes of patients with relapsed or refractory disease remain poor. Thus, a deeper understanding of molecular pathogenesis and tumor progression of lymphoma is required. Epigenetic alterations contribute to cancer initiation, progression, and drug resistance. In fact, over the past decade, dysregulation of epigenetic mechanisms has been identified in lymphomas, and the knowledge of the epigenetic aberrations has led to the emergence of the promising epigenetic therapy field in lymphoma tumors. However, epigenetic aberrations in lymphoma not only have been found in tumor cells, but also in cells from the tumor microenvironment, such as immune cells. Whereas the epigenetic dysregulation in lymphoma cells is being intensively investigated, there are limited studies regarding the epigenetic mechanisms that affect the functions of immune cells from the tumor microenvironment in lymphoma. Therefore, this review tries to provide a general overview of epigenetic alterations that affect both lymphoma cells and infiltrating immune cells within the tumor, as well as the epigenetic cross-talk between them.","output":"Tumor Immune Microenvironment in Lymphoma: Focus on Epigenetics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: With strict public health measures implemented in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many breastfeeding parents, who are within an at-risk population, have experienced limited formal and/or informal breastfeeding social support. In the Canadian context, the experiences of these women is unknown. RESEARCH AIM: To explore the experiences of at-risk postpartum breastfeeding women in accessing formal and informal breastfeeding social support during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This was a prospective, longitudinal interpretive description study using mixed methods. Data were gathered using an online survey and one 52-112-min semi-structured interview at 12-weeks postpartum. At-risk breastfeeding participants were those who lack social support and had at least one of the following: age < 25 years; experiencing or had experienced intimate partner violence; or of low income. We sought participants' experiences of accessing breastfeeding social support during the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic/lockdown. Seven participants completed the survey and the interview. RESULTS: Participants identified that the COVID-19 pandemic created barriers to accessing formal and informal breastfeeding social support, which stemmed from public health restrictions and difficulties communicating online with families and healthcare providers. Additionally, participants identified that the COVID-19 pandemic/lockdowns facilitated feelings of connectedness, protection, and resiliency. CONCLUSION: We provide preliminary insight into the experiences of trying to access breastfeeding social support during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Twenty-one outcome benchmarks were established in low-risk patients, defined as the 75th percentile of the median outcome values of centers. Benchmark cases had no previous laparotomy, diabetes, sleep apnea, cardiopathy, renal insufficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, immunosuppression, thromboembolic events, BMI> 50 kg/m2 or age> 65 years. RESULTS The benchmark cohort included 3143 cases, mainly females (85%), aged 43.8  10 years, 8.4  5.3 years after primary BS, with a BMI 35.2  7 kg/m2. Main indications were insufficient weight loss (43%) and gastro-esophageal reflux disease/dysphagia (25%). 90-days postoperatively, 14.6% of benchmark patients presented 1 complication, mortality was 0.06% (n = 2). Significantly higher morbidity was observed in non-benchmark cases (OR 1.37) and after conversional/reversal or revisional procedures with gastrointestinal suture/stapling (OR 1.84). Benchmark cutoffs for conversional BS were 4.5% re-intervention, 8.3% re-operation 90-days postoperatively. At 2-years (IQR 1-3) 15.6% of benchmark patients required a reoperation. CONCLUSION Secondary BS is safe, although postoperative morbidity exceeds the established benchmarks for primary BS. The excess morbidity is due to an increased risk of gastrointestinal leakage and higher need for intensive care. The considerable rate of tertiary BS warrants expertise and future research to optimize the management of non-success after BS.","output":"Defining Global Benchmarks in Elective Secondary Bariatric Surgery Comprising Conversional, Revisional and Reversal Procedures."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 25(th) anniversary of the Antibody Engineering & Therapeutics Conference, the Annual Meeting of The Antibody Society, will be held in Huntington Beach, CA, December 7C11, 2014.

Design/methodology/approach A qualitative semi-structured interview design was adopted for this research. Seven participants were recruited from a harm reduction recovery organisation. During their initial interview, participants volunteered information regarding their experience of the first lockdown due to emerging concerns of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants completed a second semi-structured interview at the end of the first lockdown regarding their experience of enforced isolation during this time. Findings Three themes identified from the analysis were isolation resulting in hindered human capabilities;adjusting to a new normal: an individual experience;and unexpected benefits to recovery resulting from isolation. While some participants reported boredom, loneliness and relapse events, others reported that the national response to the virus did not adversely affect them as they had already adjusted to living in a state of anxiety, isolation and uncertainty. These findings illuminate negative, neutral and positive aspects of substance use recovery throughout the COVID-19 lockdown as well as highlighting the complex and individualised role that social connectedness plays in relapse occurrence. Originality/value Participants reported differences in how they were affected by the pandemic, leading to theoretical implications for the effect of social isolation on recovery. For this reason, individuals with a history of dependency should be considered potentially vulnerable to the effects of enforced isolation and should be supported accordingly.","output":"Investigating the experiences of individuals in recovery from problem substance use and their perceptions of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We provide an assessment of how migration patterns and motivations for moving have changed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Total negative pressure isolation using portable bioisolation tents may provide a solution. The study assesses the ability of health care workers to perform emergency procedures in this environment. METHODS: Physician performance in completing predetermined critical actions in 5 emergency care scenarios inside and outside of a bioisolation tent (setting) was studied in an advanced medical simulation laboratory. By design, no pretraining of subjects about total negative pressure isolation use occurred. Impact of setting on time to completion of predetermined critical actions was the primary outcome measured. Secondary variables studied included impact of study groups, scenarios, and run order (inside or outside of the tent first). Subjective assessments were obtained through questionnaires. RESULTS: Four teams of 3 physicians completed 5 emergency patient care scenarios during 2 4-hour sessions. Mean time to completion of critical actions was for tent/no tent 298 seconds/284 seconds (P=.69, one way ANOVA), respectively.

Unfortunately, no vaccine or antiviral drug that completely eliminates the transmissible disease coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been developed to date. Given that coronavirus nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) is a good target for attenuated vaccines, it is of great significance to explore the detailed characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 nsp1. Here, we first confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 had a conserved function similar to that of SARS-CoV nsp1 in inhibiting host-protein synthesis and showed greater inhibition efficiency, as revealed by ribopuromycylation and Renilla luciferase (Rluc) reporter assays. Specifically, bioinformatics and biochemical experiments showed that by interacting with 40S ribosomal subunit, the lysine located at amino acid 164 (K164) was the key residue that enabled SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 to suppress host gene expression. Furthermore, as an inhibitor of host-protein expression, SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 contributed to cell-cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase, which might provide a favourable environment for virus production. Taken together, this research uncovered the detailed mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 K164 inhibited host gene expression, laying the foundation for the development of attenuated vaccines based on nsp1 modification.","output":"Lysine 164 is critical for SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 inhibition of host gene expression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has created a situation in which people have to choose between economic and health values. This raises the question of what psychological mechanisms determine peoples willingness to bear economic costs to protect health? To answer this question, we examined whether such willingness is better described by compensatory or lexicographic models of decision making in situations involving risk or uncertainty. We compared decisions regarding COVID-19 and occupational diseases to establish a pandemic-independent baseline and to determine whether the mechanisms behind the trade-offs are the same in both cases. Additionally, we tested whether peoples willingness to accept economic costs is related to psychological factors such as fear, feeling of control, declared knowledge about the COVID-19 pandemic, predictions concerning the expected length of the pandemic, and perceived effectiveness of actions taken to fight the coronavirus. In total, 354 Polish participants from Prolific Academic took part in this study. The results were consistent with the view that decisions are made primarily to protect sacred values and are therefore not based on compensatory models. In line with this view, participants were sensitive neither to the risk vs. uncertainty manipulation nor to the perceived effectiveness of the lockdown. Instead, their behavior was congruent with lexicographic models in which the protection of health and in particular the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic appeared to be the most important dimension, and the single criterion to be used in decision making.","output":"Willingness to Bear Economic Costs in the Fight Against the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many complex diseases are expressed with high incidence only in certain populations. Genealogy studies determine that these diseases are inherited with a high probability. However, genetic studies have been unable to identify the genomic signatures responsible for such heritability, as identifying the genetic variants that make a population prone to a given disease is not enough to explain its high occurrence within the population. This gap is known as the missing heritability problem. We know that the microbiota plays a very important role in determining many important phenotypic characteristics of its host, in particular the complex diseases for which the missing heritability occurs. Therefore, when computing the heritability of a phenotype, it is important to consider not only the genetic variation in the host but also in its microbiota. Here we test this hypothesis by studying an evolutionary model based on gene regulatory networks. Our results show that the holobiont (the host plus its microbiota) is capable of generating a much larger variability than the host alone, greatly reducing the missing heritability of the phenotype. This result strongly suggests that a considerably large part of the missing heritability can be attributed to the microbiome.","output":"Phenotype Heritability in Holobionts: An Evolutionary Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the unprecedented level and duration of mitigation policies during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, it is not surprising that the public and the media have raised important questions about the potential for negative mental health consequences of the measures.

Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease, and, in addition to classical risk factors, maladaptive immune mechanisms lead to an increased risk of stroke. Accordingly, individuals with signs of inflammation or corresponding biomarkers have an increased risk of stroke. Anti-inflammatory drugs, such as IL (interleukin)-1? blockers, methotrexate, or colchicine, represent attractive treatment strategies to prevent vascular events and stroke. Lately, the COVID-19 pandemic shows a clear association between SARS-CoV2 infections and increased risk of cerebrovascular events. Furthermore, mechanisms of both innate and adaptive immune systems influence cerebral damage cascades after ischemic stroke. Neutrophils, monocytes, and microglia, as well as T and B lymphocytes each play complex interdependent roles that synergize to remove dead tissue but also can cause bystander injury to intact brain cells and generate maladaptive chronic inflammation. Chronic systemic inflammation and comorbid infections may unfavorably influence both outcome after stroke and recurrence risk for further stroke. In addition, stroke triggers specific immune depression, which in turn can promote infections. Recent research is now increasingly addressing the question of the extent to which immune mechanisms may influence long-term outcome after stroke and, in particular, cause specific complications such as poststroke dementia or even poststroke depression.","output":"Immune Pathways in Etiology, Acute Phase, and Chronic Sequelae of Ischemic Stroke"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Virus entry involves multiple steps and is a highly orchestrated process on which successful infection collectively depends. Entry processes are commonly analyzed by monitoring internalized virus particles via Western blotting, polymerase chain reaction, and imaging techniques that allow scientist to track the intracellular location of the pathogen. Such studies have provided abundant direct evidence on how viruses interact with receptor molecules on the cell surface, induce cell signaling at the point of initial contact with the cell to facilitate internalization, and exploit existing endocytic mechanisms of the cell for their ultimate infectious agenda. However, there is dearth of knowledge in regards to trafficking of a virus via endosomes. Herein, we describe an optimized laboratory procedure to isolate individual organelles during different stages of endocytosis by performing subcellular fractionation. This methodology is established using Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infection of human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells as a model. With KSHV and other herpesviruses alike, envelope glycoproteins have been widely reported to physically engage target cell surface receptors, such as integrins, in interactions leading to entry and subsequent infection. RESULTS: Subcellular fractionation was used to isolate early and late endosomes (EEs and LEs) by performing a series of centrifugations steps. Specifically, a centrifugation step post-homogenization was utilized to obtain the post-nuclear supernatant containing intact intracellular organelles in suspension. Successive fractionation via sucrose density gradient centrifugation was performed to isolate specific organelles including EEs and LEs. Intracellular KSHV trafficking was directly traced in the isolated endosomal fractions. Additionally, the subcellular fractionation approach demonstrates a key role for integrins in the endosomal trafficking of KSHV. The results obtained from fractionation studies corroborated those obtained by traditional imaging studies. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first of its kind to employ a sucrose flotation gradient assay to map intracellular KSHV trafficking in HFF cells. We are confident that such an approach will serve as a powerful tool to directly study intracellular trafficking of a virus, signaling events occurring on endosomal membranes, and dynamics of molecular events within endosomes that are crucial for uncoating and virus escape into the cytosol.","output":"Subcellular fractionation method to study endosomal trafficking of Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the recent emergence of highly transmissible variants of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the demand for N95 respirators is expected to remain high.

METHODS We performed 4133 RFA treatments in 2154 patients with primary and metastatic liver tumors from February 1999 to December 2007. Of these, we enrolled patients with hemorrhagic complications and reviewed their medical records thoroughly. The risk factors for each hemorrhagic complication were analyzed using unconditional logistic regression. RESULTS Hemorrhagic complications occurred in 63 out of 4133 treatments (1.5%), including hemoperitoneum in 29 (0.7%), hemothorax in 14 (0.3%), and hemobilia in 20 (0.5%). Eleven, 8, and 4 of these patients, respectively, were categorized as major complications requiring blood transfusion or drainage. Two patients died after hemoperitoneum. Logistic regression analysis revealed large tumor size [odds ratio (OR) 1.06 per 1 mm increase in diameter] and low platelet count (OR 0.88 per 10,000/microL increase) were significant risk factors for hemoperitoneum. The location of tumor nodules was a significant risk factor for hemothorax (segment 7, OR 2.31) and hemobilia (segment 1, OR 3.30). Other factors, including the number of needle insertions or the duration of ablation, were not significant.

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) involved excessive inflammatory response to IAV infection profoundly contributes to the virus pathogenesis. However, the precise mechanisms underlying such a response are poorly understood. Here we found from both in vivo and in vitro studies that IAV not only induced a surge of IL-6 release, but also greatly upregulated expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3), the potent suppressor of IL-6-associated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling. Interestingly, there existed a cytokine-independent mechanism of the robust induction of SOCS3 by IAV at early stages of the infection. Furthermore, we employed SOCS3-knockdown transgenic mice (TG), and surprisingly observed from virus challenge experiments using these mice that disruption of SOCS3 expression provided significant protection against IAV infection, as evidenced by attenuated acute lung injury, a higher survival rate of infected animals and lower viral load in infected tissues as compared with those of wild-type littermates under the same condition. The activity of nuclear factor-kappa B (NFB) and the expression of its target gene IL-6 were suppressed in SOCS3-knockdown A549 cells and the TG mice after infection with IAV. Moreover, we defined that enhanced STAT3 activity caused by SOCS3 silencing was important for the regulation of NFB and IL-6. These findings establish a critical role for IL-6-STAT3-SOCS3 axis in the pathogenesis of IAV and suggest that influenza virus may have evolved a strategy to circumvent IL-6/STAT3-mediated immune response through upregulating SOCS3.","output":"Influenza Virus-Induced Robust Expression of SOCS3 Contributes to Excessive Production of IL-6"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methods are increasingly replacing traditional methods in many domains involved with important decision making activities.

It is plausible that TikToks popularity among teenagers, adolescents, and young adults may influence decision-making about what constitutes appropriate ANSBP self-care among a younger age cohort. Methods We examined 157 of the most viewed videos available through the hashtag #backpain available on TikTok in September 2021. We examined the following research questions: (1) What are the metadata characteristics of the videos in the final data set?, (2) What are the creator identities reflected in the final data set in this study?, (3) What are the ANSBP self-care content themes in the final data set?, and (4) What are the characteristics of the data set based on a low back pain reference checklist based on consensus guidelines?. Results We identified clear differences based on TikTok creator identity in our data set of most popular videos. We examined videos created by chiropractors, fitness professionals, influencers, physicians, physiotherapists, and other creator identities. We found that the TikTok videos created by chiropractors were consistently among the most viewed, most commented, and most shared. Conversely, chiropractic TikTok videos consistently had the lowest self-care reference checklist scores relative to all other disciplines. That is, TikTok videos created by chiropractors were least likely to reflect the scientific consensus on treating ANSBP. Discussion TikTok is an increasingly popular medium for disseminating short health messages. The main cohort using TikTok is young and at risk of ANSBP. However, we postulate that the messages reaching young TikTok users overall do not generally reflect the self-care advice described in consensus guidelines. Conclusion TikTok is a popular social media channel among young people. However, the most viewed TikTok videos about ANSBP are not produced by mainstream health professionals and the videos featuring the #backpain hashtag do not generally reflect contemporary evidence-based practice.

The cataclysms that have occurred recently have affected the world economy. The world has ceased to be balanced. Business froze in fear of inevitable bankruptcy, unemployment and ruin. Political changes in Russia, which began in January 2020, the drop in oil prices, the collapse of the ruble, which followed the relative stability of the Russian national currency and reached the pandemic country, negatively affected business in the country. The development of urgent state measures to support small and medium-sized enterprises is the only way to maintain its viability. These measures should be based on a clear regulatory framework that does not allow vague interpretations and legal incidents. Using the comparative legal method, it is necessary to draw the experience of those countries in which there is a state policy in relation to small and medium-sized businesses, which is a system of socio-economic actions built on the principle of ensuring the favorable development of this sector of the economy and to develop measures that can preserve it in conditions of prevailing force majeure. The aim of this work is a comparative analysis of measures taken by the world community and Russia to support small and medium-sized businesses during the economic crisis caused by Covid19.

Workers able to do so have been required to work remotely. We draw on survey data collected in October 2020 from a nationally representative sample of 3,017 remote workers, as well as qualitative survey data collected from 231 remote workers, to examine perceived changes in work hours from before to during the pandemic. Results indicate women are at greater risk of change (either a major decrease or a major increase)rather than stabilityin work hours. Gender also intersects with caregiving, race/ethnicity, prior remote work experiences, and socioeconomic status to shape changes in hours. Women and men in the sandwich generation, as well as women (but not men) with pre-school children, are the most likely to report a decrease in work hours, whereas women with older children at home or caring for adults (but not both) are the most likely to have an increase in hours. Remote working Black women and women moving into remote work are more likely to experience a major increase in hours worked, even as Hispanic women and Black men are the most likely to report somewhat of a reduction in work hours. Gender also intersects with SES, such that women without a college degree are more likely to have a decrease in work hours, while women with an advanced degree and women managers report a considerable increase in work hours. Qualitative data further illuminate why work hours change or remain stable for remote workers during COVID-19.

It is more important to take care at public places as presence of people is in majority. As it is a difficult task to check out everyone and monitor them manually and the demand for disinfection and safety for health has increased in public areas which led us to bring this system into existence. The presented system guides to disinfect humans using the proposed solution after it detects the human face mask using camera which works on convolutional neural networks and contactless temperature detection using infrared temperature sensor. The tunnel allows a person only if the person wears a face mask and his/her body temperature should be normal. If the person is qualified for both, then the tunnel lets the person enter into the tunnel and it sprays the disinfectant solution from the head to toe on the body. The system consists of a display that guides the user to wear the mask properly. The project mainly focuses on reducing the manual presence in public places to check face masks, to measure the body temperature, and to sanitize the people. It ensures that the people and front-end workers can stay safe in these unprecedented times and ensures that everyone follows the guidelines which are provided by the government. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Corona virus disinfectant tunnel using face mask detection and temperature monitoring"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When I began writing this article, it was just the beginning of COVID-19, when we were not yet social distancing Everything has changed since then, but not a conviction I have disseminated for more than 25 years More than ever, I maintain that formally addressing the critical visual component of research should be part of every researcher's education How you visually represent your work not only communicates to others in your discipline Crafting your visual presentations helps clarify your own thinking and, just as important, is a means of engaging the public In these challenging times, when society is bombarded with complex information, it is more essential than ever to develop a more accessible and honest visual language for the public to understand and gather that information Formal programs in teaching visual communication will help show the world, outside the research community, how to look at science, understand it, question it, and, hopefully, make smart decisions","output":"Picturing science and engineering"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is a systemic disease affecting not only the lungs but also multiple organ systems. Clinical studies implicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes imbalance of cellular homeostasis and immune response that trigger cytokine storm, oxidative stress, thrombosis, and insulin resistance. Mathematical modeling can offer in-depth understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and illuminate how subcellular mechanisms and feedback loops underpin disease progression and multiorgan failure. We report here a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 infection pathway network with cytokine storm, oxidative stress, thrombosis, insulin resistance, and nitric oxide (NO) pathways. The biochemical systems theory model shows autocrine loops with positive feedback enabling excessive immune response, cytokines, transcription factors, and interferons, which can imbalance homeostasis of the system. The simulations suggest that changes in immune response led to uncontrolled release of cytokines and chemokines, including interleukin (IL)-1?, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor  (TNF), and affect insulin, coagulation, and NO signaling pathways. Increased production of NETs (neutrophil extracellular traps), thrombin, PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1), and other procoagulant factors led to thrombosis. By analyzing complex biochemical reactions, this model forecasts the key intermediates, potential biomarkers, and risk factors at different stages of COVID-19. These insights can be useful for drug discovery and development, as well as precision treatment of multiorgan implications of COVID-19 as seen in systems medicine.","output":"Mathematical Modeling of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection Network with Cytokine Storm, Oxidative Stress, Thrombosis, Insulin Resistance, and Nitric Oxide Pathways"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As described in the following report, numerous research programs reported during this year's International Conference on Antiviral Research (ICAR) in San Francisco resulted in novel agents with antiviral activity against a number of viral pathogens, including programs aimed at compounds active against specific pathogens as well as broad preclinical research that identified compounds with putative activity against many virus families.

A retrospective observational study on antigenic swabs included in the extraordinary health surveillance protocol of a large Hospital in Turin was aimed to assess their performance validity. METHODS: From 30 October 2020 to 4 May 2021, 4000 antigenic swabs were carried out in three groups of healthcare workers (HCWs), respectively (i) asymptomatic, (ii) cohabiting with a positive case, and (iii) not recently exposed to the virus. RESULTS: Overall sensitivity and specificity associated with a prevalence of 1.30% were 26.9%, 97.2%, respectively, the corresponding positive (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) being 11.29% and 99.02% [95% IC (99.00 - 99.04)] respectively; a prevalence of 0.29% was observed in the asymptomatic group, among whom sensitivity and specificity were 25.0% and 98.9%, respectively, the corresponding PPV and NPV being 6.25% and 99.78% [95% IC (99.76 - 99.81)], respectively; the cohabitant group showed a prevalence of 21.11%, sensitivity and specificity were 47.4%, 81.7%, respectively, giving rise to a PPV of 40.91% and NPV of 85.29% [95% IC (85.18 C 85.41)] respectively. The prevalence in the not exposed group was 0.77%, sensitivity and specificity were 29.2%, 97.4%, respectively, and PPV and NPV 8.05% and 99.44% [95% IC (99.42 - 99.46)] respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Antigenic swabs reduced costs and provided reliable diagnostic results. In the cohabitant group, the higher-prevalence groups showed poor test performances, likely because of the high prevalence of pre-symptomatic illness in this group. Owing to the relatively low NPV, a negative result would still require confirmation with a molecular test to be acceptable for a surveillance program that effectively reduces the viruss intra-hospital spread.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection: use and effectiveness of antigenic swab for the health surveillance of healthcare workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, a novel solution to avoid new infections is presented. Instead of tracing users locations, the presence of individuals is detected by analysing the voices, and peoples faces are detected by the camera.

Firebase Platform will be used to detect faces captured by the camera and determine its size and estimate their distance to the phone terminal. The second application uses voice biometrics to differentiate the users voice from unknown speakers and creates a neural network model based on 5 samples of the users voice. This feature will only be activated whenever the user is surfing the Internet or using other applications to prevent undesired contacts. Currently, the patients tracking is performed by geolocation or by using Bluetooth connection. Although face detection and voice recognition are existing methods, this paper aims to use them and integrate both in a single device.

Very little data exist on the attitudes and views of health professionals on providing nutrition care to this patient cohort delivered by electronic health methods. COVID-19 has fast-tracked the adoption of digital health care provision, so it is more important than ever to understand the needs of health professionals in providing health care via these modes. This study aimed to explore the perspectives of health professionals on providing nutrition care to upper gastrointestinal cancer patients by electronic methods to allow the future scaling-up of acceptable delivery methods. Methods: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted face-to-face or by telephone and recorded, de-identified and transcribed. Thematic analysis was facilitated by NVivo Pro 12. Results: Interviews were conducted on 13 health professionals from a range of disciplines across several public and private health institutions. Thematic analysis revealed three main themes: (1) the ideal model, (2) barriers to the ideal model and (3) how to implement and translate the ideal model. Health professionals viewed the provision of nutrition interventions as an essential part of an upper gastrointestinal cancer patients treatment with synchronous, telephone-based internal health service models of nutrition care overwhelmingly seen as the most acceptable model of delivery. Mobile application-based delivery methods were deemed too challenging for the current population serviced by these clinicians. Conclusion: The use of novel technology for delivering nutrition care to people receiving treatment for upper gastrointestinal cancers was not widely accepted as the preferred method of delivery by health professionals. There is an opportunity, given the rapid uptake of digital health care delivery, to ensure that the views and attitudes of health professionals are understood and applied to develop acceptable, efficacious and sustainable technologies in our health care systems.","output":"Exploring the Attitudes of Health Professionals Providing Care to Patients Undergoing Treatment for Upper Gastrointestinal Cancers to Different Models of Nutrition Care Delivery: A Qualitative Investigation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public health experts emphasize the need for quick, point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 detection as an effective strategy for controlling virus spread. To this end, many \\"antigen\\" detection devices were developed and commercialized. These devices are mostly based on detecting SARS-CoV-2's nucleocapsid protein. Recently, alerts issued by both the FDA and the CDC raised concerns regarding the devices' tendency to exhibit false positive results. In this work, we developed a novel alternative spike-based antigen assay, comprising four high-affinity, specific monoclonal antibodies, directed against different epitopes on the spike's S1 subunit. The assay's performance was evaluated for COVID-19 detection from nasopharyngeal swabs, compared to an in-house nucleocapsid-based assay, composed of novel antibodies directed against the nucleocapsid. Detection of COVID-19 was carried out in a cohort of 284 qRT-PCR positive and negative nasopharyngeal swab samples. The time resolved fluorescence (TRF) ELISA spike assay displayed very high specificity (99%) accompanied with a somewhat lower sensitivity (66% for Ct < 25), compared to the nucleocapsid ELISA assay which was more sensitive (85% for Ct < 25) while less specific (87% specificity). Despite being outperformed by qRT-PCR, we suggest that there is room for such tests in the clinical setting, as cheap and rapid pre-screening tools. Our results further suggest that when applying antigen detection, one must consider its intended application (sensitivity vs specificity), taking into consideration that the nucleocapsid might not be the optimal target. In this regard, we propose that a combination of both antigens might contribute to the validity of the results. Schematic representation of sample collection and analysis.

These patients also undergo more screening intensity for secondary hypertension. However, not all patients with apparent treatment-resistant hypertension have true resistant hypertension, with some of them being nonadherent to prescribed pharmacotherapy. The prevalence of nonadherence varies from about 5% to 80% in the published literature. However, the relative contributions of intentional and nonintentional nonadherence are not well described. Nonintentional nonadherence refers to occasional forgetfulness and/or carelessness and can sometimes be related to an inability to follow instructions, because of either cognitive or physical limitations. Intentional nonadherence refers to an active process in which a patient may choose to alter the prescribed medication regimen by discontinuing medications, skipping doses, or modifying doses or dosing intervals. Objective Our objective is to establish the overall prevalence of nonadherence in the apparent treatment-resistant hypertension population and evaluate the relative contributions of nonintentional and intentional nonadherence subtypes. Design We will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis. Setting We will include observational studies and randomized controlled trials where adherence to antihypertensive medications is measured using a test of adherence, either direct or indirect. Patients We will include adult human participants aged 18 years or older with a diagnosis of resistant hypertension. Measurements Data extracted from individual studies will include title, first author, design, country, publication year, funding body, method of assessing adherence to antihypertensive medication, prevalence of medication nonadherence, definition of resistant hypertension, sample size, sex, mean age, and coexistent comorbidities. Methods A librarian will search the databases Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane, CINAHL, and Web of Science for studies meeting criteria for inclusion. Two reviewers will independently screen the titles and abstracts retrieved and assess the methodological quality of eligible full-text articles using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for clinical trials and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies. Summary estimates of prevalence will be generated using pooled analysis using the random-effects method. Subgroup analyses, sensitivity analyses, and evaluation of publication bias will also be performed. Results The outcomes of interest are the pooled prevalence of nonadherence to antihypertensive medication in apparent treatment-resistant hypertension and the prevalence of nonadherence based on different methods of assessing nonadherence (indirect vs direct), which will allow us to estimate the relative proportion of unintentional and intentional nonadherence subtypes in the overall phenomenon of medication nonadherence. Limitations Possible limitations of this study include the finding of severe heterogeneity, the limitations of the literature search, publication bias, and the lack of granular data in the published studies for a study-level meta-analysis. Conclusions This systematic review will provide a synthesis of current evidence on the prevalence of medication nonadherence in apparent treatment-resistant hypertension and on the relative contributions of nonintentional and intentional nonadherence subtypes. These findings will provide clinicians with a better understanding of the factors underlying treatment-resistant hypertension and will serve as a strong research base to guide future research on interventions to address medication nonadherence as well as the nonintentional and intentional subtypes.

However, isolation may affect negatively the psychological well-being and impair sleep quality. Our aim was to evaluate the sleep quality of respiratory patients during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. METHODS: All patients who underwent a telemedicine appointment from March 30 to April 30 of 2020 were asked to participate in the survey. Sleep difficulties were measured using Jenkins Sleep Scale. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 365 patients (mean age 63.9 years, 55.6% male, 50.1% with sleep-disordered breathing [SDB]). During the lockdown, 78.9% of participants were confined at home without working. Most patients (69.6%) reported at least one sleep difficulty and frequent awakenings was the most prevalent problem. Reporting at least one sleep difficulty was associated with home confinement without working, female gender and diagnosed or suspected SDB, after adjustment for cohabitation status and use of anxiolytics. Home confinement without working was associated with difficulties falling asleep and waking up too early in the morning. Older age was a protective factor for difficulties falling asleep, waking up too early and non-restorative sleep. Notably, SDB patients with good compliance to positive airway pressure therapy were less likely to report sleep difficulties. CONCLUSIONS: Home confinement without working, female gender and SDB may predict a higher risk of reporting sleep difficulties. Medical support during major disasters should be strengthened and potentially delivered through telemedicine, as this comprehensive approach could reduce psychological distress and improve sleep quality.","output":"Sleep quality in times of Covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ill-considered postings by young social media users hungry for attention have recently garnered headlines.

Difficulty in accessing medical care in the event of increased symptom burden, obstacles in reaching hospitals at time of emergencies or end of life, limited access to medication, social distancing causing isolation, leading to psychosocial burden, lack of bereavement support, are few of the issues we identified. Palliative home care is an important tool to allay the anxieties and address the fears of cancer patients and caregivers, by ensuring continuity of care and providing the much needed handholding in these difficult times. This article aims to highlight the home-based care strategy and experience of the Cipla Palliative Care and Training Center during the COVID-19 lockdown. Materials and Methods: We have utilized the data of documentation of the process of designing the protocol, the data entered by the team on unique data management software that is used at the palliative care center to record all palliative care interventions and reflections of the team on their experience of home visits during this period. Results: Continuity of care through home visits will ensure better management of patients in terms of physical symptoms, psychosocial support, allaying fears, and anxieties, as well as the ultimate goal of an improved quality of life. Physical symptoms (24%), morphine drop off (19%), psychosocial support (15%), end of life care (33%), and procedures (9%) were the major indications of visits. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the need for support, thus reiterating the importance of continuity of care.

We compared the baseline characteristics and in-hospital mortality between patients with hypertension taking RAS inhibitors (n=355) versus non-RAS inhibitors (n=827). Of the 1182 patients with hypertension (median age 68 years, 49.1% male), 12/355 (3.4%) patients died in the RAS inhibitors group versus 95/827 (11.5%) patients in the non-RAS inhibitors group (P<0.0001). Adjusted hazard ratio for mortality was 0.28 (95% CI 0.15-0.52, P<0.0001) at 45 days in the RAS inhibitors group compared with non-RAS inhibitors group. Similar findings were observed when patients taking angiotensin receptor blockers (n=289) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (n=66) were separately compared with non-RAS inhibitors group. The RAS inhibitors group compared with non-RAS inhibitors group had lower levels of C-reactive protein (median 13.5 versus 24.4 pg/mL; P=0.007) and interleukin-6 (median 6.0 versus 8.5 pg/mL; P=0.026) on admission.

However, they can be erroneously reported as type IV or V EL with supine computed tomography (CT) scans, leading to delay in management. Therefore, we describe a novel diagnostic technique, 'Prone contrASt enHanced computed tomography Angiography' (PASHA), to document concealed EL. TECHNICAL SUMMARY: We present eight case-descriptions with continuous sac expansion following primary EVAR. Management began with diagnosis using the PASHA imaging technique. PASHA is a multi-phase CTA positional technique for increasing the accuracy of detecting EL post-EVAR. The PASHA technique diagnosed all cases of type IIIb EL, as it enhanced the degree of contrast infiltration into the aortic sac when micro-leaks were present. Furthermore, the PASHA imaging technique helped to guide whether the open or endovascular intervention could be employed effectively to manage the sac expansion. In synchrony with the PASHA technique, 'EVAR GORE SalvAge FAbric Technique' (ARAFAT) was used in five elderly patients to salvage previous EVAR. Another three had an open conversion; two with double breasting of the aortic sac and one EVAR explantation. DISCUSSION: The PASHA protocol helped classify and localise the concealed ELs (type IV, V), which were not appropriately diagnosed by supine CT protocols. PASHA and ARAFAT were employed as a fully functioning protocol to overcome apparent challenges in accurate diagnosis and subsequent concealed EL management in high-risk patients.","output":"Management of concealed type iv endoleak and aortic sac hygroma by Prone ContrASt EnHancement Computed Tomography Angiography (PASHA)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) can provide prompt, accurate identification of infectious organisms and be a key component of antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programs. However, their use is less widespread in Asia Pacific than western countries. Cost can be prohibitive, particularly in less resource-replete settings. A selective approach is required, possibly focusing on the initiation of antimicrobials, for differentiating bacterial versus viral infections and identifying locally relevant tropical diseases. Across Asia Pacific, more data are needed on RDT use within AMS, focusing on the impact on antimicrobial usage, patient morbidity and mortality, and cost effectiveness. Moreover, in the absence of formal guidelines, regional consensus statements to guide clinical practice are warranted. These will provide a regionally relevant definition for RDT; greater consensus on its role in managing infections; advice on implementation and overcoming barriers; and guidance on optimizing human resource capacity.

This crisis is also negatively impacting the care of patients with non-COVID-19 conditions, including those with cerebellar ataxia (CA). Older patients with CA and those with immune-mediated ataxias on immunosuppressive medication are potentially at high risk of developing serious complications of the infection, although it is also possible that immunosuppressive agents may provide a defense against cytokine storm. This has implications for even greater attention to preventing contracting the disease through physical distancing and/or isolation. The CA patient population is also at higher risk because of the neurological complexities of their underlying disorder and the comorbid medical illnesses that often accompany the genetic ataxias. As the disruption of social patterns and healthcare delivery in response to the crisis continues, interruption of rehabilitation, speech and language therapy, and face-to-face consultations threatens to have a negative impact on the course and well-being of CA patients. Mental and physical health is also potentially at greater risk because the prevailing uncertainty and anxiety may be superimposed upon cerebellum-specific neuropsychological challenges. We identify and review some of the short- and long-term consequences of this global pandemic for the community of ataxia patients and their families and for the clinical and academic neurologists/ataxiologists caring for these patients. This includes the recognition that telemedicine has emerged as a principle means of caregiver-patient contact and that neurological manifestations of COVID-19 including those specific to cerebellar neurobiology are increasingly recognized and will require close surveillance and monitoring.

Design, Setting, and Participants: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of health care workers from tertiary care and ministry of health Centers across the Central, Eastern, and Western regions of Saudi Arabia. There were 1,130 participants in the survey, and we collected demographic and mental health measurements from the participants. Primary Outcomes and Measures: The magnitude of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia was measured using the original version of 9-item patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7), and 7-item insomnia severity index (ISI). We use the multiple logistic regression analysis to identify the associated risk factors of individual outcomes. Results: The scores on the PHQ-9 showed that the largest proportion of health care workers (76.93%) experienced only normal to mild depression (50.83 and 26.1%, respectively). The scores on the GAD-7 showed that the largest proportion of health care workers (78.88%) experienced minimal to mild anxiety (50.41 and 28.47%, respectively). The scores on the ISI showed that the largest proportion of health care workers (85.83%) experienced absence to subthreshold insomnia (57.08 and 28.75%, respectively). The risk factors for depression in health care workers were Saudi, living with family, working from an isolated room at home and frontline worker. For anxiety, being female was risk factor and for insomnia, being frontline worker was risk factor. Conclusion: It was observed that the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia were reported in a lower proportion of health care workers in our study.

However, the prolonged induction of this immune response can lead to lung hyperinflammation, tissue damage, and respiratory failure. We hypothesized that tissues exposed to the constant threat of infection may constitutively express higher levels of antiviral effector proteins to reduce the need to activate potentially harmful innate immune defences. By analysing transcriptomic data derived from a range of human tissues, we identify lung tissue to express constitutively higher levels of antiviral effector genes relative to that of other mucosal and non-mucosal tissues. By using primary cell lines and the airways of rhesus macaques, we show the interferon-stimulated antiviral effector protein TRIM22 (TRIpartite Motif 22) to be constitutively expressed in the lung independently of viral infection or innate immune stimulation. These findings contrast with previous reports that have shown TRIM22 expression in laboratory-adapted cell lines to require interferon stimulation. We demonstrate that constitutive levels of TRIM22 are sufficient to inhibit the onset of human and avian influenza A virus (IAV) infection by restricting the onset of viral transcription independently of interferon-mediated innate immune defences. Thus, we identify TRIM22 to confer a pre-existing (intrinsic) intracellular defence against IAV infection in cells derived from the respiratory tract. Our data highlight the importance of tissue-specific and cell-type dependent patterns of pre-existing immune gene expression in the intracellular restriction of IAV from the outset of infection.","output":"Constitutive TRIM22 Expression in the Respiratory Tract Confers a Pre-Existing Defence Against Influenza A Virus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article is a personal reflection that examines the impact of the pandemic on the British Museums (BM) onsite interpretation and audiences;however, it is informed by robust visitor insight and evaluation as well as by direct experience.

The museum eventually reopened some of its galleries on 27 August 2020 with a carefully curated one-way route, primarily on the ground-floor initially.George Floyds death was another pivotal moment in 2020. In response, the BMs Director issued a statement in support of Black Lives Matter (BLM). This was welcomed by staff and volunteers, but it also attracted some critical comments on social media, including calls for the return of looted African objects within the BMs collection. The museum made some modest but significant changes ahead of reopening, introducing a Collecting and Empire trail along the one-way route and redisplaying a bust of the Museums founder Sir Hans Sloane to acknowledge his links to slavery and empire.The museums income-generating exhibition programme was much impacted by the pandemic, with planned shows Tantra: enlightenment to revolution and Arctic: culture and climate opening much later than intended, with significantly reduced visitor capacity and major adaptations. Another lockdown in December meant that the runs of both exhibitions were curtailed, with that for Arctic being drastically shortened. A significant shift to online events and resources, however, enabled these exhibitions to reach new, global audiences.The BM again re-opened on 17 May 2021, with the government subsequently lifting Covid restrictions in England on 19 July 2021.

In this study, antibacterial activity was evaluated for six dihydrochalcone compounds from Malus. Phloretin and 3-hydroxyphloretin exhibited antibacterial effects on both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and the antibacterial capacity of these compounds was greater than that of their glycosylated derivatives. Within a certain range, dihydrochalcone hydrophobicity was positively correlated with antibacterial activity. Additionally, glycosylation at the 2'-position of the A-ring and hydroxyl group at the 3-position of the B-ring played a key role in the antibacterial activity of dihydrochalcones. Phloretin and 3-hydroxyphloretin caused damage to bacterial cells by significantly increasing protein and inorganic phosphate leakage. Compared to phloretin, 3-hydroxyphloretin exhibited a smaller effect on Gram-positive Micrococcus luteus and a greater effect on Gram-negative Klebsiella pneumoniae, suggesting different antibacterial mechanisms. At a low dihydrochalcone concentration, the respiration of M. luteus did not change, while membrane permeability increased significantly. These results indicate that the antibacterial mechanism of M. luteus was primarily damage to the cell membrane. However, damage to respiration and the cell membrane might occur simultaneously in K. pneumoniae, suggesting that the antibacterial mechanism of dihydrochalcones also depends on strain type. This study demonstrated the broad-spectrum antibacterial properties of dihydrochalcone compounds commonly found in the genus Malus to foodborne pathogens and elucidated the antibacterial mechanisms.

OBJECTIVES: To explore mental health service user attitudes to psychedelics and psilocybin therapy. METHODS: A questionnaire capturing demographics, diagnoses, previous psychedelic and other drug use, and attitudes to psychedelics and psilocybin therapy was distributed to mental health service users. RESULTS: Ninety-nine participants completed the survey (52% female, mean age 42 years). The majority (72%) supported further research, with 59% supporting psilocybin as a medical treatment. A total of 27% previously used recreational psilocybin, with a male preponderance (p = 0.01). Younger age groups, those with previous psychedelic experience, and those with non-religious beliefs were more likely to have favourable attitudes towards psilocybin. A total of 55% of the total sample would accept as a treatment if doctor recommended, whereas 20% would not. Fewer people with depression/anxiety had used recreational psychedelics (p = 0.03) but were more likely to support government funded studies (p = 0.02). A minority (5%) of people with conditions (psychosis and bipolar disorder) that could be exacerbated by psilocybin thought it would be useful for them.

Methods: A multicenter, controlled, quasi-experimental, before-and-after study was conducted on individuals at moderate to very high risk of SARS-COV-2 exposure. In the intervention group (n=15992), participants received GG 1 g daily for 28 days in conjunction with standard preventive guidelines (SPG), while in the control group (n=4953), participants were asked to follow SPG only. Outcomes were the incidence of COVID-19, perceived immune status, quality of life, and safety. The perceived immune status was assessed using a brief Likert-scale questionnaire having common immune-related complaints. Results: Of the 20945 enrolled, 20574 completed the trial (intervention: 15729, control: 4845). The percentage of participants who reported the incidence of COVID-19 was marginally lower in the GG+SPG group (41, 0.26%) than in the SPG group (16, 0.33%), leading to 21% (95% CI, -40% to 55%) efficacy of GG.

OBJECTIVE: To compare levels of physical activity (PA), sedentary behaviour (SB), and sleep time in children prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic (after the lockdown) and to determine the association between changes in moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA), total PA (TPA), SB, and sleep time between mothers and fathers with their children. METHODS: A total of 110 children (aged 4-7 years) and their parents (63 mothers and 52 fathers) wore GENEActiv accelerometers for 6 days (4 weekdays and 2 weekend days) prior to the pandemic and 1 year into the pandemic to assess SB, MVPA, TPA, and sleep time. RESULTS: Children performed more MVPA on weekdays (p = 0.002), had higher SB (p = 0.001), and slept fewer hours during the pandemic than before (p < 0.001). Likewise, children performed more weekend day MVPA and TPA (p < 0.001) during the pandemic, and slept less than prior to the pandemic (p = 0.002). On weekdays, an increase in mother's MVPA and TPA (categorized as tertiles) was associated with higher increased on MVPA (p = 0.030) and TPA in their children (p = 0.023), respectively. On weekends, an increase in mother's MVPA was also associated with higher increases in MVPA (p = 0.011) in their children. CONCLUSION: During the pandemic, children got more MVPA, more SB, and slept fewer hours than before.

We hypothesize that, in select patients, some complications of COVID-19 may be due to right-to-left (RTL) shunt. Shunt may be intra-pulmonary, or extra-pulmonary, and can cause paradoxical embolization, hypoxia and platypnoea orthodeoxia. Saline microbubble contrast echocardiography is a minimally invasive, inexpensive, bedside test that can detect, quantify, and define the anatomical substrate of intra-pulmonary and intra-cardiac shunts. The prevalence of patent foramen ovale (PFO) in the general population is high (20-30%) but is even higher in patients who have a stroke (50%). Thus, the striking absence of data on patients with PFO who develop COVID-19 suggests that this is being under-diagnosed. This may be because physicians and sonographers currently feel that screening for shunt is unnecessary. This could be an unintended consequence of guidance from several specialist societies to defer procedures to close PFO until after the pandemic. This may be counterproductive. Patients with shunt may be at particularly high risk of complications from COVID-19 and interventions to minimise RTL shunt could prevent paradoxical embolization and improve hypoxia in select high risk patients with COVID-19.","output":"Systemic thromboemboli in patients with Covid-19 may result from paradoxical embolization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the greatest challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic has been the way evolving regulation, information and sentiment has driven waves of the disease. Traditional epidemiology models, such as the SIR model, are not equipped to handle these behavioral based changes. We propose a novel multipeak SIR model, which can detect and model the waves of the disease. We bring together the SIR models compartmental structure with a change-point detection martingale process to identify new waves. We create a dynamic process where new waves can be flagged and learned in real time. We use this approach to extend the traditional SEIRD model into a multipeak SEIRD model and test it on forecasting COVID-19 cases from the John Hopkins University dataset for states in the United States. We found that compared to the traditional SEIRD model, the multipeak SEIRD model improves MAPE by 10%-15% for the United States, and by 25%-40% in the specific regions that were hit by the multiple waves. We then pair this model with an optimization model for testing, which is critical in managing the epidemic and which significantly outperforms alternative testing strategies (more than 57% in detection rate).

This study was to evaluate usefulness of the extract for the management of chronic inflammation in a murine model. METHODS: Arthritis was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats using Complete Freunds Adjuvant. Anti-arthritic effect of the extract was evaluated in prophylactic and therapeutic treatment models at doses of 50, 200 and 500 mg/kg. Parameters assessed included oedema, serology of inflammatory response, bone tissue histology and haematology. Data were analysed by ANOVA and Tukeys multiple comparisons post hoc test. RESULTS: HFE at 50C500 mg/kg dose-dependently [P  0.0354 (prophylactic) and P  0.0001 (therapeutic) inhibited swelling of the injected paw upon prophylactic [ 81.26% (P < 0.0001) or therapeutic [ 67.92% (P < 0.01) administration  and prevented spread of arthritis to the contralateral paw. The inflammation alleviation activity was further demonstrated by decrease in arthritis score, radiologic score and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. HFE at all doses significantly reduced serum interleukin (IL)-1 (P < 0.0197), and 500 mg/kg HFE reduced IL-6 (P = 0.0032). In contrast, serum concentrations of IL-10, protein kinase A and cyclic adenosine monophosphate were enhanced (P  0.0436). HFE consistently showed better prophylactic than therapeutic activity. CONCLUSION: HFE strongly suppressed Complete Freunds Adjuvant-induced arthritis and modulated regulators of inflammation, including IL-1, ? 6 and ? 10. Taken together, the data suggest that HFE has potential for use as an agent for modulation of the inflammatory response.

Sex differences in the severity and mortality of COVID-19 emerged. This study aims to describe the impact of sex on outcomes in COVOD-19 with a special focus on the effect of estrogen. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study which included 413 patients (230 males and 183 females) with COVID-19 from three designated hospitals in China with a follow up time from January 31, 2020, to April 17, 2020. Women over 55 were considered as postmenopausal patients according to the previous epidemiological data from China. The interaction between age and sex on in-hospital mortality was determined through Cox regression analysis. In addition, multivariate Cox regression models were performed to explore risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality of COVID-19. Results: Age and sex had significant interaction for the in-hospital mortality (P < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression showed that age (HR 1.041, 95% CI 1.009C1.073, P = 0.012), male sex (HR 2.033, 95% CI 1.007C2.098, P = 0.010), the interaction between age and sex (HR 1.118, 95% CI 1.003C1.232, P = 0.018), and comorbidities (HR 9.845, 95% CI 2.280C42.520, P = 0.002) were independently associated with in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients. In this multicentre study, female experienced a lower fatality for COVID-19 than male (4.4 vs. 10.0%, P = 0.031). Interestingly, stratification by age group revealed no difference in-hospital mortality was noted in women under 55 compared with women over 55 (3.8 vs. 5.2%, P = 0.144), as well as in women under 55 compared with the same age men (3.8 vs. 4.0%, P = 0.918). However, there was significantly difference in women over 55 with men of the same age group (5.2 vs. 21.0%, P = 0.007). Compared with male patients, female patients had higher lymphocyte (P < 0.001) and high-density lipoprotein (P < 0.001), lower high sensitive c reaction protein level (P < 0.001), and lower incidence rate of acute cardiac injury (6.6 vs. 13.5%, P = 0.022). Conclusion: Male sex is an independent risk factor for COVID-19 in-hospital mortality. Although female mortality in COVID-19 is lower than male, it might not be directly related to the effect of estrogen. Further study is warranted to identify the sex difference in COVID-19 and mechanisms involved.","output":"Sex Differences on Clinical Characteristics, Severity, and Mortality in Adult Patients With COVID-19: A Multicentre Retrospective Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The kinetics of IgG antibodies after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) remain poorly understood.

Six electronic databases were searched for articles published from 2010 to 2020. Articles written in English reporting vaporized hydrogen peroxide on pathogens deemed to be relevant to the dental environment were assessed. The quality of the studies was assessed using the risk-of-bias assessment tool designed for the investigation of vaporized hydrogen peroxide application in dentistry. A total of 17 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis. The most commonly reported single bacterial pathogen was Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in five studies, and the viruses Feline calicivirus, Human norovirus, and Murine norovirus were featured in three studies. The results of the studies reporting the log kill were sufficient for all authors to conclude that vaporized hydrogen peroxide generation was effective for the assessed pathogens. The studies that assessed aerosolized hydrogen peroxide found a greater log kill with the use of vaporized hydrogen peroxide generators. The overarching conclusion was that hydrogen peroxide delivered as vaporized hydrogen peroxide was an effective method to achieve large levels of log kill on the assessed pathogens. The hydrogen peroxide vapor generators can play a role in dental bio-decontamination. The parameters must be standardized and the efficacy assessed to perform bio-decontamination for the whole clinic.

Five articles met the inclusion criteria for this review. Their results suggest that many critically ill patients with COVID\\\\19 are in a hypermetabolic state, which is underestimated by commonly used predictive equations in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. In nonobese patients, energy expenditure appears to progressively increase over the course of ICU admission, peaking at week 3. The metabolic response pattern in patients with obesity is unclear because of conflicting findings. Based on limited evidence published thus far, the most accurate predictive equations appear to be the Penn State equations; however, they still had poor individual accuracy overall, which increases the risk of underfeeding or overfeeding and, as such, renders the equations an unsuitable alternative to IC.","output":"Energy requirements for critically ill patients with COVID\\\\19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The number of babies in prison could be significantly reduced if the international human rights framework was monitored and implemented.

Water samples were collected from a limestone cave (Gyokusendo cave, dropping water) and two springs (Ukinju and Komesu, spring water), and the radon concentrations were measured by liquid scintillation counters. The radon concentrations in the samples from the Gyokusendo cave, and Ukinju and Komesu springs were 10  1.3 Bq L(?1), 3.2  1.0 Bq L(?1), and 3.1  1.1 Bq L(?1), respectively. The radon concentrations showed a gradually increasing trend from summer to autumn and decreased during winter. The variation of radon concentrations in the dripping water sample from the Gyokusendo cave showed a lagged response to precipitation changes by approximately 2C3 months. The estimated radon concentrations in the dripping water sample were calculated with the measured radon concentrations from the dripping water obtained during the study period. Based on our results, groundwater in the Gyokusendo cave system was estimated to percolate through the Ryukyu limestone in 7C10 days, and the residence time of groundwater in the soil above Gyokusendo cave was estimated to be approximately 50C80 days.

METHODS: In a prospective fashion, N95 respirators (n = 15) were randomized to a decontamination process (time, dry heat, or ultraviolet C light [UVC]) in outpatient clinics. Each respirator was re-used up to 5 separate clinic sessions. Swabs on each respirator for SARS-CoV-2, bacteria, and fungi were obtained before clinic, after clinic and post-treatment. Mask integrity was checked after each treatment (n = 68). Statistical analyses were performed to determine factors for positive samples. RESULTS: All three decontamination processes reduced bacteria counts similarly. On multivariate mixed model analysis, there were an additional 8.1 colonies of bacteria (95% CI 5.7 to 10.5; p < 0.01) on the inside compared to the outside surface of the respirators. Treatment resulted in a decrease of bacterial load by 8.6 colonies (95% CI -11.6 to -5.5; p < 0.01). Although no decontamination treatment affected the respirator filtration efficiency, heat treatments were associated with the breakdown of thermoplastic elastomer straps. Contamination with fungal and SARS-CoV-2 viral particles were minimal to non-existent. CONCLUSIONS: Time, heat and UVC all reduced bacterial load on reused N95 respirators. Fungal contamination was minimal. Heat could permanently damage some elastic straps making the respirators nonfunctional. Given its effectiveness against microbes, lack of damage to re-treated respirators and logistical ease, UVC represents an optimal decontamination method for individual N95 respirators when reuse is necessary.","output":"N95 respirator reuse, decontamination methods, and microbial burden: A randomized controlled trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many U.S. households have insufficient savings to cope with income losses, expenditure shocks, and other financial emergencies, yet little research evidence explains why. Guided by Sherraden (2013) model of financial capability, we expand on prior research that examines the role of financial knowledge by incorporating additional factors and testing income interactions to explain a greater proportion of variance concerning whether or not households have money set aside for emergencies. We analyzed data from the 2009, 2012, 2015, and 2018 National Financial Capability Surveys and found that subjective financial knowledge, financial confidence, and savings account ownership, but not objective financial knowledge, were significant and consistent predictors of having an emergency fund. Savings account ownership was the strongest predictor, accounting for an increase in the probability of having an emergency fund of 25% to 29% across study years. Adding homeownership and ability to cover expenses to the models increased the proportion of variance explained by an average of 29%. Strategies to promote emergency savings should be multifaceted and include help from financial educators and counselors to create greater financial slack as well as programs and policies to increase access to short-term savings opportunities and incentives.","output":"Why Do Households Lack Emergency Savings?

Our analysis links these outcomes to six separate data sources to control for demographics;housing;socioeconomic status;occupation;transportation modes;health care access;long-run opportunity, as measured by income mobility and incarceration rates;human mobility;and underlying population health. We find that the proportions of black and Hispanic residents in a ZIP code are both positively and statistically significantly associated with COVID-19 cases per capita. The magnitudes are sizeable for both black and Hispanic, but even larger for Hispanic. Although some of these disparities can be explained by differences in long-run opportunity, human mobility, and demographics, most of the disparities remain unexplained even after including an extensive list of covariates related to possible mechanisms. For two cities C Chicago and New York C we also examine COVID-19 fatalities, finding that differences in confirmed COVID-19 cases explain the majority of the observed disparities in fatalities. In other words, the higher death toll of COVID-19 in predominantly black and Hispanic communities mostly reflects higher case rates, rather than higher fatality rates for confirmed cases.","output":"Racial and Ethnic Disparities in COVID-19: Evidence from Six Large Cities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate the value of flexible bronchoscopy (FB) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) when determining causes of lung infection in immunocompromised children; to investigate differences in causes and radiological features of lung infections following bone marrow transplantation (BMT) compared to other immunosuppressive conditions; to evaluate the reliability of radiological findings when predicting the pathogen.

Our analysis shows a significant rate of vaccine hesitancy among Arabs in and outside the Arab region (83% and 81%, respectively). The most cited reasons for hesitancy are concerns about side effects and distrust in healthcare policies, vaccine expedited production, published studies and vaccine producing companies. We also found that female participants, participants 30-59 year-old, those with no chronic diseases, those with lower-level of academic education, and those who do not know the type of vaccine authorized in their countries are more hesitant to receive COVID-19 vaccination. On the other hand, participants who regularly receive the influenza vaccine, health care workers, and those from countries with higher rates of COVID-19 infections showed more vaccination willingness.

We therefore designed and evaluated a ready-to-use 22 target respiratory infection reverse-transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) panel to determine if this would improve detection of these agents at our pediatric hospital. METHODS: RT-qPCR assays for twenty-two target organisms were dried-down in individual wells of 96 well plates and saved at room temperature. Targets included 18 respiratory viruses and 4 bacteria. After automated nucleic acid extraction of nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples, rapid qPCR was performed. RT-qPCR results were compared with those obtained by the testing methods used at our hospital laboratories. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-nine pediatric NPA samples were tested with the RT-qPCR panel. One or more respiratory pathogens were detected in 132/159 (83%) samples. This was significantly higher than the detection rate of standard methods (94/159, 59%) (P<0.001). This difference was mainly due to improved RT-qPCR detection of rhinoviruses, parainfluenza viruses, bocavirus, and coronaviruses. The panel internal control assay performance remained stable at room temperature storage over a two-month testing period.

Although AA medications are associated with substantial weight gain, their tranquilizing effects may independently contribute to risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) perhaps, by a reduction in activity of hypoglossal or recurrent activity of laryngeal nerve on the upper motor airway musculature. METHODS We hypothesized that AA medications are associated with more severe OSA independent of weight and neck circumference. Medical intake data and polysomnographic studies of patients referred to community hospital sleep disorders center were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS Mean age of patients was 49.1 years, 55.1% were male, and mean body mass index (BMI) was 33.8 kg/m. Sixty-eight patients (8.1%) were taking AA at the time of polysomnography. There were no differences in age, sex, neck circumference and BMI of AA versus non-AA patients. The mean (SE) apnea-hypopnea index values were 29.2 (3.5)/h in AA patients and 21.3 (0.8)/h in non-AA patients (P = 0.03). Thirty-four percent of AA patients had severe OSA (apnea-hypopnea index > 30/h) compared with 23% of non-AA patients (P = 0.04).

Urolithins, the products of colon microbiota from ellagitannin rich foodstuff, have immense health benefits and have been demonstrated to bind to estrogen receptors.

One of our findings from the past decade of research on SERMs and estrogen modulators, showed that pomegranate, one of the indirect but major sources of urolithins, can act as SERM. The prospect of urolithins to act as agonist, antagonist, or SERM will depend on its structure; the estrogen receptor conformational change, availability and abundance of co-activators/co-repressors in the target tissues, and also the presence of other estrogen receptor ligands.

Two such examples are Lung surfactant protein D (SP-D) and Dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecules-3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) which are soluble and membrane-bound C-type lectin receptors, respectively. SP-D has a crucial immune function in detecting and clearing pulmonary pathogens; DC-SIGN is involved in facilitating dendritic cell interaction as an antigen-presenting cell with na?ve T cells to mount an anti-viral immune response. Both SP-D and DC-SIGN have been shown to interact with various viruses, including HIV-1, Influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped RNA virus that causes COVID-19. A recombinant fragment of human SP-D (rfhSP-D) comprising of -helical neck region, carbohydrate recognition domain, and eight N-terminal Gly-X-Y repeats has been shown to bind SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication by preventing viral entry in Vero cells and HEK293T cells expressing ACE2. DC-SIGN has also been shown to act as a cell surface receptor for SARS-CoV-2 independent of ACE2. Since rfhSP-D is known to interact with SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and DC-SIGN, this study was aimed at investigating the potential of rfhSP-D in modulating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Coincubation of rfhSP-D with Spike protein improved the Spike Protein: DC-SIGN interaction. Molecular dynamic studies revealed that rfhSP-D stabilised the interaction between DC-SIGN and Spike protein. Cell binding analysis with DC-SIGN expressing HEK 293T and THP-1 cells and rfhSP-D treated SARS-CoV-2 Spike pseudotypes confirmed the increased binding. Furthermore, infection assays using the pseudotypes revealed their increased uptake by DC-SIGN expressing cells. The immunomodulatory effect of rfhSP-D on the DC-SIGN: Spike protein interaction on DC-SIGN expressing epithelial and macrophage-like cell lines was also assessed by measuring the mRNA expression of cytokines and chemokines. The RT-qPCR analysis showed that rfhSP-D treatment downregulated the mRNA expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as TNF-, IFN-, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and RANTES (as well as NF-B) in DC-SIGN expressing cells challenged by Spike protein. Furthermore, rfhSP-D treatment was found to downregulate the mRNA levels of MHC class II in DC expressing THP-1 when compared to the untreated controls. We conclude that rfhSP-D helps stabilise the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and DC-SIGN and increases viral uptake by macrophages via DC-SIGN, suggesting an additional role for rfhSP-D in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Human Surfactant Protein D Facilitates SARS-CoV-2 Pseudotype Binding and Entry in DC-SIGN Expressing Cells, and Downregulates Spike protein Induced Inflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The faculty of language allows humans to state falsehoods in their choice of words. However, while what is said might easily uphold a lie, how it is said may reveal deception. Hence, some features of the voice that are difficult for liars to control may keep speech mostly, if not always, honest. Previous research has identified that speech timing and voice pitch cues can predict the truthfulness of speech, but this evidence has come primarily from laboratory experiments, which sacrifice ecological validity for experimental control. We obtained ecologically valid recordings of deceptive speech while observing natural utterances from players of a popular social deduction board game, in which players are assigned roles that either induce honest or dishonest interactions. When speakers chose to lie, they were prone to longer and more frequent pauses in their speech. This finding is in line with theoretical predictions that lying is more cognitively demanding. However, lying was not reliably associated with vocal pitch. This contradicts predictions that increased physiological arousal from lying might increase muscular tension in the larynx, but is consistent with human specialisations that grant Homo sapiens sapiens an unusual degree of control over the voice relative to other primates. The present study demonstrates the utility of social deduction board games as a means of making naturalistic observations of human behaviour from semi-structured social interactions.","output":"Speech timing cues reveal deceptive speech in social deduction board games"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The author reflects on the celebration of the International Nurses' Day in May 2021, as well as the essential role played by nurses in Great Britain amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"How will you celebrate International Nurses' Day?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There is poor knowledge on characteristics, comorbidities and laboratory measures associated with risk for adverse outcomes and in-hospital mortality in European Countries. We aimed at identifying baseline characteristics predisposing COVID-19 patients to in-hospital death. METHODS AND RESULTS: Retrospective observational study on 3894 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection hospitalized from February 19th to May 23rd, 2020 and recruited in 30 clinical centres distributed throughout Italy. Machine learning (random forest)-based and Cox survival analysis. 61.7% of participants were men (median age 67 years), followed up for a median of 13 days. In-hospital mortality exhibited a geographical gradient, Northern Italian regions featuring more than twofold higher death rates as compared to Central/Southern areas (15.6% vs 6.4%, respectively). Machine learning analysis revealed that the most important features in death classification were impaired renal function, elevated C reactive protein and advanced age. These findings were confirmed by multivariable Cox survival analysis (hazard ratio (HR): 8.2; 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.6-14.7 for age &#8805;85 vs 18-44 y); HR = 4.7; 2.9-7.7 for estimated glomerular filtration rate levels <15 vs &#8805; 90 mL/min/1.73 m2; HR = 2.3; 1.5-3.6 for C-reactive protein levels &#8805;10 vs &#8804; 3 mg/L).

SARS-CoV-2 presents similarities with two previous coronavirus pandemics, MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) and SARS-CoV, concerning phylogenetic origin, structural composition, and clinical symptoms, thus, leading to common pathogenic mechanisms. The purpose of this review is to declare the role of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the pathogenesis, prognosis, and treatment of COVID-19 by comparing its effect on SARS-CoV and MERS cases. Increased levels of IL-6 comprise the key for the stimulation of cytokine storm and the progression of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 cases. Especially, in COVID-19 patients, the overactivation of NF-k, which is caused by the binding of coronavirus spike protein S to alveolar epithelial cells, up-regulates IL-6 and promotes its systematic circulation, causing alveolar damage and extrapulmonary injury. Additionally, IL-6 can be used to evaluate respiratory failure and identify asymptomatic patients. Tocilizumab (TCZ), a monoclonal antibody which blocks IL-6 signaling, comprises a remedial option against COVID-19. TCZ improves oxygenation, reduces fever, and decreases levels of IL-6. IL-6 plays a major role in the pathogenesis of cytokine storm and the progression of COVID-19 and may be used as a therapeutic target against COVID-19.

Until the early 2010s, interest in Korean cultural content in mainland India was low, and it was not treated as a mainstream culture. Recently, however, the Hallyu in India has been spreading around K-pop and K-drama. This study analyzed the background, level of popularity, and characteri tics of the Hallyu in India and suggested some policy implications. Chapter 2 analyzes the characteristics of Indiaa?s audiovisual content markets. India is traditionally a country with a high preference for its own culture, but interest in various cultural content is increasing around the Millennial generation with income growth. Recently, as the digital platform has spread due to the influence of Covid-19, access to overseas content has naturally increased, which is an opportunity to expand interest in Korean music, dramas, movies, etc. In 2020, for example, major Indian satellite broadcasters opened channels exclusively for Korea, providing an opportunity for the Hallyu to expand to those who have not yet contacted online content. Chapter 3 and 4 analyzed the trend of the Hallyu in India, and the main results are as follows. First, the level of interest in K-drama is highest in India, followed by K-pop and K-movie. The distribution of Korean content is expanding through Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Indiaa?s own OTT (Over-The-Top). Meanwhile, K-pop is gaining popularity throughout India, with BTS at the center. The Hallyu, which began with K-drama and K-pop, has recently led to preference to K-beauty, food and Korean language learning. Second, India is significantly less interested in Hallyu than Southeast Asian countries such as Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia. What is special about K-pop and K-drama is that trends in Southeast Asia and India have tended to synchronize. This is related to the environment in which real-time spread of content through online has become possible, along with strengthening the competitiveness of Hallyu content.Third, while Koreaa?s flagship products and brands such as IT and home appliances are receiving widespread attention in India, brand awareness of cultural content such as BTS, which can be directly related to the formation of Koreaa?s national image, is relatively low. However, according to the annual survey of the Hallyu abroad conducted by the Korea International Cultural Exchange Promotion Agency, K-drama and K-pop are emerging as an important element constructing Koreaa?s country image in India. This shows that the Hallyu is beginning to be associated with the image of Korea among Indian people.Fourth, K-drama and K-pop are attracting attention in limited regions of India. The Hallyu in India is concentrated in seven northeastern states, followed by the southern region. In the rest of the region, the popularity of Hallyu is relatively not noticeable. However, according the Indian presses, it is believed that the Hallyu is now expanding throughout India. Seven northeastern states have low income levels, but are ethnically and culturally close to Korea. Pondicherry, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka in the southern region are religiously and culturally open, with relatively high levels of income and education.Fifth, the long-term Hallyu trend in India since 2004 shows that the level of interest in the Hallyu is most noticeable as the spread of Covid-19 began. In particular, the number of K-drama-related reports in 2020 doubled from the previous year in India. This phenomenon is also seen in Southeast Asia, but is most prominent in India. By region, interest in Hallyu content after Covid-19 in seven northeastern states and southern regions is rapidly increasing. In the case of K-pop, interest tends to rise in Kerala and Delhi, which had relatively low interest in K-pop. Covid-19 made favorable condition for the spread of the Hallyu in India.Chapter 5 presents implications based on the above research. First, There is a need to expand Hallyu-linked cultural exchange projects in the southern part of India where the Hallyu has recently emerged, as well as in large cities such as Delhi and Mumbai. Tamil Nadu and Kerala have cultural industry backgrounds and could be a new hub for the Hallyu. In addition to K-drama and K-pop, we also needs to pay attention to K-beauty, which has high potential to expand the m rket regardless of Indiaa?s regional characteristics.Second, we need to expand Korean language education in India with the popularity of the Hallyu. Indian consumers cite linguistic factors as an important obstacle to Korean cultural content consumption. Since the spread of the Hallyu leads to demand for the Korean language, and the knowledge on the Korean language leads to interest in the Korea itself, Korean language education will be an important medium for maximizing the positive external effects of the Hallyu and improving Koreaa?s national brand.Third, it is necessary to utilize the Agreement on Cooperation in Audio-Visual Co-production signed between Korea and India in 2015. India signed audio-visual co-production agreements with 15 countries including Korea, and has jointly produced a number of films with France, Canada, etc. India has already remade a number of Korean films and is showing interest in K-drama, but there have been no cases of co-production of movies or dramas yet. Korean producers should consider what Indian consumers and producers expect from the joint production.Fourth, it is necessary to expand cooperation among cultural agencies. While the Korean Cultural Center in Dehli is the only institution in India, it is time to actively expand institutional-level cooperation in India.Fifth, regarding India, Korean government or agenciesa? supports to link Hallyu to national brands are crucial. It is required to strengthen Korean companies (especially SMEs)a? marketing in India combined with Hallyu content.","output":"An Analysis of Hallyu in India and Policy Implication: Centered on Music and Visual Content"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective To describe the structure and efforts of the health sectors in municipalities to address the COVID-19 pandemic from the first infected case to the second wave.Method We conducted self-administered postal questionnaires with the department head or an equivalent position of the 1,741 municipal health departments (108 cities or districts with public health centers (PHC) and 1,633 general municipalities) in Japan as of November 1, 2020.

The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses Filoviridae Study Group and other experts have recently established an almost consistent classification and nomenclature for filoviruses. Here, further guidelines are suggested to include their natural genetic variants. First, this term is defined. Second, a template for full-length virus names (such as Ebola virus H.sapiens-tc/COD/1995/Kikwit-9510621) is proposed. These names contain information on the identity of the virus (e.g., Ebola virus), isolation host (e.g., members of the species Homo sapiens), sampling location (e.g., Democratic Republic of the Congo (COD)), sampling year, genetic variant (e.g., Kikwit), and isolate (e.g., 9510621). Suffixes are proposed for individual names that clarify whether a given genetic variant has been characterized based on passage zero material (-wt), has been passaged in tissue/cell culture (-tc), is known from consensus sequence fragments only (-frag), or does (most likely) not exist anymore (-hist). We suggest that these comprehensive names are to be used specifically in the methods section of publications. Suitable abbreviations, also proposed here, could then be used throughout the text, while the full names could be used again in phylograms, tables, or figures if the contained information aids the interpretation of presented data. The proposed system is very similar to the well-known influenzavirus nomenclature and the nomenclature recently proposed for rotaviruses. If applied consistently, it would considerably simplify retrieval of sequence data from electronic databases and be a first important step toward a viral genome annotation standard as sought by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Furthermore, adoption of this nomenclature would increase the general understanding of filovirus-related publications and presentations and improve figures such as phylograms, alignments, and diagrams.

This dysfunction may cause loss of appetite, malnutrition, poisoning, and depression. Obviously, the impairment has a strong impact on the quality of life. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify effective treatments. Various therapies have been studied to treat smell disorders after infection, and olfactory training (OT) is considered a promising treatment option. Assessing the effectiveness and safety of olfactory training for COVID-19 patients with smell disorders is the main purpose of this systematic review protocol. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Wanfang Database, ClinicalTrials.gov trials registry, and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry will be searched from January 2019 to January 2021.

Laboratory testing is crucial to prompt identification of positive cases, initiation of treatment and management strategies. However, medical scientists are vulnerable to infection due to the risk of exposure in the laboratory and the community. This study sought to determine the awareness of laboratory safety measures, assess the personal efforts of medical scientists in creating a safe laboratory environment for testing and examine the laboratory safety enabling factors. METHODS: The data used for the study were generated among medical scientists in Nigeria through an internet-broadcasted questionnaire and were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics (version 25). RESULTS: The majority of the respondents had a high awareness of laboratory safety measures (60.3%) and demonstrated good personal efforts in creating a safe laboratory testing environment (63%). The level of awareness of laboratory safety measures was significantly associated with respondents level of education ((2) = 6.143; p = 0.046) and influences respondents efforts in creating a safe laboratory testing environment (p = 0.007). However, just a few respondents could convincingly attest to the availability of adequate and appropriate PPE with proper utilization training (45.1%), adequate rest and other welfare packages (45.8%) as well as access to appropriate Biological Safety Cabinets (BSCs) and other essential equipment in their laboratories (48.8%). Furthermore, a significant association existed between the availability of laboratory safety enabling factors and respondents efforts in creating a safe environment for testing with the p-value ranging between < 0.0001 and 0.003. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that despite the high awareness of safety measures and good personal efforts of the study participants in creating a safe laboratory-testing environment, there was poor availability of safety facilities, equipment, support and welfare packages required to enhance their safety. It is, therefore, crucial to provide necessary laboratory biosafety equipment and PPE in order not to compromise medical scientists safety as they perform their duties in COVID-19 pandemic response.

Both theoretical and experimental efforts are being made to find an effective treatment to suppress the virus, constituting the forefront of current global safety concerns and a significant burden on global economies. The development of innovative materials able to prevent the transmission, spread, and entry of COVID-19 pathogens into the human body is currently in the spotlight. The synthesis of these materials is, therefore, gaining momentum, as methods providing nontoxic and environmentally friendly procedures are in high demand. Here, a highly virucidal material constructed from SiO2-Ag composite immobilized in a polymeric matrix (ethyl vinyl acetate) is presented. The experimental results indicated that the as-fabricated samples exhibited high antibacterial activity towards Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) as well as towards SARS-CoV-2. Based on the present results and radical scavenger experiments, we propose a possible mechanism to explain the enhancement of the biocidal activity. In the presence of O2 and H2O, the plasmon-assisted surface mechanism is the major reaction channel generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). We believe that the present strategy based on the plasmonic effect would be a significant contribution to the design and preparation of efficient biocidal materials.

We assessed the experience with one such therapy of patients diagnosed with psychosis, including satisfaction, side effects, and positive experiences of access to the technology. We tested whether side effects affected therapy. METHODS In a clinical trial 122 patients diagnosed with psychosis completed baseline measures of psychiatric symptoms, received gameChange VR therapy, and then completed a satisfaction questionnaire, the Oxford-VR Side Effects Checklist, and outcome measures. RESULTS 79 (65.8%) patients were very satisfied with VR therapy, 37 (30.8%) were mostly satisfied, 3 (2.5%) were indifferent/mildly dissatisfied, and 1 (0.8%) person was quite dissatisfied. The most common side effects were: difficulties concentrating because of thinking about what might be happening in the room (n = 17, 14.2%); lasting headache (n = 10, 8.3%); and the headset causing feelings of panic (n = 9, 7.4%). Side effects formed three factors: difficulties concentrating when wearing a headset, feelings of panic using VR, and worries following VR. The occurrence of side effects was not associated with number of VR sessions, therapy outcomes, or psychiatric symptoms.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the behavior of adolescents during the isolation period. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional descriptive study conducted at the Adolescent Health Studies Center. Data were obtained from a questionnaire prepared on Google Forms, sent by a multiplatform instant messaging application, and analyzed using the Stata 14 software. RESULTS: A total of 208 adolescents with a mean age of 15.3 years (SD  1.8) answered the questionnaire, 57.7% were female. About 93.3% of adolescents said they were in isolation with a changed routine, 67.3% increased their food consumption, 86.5% were inactive, and 58.7% reported screen time over 8 h/d. There was an association between anxiety and increased food consumption (odds ratio: 3.9; CI 95% 2-7.5; p = 0.00), sleeping difficulty (odds ratio: 3.6; CI 95% 1.9-6.8; p = 0.00), and conflicting family relationship (odds ratio: 5.7; CI 95% 1.6-7.8; p = 0.01).

It is assumed that almost one third of these infections include the lower respiratory tract (LRTI), e. g. acute bronchitis, acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), community- or hospital-acquired pneumonia and influenza. Due to a lack of sufficient and valid investigations to prove the presence of respiratory viruses their impact in the pathogenesis of lower respiratory tract infection has probably been underestimated for a long time. Therefore, there might have been many cases of unnecessary antibiotic treatment, especially in cases of acute bronchitis or acute exacerbations of COPD, because of an assumed bacteriological cause. With the introduction of more sensitive investigational procedures, such as polymerase chain reaction, it is possible to sufficiently prove respiratory viruses and therefore illuminate their role in the pathogenesis of lower respiratory tract infections of the adult. We have reviewed the current literature on the impact of viruses in lower respiratory tract infections to elucidate the role of viruses in the pathogenesis of lower respiratory tract infections.

Recent literature has shown that the effects of COVID-19 mitigation measures may increase disease burden of common illnesses including HIV, Tuberculosis, Malaria and other key public health outcomes such as maternal mortality. A research program was undertaken to locate disengaged HIV positive women on option B+ and supported them to reengage in care. A 1 year follow up done following the tracing revealed that some women still disengaged from care. We aimed to establish the barriers to and facilitators for reengagement in care among previously traced women on option B+, and how these could have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This was a cross sectional qualitative study using individual interviews conducted in June and July, 2020, a period when the COVID-19 response measures such as lockdown and restrictions on transport were being observed in Uganda. Study participants were drawn from nine peri-urban and rural public healthcare facilities. Purposive sampling was used to select women still engaged in and those who disengaged from care approximately after 1 year since they were last contacted. Seventeen participants were included. Data was analysed using the content analysis approach. RESULTS: Women reported various barriers that affected their reengagement and retention in care during the COVID-19 pandemic. These included structural barriers such as transport difficulties and financial constraints; clinical barriers which included unsupportive healthcare workers, short supply of drugs, clinic delays, lack of privacy and medicine side effects; and psychosocial barriers such as perceived or experienced stigma and non-disclosure of HIV sero-status. Supportive structures such as family, community-based medicine distribution models, and a friendly healthcare environment were key facilitators to retention in care among this group. The COVID-19 pandemic was reported to exacerbate the barriers to retention in care. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 may exacerbate barriers to retention in HIV care among those who have experienced previous disengagement.

Previously, it has been shown that Semliki Forest virus Nsp3 (482 amino acids) is a phosphoprotein, and, in the present study, we have mapped its major phosphorylation sites. Mass spectrometric methods utilized included precursor ion scanning, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry used in conjunction with on-target alkaline phosphatase digestions, and tandem mass spectrometry. Two-dimensional peptide mapping was applied to separate tryptic (32)P-labeled phosphopeptides of Nsp3. Radiolabeled peptides were then subjected to Edman sequencing, and phosphoamino acid analysis. In addition, radiolabeled Nsp3 was cleaved successively with cyanogen bromide and trypsin, and microscale iron-chelate affinity chromatography was used to enrich phosphopeptides. By combining these methods, we showed that Nsp3 is phosphorylated on serine residues 320, 327, 332, 335, 356, 359, 362, and 367, and is heavily phosphorylated on peptide Gly(338)-Lys(415), which carries 7-12 phosphates distributed over its 13 potential phosphorylation sites.

To further control its transmission, early laboratory diagnosis of both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients is crucial. Presently, the COVID-19 diagnosis of infected individuals is dependent on computed tomography scanning and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The latter is considered more sensitive and efficient for early diagnosis.

Recently in vitro studies suggested that it may be beneficial to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. This important drug molecule was investigated by solid state NMR measurements to provide more complete features of its structure and dynamics at atomic scale resolution. The spinClattice relaxation time at twenty-two different carbon sites of dexamethasone was determined by the Torchia CP method. The principle components of the chemical shift anisotropy tensor were determined by (13)C two-dimensional phase adjusted spinning sideband (2DPASS) cross-polarization magic angle spinning (CP-MAS) solid state NMR experiments. The molecular correlation time at twenty-two crystallographically different carbon sites of dexamethasone was calculated by considering that the spinClattice relaxation mechanism of the (13)C nucleus is mainly governed by the chemical shift anisotropy interaction and the heteronuclear dipoleCdipole coupling. The spinClattice relaxation time of carbon nuclei resides on A, B, C, and D rings and the side-chain of dexamethasone is quite large, which implies the close-packed arrangement of the molecule. The difference in molecular correlation time at various regions of the molecule demonstrates the existence of different degrees of freedom within the molecule. This may be the reason for the various biological activities exhibited by the molecule.

OBJECTIVE: This registry study assessed the real-world use and clinical outcomes of telavancin in patients with bacteremia or endocarditis enrolled in the Telavancin Observation Use Registry (TOUR?). METHODS: The subset of patients enrolled in TOUR who were diagnosed with endocarditis and/or bacteremia with a known or unknown primary source (N = 151) were analyzed. Data including demographics, infection type, baseline pathogens, prior or concomitant antimicrobial therapy, dosing regimen, clinical response, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of interest, and mortality were collected by retrospective medical chart review. RESULTS: Telavancin was primarily used as a second-line or greater therapy (n = 132, 87.4%). MRSA was present in 87 (57.6%) patients. Median telavancin dose was 740.6 mg (interquartile range (IQR) 206.0 mg) and median duration of therapy was 9.0 days (IQR 24.0 days). Of the 132/151 (87.4%) patients with an available assessment at the end of telavancin therapy, a positive clinical response was achieved in 98/132 (74.2%), while 14/132 (10.6%) failed therapy and 20/132 (15.2%) had an indeterminant outcome. TEAEs occurred in 24 (15.9%) patients. The most frequent TEAE was renal failure (n = 12, 7.9%); seven of these patients were receiving concomitant nephrotoxic medications. There was no change in creatinine clearance for 67/89 (75.3%) patients with values recorded at the beginning and the end of telavancin therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In real-world clinical practice, overall positive clinical outcomes are observed in patients with bacteremia or endocarditis treated with telavancin, including in those patients infected with MRSA or another S. aureus pathogen. Telavancin may be an alternative treatment option for these patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02288234) on 11 November 2014.

Design Cross sectional telephone survey using random digit dialling. Setting Interviews by telephone between 8 and 12 May. Participants 997 adults aged 18 or more who had heard of swine flu and spoke English. Main outcome measures Recommended change in behaviour (increases in handwashing and surface cleaning or plans made with a flu friend) and avoidance behaviours (engaged in one or more of six behaviours such as avoiding large crowds or public transport). Results 37.8% of participants (n=377) reported performing any recommended behaviour change over the past four days . . . because of swine flu. 4.9% (n=49) had carried out any avoidance behaviour. Controlling for personal details and anxiety, recommended changes were associated with perceptions that swine flu is severe, that the risk of catching it is high risk, that the outbreak will continue for a long time, that the authorities can be trusted, that good information has been provided, that people can control their risk of catching swine flu, and that specific behaviours are effective in reducing the risk. Being uncertain about the outbreak and believing that the outbreak had been exaggerated were associated with a lower likelihood of change. The strongest predictor of behaviour change was ethnicity, with participants from ethnic minority groups being more likely to make recommended changes (odds ratio 3.2, 95% confidence interval 2.0 to 5.3) and carry out avoidance behaviours (4.1, 2.0 to 8.4). Conclusions The results support efforts to inform the public about specific actions that can reduce the risks from swine flu and to communicate about the governments plans and resources. Tackling the perception that the outbreak has been over-hyped may be difficult but worthwhile. Additional research is required into differing reactions to the outbreak among ethnic groups.","output":"Public perceptions, anxiety, and behaviour change in relation to the swine flu outbreak: cross sectional telephone survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We aimed to compare the therapeutic efficacy of prolonged macrolide (PMC), corticosteroids (CST), doxycycline (DXC), and levofloxacin (LFX) against macrolide-unresponsive Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) pneumonia in children and to evaluate the safety of the secondary treatment agents. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of patients with MP pneumonia hospitalized between January 2015 and April 2017. Macrolide-unresponsiveness was clinically defined with a persistent fever of  38.0C at  72 hours after macrolide treatment. The cases were divided into four groups: PMC, CST, DXC, and LFX. We compared the time to defervescence (TTD) after secondary treatment and the TTD after initial macrolide treatment in each group with adjustment using propensity score-matching analysis. RESULTS: Among 1,165 cases of MP pneumonia, 190 (16.3%) were unresponsive to macrolides. The proportion of patients who achieved defervescence within 48 hours in CST, DXC, and LFX groups were 96.9% (31/33), 85.7% (12/14), and 83.3% (5/6), respectively. The TTD after initial macrolide treatment did not differ between PMC and CST groups (5.1 vs. 4.2 days, P = 0.085), PMC and DXC groups (4.9 vs. 5.7 days, P = 0.453), and PMC and LFX groups (4.4 vs. 5.0 days, P = 0.283). No side effects were observed in the CST, DXC, and LFX groups. CONCLUSION: The change to secondary treatment did not show better efficacy compared to PMC in children with macrolide-unresponsive MP pneumonia.

Patients with COVID-19 are susceptible to thrombosis due to excessive inflammation, platelet activation, endothelial dysfunction, and circulatory stasis, resulting in an increased risk of death due to associated coagulopathies. In addition, many patients receiving antithrombotic therapy for pre-existing thrombotic diseases can develop COVID-19, which can further complicate dose adjustment, choice and laboratory monitoring of antithrombotic treatment. This review summarizes the laboratory findings, the prohemostatic state, incidence of thromboembolic events and some potential therapeutic interventions of COVID-19 associated coagulopathy. We explore the roles of biomarkers of thrombosis and inflammation according to the severity of COVID-19. While therapeutic anticoagulation has been used empirically in some patients with severe COVID-19 but without thrombosis, it may be preferable to provide supportive care based on evidence-based randomized clinical trials. The likely lifting of travel restrictions will accelerate the spread of COVID-19, increasing morbidity and mortality across nations.

METHODS: Bespoke questionnaires of childrens and parents mental and behavioral problems during the epidemic were used in the study. We also used the State Anxiety Inventory (S-AI), the Parenting Stress IndexShort Form-15 (PSI-SF-15), the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI), and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). The data used in the study were pooled from an online survey of parents of special needs children and analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multiple linear regression. RESULTS: Overall, 1,451 individuals were included, of which 402 were fathers (27.71%) and 1,049 were mothers (72.29%). ANOVA results showed that educational background, family monthly income, and type of their childs disability made parents state anxiety significantly different. The results of multiple linear regression showed that during the epidemic, social support negatively predicted parents state anxiety (B = ?0.15, p < 0.001), whereas parenting stress (B = 0.07, p = 0.001) and parental mental and behavioral problems (B = 0.37, p < 0.001) positively predicted parents state anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: During the outbreak of COVID-19, parents of special needs children suffered mental and behavioral problems, together with parenting stress and social support, which influenced their state anxiety.

As the objective assessment of physical activity with wearables is usually initiated during in-person visits, the collection of these data experienced substantial, unplanned gaps. We report the frequency of data collection (visits-per-month) in studies collaborating with the Accelerometry Resource Core (ARC) at Johns Hopkins Center on Aging and Health. We focus on two, NIH-funded, studies that implemented the ARC accelerometry protocol. The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities that stopped visit 8 enrollment in early 2020 and reinstated in 2021 for visit 9, and the Peripheral Artery Disease Study of SOL that started the data collection in early 2021, first via the mail-in protocol, then shifting towards in-clinic visits. Through March 2020, ARC processed an average of 125 new accelerometry per month (SD = 54). There was no new data collected for the remainder of 2020. The collection restarted in January 2021 with an average of 55 (SD = 43) files a month in the first and 112 (SD = 53) in the second quarter of 2021. A total of 573 new accelerometry observations were collected across both studies since the first wave of COVID-19 in March 2020 including 282 observations collected exclusively using a mail-in protocol.

OBJECTIVES: We analyzed azithromycin consumption in Croatia in 2020 and compared this to the period 2017C2019. METHODS: Azithromycin consumption was evaluated using the IQVIA Adriatic d.o.o. database which collects data on azithromycin distribution from wholesale pharmacies to hospital and non-hospital pharmacies in Croatia. We analyzed data for the period from January 2017 to December 2020. Azithromycin distribution was measured as days of therapy (DOT) and reported as per 1000 inhabitants or per 1000 inhabitant-days. RESULTS: In the period 2017C2020, total azithromycin DOT in Croatia increased in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 (1.76, 1.91, 1.91 and 2.01/1000 inhabitant-days, respectively). Non-hospital pharmacies received 2.18 times and hospital pharmacies 4.39 times more DOT units/1000 inhabitants of azithromycin in March 2020 compared to the average distribution rate in March 2017C2019. During the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic (November and December 2020) azithromycin distribution increased considerably in hospital (3.62 and 3.19 times, respectively) and non-hospital pharmacies (1.93 and 1.84 times, respectively) compared to the average consumption in the same months in 2017C2019.

Here, we introduce a novel surgical technique of video-assisted transaxillary nipple-sparing mastectomy and immediate implant-based breast reconstruction and describe the detailed surgical procedure using this technique. METHODS: Detailed steps of surgical procedure, the patient characteristics and the mean operative time of this new technique were described in this article. All patients were asked to score their satisfaction with their reconstructed breasts preoperatively, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months postoperatively using the BREAST-Q. RESULTS: At first, we used our conventional method and performed on 10 patients from April 2017 to June 2020; the operative time was 324.80  66.39 minutes. After improving several procedures of the technique, the optimized method was performed on 14 cases from July 2020 to November 2020; the operative time decreased to 193.71  28.75 minutes with shortest was 133 minutes; the optimized method was novel and easy to learn and be generalized. Most of the patients were satisfied with the reconstruction results. There was no significant difference between preoperative scores and scores at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months (p = 0.364). Since there is no wound on the breast dome, no obvious postoperative complications were observed except for one patient presented with infection.

More than 6,973,427 confirmed cases were diagnosed in nearly 213 countries and territories around the world and two international conveyances, causing globally over 400,000 deaths. Epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients have been identified, but the factors influencing the immune system against COVID-19 have not been well established. Upon infection or cell damage, high amounts of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are released from damaged cells, which serve as mediators of inflammation through purinergic cell surface receptor signaling. As a protective mechanism to prevent excessive damage to host tissue, adenosine counteracts ATP's effects by adenosine receptor stimulation to suppress the pro-inflammatory response. Adenosine is seen as a major obstacle to the efficacy of immune therapies, and the adenosinergic axis components are critical therapeutic targets for cancer and microbial infections. Pharmacologic inhibitors or antibodies specific to adenosinergic pathway components or adenosine receptors in microbial and tumor therapy have shown efficacy in pre-clinical studies and are entering the clinical arena. In this review, we provide a novel hypothesis explaining the potential for improving the efficiency of innate and adaptive immune systems by targeting adenosinergic pathway components and adenosine A2A receptor signaling for the treatment of COVID-19.","output":"Targeting adenosinergic pathway and adenosine A2A receptor signaling for the treatment of COVID-19: A hypothesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medical schools play a central role in the compilation and development of professional knowledge, which is why they have privileges and resources that are justified only to the extent that they use them to serve the community, particularly those who are most in need.

Soon after, the virus had spread around the world and became a pandemic. Social restrictions, quarantines, and other governmental policies in response to the pandemic altered normal operations across the world. One area significantly affected is human mobility. Typical movement patterns have been hindered by the pandemic. But inversely, mobility patterns can influence patterns of the virus. With this in mind, we created an interactive web application to visualize in near-real time the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and human mobility, as well as the impact of governmental policies at different spatial scales. The web application allows users to select a country at the global scale or a state or county for the USA and then displays a corresponding plot that compares human mobility to COVID-19 cases across time for the location, as well as to policy data. The application is useful for quickly revealing insightful patterns. First, the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was a rather sudden decrease in mobility. Second, a relationship exists between mobility and COVID-19 offset by a lag, but that lag is not consistent over space or time. Third, spatial autocorrelation of relationship is apparent, meaning locations near each other share similar patterns.

It has been hypothesized that hyperinflammation, as reflected by the secretion of cytokines, might induce thyroid dysfunction among patients with COVID-19. We explored thyroid hormone involvement in the acute phase of symptomatic COVID-19 and its possible associations with cytokine levels and mortality risk. This was a single-center study of 116 consecutive patients hospitalized for moderate-to-severe COVID-19 disease. Serum concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (T(4)), and 45 cytokines/chemokines were measured in all patients within 3 days of admission. Data were extracted retrospectively through a manual review of health records. At admission, 95 (81.9%) were euthyroid; while 21 (18.1%) had biochemically thyroid dysfunction including subclinical thyrotoxicosis (n = 11), overt thyrotoxicosis (n = 2), hypothyroidism (n = 1), non-thyroidal illness (n = 2), and normal TSH but high free T(4) (n = 5). TSH levels were inversely correlated with IL-8 (r(s) = C0.248), IL-10 (r(s) = C0.253), IL-15 (r(s) = C0.213), IP-10 (r(s) = C0.334), and GM-CSF (r(s) = C0.254). Moreover, IL-8 levels, IP-10, and GM-CSF were significantly higher in patients with serum TSH < 0.4 mIU/L. Lastly, a two-fold increment of IL-8 and IL-10 was associated with significantly higher odds of having TSH < 0.4 mIU/L (odds ratio 1.86 (1.11C3.10) and 1.78 (1.03C3.06)). Serum TSH was not associated with 30- or 90-day mortality. In conclusion, this study suggests that fluctuations of TSH levels in patients with COVID-19 may be influenced by circulating IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, IP-10, and GM-CSF as previously described in autoimmune thyroid diseases.","output":"Thyroid function in COVID-19 and the association with cytokine levels and mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer is technically demanding and can be hindered by unexpected intra-operative complications. Among the various intra-operative complications, double-stapled anastomotic complications are more serious and complicated to manage. The purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of intra-operative double-stapled colorectal or coloanal anastomotic complications on short-term surgical outcomes and persistent leak, and risk factors of intra-operative double-stapled anastomotic complication. METHODS Consecutive 363 cases of laparoscopic low anterior resection from August 2004 to November 2012 were analyzed in this study. We retrospectively reviewed intra-operative double-stapled anastomotic complications and compared patient characteristics, surgical data, post-operative clinical data, and pathological data between groups with and without intra-operative double-stapled anastomotic complications. And we analyzed risk factors for double-stapled anastomotic complication. RESULTS There were 20 intra-operative double-stapled anastomotic complications among the patients (5.5 %). Operation time was longer (304.8  122.0 vs. 197.1  87.5 min, p = 0.001) and more diversion ileostomy were made (75 vs. 34.7 %, p < 0.001) in the group with double-stapled anastomotic complications. There were no differences in terms of surgical morbidity, conversion rate, anastomotic leakage, and hospital stay. However, there was more persistent anastomotic leakage (15 vs. 0.9 %, p = 0.003) in the group with double-stapled anastomotic complications. In univariate analysis, risk factors for double-stapled anastomotic complications were male, T4 stage lesion, and three or more stapler firings. CONCLUSIONS The double-stapled anastomotic complications during laparoscopic low anterior resection increased operation time and rate of diversion ileostomy. Although these factors did not adversely affect short-term surgical outcome including post-operative morbidity and anastomotic leakage, double-stapled anastomotic complications could increase persistent anastomotic leakage rate.","output":"Intra-operative double-stapled colorectal or coloanal anastomotic complications of laparoscopic low anterior resection for rectal cancer: double-stapled anastomotic complication could result in persistent anastomotic leakage."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Virtual reality simulation (VRS) has become progressively popular as a training tool in ophthalmology. However, debate continues as to whether VRS has resulted in better outcomes for patients following cataract surgery.

Included studies measured the effect of VRS on real-life patient outcomes following cataract surgery. Databases searched included Medline (Ovid), The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PubMed, and CINAHL. 1917 studies were identified, of which 10 studies were included, spanning from 2011 to 2020. Studies included comprised of 471 ophthalmological residents, with their complication rates assessed after 30,462 cataract surgery procedures. This systematic literature review indicates that VRS appears to be most helpful in reducing the rate of posterior capsular rupture or errant curvilinear capsulorrhexis and had limited evidence in reducing the rate of other complications.","output":"Does virtual reality simulation training result in fewer real-life cataract surgery complications?

Appropriate countermeasures mean thoughtful and educated choice of viral targets (epitopes). There are several articles that discuss such choices in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, other focus on phylogenetic traits and history of the Coronaviridae genome/proteome. However none consider viral protein low complexity regions (LCRs). Recently we created the first methods that are able to compare such fragments. We show that five low complexity regions (LCRs) in three proteins (nsp3, S and N) encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome are highly similar to regions from human proteome. As many as 21 predicted T-cell epitopes and 27 predicted B-cell epitopes overlap with the five SARS-CoV-2 LCRs similar to human proteins. Interestingly, replication proteins encoded in the central part of viral RNA are devoid of LCRs. Similarity of SARS-CoV-2 LCRs to human proteins may have implications on the ability of the virus to counteract immune defenses. The vaccine targeted LCRs may potentially be ineffective or alternatively lead to autoimmune diseases development. These findings are crucial to the process of selection of new epitopes for drugs or vaccines which should omit such regions. Author summary The outbreak of the COVID-19 disease affects humans all over the globe. More and more people get sick and many die because of the deadly SARS-CoV-2 virus. The whole machinery of this pathogen is enclosed in a short sequence of nucleotides, building blocks for both RNA and DNA strands. This RNA virus encodes less than 30 protein sequences that change the fate of our societies. Its proteins are composed of 20 amino acids (building bricks) that are usually used quite freely by proteins. However, there are fragments where only one or a few amino acids are used. We name those low complexity regions (LCRs). We invented the first programmes able to compare such LCRs. Using this new methodology we were able to show similarity of some viral proteins to human ones. This discovery has a serious implication when designing vaccines or drugs. It means that companies should not use these very LCRs as targets because it may trigger an autoimmune disease. On the other hand this specific similarity may suggest some kind of disguise of viral proteins into the machinery of human cells.","output":"Common low complexity regions for SARS-CoV-2 and human proteomes as potential multidirectional risk factor in vaccine development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT: Advance Care Planning (ACP) is essential to elicit goals, values, and preferences of care in older adults with serious illness and on trajectories of frailty.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study in the intensive care unit of Tongji Hospital, which was assigned responsibility for the treatments of severe COVID-19 patients by the Wuhan government. AKI was defined and staged based on Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. Mild AKI was defined as stage 1, and severe AKI was defined as stage 2 or stage 3. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate AKI risk factors, and Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the association between AKI and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 119 patients with COVID-19 were included in our study. The median patient age was 70 years (interquartile range, 59C77) and 61.3% were male. Fifty-one (42.8%) patients developed AKI during hospitalization, corresponding to 14.3% in stage 1, 28.6% in stage 2 and 18.5% in stage 3, respectively. Compared to patients without AKI, patients with AKI had a higher proportion of mechanical ventilation mortality and higher in-hospital mortality. A total of 97.1% of patients with severe AKI received mechanical ventilation and in-hospital mortality was up to 79.4%.

Dental implant placement in this area may damage neurovascular branches if this anatomic variation is not carefully identified, resulting in unexpected complications. PURPOSE: The purpose of this retrospective study was to identify accessory canals of the canalis sinuosus and analyze their relationship to the terminal canalis sinuosus and anterior maxilla in Chinese patients to provide a warning for surgeons operating in the anterior maxilla. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans of 1007 Chinese patients were examined to identify the prevalence and size of accessory canals with at least 1.0-mm diameter. Axial position of this canal was classified referring to the nasal cavity and adjacent teeth. Its sagittal position was determined by the distance from the bifurcation site of canalis sinuosus to the buccal alveolar crest and the distance from the canal opening to the palatal alveolar crest. Diameter of the terminal canalis sinuosus, distance from the terminal canalis sinuosus to the buccal alveolar crest, and anterior maxillary volume were measured on all scans. Binary logistic regression and the Spearman rank correlation coefficient were used for prevalence and diameter analysis. RESULTS: The prevalence of the accessory canal was 36.9%, positively correlated the anterior maxillary volume (OR 1.408) and negatively correlated with the distance from the terminal canalis sinuosus to the buccal alveolar crest (OR 0.921). Average diameter of such canal was 1.1 0.1 mm, significantly higher in men, positively correlated with the diameter of terminal canalis sinuosus (rs=0.163) and the distance from the canal opening to the palatal alveolar crest (rs=0.192). All accessory canals started below the buccal cortical bone, 19.3 2.7 mm away from the buccal alveolar crest. There were 61.9% accessory canals opened between the central and the lateral incisors.

It includes a dramatic loss of gained bone mineral density (BMD) and an increased risk of vertebral fractures. This prospective multi-institutional randomized controlled trial aims to investigate whether zoledronate prevents loss of BMD after discontinuation of denosumab. The trial was registered as Denosumab Sequential Therapy (DST) trial in March 2019 at clinicaltrials.gov, with the identifier NCT03868033. Methods: The study is conducted at National Taiwan University Hospital and its branches. Patients who have continuously received denosumab treatment for two or more years are surveyed for eligibility. Baseline characteristics and questionnaires of life quality are recorded after recruitment. BMD, circulating levels of bone turnover markers (BTMs), including serum N-terminal propeptide of type 1 collagen (P1NP) and C-terminal telopeptide (CTX), are checked before the stratified randomization to 4 groups. Biological sex and the T-scores are used to create 4 strata. The participants in group 1 adhere to regular denosumab therapy for another 2 years. All the other patients receive on-time zoledronate treatment in the first year. The participants in group 2, 3, and 4 have on-time denosumab, on-time zoledronate and drug holiday in the second year, respectively. BMDs are checked annually. Pre-scheduled checkpoints of BTMs are also arranged. For patient safety, rescue treatment with another injection of zoledronate will be applied to the patients on drug holiday if the CTX levels raise above the pre-specified threshold, 0.573 ng/mL for women and 0.584 ng/mL for men. The primary outcomes are the percentage changes of BMDs in lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck. The secondary outcomes include the changes of serum level of the BTMs, new osteoporotic fractures, extra zoledronate injections needed in group 4 and the differences of quality of life.

This mixed-method study investigated officers' strain over three months after the lockdown. METHODS: In an online survey, 2567 police officers (77% male) from Austria, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Spain participated at three measurement points per country in spring, 2020. Three-level growth curve models assessed changes in strain and its relation to stressor appraisal, emotion regulation, and preparedness through training. To add context to the findings, free response answers about officers' main tasks, stressors, and crisis measures were coded inductively. RESULTS: On average, officers seemed to tolerate the pandemic with slight decreases in strain over time. Despite substantial variance between countries, 66% of the variance occurred between individuals. Sex, work experience, stressor appraisal, emotion regulation, and preparedness significantly predicted strain. Risk of infection and deficient communication emerged as main stressors. Officers' reports allowed to derive implications for governmental, organizational, and individual coping strategies during pandemics. CONCLUSION: Preparing for a pandemic requires three primary paths: 1) enacting unambiguous laws and increasing public compliance through media communication, 2) being logistically prepared, and 3) improving stress regulation skills in police training.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on European police officers: Stress, demands and coping resources"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to report the changes and adaptations of a vascular tertiary center during a global pandemic and the impact on its activity and patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study within the Vascular Surgery ward in Centro Hospitalar Universitrio Lisboa Norte, Portugal. All data from surgical, inpatient and outpatient activity were collected from February to June 2020 and compared to the same 5-month period in 2018 and 2019. We ran a descriptive analysis of all data and performed statistical tests for the variation of procedures and admissions between February and June 2018 and the same time period in 2020. RESULTS: During the outbreak, our staff had to be readapted. 6 nurses were transferred to COVID-19 units (out of a total of 33 nurses) while 1 of the 7 residents was transferred to an intensive care unit and 1 senior surgeon was put on prophylactic leave. In the outpatient clinic, there was an increase in the number of telemedicine consultations with a greater focus on first-time referrals and urgent cases. There was a significant increase in the total number of elective admissions whereas there were significantly less admissions from an emergency setting (+57% and -54% respectively, p <0.001). The vascular surgery team performed a total number of 584 procedures between February and June 2020 (-17,8% compared to 2018 and 2019), with a significant increase in the number of endovascular procedures (p <0.001) and in the use of local and regional anesthesia (p <0.001), especially in the Angio Suite (+600%, p <0.001). Comparing with 2018 and 2019, the surgical team performed less outpatient procedures in early 2020. We reported a significant increase in the total number of procedures for patients with a chronic limb-threatening ischemia diagnosis (+21%, p <0.001). We did not report significant changes in the proportion of other vascular conditions. Regarding mortality, we observed a 16% decrease in the intraoperative mortality (p 0.67). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we assessed the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in daily activity during the contingency period. During the outbreak, there was an overall decline in outpatient clinics and inpatient admissions. Nevertheless, and despite the restrictions imposed by the pandemic and health authorities, we managed to maintain most procedures for most vascular diseases, particularly for CLTI urgent cases, without a significant increase in the mortality rate. Stringent protective measures for patient and staff or higher use of endovascular techniques and local anesthesia are some of the successful changes implemented in the department. These learned lessons are to be pursued as the pandemic evolves with future outbreaks of COVID-19, such as the current second outbreak currently spreading through Europe.","output":"Lessons learned from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in a Vascular Surgery department and preparation for future outbreaks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The trimeric spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary focus of most vaccine design and development efforts.

To support ongoing vaccine development efforts, we report the structure-based design of soluble S trimers with increased yields and stabilities, based on introduction of single point mutations and disulfide-bridges. We identify regions critical for stability: the heptad repeat region 1, the SD1 domain and position 614 in SD2.

We compared the number of ED visits during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic (March-May 2020) to historical controls (March-May 2015-2019), using Poisson regression, adjusting for site and the underlying baseline trend. Secondary analyses examined variations in ED visits by acuity, disposition, and disease categories. Results: From 2015 to 2019, the two EDs had a median of 1,632 visits per week [interquartile range (IQR) 1,548; 1,703]; in 2020, this number decreased to 536 visits per week [IQR 446; 744].

However, most of the present GDFT protocols based on cardiac output optimization use invasive devices and the protocols may require significant practitioner attention and intervention to apply them accurately. The aim of this prospective pilot study was to evaluate the clinical feasibility of GDFT using a closed-loop fluid administration system with a non-invasive cardiac output monitoring device (Nexfin?, BMEYE, Amsterdam, Netherlands). METHODS Patients scheduled for elective moderate risk surgery under general anaesthesia were enrolled. The primary anaesthesia team managing the case selected GDFT targets using the controller interface and all patients received a baseline 3 ml kg(-1) h(-1) crystalloid infusion. Colloid solutions were delivered by the closed-loop system for intravascular volume expansion using data from the Nexfin? monitor. Compliance with GDFT management was defined as acceptable when a patient spent more than 85% of the surgery time in a preload independent state (defined as pulse pressure variation <13%) or when average cardiac index during surgery was >2.5 litre min(-1) m(-2). RESULTS A total of 13 patients were included in the study group. All patients met the established criteria for delivery of GDFT for greater than 85% of case time.

We selected 40 herbal leads on the basis of their traditional applications. The phytomolecules from these leads were further screened through in-silico molecular docking against two main targets of SARS-CoV-2 i.e. the spike protein (S;structural protein) and the main protease (MPRO;non-structural protein). Out of the selected 40, 12 phytomolecules were able to block or stabilize the major functional sites of the main protease and spike protein. Among these, Ginsenoside, Glycyrrhizic acid, Hespiridin and Tribulosin exhibited high binding energy with both main protease and spike protein. Etoposide showed good binding energy only with Spike protein and Teniposide had high binding energy only with main protease. The above phytocompounds showed promising binding efficiency with target proteins indicating their possible applications against SARS-CoV-2.

College students (n = 498) self-reported their general and source-specific stress mindsets, perceived distress, health, coping, and GPA.

Consistent with previous research, general stress mindsets were associated with health, but some source-specific mindsets were more predictive of health than othersviewing stress from chronic controllable sources as debilitating was most predictive of poor mental and physical health. Measures of stress were also associated with health, and this association was moderated by stress mindsets, suggesting that viewing stress as enhancing can provide a psychological buffer against the negative effects of stress. Approach coping and perceived distress were examined as potential mediators of the links between stress mindset and health. Viewing stress as enhancing was related to greater use of approach coping and lower perceived distress, which in turn was related to better health.

METHODS: A nationally representative sample of 1300 participants &#8805;18 years living in Jordan were selected using stratified random sampling. Data were collected via telephone interviews in this cross-sectional study. Chi-square was used to test age and gender differences according to demographics, economic burden, and health indices (access to healthcare, health insurance, antenatal and reproductive services). A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the beta-coefficient (?) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of factors correlated with mental well-being, assessed by patients' health questionnaire 4 (PHQ-4). RESULTS: 656 (50.5%) men and 644 (49.5%) women completed the interview. Three-fourths of the participants had health insurance during the COVID-19 crisis. There was no significant difference in healthcare coverage or access between women and men (p > 0.05). Half of pregnant women were unable to access antenatal care. Gender was a significant predictor of higher PHQ-4 scores (women vs. men: ?: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.54-1.22). Among women, age &#8805; 60 years and being married were associated with significantly lower PHQ-4 scores.

METHODS We develop a dynamic disease model to assess the effectiveness of face masks in reducing the spread of COVID-19, during an initial outbreak and a later resurgence, as a function of mask effectiveness, coverage, intervention timing, and time horizon. We instantiate the model for the COVID-19 outbreak in New York, with sensitivity analyses on key natural history parameters. RESULTS During the initial epidemic outbreak, with no social distancing, only 100% coverage of masks with high effectiveness can reduce the effective reproductive number Re below 1. During a resurgence, with lowered transmission rates due to social distancing measures, masks with medium effectiveness at 80% coverage can reduce Re below 1 but cannot do so if individuals relax social distancing efforts. Full mask coverage could significantly improve outcomes during a resurgence: with social distancing, masks with at least medium effectiveness could reduce Re below 1 and avert almost all infections, even with intervention fatigue. For coverage levels below 100%, prioritizing masks that reduce the risk of an infected individual from spreading the infection rather than the risk of a susceptible individual from getting infected yields the greatest benefit. LIMITATIONS Data regarding COVID-19 transmission are uncertain, and empirical evidence on mask effectiveness is limited. Our analyses assume homogeneous mixing, providing an upper bound on mask effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS Even moderately effective face masks can play a role in reducing the spread of COVID-19, particularly with full coverage, but should be combined with social distancing measures to reduce Re below 1.[Box: see text].","output":"Effectiveness of Face Masks in Reducing the Spread of COVID-19: A Model-Based Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Trend anomaly detection is the practice of comparing and analyzing current and historical data trends to detect real-time abnormalities in online industrial data-streams.

It is based on calculating the data weight in each window by applying variable weights, while maintaining the method of trend-effective integration accumulation. The new algorithm changes the traditional calculation method of the trend anomaly detection score, which calculates the score in a short window. This algorithm, SNWFDCDS, can detect weak trend abnormalities in the presence of noise interference. Compared with other methods, it has significant advantages. An on-site oil drilling data test shows that this method can significantly reduce delays compared with other methods and can improve the detection accuracy of weak trend anomalies under noise interference.","output":"Research on the Fastest Detection Method for Weak Trends under Noise Interference"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns and mobility restrictions have forced many individuals to work from home, leading to diverse isolation-induced mental health consequences.

The nanofluid is in a cavity inclined at an angle of 45. The MF can take different angles between 0 and 90. Radiative heat transfer is present in the cavity in volumetric form. There are two hot semicircles, similar to two half-pipes, on the bottom wall. The top wall is kept cold. The side walls and parts of the bottom wall, except the pipes, have been insulated. The lattice Boltzmann method has been used for the simulation. The studied parameters are the Rayleigh number (in the range 10(3)C10(6)), magnetic field angle, radiation parameter (in the range 0C2), and nanoparticle volume fraction (in the range 0C5%). The generated entropy has been studied as the NCHT. The results indicate that adding nanoparticles improves heat transfer rate (HTR). Moreover, the addition of volumetric radiation to the cavity enhances the Nusselt number by 54% and the generated entropy by 12.5%. With an augmentation in the MF angle from 0 to 90, HTR decreases and this decrease is observed mostly at higher Rayleigh numbers. An augmentation in the Ra increases NCHT and entropy generation. Indeed, a rise in the Ra from 10(3) to 10(6) increases HTR by almost sixfold.","output":"Lattice Boltzmann-based numerical analysis of nanofluid natural convection in an inclined cavity subject to multiphysics fields"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To summarise specific adverse effects of remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We searched 32 databases through 27 October 2020. We included randomised trials comparing any of the drugs of interest to placebo or standard care, or against each other. We conducted fixed-effects pairwise meta-analysis and assessed the certainty of evidence using the grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation approach. RESULTS: We included 16 randomised trials which enrolled 8152 patients. For most interventions and outcomes the certainty of the evidence was very low to low except for gastrointestinal adverse effects from hydroxychloroquine, which was moderate certainty. Compared with standard care or placebo, low certainty evidence suggests that remdesivir may not have an important effect on acute kidney injury (risk difference (RD) 8 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 27 fewer to 21 more) or cognitive dysfunction/delirium (RD 3 more per 1000, 95% CI 12 fewer to 19 more). Low certainty evidence suggests that hydroxychloroquine may increase the risk of cardiac toxicity (RD 10 more per 1000, 95% CI 0 more to 30 more) and cognitive dysfunction/delirium (RD 33 more per 1000, 95% CI 18 fewer to 84 more), whereas moderate certainty evidence suggests hydroxychloroquine probably increases the risk of diarrhoea (RD 106 more per 1000, 95% CI 48 more to 175 more) and nausea and/or vomiting (RD 62 more per 1000, 95% CI 23 more to 110 more) compared with standard care or placebo. Low certainty evidence suggests lopinavir/ritonavir may increase the risk of diarrhoea (RD 168 more per 1000, 95% CI 58 more to 330 more) and nausea and/or vomiting (RD 160 more per 1000, 95% CI 100 more to 210 more) compared with standard care or placebo. DISCUSSION: Hydroxychloroquine probably increases the risk of diarrhoea and nausea and/or vomiting and may increase the risk of cardiac toxicity and cognitive dysfunction/delirium. Lopinavir/ritonavir may increase the risk of diarrhoea and nausea and/or vomiting. Remdesivir may have no important effect on risk of acute kidney injury or cognitive dysfunction/delirium.

The objective of this study is to measure quality of life of the public during the COVID-19 pandemic and factors affecting it among adults. METHODS: This is a community-based cross-sectional household study with analytic component conducted in an agricultural area in Dakahlia governorate, Egypt and included 500 individuals. Data were collected through a structured interview, and the collected data included socio-demographic characteristics as well as some data related to their habits and comorbidities, their experience with COVID-19 and data about QoL using the COV19-Impact on Quality of Life (COV19-QoL) scale Arabic version, after assessing Content validity and reliability. RESULTS: The total QoL score (mean  standard deviation) is 2.3  0.6 and the score for QoL in general and perception of danger on personal safety show the highest mean with 2.6  0.7. The lowest mean score is related to the perception of mental health deterioration (1.9  0.8). Independent predictors of the total QoL scale are sex (regression coefficient (95% CI) = 0.1 (0.02 to 0.2), p value = 0.02), monthly income (regression coefficient (95% CI) = 0.1 (0.004 to 0.2), p value = 0.04), knowing someone infected with COVID-19 (regression coefficient (95% CI) = 0.15 (0.08 to 0.3), p value = 0.001), and data collection time (regression coefficient (95% CI) = 0.1 (0.006 to 0.2), p value = 0.04).

The efforts for time-series narration hitherto are domain-specific and use predefined templates that offer consistency but lead to mechanical narratives. We present TCube (Time-series-to-text), a domain-agnostic neural framework for time-series narration, that couples the representation of essential time-series elements in the form of a dense knowledge graph and the translation of said knowledge graph into rich and fluent narratives through the transfer-learning capabilities of PLMs (Pre-trained Language Models). TCube's design primarily addresses the challenge that lies in building a neural framework in the complete paucity of annotated training data for time-series. The design incorporates knowledge graphs as an intermediary for the representation of essential time-series elements which can be linearized for textual translation. To the best of our knowledge, TCube is the first investigation of the use of neural strategies for time-series narration. Through extensive evaluations, we show that TCube can improve the lexical diversity of the generated narratives by up to 65.38% while still maintaining grammatical integrity. The practicality and deployability of TCube is further validated through an expert review (n=21) where 76.2% of participating experts wary of auto-generated narratives favored TCube as a deployable system for time-series narration due to its richer narratives.

METHODS: In our multicenter study, 543 patients with confirmed COVID\\\\19 were classified as Non\\\\severe group and Severe group, and then were compared respectively for all\\\\cause mortality and length of hospital stay between those who received corticosteroids and not. By searching in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and CNKI, we identified 13 retrospective studies and 6 random control trials eligible for criteria of inclusion, and conducted comprehensive meta\\\\analyses assessing the impacts of corticosteroids on mortality, length of stay, duration of RNA clearance and duration of fever. RESULTS: Our multicenter study demonstrated that low\\\\dose corticosteroids can reduce mortality in the multivariable Cox regression analysis for severe patients(p=0.03), while presented no influence in univariable analysis for non\\\\severe patients(p=0.14). From multivariable analyses, patients with corticosteroids in non\\\\severe group had longer duration of hospitalization(p=0.003), but did not in severe group(p=0.18).

A literature search across PubMed and internet was conducted. A number of studies dealing with COVID-19 were identified.

Several studies conducted on different age groups from different countries have reported a decrease in the frequency of hospital visits during the pandemic. Aim This study aimed to assess the self-reported effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospital visits and healthcare outcomes in the pediatric age group. We further aimed to assess the participants beliefs on the reasons for decreased frequency of hospital visits during the pandemic. Methods This was a quantitative analytical cross-sectional study. Data from the parents of children less than 14 years living in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) was collected using a self-administered structured questionnaire. The questionnaire included sociodemographic characteristics of the participants, self-reported frequency of hospital visits, and potential consequences on pediatric care outcomes during the pandemic. A total of 1,548 initial respondents filled the questionnaire, out of which only 1,311 had children aged less than 14 years. SPSS version 25 (IBM, New York, USA) was used for statistical analysis. Results We found that of the 1,311 eligible respondents, majority (75.1%) were mothers of the children while only 24.9% were fathers, and 34.4% of the respondents had two children less than 14 years. Majority (76.7%) of the respondents were from the central region and felt that the pandemic has reduced their frequency of hospital visits. Furthermore, majority (78.6%) of the respondents believed that the decreased hospital (emergency or clinic) visits did not have any negative effect on the health and care of their children. Moreover, 56.4% of the participants responded that lack of the need to visit the hospital during the pandemic was the reason for their decreased hospital visits frequency, and 51.6% were afraid of being infected by the virus. There was a significant association between decreased hospital visits and missing an appointment for vaccination, delayed diagnosis, deterioration of participants childrens condition, and running out of treatment and inability to refill. Conclusion This study was conducted to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospital visits and pediatric care outcomes in the KSA. We hypothesized that the pandemic has led to a reduction in pediatric hospital visits which might influence pediatric care outcomes. We found that there was a decrease in the frequency of hospital visits. This decrease was attributed to the lack of the need to go to the hospital or to the fear of being infected by the virus. A significant association was found between the participants beliefs of the pandemic effect on hospital visits and its effect on the pediatric care outcomes.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on the Self-Reported Frequency of Hospital Visits and Pediatric Care Outcomes in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lions (Panthera leo) in Africa have lost nearly half their population in just the last two decades, and effective management of the protected areas (PAs) where lions live will cost an estimated USD >$1 B/year in new funding. We explore the potential for launching a fire management and habitat restoration carbon-financing program to help fill this PA management funding gap. We demonstrate how introducing early dry season fire management programs could produce potential carbon revenues (PCR) from either a single carbon-financing method (avoided emissions) or from multiple sequestration methods of USD $59.6-$655.9 M/year (at USD $5/ton) or USD $155.0 MC$1.7 B/year (at USD $13/ton). We highlight variable but significant PCR for PAs with the greatest potential for restoring lion numbers between USD $1.5C$44.4 M per PA. We suggest investing in lion-centric fire management programs to jump-start the United Nations Decade of Ecological Restoration and help preserve African lions across their range. SCIENCE FOR SOCIETY The United Nations recently launched the Decade of Ecological Restoration in response to planet-wide land degradation. This study analyses the potential for savanna fire management programs to restore fire regimes that can generate new sources of revenue from carbon financing for chronically under-funded protected areas in Africa with lions, as lions are a key indicator of savanna ecosystem health. We estimated the amount of carbon saved by shifting fires that normally burn in the late dry season (and emit more carbon) to the early dry season (that accrue more carbon in the soil and woody vegetation). Based on current carbon market values we found substantial potential to eliminate or significantly reduce the $>1B annual funding gap needed to save the lion from extinction. Given additional benefits for nature and people from new savanna fire programs, we recommend integrated conservation and development projects direct more funding to some of the least developed countries with high biodiversity and support fire management programs in Africa.","output":"A burning question: Can savannah fire management generate enough carbon revenue to help save the lion from extinction?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"London was at the forefront of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, with an exponential rise in hospital admissions from March 2020 This case study appraises the impact on and response of a hospital palliative care service based in a large inner-city teaching hospital Referrals increased from a mean of 39 to 75 per week;deaths from 13 to 52 per week Multiple actions were taken by the team to manage the surge in referrals, which have been categorised based on the 4S model: systems, space, stuff and staff Several lessons are highlighted: need for flexible and responsive staffing over the 7-day week;implementing clear, accessible clinical guidance supported by ward-based teaching;benefits of integrating clinical practice with research;and the importance of maintaining team well-being and camaraderie to sustain change Further evaluation is needed of the differential impact of changes made to inform service planning for future pandemics","output":"The impact of and response to the COVID-19 pandemic on a hospital palliative care team"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To determine the distribution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) respiratory viral loads (VL) during the acute phase of infection and their correlation with clinical presentation and inflammation-related biomarkers.

A drawback of this approach is that the PCR-confirmed cases used to estimate the sensitivity of the threshold may not be representative of cases in the wider populatione.g., they may be more recently infected and more severely symptomatic. Mixture modelling offers an alternative approach that does not require external data from PCR-confirmed cases.

Material and Method: We conducted a prospective observational study based on a structured questionnaire that included 30 items for investigating multiple aspects regarding the dietary habits in the context of the pandemic, quarantine and social isolation imposed by the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. The questionnaire was disseminated on various online platforms accessible from any device with an internet connection in Romania, on social media groups between January and March 2021. The questionnaire was made online, using the Google Forms platform, this method being very useful for carrying out the proposed evaluation, as it facilitated the national dissemination of the evaluation questionnaire.

A decrease in the conservation of epitopes with time was observed in almost all proteins, which was more rapid in neutralizing epitopes. Delta variant still has the highest PIEM in the circulating strains, which pose threat to the effectiveness of current vaccines.

In its real-time, fluorescence-based usage (RT-qPCR), it has long been a core technology driving the accurate, rapid and sensitive laboratory diagnosis of infectious diseases. However, RT-qPCR protocols have changed little over the past 30 years, with the RT step constituting a significant percentage of the time taken to complete a typical RT-qPCR assay. When applied to research investigations, reverse transcription has been evaluated by criteria such as maximum yield, length of transcription, fidelity, and faithful representation of an RNA pool. Crucially, however, these are of less relevance in a diagnostic RT-PCR test, where speed and sensitivity are the prime RT imperatives, with specificity contributed by the PCR component. We propose a paradigm shift that omits the requirement for a separate high-temperature RT step at the beginning of an RT-qPCR assay. This is achieved by means of an innovative protocol that incorporates suitable reagents with a revised primer and amplicon design and we demonstrate a proof of principle that incorporates the RT step as part of the PCR assay setup at room temperature. Use of this modification as part of a diagnostic assay will of course require additional characterisation, validation and optimisation of the PCR step.

Secondary outcomes are as follows: stress/depression/illness perception/self-efficacy/general health/quality of life/physical activity/global perceived effect. We used linear mixed models for continuous outcomes and logistic generalized estimating equation for binary outcomes. Analyses were stratified to assess effect modification, whereas control (n = 229) and intervention (n = 232) groups were pooled in analyses of outcome trajectories. RESULTS: Baseline multimorbidity and co-occurring musculoskeletal pain sites did not modify the effect of the selfBACK app. The effect was somewhat stronger in people with multimorbidity than among those with LBP only (difference in RMDQ due to interaction, ? 0.9[95 % CI ? 2.5 to 0.6]). Participants with a greater number of long-term conditions and more co-occurring musculoskeletal pain had higher levels of baseline disability (RMDQ 11.3 for  2 long-term conditions vs 9.5 for LBP only; 11.3 for  4 musculoskeletal pain sites vs 10.2 for  1 additional musculoskeletal pain site); along with higher baseline scores for stress/depression/illness perception and poorer pain self-efficacy/general health ratings. In the pooled sample, LBP-related disability improved slightly less over time for people with  2 long-term conditions additional to LBP compared to no multimorbidity and for those with 4 co-occurring musculoskeletal pain sites compared to  1 additional musculoskeletal pain site (difference in mean change at 9 months = 1.5 and 2.2, respectively). All groups reported little improvement in secondary outcomes over time. CONCLUSIONS: Multimorbidity or co-occurring musculoskeletal pain does not modify the effect of the selfBACK app on LBP-related disability or other secondary outcomes. Although people with these health problems have worse scores both at baseline and 9 months, the AI-based selfBACK app appears to be helpful for those with multimorbidity or co-occurring musculoskeletal pain.

Children with special health care needs may have behavioral factors, medical complexities, and/or intellectual disabilities which influence their ability to cooperate for dental treatment. They may have elevated dental fear and anxiety which may not be alleviated with basic behavior guidance strategies alone. The option to offer inhalational nitrous oxide provides an adjunctive method to help reduce a child's pain and anxiety during dental treatment. Inhalational nitrous oxide can be simply administered via a well-fitting nasal hood. Based on the underlying medical condition of the child, it may be necessary to monitor oxygen saturation with pulse oximetry. Administration of 100% oxygen preoperatively and upon completion of treatment is an essential step applicable to all the patients. Children recover quickly from the effects of nitrous oxide after post-treatment oxygenation and can be discharged to the parent without any residual effects.

Patients with advanced cancer commonly visit the emergency department(ED) at the end of life (EoL). Recognition of patients with limited life expectancies and PC needs may improve the EoL trajectory of these patients. Our objective was to characterize ED visits of cancer patients at the EoL by examining the patterns of ED visits in PR using the PR Central Cancer Registry-Health Insurance Linkage Database (PRCCR-HILD). METHODS The cohort consisted of patients aged 18 years with a primary invasive that died between 2011- 2017, with a recorded date of death, and who had insurance claims during their last three months. EoL indicators were ED visits, ED death, and hospice care use. RESULTS The study cohort included 10,755 cancer patients. 49.6% had 1 ED visit, 20.3% had 2 ED visits, and 9.7% died in the ED. In the adjusted model, female patients (aOR 0.80; 95% CI 0.68-0.93; p-value < 0.01), patients aged 80 years (aOR 0.47; 95% CI 0.36-0.63; p-value < 0.01), being enrolled in Medicare (aOR 0.74; 95% CI 0.61-0.90; p-value < 0.01) or being enrolled in Medicaid/Medicare (aOR 0.76; 95% CI 0.62-0.93; p-value = 0.01) were less likely to have an ED visit the date of death.

METHODS: This was a 1-year observational study, as a continuation of the previous 3 months prospective study of pediatric patients with T1D conducted at Sidra Medicine in Qatar. The study enrolled individuals aged 7C18 years with T1D > 1 year, on MDI with self-monitoring of blood glucose or continuous glucose monitoring, with no prior pump experience, and with an HbA1c level < 12.5% (< 113 mmol/mol). After the first 3 months of HCL use, patients were followed at 6, 9 and 12 months, where HbA1c was obtained and pump data were collected. RESULTS: All 30 participants (age 10.24  2.6 years) who initiated HCL completed 12 months of HCL system use in Auto Mode. The participants used the sensor 88.4  6.5% of the time with Auto Mode usage 85.6  7.4% during 12 months of HCL system use.

Here, we compared the SARS-CoV-2 consensus genomes obtained from the Oxford Nanopore Technology GridION and the Illumina MiSeq for 28 sequencing runs. RESULTS: Our results show that the MiSeq had a significantly higher number of consensus genomes classified by Nextclade as good and mediocre compared to the GridION. The MiSeq also had a significantly higher genome coverage and mutation counts than the GridION. CONCLUSION: Due to the low genome coverage, high number of indels, and sensitivity to SARS-CoV-2 viral load noted with the GridION when compared to MiSeq, we can conclude that the MiSeq is more favourable for SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance, as successful genomic surveillance is dependent on high quality, near-whole consensus genomes.","output":"Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing using the ONT GridION and the Illumina MiSeq"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We read with interest the short paper describing, and commend the authors on sharing their experience the continued use of phototherapy in COVID-19 affected Italy.

Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mice were established, and depression-like behaviors were confirmed using the forced swimming test (FST), sucrose preference test (SPT), and the tail suspension test (TST). Next, the expression of miR-212 and its potential target, i.e., nuclear factor I-A (NFIA), was verified using quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR analysis and Western blotting in CUMS mice. The effects of miR-212 and NFIA on depression-like behaviors, inflammatory response, and neuronal apoptosis were examined using FST, TST, SPT, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay, and flow cytometry analysis. Finally, the relationship between miR-212 and NFIA was examined using a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Based on our findings, miR-212 was significantly upregulated, while NFIA was downregulated in CUMS mice. miR-212 overexpression could suppress the CUMS-induced weight loss, immobility time in FST and TST, and increased hippocampal neuronal apoptosis and pro-inflammatory cytokines levels. In addition, NFIA upregulation could partially reverse the effects of miR-212 mimic in CUMS mice. Accordingly, miR-212 could ameliorate CUMS-induced depression-like behavior in mice by targeting NFIA, indicating its protective role in depression.","output":"Expression and role of microRNA-212/nuclear factor I-A in depressive mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We interviewed Gabi via Skype on February 3, 2020.

Liquid infiltration of the preperitoneal space can help facilitate dissection and avoid inadvertent injuries. We describe a novel technique for TAPP inguinal hernia repair using liquid-injection for preperitoneal [corrected] dissection and report our initial experience. METHODS TAPP inguinal hernia repair using a liquid-injection technique during preperitoneal dissection was performed by a single surgical resident without prior TAPP repair experience from July 2013 to January 2014. After trocar placement, 60 mL of 0.3 % lidocaine with 1:300,000 dilution of epinephrine was injected percutaneously using a blunt needle under laparoscopic visualization into the preperitoneal space to assist with the dissection and parietalization of the vas deferens, spermatic vessels, and epigastric vessels. The initial peritoneal incision is performed at the lateral side of the inguinal canal, followed by blunt dissection of the preperitoneal space. RESULTS Eleven patients (median age: 69; 8 male) with a total of 12 inguinal hernias underwent a TAPP repair using a liquid-injection preperitoneal dissection technique. Ten patients had unilateral hernias (4 indirect, 6 direct), and one patient had bilateral direct hernias. The median operative time, median injection time, and median dissection time were 116, 3.5, and 42 min, respectively. Estimated blood loss was less than 10 mL for all cases. No intraoperative injuries, conversions to open repair, or 30-day postoperative complications occurred. There were no hernia recurrences after a median follow-up of 143 days. CONCLUSION Our preliminary experience suggests that liquid-injection to assist preperitoneal dissection during TAPP inguinal hernia repair appears to be safe and feasible. This novel method facilitates the dissection of spermatic cord structures, and can be used to minimize trauma to surrounding structures, especially when performed by trainees with limited operative experience.","output":"Liquid-injection for preperitoneal dissection of transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) inguinal [corrected] hernia repair."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"No consensus exists regarding the definition of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in neonates and reliability of chest X-ray (CXR) is low.

Between March 25, 2018, and May 25, 2019, infants with VAP were identified. Clinical, laboratory and microbiology data were collected. CXRs and LU scans were reviewed. A multiparameter VAP score, including LU, was calculated on Day 1 and Day 3 for infants with VAP and for a control group and compared with CXR. VAP incidence was 10.47 episodes/1000 ventilator days. LU and CXR were available for 31 episodes in 21 infants with VAP, and for six episodes in five patients without VAP. On Day 1, a VAP score of > 4, and on Day 3 a score of > 5 showed sensitivity of 0.94, and area under the curve of 0.91 and 0.97, respectively.

All samples were analyzed on MAGLUMI(TM) 800 platform. RESULTS: All COVID\\\\19 free samples had Ab levels below the cut\\\\off values. Hence, the diagnostic specificity was estimated at 100% (95%CI= 96.3\\\\100.0; PPV= 100%). By the 18(th) day from the onset of symptoms we reached to an optimal diagnostic sensitivity (more than 95.0 %) In fact, the diagnostic sensitivity increased over time and between 15 to 25 days after symptoms onset, reached to 95.5% (95% CI= 84.9\\\\99.2). CONCLUSION: The new automated CLIA analyzer appeared to be a robust and reliable method to measure specific Ab against COVID\\\\19 at a high throughput. Our data suggest that combining Ab and nucleic acid detection could increase the diagnostic sensitivity. This article is protected by copyright.

Autonomous and non-autonomous generalizations of SIR for interacting regions are also considered, including non-separability for two or more interacting regions. A reduction of simple SIR models to one variable leads us to a generalized logistic model, Richards model, which we use to fit Mexicos COVID-19 data up to day number 134. Forecasting scenarios resulting from various fittings are discussed. A critique to the applicability of these models to current pandemic outbreaks in terms of robustness is provided.

This retrospective study aimed to compare the early and late outcomes of D1-AAD and D2-AAD through a propensity score-matched analysis. METHODS: Between January 2009 and April 2020, 599 consecutive patients underwent ATAAD repair at our institution, and were dichotomized into D1 (n = 543; 90.7%) and D2 (n = 56; 9.3%) groups. Propensity scoring was performed with a 1:1 ratio, resulting in a matched cohort of 56 patients per group. The clinical features, postoperative complications, 5-year cumulative survival and freedom from reoperation rates were compared. RESULTS: In the overall cohort, the D1 group had a lower rate of preoperative shock and more aortic arch replacement with longer cardiopulmonary bypass time. The D1 group had a higher in-hospital mortality rate than the D2 group in overall (15.8% vs 5.4%; P = 0.036) and matched cohorts (19.6% vs 5.4%; P = 0.022). For patients that survived to discharge, the D1 and D2 groups demonstrated similar 5-year survival rates in overall (77.0% vs 85.2%; P = 0.378) and matched cohorts (79.1% vs 85.2%; P = 0.425). The 5-year freedom from reoperation rates for D1 and D2 groups were 80.0% and 97.1% in overall cohort (P = 0.011), and 93.6% and 97.1% in matched cohort (P = 0.474), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with D1-AAD had a higher risk of in-hospital mortality than those with D2-AAD.

Reoperations are not uncommon but have been associated with higher rates of complications and lower extents of resection. So radiation is often offered as an alternative to reoperation. The endonasal endoscopic transsphenoidal approach has been used in recent years for craniopharyngiomas previously removed with craniotomy. The impact of this approach on reoperations has not been widely investigated. METHODS The authors reviewed a prospectively acquired database of endonasal endoscopic resections of craniopharyngiomas over 11 years at Weill Cornell Medical College, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, performed by the senior authors. Reoperations were separated from first operations. Pre- and postoperative visual and endocrine function, tumor size, body mass index (BMI), quality of life (QOL), extent of resection (EOR), impact of prior radiation, and complications were compared between groups. EOR was divided into gross-total resection (GTR, 100%), near-total resection (NTR, > 95%), and subtotal resection (STR, < 95%). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS Of the total 57 endonasal surgical procedures, 22 (39%) were reoperations. First-time operations and reoperations did not differ in tumor volume, radiological configuration, or patients' BMI. Hypopituitarism and diabetes insipidus (DI) were more common before reoperations (82% and 55%, respectively) compared with first operations (60% and 8.6%, respectively; p < 0.001). For the 46 patients in whom GTR was intended, rates of GTR and GTR+NTR were not significantly different between first operations (90% and 97%, respectively) and reoperations (80% and 100%, respectively). For reoperations, prior radiation and larger tumor volume had lower rates of GTR. Vision improved equally in first operations (80%) compared with reoperations (73%). New anterior pituitary deficits were more common in first operations compared with reoperations (51% vs 23%, respectively; p = 0.08), while new DI was more common in reoperations compared with first-time operations (80% vs 47%, respectively; p = 0.08). Nonendocrine complications occurred in 2 (3.6%) first-time operations and no reoperations. Tumor regrowth occurred in 6 patients (11%) over a median follow-up of 46 months and was not different between first versus reoperations, but was associated with STR (33%) compared with GTR+NTR (4%; p = 0.02) and with not receiving radiation after STR (67% vs 22%; p = 0.08). The overall BMI increased significantly from 28.7 to 34.8 kg/m2 over 10 years. Six months after surgery, there was a significant improvement in QOL, which was similar between first-time operations and reoperations, and negatively correlated with STR. CONCLUSIONS Endonasal endoscopic transsphenoidal reoperation results in similar EOR, visual outcome, and improvement in QOL as first-time operations, with no significant increase in complications. EOR is more impacted by tumor volume and prior radiation. Reoperations should be offered to patients with recurrent craniopharyngiomas and may be preferable to radiation in patients in whom GTR or NTR can be achieved.","output":"Endonasal endoscopic reoperation for residual or recurrent craniopharyngiomas."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viroporins, integral viral membrane ion channel proteins, interact with host-cell proteins deregulating physiological processes and activating inflammasomes. Severity of COVID-19 might be associated with hyperinflammation, thus we aimed at the complete immunoinformatic analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 viroporin E, P0DTC4. We also identified the human proteins interacting with P0DTC4 and the enriched molecular functions of the corresponding genes. The complete sequence of P0DTC4 in FASTA format was processed in 10 databases relative to secondary and tertiary protein structure analyses and prediction of optimal vaccine epitopes. Three more databases were accessed for the retrieval and the molecular functional characterization of the P0DTC4 human interactors. The immunoinformatics analysis resulted in the identification of 4 discontinuous B-cell epitopes along with 1 linear B-cell epitope and 11 T-cell epitopes which were found to be antigenic, immunogenic, nonallergen, nontoxin, and unable to induce autoimmunity thus fulfilling prerequisites for vaccine design. The functional enrichment analysis showed that the predicted host interactors of P0DTC4 target the cellular acetylation network. Two of the identified host-cell proteins C BRD2 and BRD4 C have been shown to be promising targets for antiviral therapy. Thus, our findings have implications for COVID-19 therapy and indicate that viroporin E could serve as a promising vaccine target against SARS-CoV-2.

Such a layer plays a key role in maintaining the proper lung functionality. It acts as a barrier against inhaled particles and pathogens, including viruses, and may represent an important entry point for drugs delivered via aerosols. Understanding the physicochemical properties of PS is therefore of importance for the comprehension of pathophysiological mechanisms affecting the respiratory system. That can be of particular relevance for supporting the development of novel therapeutic interventions against COVID-19Cinduced acute respiratory distress syndrome. Owing to the complexity of the in vivo alveolar lining layer, several in vitro methodologies have been developed to investigate the functional and structural properties of PS films or interfacial films made by major constituents of the natural PS. As breathing is a highly dynamic interfacial process, most applied methodologies for studying PSs need to be capable of dynamic measurements, including the study of interfacial dilational rheology. We provide here a review of the most frequently and successfully applied methodologies that have proven to be excellent tools for understanding the biophysics of the PS and of its role in the respiratory mechanics.

This meta-analysis aims to systematically compare the diagnostic performance of different clinical specimen collection methods. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we systematically searched PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, medRxiv, bioRxiv, SSRN, and Research Square from Jan 1, 2000, to Nov 16, 2020. We included original clinical studies that examined the performance of nasopharyngeal swabs and any additional respiratory specimens for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection among individuals presenting in ambulatory care. Studies without data on paired samples, or those that only examined different samples from confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases were not useful for examining diagnostic performance of a test and were excluded. Diagnostic performance, including sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value, was examined using random effects models and double arcsine transformation. FINDINGS: Of the 5577 studies identified in our search, 23 studies including 7973 participants with 16 762 respiratory samples were included. Respiratory specimens examined in these studies included 7973 nasopharyngeal swabs, 1622 nasal swabs, 6110 saliva samples, 338 throat swabs, and 719 pooled nasal and throat swabs. Using nasopharyngeal swabs as the gold standard, pooled nasal and throat swabs gave the highest sensitivity of 97% (95% CI 93-100), whereas lower sensitivities were achieved by saliva (85%, 75-93) and nasal swabs (86%, 77-93) and a much lower sensitivity by throat swabs (68%, 35-94). A comparably high positive predictive value was obtained by pooled nasal and throat (97%, 90-100) and nasal swabs (96%, 87-100) and a slightly lower positive predictive value by saliva (93%, 88-97). Throat swabs have the lowest positive predictive value of 75% (95% CI 45-96). Comparably high specificities (range 97-99%) and negative predictive value (range 95-99%) were observed among different clinical specimens. Comparison between health-care-worker collection and self-collection for pooled nasal and throat swabs and nasal swabs showed comparable diagnostic performance. No significant heterogeneity was observed in the analysis of pooled nasal and throat swabs and throat swabs, whereas moderate to substantial heterogeneity (I2 &#8805;30%) was observed in studies on saliva and nasal swabs. INTERPRETATION: Our review suggests that, compared with the gold standard of nasopharyngeal swabs, pooled nasal and throat swabs offered the best diagnostic performance of the alternative sampling approaches for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in ambulatory care. Saliva and nasal swabs gave comparable and very good diagnostic performance and are clinically acceptable alternative specimen collection methods. Throat swabs gave a much lower sensitivity and positive predictive value and should not be recommended. Self-collection for pooled nasal and throat swabs and nasal swabs was not associated with any significant impairment of diagnostic accuracy. Our results also provide a useful reference framework for the proper interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 testing results using different clinical specimens.

We utilized Piecewise Aggregate Approximation, Similarity based Merging and clustering to evaluate the impact of the different hemostatic nanoparticles administered. In some cases the fluctuations in the cytokines may be too small. So in addition we highlight situations where temporal modelling that produces a smoothed time series may not be useful as it may remove out the noise and miss the overall fluctuations resulting from the nanoparticles.

Individuals with pre-existing conditions are particularly susceptible to and more likely to die from Covid-19. However, individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are unique due to their use of antiretroviral therapy, including protease inhibitors, which have been used to treat COVID-19. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis exploring the prevalence and prevalence of HIV in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and delineating the mortality rates. METHODS: MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and Cochrane Library databases and medrxiv.org were searched from January 1st, 2020, to June 15th, 2020. Studies reporting on the prevalence of HIV among hospitalized COVID-19 patients among and outcome of mortality were extracted. Two reviewers independently extracted appropriate data of interest and assessed the risk of bias. All analyses were performed using random-effects models on log-transformed proportions and risk ratio estimates, and heterogeneity was quantified. RESULTS: A total of 144,795 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were identified from 14 studies (United States 8, Spain 3, China 1, Italy1, and Germany 1). The pooled prevalence of HIV in COVID-19 patients was 1.22 % [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.61%-2.43%)] translating to a 2-fold increase compared to the respective local-level pooled HIV prevalence in the general population of 0.65% (95% CI: 0.48%-0.89%.

The primary endpoint for this cohort is relapse-free survival (RFS) time defined as either time to disease progression or death whichever happened first. The maximum planned sample size is 40. Results: As of June 2020, 22 pts were enrolled;M/F, 12/10, median age, 62 (range 18 to74). Of 11 AML pts., ELN risk category was adverse in 8, intermediate in 2 and favorable in 1. Of 11 MDS pts, 6 had poor/very poor and 4 good and 1 intermediate risk cytogenetic abnormalities by revised-IPSS. Of 22, 6 were in complete remission with count recovery at transplant. Median time to initiation of first cycle of maintenance with SGI-110 was 59.5 days (range, 43 to 114 days). So far, 14 pts of 22 were taken off the study;6 due to disease relapse, 4 completed planned 12 cycles of treatment, 1 lost insurance, 1 withdrew the consent, 1 had travel issues due to COVID19 pandemic and 1 had pulmonary complications unrelated to study drug. Currently, 8 remain to be on the study. Median number of treatment cycles administered have been 4 (range, 1 to 12). Of 22, 7 pts. required the SGI-110 dose to be reduced down to 20 mg/m2/dayX5 days and 1 patient to 20 mg/m2/dayX3 days to be able to continue the treatment. At a median follow-up of 13.1 months for survivors (n=17), RFS and overall survival at 1-year was 66.3% (95% confidence interval (CI)=42% to 82.3%) and 88.9% (95%CI=61.8 to 92.2%) respectively (Figure) During the study, 353 AEs observed with 125 cycles of SGI-110 treatments. Of 353, 287 (81.3%) were attributable to SGI-110 and 133 of 287 (46.3%) were grade 3 or higher in severity. Most of the grade 3 or higher AEs were related with bone marrow suppression;71 (25%) thrombocytopenia, 64 (22%) neutropenia, 67 (23%) leukopenia and 8 (2%) anemia. Of 22 pts, 15 had grade 4 neutropenia at least once and 8 pts grade 4 thrombocytopenia. There was 18 episodes of infectious AEs and 11 of 18 were grade 3-4. There were no gra e 5 AEs observed attributable to study drug. Conclusion: SGI-110 led to frequent grade 3-4 BM suppression in high risk AML/MDS pts when given as maintenance therapy after allo-SCT. However, bone marrow suppression was not associated with increased risk of infection and it was temporary with count recovery. The efficacy of SGI-110 has been promising with 1-year RFS of 66.3%.

As an RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2 has a high mutation rate due to the low fidelity of RNA polymerase. To study the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, 158 SNPs with high confidence were identified by deep meta-transcriptomic sequencing, and the most common SNP type was C > T. Analyses of intra-host population diversity revealed that intra-host quasispecies' composition varies with time during the early onset of symptoms, which implicates viral evolution during infection. Network analysis of co-occurring SNPs revealed the most abundant non-synonymous SNP 22,638 in the S glycoprotein RBD region and 28,144 in the ORF8 region. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 variations differ in an individual's respiratory tissue (nose, throat, BALF, or sputum), suggesting independent compartmentalization of SARS-CoV-2 populations in patients. The positive selection analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome uncovered the positive selected amino acid G251V on ORF3a. Alternative allele frequency spectrum (AAFS) of all variants revealed that ORF8 could bear alternate alleles with high frequency.

Method: Data were from the national Understanding American Study, a probability-based Internet panel weighted to represent the U.S. population. Subjects (N=5874; 51% female) were adults, 18 years and older, who completed a March survey (wave 1) and a follow-up survey one month later (wave 3). Analyses assessed the relationship of social media use at wave 1 with wave 3 alcohol use, accounting for wave 1 alcohol use and the socio-demographic characteristics of the sample. We examined the effect of working or studying from home as a moderator. Results: Twitter and Instagram users, but not Facebook users, drank more frequently at wave 3 than non-users. For Instagram users, more frequent alcohol use at wave 3 was at least partially attributed to the frequency of drinking at wave 1. The interaction between Twitter use and working or studying from home was statistically significant. The combination of being on Twitter and working or studying from home was associated with drinking more days a week. Conclusions: Exposure to content about COVID-19 and increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic may contribute to more frequent alcohol use for some social media users, especially those sheltering at home. The study of public health messaging via social media to change alcohol use behaviors during traumatic events is warranted.","output":"At home and online during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic and the relationship to alcohol consumption in a national sample of U.S. adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inspired by the need to understand the genomic aspects of COVID-19, the Viral Conceptual Model captures and represents the sequencing of viruses.

Evaluation of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) antioxidant, tyrosinase, elastase, and biofilm inhibition, antibacterial and antiviral activities as well as evaluation of cytotoxicity were realized for each extract. Total phenolic content was measured for extract characterization, and solid-phase extraction was useful to purify the enzymatic extract. Soluble total phenolic content of S. muticum Viscozyme extract was highest with 6.4% of dry weight. Enzymatic Celluclast and Viscozyme extracts had the lowest value of DPPH IC(50) indicating a strong antiradical activity, 0.6 mg mL(?1), in comparison with other enzymes. The ferric reducing antioxidant power ranged between 48.7 M Fe(2+) Eq, digested with Viscozyme, and 60.8 M Fe(2+) Eq, digested with Amyloglucosidase. Tyrosinase inhibition activity of S. muticum Neutrase extract was 41.3% higher compared to other enzymes. Elastase inhibition activity of S. muticum Shearzyme extract had highest activity (32.8%). All enzymatic extracts showed no cytotoxic effect towards the kidney Vero cells. Meanwhile, only S. muticum Neutrase and Alcalase extracts exhibited potential antiviral activity.

We aimed to quantify the contribution of the sales of hand hygiene products and the number of international and domestic airline passenger arrivals on HRSV epidemic in Japan. METHODS: The monthly number of HRSV cases per sentinel site (HRSV activity) in 2020 was compared with the average of the corresponding period in the previous 6 years (from January 2014 to December 2020) using a monthly paired t-test. A generalized linear gamma regression model was used to regress the time-series of the monthly HRSV activity against NPI indicators, including sale of hand hygiene products and the number of domestic and international airline passengers, while controlling for meteorological conditions (monthly average temperature and relative humidity) and seasonal variations between years (2014C2020). RESULTS: The average number of monthly HRSV case notifications in 2020 decreased by approximately 85% (p < 0.001) compared to those in the preceding 6 years (2014C2019). For every average 1 billion (approximately 680,000/$9,000,000) spent on hand hygiene products during the current month and 1 month before there was a 0.29% (p = 0.003) decrease in HRSV infections. An increase of average 1000 domestic and international airline passenger arrivals during the previous 1C2 months was associated with a 3.8  10(? 4)% (p < 0.001) and 1.2  10(? 3)% (p < 0.001) increase in the monthly number of HRSV infections, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that there is an association between the decrease in the monthly number of HRSV cases and improved hygiene and sanitary measures and travel restrictions for COVID-19 in Japan, indicating that these public health interventions can contribute to the suppression of HRSV activity.

Early diagnosis of VAP is important to provide appropriate treatment and reduce mortality. Developing a noninvasive and highly accurate diagnostic method is important. The invention of electronic sensors has been applied to analyze the volatile organic compounds in breath to detect VAP using a machine learning technique. However, the process of building an algorithm is usually unclear and prevents physicians from applying the artificial intelligence technique in clinical practice. Clear processes of model building and assessing accuracy are warranted. The objective of this study was to develop a breath test for VAP with a standardized protocol for a machine learning technique. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study. This study enrolled subjects in an intensive care unit of a hospital in southern Taiwan from February 2017 to June 2019. We recruited patients with VAP as the case group and ventilated patients without pneumonia as the control group. We collected exhaled breath and analyzed the electric resistance changes of 32 sensor arrays of an electronic nose. We split the data into a set for training algorithms and a set for testing. We applied eight machine learning algorithms to build prediction models, improving model performance and providing an estimated diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS: A total of 33 cases and 26 controls were used in the final analysis. Using eight machine learning algorithms, the mean accuracy in the testing set was 0.81  0.04, the sensitivity was 0.79  0.08, the specificity was 0.83  0.00, the positive predictive value was 0.85  0.02, the negative predictive value was 0.77  0.06, and the area under the receiver operator characteristic curves was 0.85  0.04.

This meta-analysis assessed procedural outcomes of such interventions to elucidate the rate of early procedural failures and the need for such specialty devices. MATERIALS AND METHODS MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for contemporary studies (2000-2012) reporting procedural or short-term outcomes for revascularization of infrapopliteal atherosclerotic lesions. A random-effects metaanalysis was performed, which included post hoc comparisons among treatment groups. RESULTS A total of 42 studies with 52 treatment arms representing 3,660 unique patients were included. Technical success rates were higher with bare metal stents (BMSs; 98.6%) than with atherectomy (92.2%; P < .05) or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA; 91.2%; P = .01), and higher with drug-eluting stents (DESs) than with PTA (P < .001). DES use had higher primary patency rates than atherectomy (P < .05), BMS use (P < .001), and PTA (P < .01). The 30-day rate of target lesion revascularization was significantly higher with PTA (8.1%) than with BMSs (2.2%; P < .05) and DESs (1.1%; P < .05). Thirty-day rates of major unplanned amputation (range, 1.5%-4.4%) and mortality (range, 0.9%-3.3%) were comparable among treatment groups. Significant heterogeneity among studies was noted for most PTA outcomes. Publication bias was evident for most PTA and DES outcomes.

Their appearance in the industrial facilities using bacteria to produce active compounds (e.g., drugs, food, cosmetics, etc.) causes considerable financial losses. Instances of bacteriophage resistance towards disinfectants and decontamination procedures (such as thermal inactivation and photocatalysis) have been reported. There is a pressing need to explore new ways of phage inactivation that are environmentally neutral, inexpensive, and more efficient. Here, we study the effect of zero-valent iron nanoparticles (nZVI) on four different bacteriophages (T4, T7, MS2, M13). The reduction of plaque-forming units (PFU) per mL varies from greater than 7log to around 0.5log depending on bacteriophages (M13 and T7, respectively). A comparison of the importance of oxidation of nZVI versus the release of Fe(2+)/Fe(3+) ions is shown. The mechanism of action is proposed in connection to redox reactions, adsorption of virions on nZVI, and the effect of released iron ions.

The fQRS angle can predict mortality due to myocarditis, ischaemic and non-ischaemic cardiomyopathies, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, and chronic heart failure in the general population. Moreover, no studies to date have investigated fQRS angle in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Thus, the purpose of this retrospective multicentre study was to evaluate the fQRS angle of COVID-19 patients to predict in-hospital mortality and the need for mechanical ventilation. Methods and results An electrocardiogram was performed for 327 COVID-19 patients during admission, and the fQRS angle was calculated. Mechanical ventilation was needed in 119 patients; of them, 110 died in the hospital. The patients were divided into two groups according to an fQRs angle >90 versus an fQRS angle 90. The percentages of mortality and the need for mechanical ventilation according to fQRS angle were 67.8% and 66.1%, respectively, in the fQRs >90 group and 26.1% and 29.9% in the fQRS 90group. Heart rate, oxygen saturation, fQRS angle, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and C-reactive protein level were predictors of mortality on the multivariable analysis. The mortality risk increased 2.9-fold on the univariate analysis and 1.6-fold on the multivariate analysis for the fQRS >90 patient group versus the fQRS 90 group.

After a period with almost no cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, a resurgent Covid-19 outbreak began in mid-June 2021. Possible reasons for the resurgence were reduced vaccine effectiveness against the delta (B.1.617.2) variant and waning immunity. The extent of waning immunity of the vaccine against the delta variant in Israel is unclear. METHODS: We used data on confirmed infection and severe disease collected from an Israeli national database for the period of July 11 to 31, 2021, for all Israeli residents who had been fully vaccinated before June 2021. We used a Poisson regression model to compare rates of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe Covid-19 among persons vaccinated during different time periods, with stratification according to age group and with adjustment for possible confounding factors. RESULTS: Among persons 60 years of age or older, the rate of infection in the July 11C31 period was higher among persons who became fully vaccinated in January 2021 (when they were first eligible) than among those fully vaccinated 2 months later, in March (rate ratio, 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 2.0). Among persons 40 to 59 years of age, the rate ratio for infection among those fully vaccinated in February (when they were first eligible), as compared with 2 months later, in April, was 1.7 (95% CI, 1.4 to 2.1). Among persons 16 to 39 years of age, the rate ratio for infection among those fully vaccinated in March (when they were first eligible), as compared with 2 months later, in May, was 1.6 (95% CI, 1.3 to 2.0). The rate ratio for severe disease among persons fully vaccinated in the month when they were first eligible, as compared with those fully vaccinated in March, was 1.8 (95% CI, 1.1 to 2.9) among persons 60 years of age or older and 2.2 (95% CI, 0.6 to 7.7) among those 40 to 59 years of age; owing to small numbers, the rate ratio could not be calculated among persons 16 to 39 years of age.

Compared with placebo, finerenone reduced the composite kidney and cardiovascular outcomes. We report the effect of finerenone on individual cardiovascular outcomes and in patients with and without history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included patients with type 2 diabetes and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio 30 to 5000 mg/g and an estimated glomerular filtration rate 25 to <75 mL per min per 1.73 m(2), treated with optimized reninCangiotensin system blockade. Patients with a history of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction were excluded. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive finerenone or placebo. The composite cardiovascular outcome included time to cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure. Prespecified cardiovascular analyses included analyses of the components of this composite and outcomes according to CVD history at baseline. RESULTS: Between September 2015 and June 2018, 13 911 patients were screened and 5674 were randomized; 45.9% of patients had CVD at baseline. Over a median follow-up of 2.6 years (interquartile range, 2.0C3.4 years), finerenone reduced the risk of the composite cardiovascular outcome compared with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.75C0.99]; P=0.034), with no significant interaction between patients with and without CVD (hazard ratio, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.71C1.01] in patients with a history of CVD; hazard ratio, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.68C1.08] in patients without a history of CVD; P value for interaction, 0.85).

Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive ivermectin, 400 mcg/kg, single dose (n = 12) or placebo (n = 12). The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients with detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA by PCR from nasopharyngeal swab at day 7 post-treatment. The primary outcome was supported by determination of the viral load and infectivity of each sample. The differences between ivermectin and placebo were calculated using Fishers exact test and presented as a relative risk ratio.All patients recruited completed the trial (median age, 26 [range, 18-54] years;12 [50%] women;100% had symptoms at recruitment, 70% reported headache, 62% reported fever, 50% reported general malaise and 25% reported cough). At day 7, there was no difference in the proportion of PCR positive patients (RR 0.92, 95% CI: 0.77-1.09, p = 1.0).

Insulin resistance is a metabolic disorder that was regarded as an indicator of chronic systemic inflammation. In this study, we aimed to determine the effect of insulin resistance on the occurrence of R-DWILs in ICH. Methods Patients with primary ICH within 14 days after onset were prospectively enrolled from November 2017 to October 2019. R-DWILs was defined as remote focal hyperintensity from the hematoma in DWI, with corresponding hypointensity in apparent diffusion coefficient. The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was used for insulin resistance estimation and calculated as fasting insulin (U/ml)  fasting glucose (mmol/L)/22.5. Patients in our cohort were divided into four groups according to HOMA-IR index quartiles. Logistic regression analysis and smoothing plots were used to evaluate the association of HOMA-IR with R-DWIL occurrence. Sensitivity analysis was performed in non-diabetic patients, non-obese patients, hypertensive ICH patients, and patients 60 years and older separately. The association between HOMA-IR and systemic inflammatory immune indices neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and monocyte to lymphocyte ratio (MLR) was examined with multiple linear regression analysis. Results Among the 345 patients, 54 (15.7%) had R-DWILs. Both the third and fourth quartiles of HOMA-IR index were robustly associated with an increased risk of R-DWIL occurrence (adjusted OR 3.58, 95% CI 1.33-9.65; adjusted OR 3.91, 95%CI 1.47-10.41) when compared with the first quartile. The association was consistent in non-diabetic, non-obese, hypertensive ICH patients, as well as in patients 60 years and older. Furthermore, both NLR and MLR were independently associated with HOMA-IR. Conclusions Our study suggested that insulin resistance evaluated with HOMA-IR index was independently associated with the presence of R-DWILs in patients with acute and subacute primary ICH.

During the 30-minutes normal flight, every animal underwent blind (left side) and ultrasound-guided (US) (right side) vascular access (VA) to the femoral artery followed by REBOA: the first catheter (Rescue balloon, Japan) - into Zone I, the second one (MIT, Russia) - Zone III. In case of blind VA failure, an alternate US-puncture was attempted. Six experienced flight anesthetists were enrolled into the study. Vascular access and REBOA catheter placement (confirmed by X-Ray later) success rate and timing were recorded. RESULTS Among six blind punctures one was successful, 2/6 - were into the vein, 3/6 - completely failed and switched to US-punctures (making total number of US-punctures nine). Eight out of nine US-punctures were successful. However, correct wire insertion and sheath placement was performed in 1/6 animal in the 'blind' group and only in 6/9 animals in the 'US' group. It took a median of 65 seconds (range 5-260) for US-puncture and a median of 4 minutes to get the sheath in.

Many attempts have been made to introduce the use of machine learning to the scientific process of hypothesis generation(HG), which refers to the discovery of meaningful implicit connections between biomedical terms. However, most existing methods fail to truly capture the temporal dynamics of scientific term relations and also assume unobserved connections to be irrelevant (i.e., in a positive-negative (PN) learning setting). To break these limits, we formulate this HG problem as future connectivity prediction task on a dynamic attributed graph via positive-unlabeled (PU) learning. Then, the key is to capture the temporal evolution of node pair (term pair) relations from just the positive and unlabeled data. We propose a variational inference model to estimate the positive prior, and incorporate it in the learning of node pair embeddings, which are then used for link prediction.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has devastated global health with higher morbidities and mortality rates. Reducing vaccine hesitancy could achieve immunization. However, different sociodemographic conditions can also hamper these efforts in low- and middle-income countries. The objective of the present study was to assess the demographic factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, hesitancy, and refusal among the general Pakistani population. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted during the months of FebruaryCMarch 2021 during the pandemic. Sample size was 479. Snowball sampling strategy was used for data collection. Study questionnaires were distributed online using e-mail, twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp. RESULT: The overall COVID-19 vaccine acceptance was 40.5%, vaccine hesitancy was 29%, and vaccine refusal was 30% among the study participants. Compared to younger, the vaccine hesitancy and refusal was higher in older people age > 30 years ((2) = 7.45, p = .02). Compared to males, vaccine refusal was high among females ((2) = 7.45, p = .02). Vaccine refusal was higher in people with less educated <12 compared to more education ((2) = 28.68, p < .0001).

No national guidelines for PPSV23 have been developed. We analyzed PPSV23 coverage and utilization in Hangzhou to determine patterns of PPSV23 use and the occurrence of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) in Hangzhou. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Individuals over 2 years of age in Hangzhou were included. Vaccination data during 2006-2017 was retrieved from Hangzhou's Immunization Information System (HZIIS). We used descriptive epidemiological methods to determine PPSV23 usage patterns and AEFI occurrence. RESULTS: In 2017, there were 9,027,973 persons above 2 years of age with the coverage of PPSV23 of 2.98%. The coverage of PPSV23 among elders ranged from 0.17% to 0.69%, and the overall coverage was higher in urban areas (3.70%) than in rural (3.34%) and suburban areas (2.16%). 93.45% of 268957 recipients were vaccinated with PPSV23 at 2-4 years of age. 394 AEFI of PPSV23 cases were reported to the Chinese national adverse event following immunization information system (CNAEFIS) during 2008-2017, with the reporting rate of 140.39 per 100,000 doses. CONCLUSION: Persons in Hangzhou had overall low PPSV23 vaccination coverage especially for adults. Most of PPSV23 were used in children, while the proportion of the old population over 60 years slightly increased over year.

However, there is limited published research on mobile market operations. The goal of this research is to identify the challenges mobile markets face and ways to potentially mitigate those challenges. We will also discuss implications of our findings for future implementation of evidence-based food access interventions. METHODS: We conducted 21 semi-structured key informant (KI) interviews to assess common practices of mobile market organizations that had been operating for 2 + years. We asked KIs about their organizational structure, operations, procurement and logistics, evaluation efforts, marketing and community engagement, success and challenges. A primary qualitative analysis involved deductive coding using qualitative software. A secondary qualitative analysis identified subthemes related to common challenges and remedial practices. A deductive coding process was applied to match identified challenges to the appropriate Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). RESULTS: The leading challenges cited by KIs correspond to the CFIR domains of inner setting (e.g., funding and resources), outer setting (e.g., navigating regulations), and process (e.g., engaging community partnership). Practices that may mitigate challenges include maximizing ancillary services, adopting innovative volunteer and staffing structures, and formalizing agreements with community partners. CONCLUSION: Common and persistent challenges ought to be addressed to ensure and enhance the positive public health impacts of mobile produce markets. Contextual factors, particularly organizational factors, that impact implementation should also be considered when implementing an evidence-based intervention at a mobile market.

Subsequently, Japan experienced three distinct waves of the outbreak in the span of a year and has been attributed to new exogenous strains and evolving existing strains. Japan engaged very early on in tracking different COVID-19 sub-strains and have sequenced approximately 5% of all confirmed cases. While Japan has enforced stringent airport surveillance on cross-border travelers and returnees, some carriers appear to have advanced through the quarantine stations undetected. In this study, 17112 genomes sampled in Japan were analyzed to understand the strains, heterogeneity and temporal evolution of different SARS-CoV-2 strains. We identified 11 discrete strains with a substantial number of cases with most strains possessing the spike (S) D614G and nucleocapsid (N) 203_204delinsKR mutations. Besides these variants, ORF1ab P3371S, A4815V, S1361P, and N P151L were also detected in nearly half the samples constituting the most common strain in Japan. 115 distinct strains have been introduced into Japan and 12 of them were introduced after strict quarantine policy was implemented. In particular, the B.1.1.7 strain, that emerged in the United Kingdom (UK) in September 2020, has been circulating in Japan since late 2020 after eluding cross-border quarantine stations. Similarly, the B.1.351 strain dubbed the South African variant, P.1 Brazilian strain and R.1 strain with the spike E484K mutation have been detected in Japan. At least four exogenous B.1.1.7 sub-strains have been independently introduced in Japan as of late January 2021, and these strains carry mutations that give selective advantage including N501Y, H69_V70del, and E484K that confer increased transmissibility, reduced efficacy to vaccines and possible increased virulence.

Booster vaccines were offered starting from August 2021. MethodsThe nationwide HUN-VE 3 study examined the effectiveness and durability of primary immunization and single booster vaccinations on SARS-CoV-2-related infection, hospitalization and mortality during the Delta wave. ResultsThe study population included 8,087,988 individuals aged 18-100 years at the beginning of the pandemic. During the Delta wave, after adjusting for age, sex, calendar day, and chronic diseases, vaccine effectiveness (VE) of primary vaccination against registered SARS-CoV-2 infection was between 11% to 77% and 18% to 79% 14-120 days after primary immunization in the 16-64 and 65-100 years age cohort respectively, while it decreased to close to zero in the younger age group and around 40% or somewhat less in the elderly after 6 months for almost all vaccine types. In the population aged 65-100 years, we found high, 88.1%-92.5% adjusted effectiveness against Covid-19 infection after the Pfizer-BioNTech, and 92.2%-95.6% after the Moderna booster dose, while Sinopharm and Janssen booster doses provided 26.5%-75.3% and 72.9%-100.0% adjusted VE, respectively. Adjusted VE against Covid-19 related hospitalization was high within 14-120 days for Pfizer-BioNTech: 76.6%, Moderna: 83.8%, Sputnik-V: 78.3%, AstraZeneca: 73.8%, while modest for Sinopharm: 45.7% and Janssen: 26.4%. The waning of protection against Covid-19 related hospitalization was modest and booster vaccination with mRNA vaccines or the Janssen vaccine increased adjusted VE up to almost 100%, while the Sinopharm booster dose proved to be less effective. VE against Covid-19 related death after primary immunization was high or moderate: for Pfizer-BioNTech: 81.5%, Moderna: 93.2%, Sputnik-V: 100.0%, AstraZeneca: 84.8%, Sinopharm: 58.6%, Janssen: 53.3%). VE against this outcome also showed moderate decline over time, while booster vaccines restored effectiveness up to almost 100%, except for the Sinopharm booster.

For the prevention and control of infection, Taiwan Centers for Disease Control initiated testing of SARS-CoV-2 on January 24th 2020 for persons suspected with this disease. Until February 28th, 43 flu-like symptomatic patients were screened in China Medical University Hospital. METHODS: Two patients were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by rRT-PCR as COVID-19 patients A and B. Causative pathogens for included patients were detected using FilmArray? Respiratory Panel. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical presentations, laboratory data, radiologic findings, and travel and exposure contact histories, of the COVID-19 patients in comparison to those with other respiratory infections. RESULTS: Through contact with Taiwan No. 19 case patient on 27th January, COVID-19 patients A and B were infected. Both patients had no identified comorbidities and developed mild illness with temporal fever, persistent cough, and lung interstitial infiltrates. Owing to the persistence of positive SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimen, the two COVID-19 patients are still in the isolation rooms despite recovery until 10th of March.

It is challenging and confusing for the clinicians to make the decision of the febrile neutropenic patients under chemotherapy to be monitored at intensive care unit (ICU). The aim of this study was to define the factors supporting decision-making for the critical patients with febrile neutropenia. METHODS: The data of 60 patients, who were taken to the ICU while they were under treatment in the Hematology Clinic with a diagnosis of febrile neutropenia, were analyzed retrospectively, in order to identify clinically useful prognostic parameters. RESULTS: The ICU mortality rate was 80%. Mortality was significantly associated with higher sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA), quick sequential organ failure assessment score (qSOFA), and hematological SOFA (SOFAhem) scores on admission. All cases having SOFA score 10 and above and qSOFA score 2 and above died. In multivariate analysis, qSOFA score was found to be statistically significant in predicting mortality in regard to ICU admission (p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: Mortality of febrile neutropenic patients admitted to ICU is high. It would be appropriate to determine the extent of organ dysfunction instead of underlying disease, for making the decision of ICU admission. It should be noticed that the risk mortality is high for the FN cases with SOFA score 10 or above, qSOFA score 2 or above, and in need of mechanical ventilation and positive inotropic support; hence, early intervention is recommended.

Massive research efforts have been made in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Utilization of clinical data can accelerate these research efforts to combat the pandemic since important characteristics of the patients are often found by examining the clinical data.

OBJECTIVE: To provide shareable clinical data to catalyze COVID-19 research, we present Columbia Open Health Data for COVID-19 Research (COHD-COVID), a publicly accessible database providing clinical concept prevalence, clinical concept co-occurrence, and clinical symptom prevalence for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. COHD-COVID also provides data on hospitalized patients with influenza and general hospitalized patients as comparator cohorts. METHODS: The data used in COHD-COVID were obtained from NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Centers electronic health records database. Condition, drug, and procedure concepts were obtained from the visits of identified patients from the cohorts. Rare concepts were excluded, and the true concept counts were perturbed using Poisson randomization to protect patient privacy. Concept prevalence, concept prevalence ratio, concept co-occurrence, and symptom prevalence were calculated using the obtained concepts. RESULTS: Concept prevalence and concept prevalence ratio analyses showed the clinical characteristics of the COVID-19 cohorts, confirming the well-known characteristics of COVID-19 (eg, acute lower respiratory tract infection and cough). The concepts related to the well-known characteristics of COVID-19 recorded high prevalence and high prevalence ratio in the COVID-19 cohort compared to the hospitalized influenza cohort and general hospitalized cohort. Concept co-occurrence analyses showed potential associations between specific concepts. In case of acute lower respiratory tract infection in the COVID-19 cohort, a high co-occurrence ratio was obtained with COVID-19Crelated concepts and commonly used drugs (eg, disease due to coronavirus and acetaminophen). Symptom prevalence analysis indicated symptom-level characteristics of the cohorts and confirmed that well-known symptoms of COVID-19 (eg, fever, cough, and dyspnea) showed higher prevalence than the hospitalized influenza cohort and the general hospitalized cohort.

A subset of adverse childhood experiences, household dysfunction [(HHD) e.g.; parental substance use, mental illness, incarceration, suicide, intimate partner violence, separation/divorce, homelessness], are robust predictors of behavioral disorders; however, few studies have investigated the link between HHD and PIU and PSU and potential protective factors, such as social support, among students. METHODS: Data are from a diverse California student sample (N = 1027). The Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version and Internet Addiction Test assessed dimensions of addiction. Regression models tested associations between students' level of HHD (No HHD, 1-3 HHD, &#8805;4 HHD) and PSU and PIU, and the role of extrafamilial social support in these relationships, adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity, SES, employment loss due to COVID-19, and depression. RESULTS: Compared to students reporting no HHD, students with &#8805;4 HHD had twice the odds (AOR: 2.03, 95% CI: 1.21-3.40) of meeting criteria for PSU, while students with 1-3 HHD and &#8805;4 HHD had three and six times the odds of moderate to severe PIU (AORs: 2.03-2.46, CI:1.21-3.96) after adjusting for covariates. Extrafamilial social support was inversely associated with PIU and moderated the HHD-PSU association for students with 1-3 HHD. CONCLUSION: Students exposed to HHD may be especially vulnerable to developing behavioral addictions such as PSU and PIU.

As obligate blood-feeding arthropods, ticks are responsible for a number of infectious diseases that can affect humans, livestock, domestic animals and wildlife. While cases of human tick-borne diseases continue to increase in the northern hemisphere, there has been relatively little recognition of zoonotic tick-borne pathogens in Australia. Over the past 5 years, studies using high-throughput sequencing technologies have shown that Australian ticks harbour unique and diverse bacterial communities. In the present study, free-ranging wildlife (n=203), representing ten mammal species, were sampled from urban and peri-urban areas in New South Wales (NSW), Queensland (QLD) and Western Australia (WA). Bacterial metabarcoding targeting the 16S rRNA locus was used to characterize the microbiomes of three sample types collected from wildlife: blood, ticks and tissue samples. Further sequence information was obtained for selected taxa of interest. Six tick species were identified from wildlife: Amblyomma triguttatum, Ixodes antechini, Ixodes australiensis, Ixodes holocyclus, Ixodes tasmani and Ixodes trichosuri. Bacterial 16S rRNA metabarcoding was performed on 536 samples and 65 controls, generating over 100 million sequences. Alpha diversity was significantly different between the three sample types, with tissue samples displaying the highest alpha diversity (P<0.001). Proteobacteria was the most abundant taxon identified across all sample types (37.3 %). Beta diversity analysis and ordination revealed little overlap between the three sample types (P<0.001). Taxa of interest included Anaplasmataceae , Bartonella , Borrelia , Coxiellaceae , Francisella , Midichloria , Mycoplasma and Rickettsia . Anaplasmataceae bacteria were detected in 17.7% (95/536) of samples and included Anaplasma , Ehrlichia and Neoehrlichia species. In samples from NSW, Ca. Neoehrlichia australis, Ca. Neoehrlichia arcana, Neoehrlichia sp. and Ehrlichia sp. were identified. A putative novel Ehrlichia sp. was identified from WA and Anaplasma platys was identified from QLD. Nine rodent tissue samples were positive for a novel Borrelia sp. that formed a phylogenetically distinct clade separate from the Lyme Borrelia and relapsing fever groups. This novel clade included recently identified rodent-associated Borrelia genotypes, which were described from Spain and North America. Bartonella was identified in 12.9% (69/536) of samples.

A recent direction in drug development is the utilization of nucleic acid-based therapeutic molecules, such as antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, short interfering RNA (siRNA), and microRNA (miRNA). miRNAs are endogenous, short, non-coding RNA molecules. Some viruses encode their own miRNAs, which play pivotal roles in viral replication and immune evasion strategies. Conversely, viruses that do not encode miRNAs may manipulate host cell miRNAs for the benefits of their replication. miRNAs have therefore become attractive tools for the study of viral pathogenesis. Lately, novel therapeutic strategies based on miRNA technology for the treatment of viral diseases have been progressing rapidly. Although this new generation of molecular therapy is promising, there are still several challenges to face, such as targeting delivery to specific tissues, avoiding off-target effects of miRNAs, reducing the toxicity of the drugs, and overcoming mutations and drug resistance. In this article, we review the current knowledge of the role and therapeutic potential of miRNAs in viral diseases, and discuss the limitations of these therapies, as well as strategies to overcome them to provide safe and effective clinical applications of these new therapeutics.","output":"Exploiting the therapeutic potential of microRNAs in viral diseases: expectations and limitations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"No abstract available.","output":"Family doctors on the front line"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The psychosocial consequences of the coronavirus pandemic are serious for health professionals including nurses because of a higher level of exposure Nurses often face huge psychological pressure as a result of workload, long hours, and working in a high-risk environment This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of anxiety, depression, and stress among nurses working in northwest Amhara referral hospitals Methods: Institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 25th September to 20th October 2020 A total of 302 nurses were selected using a simple random sampling technique A structured pretested self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data The data were entered into EpiData version 3 and analyzed using SPSS version 21 A binary logistic regression model was used to compute bivariable and multivariable analyses Results: The prevalence of anxiety, depression, and stress among nurses was 69 6%, 55 3%, and 20 5%, respectively Unavailability of a guideline, fear of infecting family, and having chronic diseases increase the risk of developing anxiety Nurses who did not have a guideline, received negative feedback from families, had a history of mental disorders, and chronic diseases have a higher odds of depression Working in the night shift, lack of training, fear of infecting family, negative feedback from families, presence of confirmed/suspected cases in the family, and having chronic diseases increase the risk of developing stress Conclusion: More than two-thirds, more than half, and nearly one-fifth of the nurses had anxiety, depression, and stress, respectively It is better to create awareness for the community, avail a guideline, train nurses, and give special attention to nurses with chronic disease and a history of mental disorders to minimize the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on nurses and protect their mental health The government shall develop and implement national programs for occupational health and safety, prevent violence in the workplace, improve psychological well-being, and protect from physical and biological hazards to take care of the mental health of healthcare professionals during this pandemic","output":"The Psychological Impact of COVID-19 Outbreak on Nurses Working in the Northwest of Amhara Regional State Referral Hospitals, Northwest Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This cross-sectional study evaluates the implementation of a telemedicine program in North Carolina prisons based on responses from individuals who were incarcerated, health care practitioners, and telepresenters.","output":"Implementation and Evaluation of a Telemedicine Program for Specialty Care in North Carolina Correctional Facilities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A new form of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-coronavirus 2 (CoV-2), called COVID-19, has become a global threat in 2020.

There appears to be a consensus, despite the lack of experimental data, that angiotensin II (ANG II) is linked to the pathogenesis of COVID-19. This process may occur due to acquired deficiency of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), resulting in reduced degradation of ANG II. Furthermore, ANG II has a critical role in the genesis and worsening of hypertension. In this context, the idea that there is a surge in the level of ANG II with COVID-19 infection, causing multiple organ injuries in hypertensive patients becomes attractive. However, the role of other components of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) in this scenario requires elucidation. The identification of other RAS components in COVID-19 hypertension may provide both diagnostic and therapeutic benefits.

Relationship between diet and reduced vaccine efficacy in developing countries is not well established; therefore, we investigated the interconnections between the host-microbiota-nutrition-HRV vaccine using HRV-vaccinated, human infant faecal microbiota (HIFM)-transplanted neonatal gnotobiotic pigs fed with a protein deficient or sufficient diet. The microbiota from faecal, intestinal (duodenum, ileum, jejunum, and colon), and systemic tissue (liver, spleen, and mesenteric lymph node [MLN]) samples was analysed before and after HRV challenge using MiSeq 16S rRNA sequencing. Overall, microbiota from deficient fed HIFM pigs displayed, compared to the sufficient group, significantly higher Shannon index, especially in the faeces and lower intestines; higher level of Proteus and Enterococcus, and lower level of Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, and Streptococcus in the three types of samples collected (P<0.05); and higher unique operational taxonomic units (OTUs), especially in the systemic tissues.

Few empirical studies have assessed whether and how these control measures may affect mental health, and no study has investigated the prevalence and impacts of the use of eHealth resources among pregnant women during the COVID-19 outbreak. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated (1) the effects of lockdown and mandatory quarantine on mental health problems (ie, anxiety and depressive symptoms), (2) the potential mediation effects of perceived social support and maladaptive cognition, and (3) the moderation effects of eHealth-related factors (ie, using social media to obtain health information and using prenatal care services during the COVID-19 pandemic) on pregnant women in China. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among 19,515 pregnant women from all 34 Chinese provincial-level administrative regions from February 25 to March 10, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 19,515 participants, 12,209 (62.6%) were subjected to lockdown in their areas of residence, 737 (3.8%) were subjected to mandatory quarantine, 8712 (44.6%) had probable mild to severe depression, 5696 (29.2%) had probable mild to severe anxiety, and 1442 (7.4%) had suicidal ideations. Only 640 (3.3%) participants reported that they used online prenatal care services during the outbreak. Significant sociodemographic/maternal factors of anxiety/depressive symptoms included age, education, occupation, the area of residence, gestational duration, the number of children born, complication during pregnancy, the means of using prenatal care services, and social media use for obtaining health information. Multiple indicators multiple causes modeling ((2)(14)=495.21; P<.05; comparative fit index=.99; nonnormed fit index=.98; root mean square error of approximation=.04, 90% CI 0.038-0.045) showed that quarantine was directly and indirectly strongly associated with poor mental health through decreased perceived social support and increased maladaptive cognition (B=.04; =.02, 95% CI 0.01-0.02; P=.001), while lockdown was indirectly associated with mental health through increased social support and maladaptive cognition among pregnant women (B=.03; =.03, 95% CI 0.02-0.03; P=.001). Multigroup analyses revealed that the use of social media for obtaining health information and the means of using prenatal care services were significant moderators of the model paths.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective clinical chart review of severe TBI patients with invasive ICP measurement treated at an urban level I trauma center between January 2007 and September 2017. RESULTS: Clinical records of 213 patients were analyzed. The mean Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on admission was 6 with an intra-hospital mortality of 20.7%. Overall, complications in 12 patients (5.6%) related to the invasive ICP-measurement were recorded of which 5 necessitated surgical intervention. Follow-up CCT scans were performed in 192 patients (89.7%). Indications for follow-up CCTs included routine imaging without clinical deterioration (n = 137, 64.3%), and increased ICP values and/or clinical deterioration (n = 55, 25.8%). Follow-up imaging based on clinical deterioration and increased ICP values were associated with significantly increased likelihoods of worsening of CCT findings compared to routinely performed CCT scans with an odds ratio of 5.524 (95% CI 1.625C18.773) and 6.977 (95% CI 3.262C14.926), respectively.

However, for populations at a higher risk, including those diagnosed with dementia, influenza is proven to be more detrimental.

METHODS: A literature review was conducted to examine the barriers that prevent PWD from seeking out the annual influenza vaccine. A thematic analysis provided an understanding of the overarching relationships found among the influences between the identified themes. RESULTS: Three main influences were identified: (1) intra-personal, (2) inter-personal, and (3) extra-personal, with each influence containing several subsequent sub-themes. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: The literature review found that there is a lack of research involving this high-risk population and the barriers they face, especially within the extra-personal influences.

Autoantibody responses to 57 proteins were significantly altered in the COVID-19 Disc cohort compared to healthy controls (P  0.05). The Rep cohort had altered autoantibody responses against 26 proteins compared to non-COVID-19 ICU patients that served as controls. Both cohorts showed substantial similarities (r2 = 0.73) and exhibited higher autoantibodies responses to numerous transcription factors, immunomodulatory proteins, and human disease markers. Analysis of the combined cohorts revealed elevated autoantibody responses against SPANXN4, STK25, ATF4, PRKD2, and CHMP3 proteins in COVID-19 patients. KREX analysis of the specific IgG autoantibody responses indicates that the targeted host proteins are supposedly increased in COVID-19 patients. The autoantigen-autoantibody response was cross-validated for SPANXN4 and STK25 proteins using Uniprot BLASTP and sequence alignment tools.

It is observed that the host immune system contributes to the varied responses to COVID-19 pathogenesis. Autoantibodies, immune system proteins that mistakenly target the bodys own tissue, may underlie some of this variation.

With the multi-agent based structure, an effective control mechanism is devised to monitor the interaction of students with the system and to observe the learning levels of each student. The purpose of this control mechanism is to provide a higher efficiency in the subjects the students study compared to non-personalized e-learning systems. This study focuses on the proposed architecture and the development of the first prototype of it. In order to test the effectiveness of the system, personalized course materials should be prepared according to the learning styles of the students. In this context, it is planned to use the proposed system in future studies within the scope of a course in which the educational content is personalized. ? 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"A Multi-agent Based Adaptive E-Learning System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Vitamin and mineral nutritional supplements are becoming increasingly popular as alternative treatments for anxiety and depression, as issues such as side effects from medication, failure to respond to psychotherapy and workforce limitations pose barriers for successful treatment.Areas covered: This review covered double-blind, randomized controlled trials (DBRCTs) testing formulas including at least four vitamins and/or minerals used for the treatment of symptoms of anxiety, stress or depression in adults not currently taking medication for psychiatric difficulties.Expert opinion: The majority of the 23 trials reviewed were conducted on people without psychological difficulties, limiting the generalizability of the results to people with diagnosed mood and anxiety difficulties. 16 studies demonstrated positive effects for symptoms of anxiety, depression or stress. Micronutrient supplementation in healthy nonclinical adults has limited benefits for mood and anxiety symptoms, although may convey some subtle general improvements. The evidence for adults with physical or mental ill health is more positive although limited by small samples and variability in nutrients studied. Broad spectrum nutrient products may be more effective than a selected few.

Although autophagy has been studied in many animal species, reagents to study autophagy in avian systems are lacking. Microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (MAP1LC3/LC3) is an important marker for autophagy and is used to follow autophagosome formation. Here we report the cloning of avian LC3 paralogs A, B and C from the domestic chicken, Gallus gallus domesticus, and the production of replication-deficient, recombinant adenovirus vectors expressing these avian LC3s tagged with EGFP and FLAG-mCherry. An additional recombinant adenovirus expressing EGFP-tagged LC3B containing a G120A mutation was also generated. These vectors can be used as tools to visualize autophagosome formation and fusion with endosomes/lysosomes in avian cells and provide a valuable resource for studying autophagy in avian cells. We have used them to study autophagy during replication of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). IBV induced autophagic signaling in mammalian Vero cells but not primary avian chick kidney cells or the avian DF1 cell line. Furthermore, induction or inhibition of autophagy did not affect IBV replication, suggesting that classical autophagy may not be important for virus replication. However, expression of IBV nonstructural protein 6 alone did induce autophagic signaling in avian cells, as seen previously in mammalian cells. This may suggest that IBV can inhibit or control autophagy in avian cells, although IBV did not appear to inhibit autophagy induced by starvation or rapamycin treatment.","output":"Visualizing the autophagy pathway in avian cells and its application to studying infectious bronchitis virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and outcomes of transvenous endovascular embolization (TVE) for superficial intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Methods After collecting clinical and imaging data, a prospective series of 11 patients presenting with superficial AVMs were treated by endovascular embolization using a transvenous approach between November 2016 and October 2018. Results Ten patients (90.9%) had ruptured AVMs before TVE. The mean nidus size was 3.27  1.47 cm, and the median Spetzler-Martin grade was II. The rate of immediate angiographic occlusion of the AVMs was 90.9% (10/11). One patient was treated with transarterial embolization since TVE was not achieved due to an unsuccessful positioning of the microcatheter. Two patients (cases 8 and 11) suffered a intracranial hemorrhage and a cerebral infarction with encephaledema, respectively, but no procedure-related mortalities were observed. Eight patients (72.7%) were independent with a modified Rankin Score (mRS)  2 at discharge and the mRSs of all patients, which were collected 30 days postintervention, were not more than 2. The mean follow-up period was 17 months. There were no nidus recurrences during the follow-up period.

The primary objective of our systematic review was to describe the kind of cardiac complications observed in COVID-19 patients and to identify potential predictors of cardiovascular events. The secondary aim was to analyze the effect of cardiac complications on outcome. We performed this systematic review according to PRISMA guidelines using several databases for studies evaluating the type of cardiac complications and risk factors in COVID-19 patients. We also calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% CI. A random-effects model was applied to analyze the data. The heterogeneity of the retrieved trials was evaluated through the I(2) statistic. Our systematic review included 49 studies. Acute cardiac injury was evaluated in 20 articles. Heart failure and cardiogenic shock were reported in 10 articles. Myocardial infarction was evaluated in seven of the papers retrieved. Takotsubo, myocarditis, and pericardial effusion were reported in six, twelve, and five articles, respectively. Arrhythmic complications were evaluated in thirteen studies. Right ventricular dysfunction was evaluated in six articles. We included 7 studies investigating 2115 patients in the meta-analysis. The RR was 0.20 (95% CI: 0.17 to 0.24; P < 0.00001, I(2) = 0.75). Acute cardiac injury represented the prevalent cardiac complications observed in COVID-19 patients (from 20 to 45% of the patients). Patients with acute cardiac injury seemed to be significantly older, with comorbidities, more likely to develop complications, and with higher mortality rates. Acute cardiac injury was found to be an independent risk factor for severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and an independent predictor of mortality. Due to the scarce evidence, it was not possible to draw any conclusion regarding Takotsubo, myocarditis, pleural effusion, and right ventricular dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. Noteworthy, possible arrhythmic alterations (incidence rate of arrhythmia from 3 to 60%) in COVID-19 patients have to be taken into account for the possible complications and the consequent hemodynamic instabilities. Hypertension seemed to represent the most common comorbidities in COVID-19 patients (from 30 to 59.8%). The prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) was high in this group of patients (up to 57%), with coronary artery disease in around 10% of the cases.

This situation causes various major challenges for gastroenterology. In the context of IBD, several key questions arise. For instance, it is an important question to understand whether patients with IBD (eg, due to intestinal ACE2 expression) might be particularly susceptible to COVID-19 and the cytokine release syndrome associated with lung injury and fatal outcomes. Another highly relevant question is how to deal with immunosuppression and immunomodulation during the current pandemic in patients with IBD and whether immunosuppression affects the progress of COVID-19.

As their state of preparation and perceptions in volunteering during this pandemic have yet to be investigated, this study aims to evaluate Indonesian medical students' willingness to volunteer and readiness to practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted among undergraduate medical students throughout Indonesia. Socio-demographic and social interaction information, in addition to willingness to volunteer and readiness to practice, were obtained using a self-reported questionnaire. The significance level was set at 5%. RESULTS: Among 4870 participants, 2374 (48.7%) expressed their willingness to volunteer, while only 906 (18.6%) had adequate readiness to practice. Male students, students with prior volunteering experience in health or non-health sectors, and students from public universities or living in Central Indonesia (vs Java) had higher scores of willingness and readiness to volunteer. Students from Sumatra also had better preparedness (odds ratio [OR] 1.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15-2.12, p = 0.004), while the opposite occurred for students from Eastern Indonesia (OR 0.63, 95% CI: 0.44-0.89, p = 0.002)-when compared to students from Java. In addition, compared to students with high family income, students from lower-middle income families were less willing to volunteer (OR 0.76, 95% CI: 0.59-0.98, p = 0.034), though those with low family income had better readiness (OR 1.51, 95% CI: 1.10-2.08, p = 0.011). Shortage of medical personnel, sense of duty, and solicitation by stakeholders were the main reasons increasing the students' willingness to volunteer; whereas contrarily fear for own's health, absence of a cure, and fear of harming patients were the primary factors diminishing their willingness to volunteer. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that many Indonesian medical students are willing to volunteer, yet only few of them were ready to practice, indicating that further preparations are required to maximize their potentials and minimize their exposure to hazards. We suggest that their potentials as a firm support system during the pandemic should not be overlooked, and that the integration of relevant courses to the medical curricula are imperative to prepare for future public health emergencies.","output":"Willingness to volunteer and readiness to practice of undergraduate medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional survey in Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Dental caries is one of the most prevalent non-communicable disease globally and can have serious health sequelae impacting negatively on quality of life. In the UK most adults experience dental caries during their lifetime and the 2009 Adult Dental Health Survey reported that 85% of adults have at least one dental restoration. Conservative removal of tooth tissue for both primary and secondary caries reduces the risk of failure due to tooth-restoration, complex fracture as well as remaining tooth surfaces being less vulnerable to further caries. However, despite its prevalence there is no consensus on how much caries to remove prior to placing a restoration to achieve optimal outcomes. Evidence for selective compared to complete or near-complete caries removal suggests there may be benefits for selective removal in sustaining tooth vitality, therefore avoiding abscess formation and pain, so eliminating the need for more complex and costly treatment or eventual tooth loss. However, the evidence is of low scientific quality and mainly gleaned from studies in primary teeth. METHOD: This is a pragmatic, multi-centre, two-arm patient randomised controlled clinical trial including an internal pilot set in primary dental care in Scotland and England. Dental health professionals will recruit 623 participants over 12-years of age with deep carious lesions in their permanent posterior teeth. Participants will have a single tooth randomised to either the selective caries removal or complete caries removal treatment arm. Baseline measures and outcome data (during the 3-year follow-up period) will be assessed through clinical examination, patient questionnaires and NHS databases. A mixed-method process evaluation will complement the clinical and economic outcome evaluation and examine implementation, mechanisms of impact and context. The primary outcome at three years is sustained tooth vitality. The primary economic outcome is net benefit modelled over a lifetime horizon. Clinical secondary outcomes include pulp exposure, progession of caries, restoration failure; as well as patient-centred and economic outcomes. DISCUSSION: SCRiPT will provide evidence for the most clinically effective and cost-beneficial approach to managing deep carious lesions in permanent posterior teeth in primary care. This will support general dental practitioners, patients and policy makers in decision making. Trial Registration Trial registry: ISRCTN. Trial registration number: ISRCTN76503940.

Due to inadequate research on geographic modeling of COVID-19, we investigated county-level variations of disease incidence across the continental United States. We compiled a geodatabase of 35 environmental, socioeconomic, topographic, and demographic variables that could explain the spatial variability of disease incidence. Further, we employed spatial lag and spatial error models to investigate spatial dependence and geographically weighted regression (GWR) and multiscale GWR (MGWR) models to locally examine spatial non-stationarity. The results suggested that even though incorporating spatial autocorrelation could significantly improve the performance of the global ordinary least square model, these models still represent a significantly poor performance compared to the local models. Moreover, MGWR could explain the highest variations (adj. R2: 68.1%) with the lowest AICc compared to the others. Mapping the effects of significant explanatory variables (i.e., income inequality, median household income, the proportion of black females, and the proportion of nurse practitioners) on spatial variability of COVID-19 incidence rates using MGWR could provide useful insights to policymakers for targeted interventions.","output":"GIS-based spatial modeling of COVID-19 incidence rate in the continental United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom, a country with a population of 67 mln people and the fifth largest economy in the world, left the European Union.

According to the third-generation comparative capitalism literature, EU economic integration has been favouring export-led growth models over domestic-demand led ones through several channels, which included fiscal rules, financial support conditionality and monetary policy. During the pandemic, there have been apparent shifts in some of these channels. Greece has entered the pandemic with vulnerabilities from previous economic adjustment programmes it had to follow, large enough to warrant enhanced surveillance by the European Commission, as well as challenging fiscal conditionality to secure some preferential treatment by its Eurozone partners/lenders of its public debt, to improve its fragile sustainability. This article assesses the risks that the Greek Recovery and Resilience Plan may face, given the economic, social and political legacies of and the lingering conditionality from the previous crisis. It thus illustrates how the implementation of the EU response to the pandemic in Greece is constrained by the legacy of the previous crisis despite shifts in policy channels through which the EU economic integration has been shaping national capitalisms.","output":"Recovery, resilience and growth regimes under overlapping EU conditionalities: the case of Greece"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Vaccine efficacy against the B.1.351 variant following mRNA-1273 vaccination in humans has not been determined. Nonhuman primates (NHP) are a useful model for demonstrating whether mRNA-1273 mediates protection against B.1.351. Methods Nonhuman primates received 30 or 100 g of mRNA-1273 as a prime-boost vaccine at 0 and 4 weeks, a single immunization of 30 g at week 0, or no vaccine. Antibody and T cell responses were assessed in blood, bronchioalveolar lavages (BAL), and nasal washes.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 292 patients with COVID-19 who presented at the emergency department between March 16, 2020 and April 30, 2020. To standardize the radiologic patterns, we used the RSEHA, categorizing the radiologic pattern as mild, moderate, or severe. We analyzed the relationship between radiologic severity according to the RSEHA with the need for admission to the hospital, admission to the ICU, and mortality. RESULTS: Hospital admission was necessary in 91.4% of the patients. The RSEHA was significantly associated with the need for hospital admission (p = 0.03) and with the need for ICU admission (p < 0.001). A total of 51 (17.5%) patients died; of these, 57% had the severe pattern on the RSEHA. When we analyzed mortality by grouping patients according to their results on the RSEHA and their age range, the percentage of patients who died increased after age 70 years in patients classified as moderate or severe on the RSEHA.

However, whether the optimal transrectal approach for intraperitoneal surgery is anterior or posterior remains unknown. To evaluate this, a prospective comparison of anterior and posterior transrectal NOTES approaches in a cadaveric appendectomy model was performed. METHODS Operations were performed on human cadavers using a transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) scope to assist with access and closure. Posterior access was achieved by tunneling cephalad through the retrorectal space into the peritoneal cavity. Anterior transrectal access was established through the rectal wall just above the peritoneal reflection. A dual-channel flexible endoscope was used to perform appendectomies. Rectotomies were closed using sutures or staples. Operative time, degree of laparoscopic assistance, complications, and leak-testing results were recorded. RESULTS This study investigated 10 cadavers with access and closure attempted using both anterior (n = 10) and posterior (n = 5) approaches, whereas appendectomies were performed using either an anterior (n = 8) or a posterior (n = 2) approach. The anterior approach required less time than the posterior approach for peritoneal access (4  1 vs. 61  14 min; p < 0.001), specimen extraction (2  1 vs. 5  1 min; p < 0.01), and the total operation (99  35 vs. 176  26 min; p = 0.02). A \\"pure\\" NOTES dissection was possible with the anterior approach using rigid transanal instruments for assistance.

This study aimed to analyze the relationship between insomnia, worry, coping strategies, and academic engagement in subjects pursuing a university degree in Argentina during the first month of compulsory social isolation against the COVID-19 pandemic. Self-report online questionnaires were administered to 584 participants: Insomnia Severity Index, Penn State Worry Questionnaire, Coping Responses Inventory, Utrecht Work Engagement Scale for Students. Demographic data was recorded. Statistics included bivariate and multivariate techniques. Prevalences of 45% for subthreshold insomnia, 23% for moderate insomnia, and 4% for severe insomnia were found. The severe insomnia group presented higher levels of worry and cognitive avoidance strategies. Insomnia was also associated with daytime concerns. The group without insomnia was more vigorous in their academic engagement. Being physically active was associated with lower sleep problems. Insomnia prevalence is high in socially isolated university students. Cognitive avoidance coping strategies are associated with worry, which leads to an alert state that makes sleep difficult.

However, digestive symptoms have also been reported; at first considered as infrequent, they in fact seem to affect (to some extent) more than half of patients. The symptoms are mainly manifested by anorexia, diarrhea, nausea and/or vomiting and abdominal pain. Even though prognosis is associated with lung injury, digestive symptoms seem significantly more frequent in patients presenting with severe COVID-19 infection. Digestive forms, which may be isolated or which can precede pulmonary symptoms, have indeed been reported, with diarrhea as a leading clinical sign. The main biological abnormalities that can suggest COVID-19 infection at an early stage are lymphopenia, elevated CRP and heightened ASAT transaminases. Thoraco-abdominal scan seems useful as a means of on the one hand ruling out digestive pathology not connected with coronavirus and on the other hand searching for pulmonary images compatible with COVID-19 infection. No data exist on the interest of digestive endoscopy in cases of persistent digestive symptoms. Moreover, the endoscopic surgeons may themselves be at significant risk of contamination. Fecal-oral transmission of the infection is possible, especially insofar as viral shedding in stools seems frequent and of longer duration than at the ENT level, including in patients with negative throat swab and without digestive symptoms. In some doubtful cases, virologic assessment of stool samples can yield definitive diagnosis. In the event of prolonged viral shedding in stools, a patient's persistent contagiousness is conceivable but not conclusively established.

This analysis graded the accuracy, quality, and reliability of the most viewed YouTube videos depicting COVID-19 and vaccinations over a 6-mo period. METHODS: We collected hyperlinks for the 150 most viewed YouTube videos discussing COVID-19 from January through June 2020. Closed captioning data were searched for the term vaccine, yielding 32 videos. This sample was evaluated for quality, accuracy, and reliability using a rubric that incorporated existing instruments: Global Quality Scale (GQS), JAMA Benchmark Criteria, and DISCERN. RESULTS: These 32 videos had 139,764,188 views at the time of data collection. The majority of videos received low scores, with network news sources receiving the lowest scores overall. CONCLUSIONS: The overall quality of COVID-19 YouTube videos related to vaccines may be low and raises a precautionary alert for the public consuming these videos and for health-care providers working to provide the best information to their patients.

For instance, kernels of these methods have a singularity that occurs at the endpoint of an interval of definition. Thus, to overcome this issue, several new definitions of fractional derivatives have been introduced. The CaputoCFabrizio fractional order is one of these nonsingular definitions. This paper is concerned with the analyses and design of an optimal control strategy for a CaputoCFabrizio fractional-order model of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The CaputoCFabrizio fractional-order model of HIV/AIDS is considered to prevent the singularity problem, which is a real concern in the modeling of real-world systems and phenomena. Firstly, in order to find out how the population of each compartment can be controlled, sensitivity analyses were conducted. Based on the sensitivity analyses, the most effective agents in disease transmission and prevalence were selected as control inputs. In this way, a modified CaputoCFabrizio fractional-order model of the HIV/AIDS epidemic is proposed. By changing the contact rate of susceptible and infectious people, the atraumatic restorative treatment rate of the treated compartment individuals, and the sexual habits of susceptible people, optimal control was designed. Lastly, simulation results that demonstrate the appropriate performance of the CaputoCFabrizio fractional-order model and proposed control scheme are illustrated.","output":"A CaputoCFabrizio Fractional-Order Model of HIV/AIDS with a Treatment Compartment: Sensitivity Analysis and Optimal Control Strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Corona virus disease-2019 (COVID-19) presents primarily with respiratory symptoms. However, extra respiratory manifestations are being frequently recognized including gastrointestinal involvement. The most common gastrointestinal symptoms are nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Gastrointestinal perforation in association with COVID-19 is rarely reported in the literature. PATIENT CONCERNS AND DIAGNOSIS: In this series, we are reporting 3 cases with different presentations of gastrointestinal perforation in the setting of COVID-19. Two patients were admitted with critical COVID-19 pneumonia, both required intensive care, intubation and mechanical ventilation. The first one was an elderly gentleman who had difficult weaning from mechanical ventilation and required tracheostomy. During his stay in intensive care unit, he developed Candidemia without clear source. After transfer to the ward, he developed lower gastrointestinal bleeding and found by imaging to have sealed perforated cecal mass with radiological signs of peritonitis. The second one was an obese young gentleman who was found incidentally to have air under diaphragm. Computed tomography showed severe pneumoperitoneum with cecal and gastric wall perforation. The third case was an elderly gentleman who presented with severe COVID-19 pneumonia along with symptoms and signs of acute abdomen who was confirmed by imaging to have sigmoid diverticulitis with perforation and abscess collection. INTERVENTIONS: The first 2 cases were treated conservatively. The third one was treated surgically. OUTCOME: Our cases had a variable hospital course but fortunately all were discharged in a good clinical condition.

In this study we demonstrate that a vimentin specific antibody, obtained by phage antibody technology, promotes tube formation of endothelial cells in a 2D matrigel assay. By binding vimentin, the antibody increases the tube formation by 21% after 5 hours of incubation. Addition of the antibody directly to cultured endothelial cells does not influence endothelial cell migration or proliferation. The enhanced tube formation can be seen for up to 10 hours where after the effect decreases. It is shown that the antibody-binding site is located on the coil 2 domain of vimentin.

Consequently, methods for accurate COVID-19 diagnosis and classification are necessary to facilitate rapid patient care and terminate viral spread. Lung infection segmentations are useful to identify unique infection patterns that may support rapid diagnosis, severity assessment, and patient prognosis prediction, but manual segmentations are time-consuming and depend on radiologic expertise. Deep learning-based methods have been explored to reduce the burdens of segmentation; however, their accuracies are limited due to the lack of large, publicly available annotated datasets that are required to establish ground truths. For these reasons, we propose a semi-automatic, threshold-based segmentation method to generate region of interest (ROI) segmentations of infection visible on lung computed tomography (CT) scans. Infection masks are then used to calculate the percentage of lung abnormality (PLA) to determine COVID-19 severity and to analyze the disease progression in follow-up CTs. Compared with other COVID-19 ROI segmentation methods, on average, the proposed method achieved improved precision ([Formula: see text] ) and specificity ([Formula: see text] ) scores. Furthermore, the proposed method generated PLAs with a difference of [Formula: see text] from the ground-truth PLAs.

In 2011, the diagnosis of DES was refined based on the occurrence of premature (rather than rapid) contractions by high-resolution manometry. New therapeutic options have also been recently proposed. Thus, a review on DES incorporating publications since 2012 is timely because of these revisions in definition and management. RECENT FINDINGS DES remains a heterogeneous clinical disorder. Its pathophysiology is still debated and DES might be related to achalasia. Alternatively, it might be secondary to medications, especially opiates. Endoscopic ultrasound might be informative diagnostically by demonstrating muscularis propria hypertrophy and thickening. Botulinum toxin injection in the esophageal body has been shown superior to placebo to relieve symptoms associated with DES. Finally, per oral endoscopic myotomy is a promising therapeutic approach, but may be less effective in DES than in achalasia. SUMMARY The diagnosis of DES should lead to a systematic search for medication that might promote the occurrence of esophageal dysmotility.

The Older Adult Mental Health Wards in Bridgend were relocated from the district general hospital (Princess of Wales) and merged at Angelton Clinic, an off site separate unit. It was therefore essential that patients had clear escalation of care plans as access to medical input was limited and transfer to hospital potentially not appropriate in the later stages of chronic illness such as dementia. The initial aim of the PDSA cycle was to assess the level of compliance with Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (DNAR) discussions and if appropriate, DNAR documentation. The other aim was to assess the utilisation of Escalation of Care plans. METHOD: An audit of patients MDT medical notes on 38 admitted to Angelton clinic was carrired out in March. It was documented if the patient had a clear DNAR or Escalation plan that was easily accessible in the front of the notes.

Objective: To understand, from the perspective of parents, how the COVID-19 shelter-in-place mandates affected childrens physical activity, while also considering families socioeconomic statusDesign: Open-ended surveySetting: Online Method: Data were collected from 335 parents living in the United States of America. Parents answered an open-ended prompt to describe their children's physical activity during COVID-19 shelter-in-place mandates. Following data collection, inductive and deductive content analysis examined patterns in the data. Results: Analyses indicated that shelter-in-place mandates restricted childrens opportunities for physical activity. However, if families had access to outdoor spaces or equipment, they could encourage and support more physical activity opportunities than those without. Families in the lower-income bracket had less access to outdoor space and subsequently those children had fewer opportunities to be physically active. Parents supported their childrens physical activity through their involvement and encouragement.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been interest in elderberry supplements to treat or prevent illness, but also concern that elderberry might overstimulate the immune system and increase the risk of cytokine storm. We aimed to determine benefits and harms of elderberry for the prevention and treatment of viral respiratory infections, and to assess the relationship between elderberry supplements and negative health impacts associated with overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and searched six databases, four research registers, and two preprint sites for studies. Two reviewers independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data from studies, assessed risk of bias using Cochrane tools, and evaluated certainty of estimates using GRADE. Outcomes included new illnesses and the severity and duration of illness. RESULTS: We screened 1187 records and included five randomized trials on elderberry for the treatment or prevention of viral respiratory illness. We did not find any studies linking elderberry to clinical inflammatory outcomes. However, we found three studies measuring production of cytokines ex vivo after ingestion of elderberry. Elderberry may not reduce the risk of developing the common cold; it may reduce the duration and severity of colds, but the evidence is uncertain. Elderberry may reduce the duration of influenza but the evidence is uncertain. Compared to oseltamivir, an elderberry-containing product may be associated with a lower risk of influenza complications and adverse events. We did not find evidence on elderberry and clinical outcomes related to inflammation. However, we found evidence that elderberry has some effect on inflammatory markers, although this effect may decline with ongoing supplementation. One small study compared elderberry to diclofenac (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) and provided some evidence that elderberry is as effective or less effective than diclofenac in cytokine reduction over time. CONCLUSIONS: Elderberry may be a safe option for treating viral respiratory illness, and there is no evidence that it overstimulates the immune system. However, the evidence on both benefits and harms is uncertain and information from recent and ongoing studies is necessary to make firm conclusions.

Patients (N=192) attending an emergency department during the 2007-8 respiratory season consented, and excess frozen archived nasopharyngeal aspirates were analysed; 46 were positive by conventional virology and 69 by RT-PCR/ESI-MS, among which there were six samples with multiple viral pathogens detected. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay were 89.1% and 80.3%, respectively. Additional viruses that were not identified by conventional virology assays were detected (4 human bocaviruses and 7 coronaviruses). Samples in which the RT-PCR/ESI-MS results disagreed with conventional virology were sent for analysis by a third method using a commercial RT-PCR-based assay, which can identify viruses not detectable by conventional virologic procedures. Time to first result of RT-PCR/ESI-MS was 8 hours. RT-PCR/ESI-MS demonstrated capacity to detect respiratory viruses identifiable and unidentifiable by conventional methods rapidly.","output":"Rapid Identification Viruses from Nasal Pharyngeal Aspirates in Acute Viral Respiratory Infections by RT-PCR and Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Federated learning is a framework for multiple devices or institutions, called local clients, to collaboratively train a global model without sharing their data. For federated learning with a central server, an aggregation algorithm integrates model information sent from local clients to update the parameters for a global model. Sample mean is the simplest and most commonly used aggregation method. However, it is not robust for data with outliers or under the Byzantine problem, where Byzantine clients send malicious messages to interfere with the learning process. Some robust aggregation methods were introduced in literature including marginal median, geometric median and trimmed-mean. In this article, we propose an alternative robust aggregation method, named [Formula: see text]-mean, which is the minimum divergence estimation based on a robust density power divergence. This [Formula: see text]-mean aggregation mitigates the influence of Byzantine clients by assigning fewer weights. This weighting scheme is data-driven and controlled by the [Formula: see text] value.

DESIGN: Cross sectional study. SETTING: University sports performance laboratory in the United States. Data were collected from May 2015 to February 2017. PARTICIPANTS: 176 adults (74 women, 102 men), including university students, faculty, and staff with no history of injuries, disease, or medical conditions that would affect digit length. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 2D:4D, body composition parameters potentially influenced by androgens (bone mineral content, bone mineral density, body fat percentage), and good luck (using poker hands from randomly selected playing cards as a surrogate). RESULTS: 2D:4D significantly correlated with select body composition parameters (Spearmans r (s) range ?0.26 to 0.23; P<0.05), but the correlations varied by sex, participant hand measured, and the method of measuring 2D:4D (by photocopy or radiography). However, the strongest correlation observed was between right hand 2D:4D in men measured by radiograph and poker hand rank (r (s)=0.28, P=0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Greater prenatal exposure to testosterone, as estimated by a lower 2D:4D, significantly increases good luck in adulthood, and also modulates body composition (albeit to a lesser degree). While these findings are consistent with a wealth of research reporting that 2D:4D is related to many seemingly disparate outcomes, they are not meant to provide confirmatory evidence that 2D:4D is a universal biomarker of nearly everything. Instead, the associations between 2D:4D and good luck are simply due to chance, and provide a handy example of the reproducibility crisis within medical and scientific research. Biologically sound hypotheses, pre-registration of trials, strong methodological and statistical analyses, transparent reporting of negative results, and unbiased interpretation of data are all necessary for biomarker studies and other areas of clinical research.","output":"Giving science the fingeris the second-to-fourth digit ratio (2D:4D) a biomarker of good luck?

Of particular interest are the incidence, prevalence, and effective reproductive number (R-t). Estimating these quantities is challenging due to under-ascertainment, unreliable reporting, and time lags between infection, onset, and testing. We propose a Multilevel Epidemic Regression Model to Account for Incomplete Data (MERMAID) to jointly estimate R-t, ascertainment rates, incidence, and prevalence over time in one or multiple regions. Specifically, MERMAID allows for a flexible regression model of R-t that can incorporate geographic and time-varying covariates. To account for under-ascertainment, we (a) model the ascertainment probability over time as a function of testing metrics and (b) jointly model data on confirmed infections and population-based serological surveys. To account for delays between infection, onset, and reporting, we model stochastic lag times as missing data, and develop an EM algorithm to estimate the model parameters. We evaluate the performance of MERMAID in simulation studies, and assess its robustness by conducting sensitivity analyses in a range of scenarios of model misspecifications. We apply the proposed method to analyze COVID-19 daily confirmed infection counts, PCR testing data, and serological survey data across the United States.

The aim of this randomized controlled study was to test this hypothesis by comparing the expiratory tidal volume (Vte) between NMV and FMV. METHODS After the induction of anesthesia, 41 subjects, 3-17 years of age without anticipated difficult mask ventilation, were randomly assigned to receive either NMV or FMV with neck extension. Both groups were ventilated with pressure control ventilation (PCV) at 20 cmH2 O of peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels of 0, 5, and 10 cmH2 O. An additional mouth closing maneuver (MCM) was applied for the NMV group. RESULTS The Vte was higher in the FMV group compared with the NMV group (median difference [95% CI]: 8.4 [5.5-11.6] mlkg(-1) ; P < 0.001) when MCM was not applied. NMV achieved less PEEP than FMV (median difference [95% CI]: 5.0 [4.3-5.3] cmH2 O at 10 cmH2 O; P < 0.001) though both groups achieved the set PIP level. In the NMV group, MCM markedly increased Vte (median increase [95% CI]: 5.9 [2.5-9.0] mlkg(-1) ; P < 0.005) and PEEP (median increase [95% CI]: 5.0 [0.6-8.6] cmH2 O at 10 cmH2 O; P < 0.005); however, PEEP was highly variable and lower than that of FMV (median difference [95% CI]: 2.5 [0.8-8.5] cmH2 O at 10 cmH2 O; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS In anesthetized, apneic children greater than 2 years of age ventilated with an anesthesia ventilator and neck extension, FMV established a greater Vte than NMV regardless of mouth status. NMV could not maintain the set PEEP level due to an air leak from the mouth.

HYPOTHESIS: COVID-19 infection may result in cardiovascular manifestations leading to worse clinical outcome. METHODS: Fifty four severe and critical patients with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled. Risk factors predicting the severity of COVID-19 were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 54 patients (56.1  13.5 years old, 66.7% male) with COVID-19, 39 were diagnosed as severe and 15 as critical cases. The occurrence of diabetes, the level of D-dimer, inflammatory and cardiac markers in critical cases were significantly higher. Troponin I (TnI) elevation occurred in 42.6% of all the severe and critical patients. Three patients experienced hypotension at admission and were all diagnosed as critical cases consequently. Hypotension was found in one severe case and seven critical cases during hospitalization. Sinus tachycardia is the most common type of arrythmia and was observed in 23 severe patients and all the critical patients. Atrioventricular block and ventricular tachycardia were observed in critical patients at end stage while bradycardia and atrial fibrillation were less common. Mild pericardial effusion was observed in one severe case and five critical cases. Three critical cases suffered new onset of heart failure. Hypotension during treatment, severe myocardial injury and pericardial effusion were independent risk factors predicting the critical status of COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: This study has systemically observed the impact of COVID-19 on cardiovascular system, including myocardial injury, blood pressure, arrythmia and cardiac function in severe and critical cases.

Excellent efficacy and safety profile have been reported in HIV/AIDS pts with high-risk Burkitt lymphoma (BL) [Ferreri et al. BJH 2021], but its efficacy in pts with high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC rearrangement (HGBCL) remains to be defined. Herein, we report a retrospective series of consecutive pts with BL or HGBCL treated with CARMEN regimen. Methods: Either HIV-negative and HIV-positive pts aged 18-80 years with BL or HGBCL and MYC rearrangement positive by FISH were treated with CARMEN regimen, which includes a single 36-day induction course of sequential doses of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, rituximab, methotrexate, VP16, and doxorubicin plus intrathecal chemotherapy, followed by consolidation with HD-cytarabine  cisplatin. Pts who did not achieve complete remission (CR) after induction received BEAM/ASCT after consolidation. Results: 63 pts (22 HGBCL;41 BL) received the CARMEN regimen (Table). Treatment was well tolerated: 56 (89%) pts completed the induction, and 55 (87%) completed the consolidation. G4 hematological toxicity during induction was neutropenia in 48 (76%) pts, thrombocytopenia in 24 (38%) and anemia in 7 (11%), which were recorded after consolidation in 34 (62%), 38 (69%) and 1 (2%) pt, respectively. G4 non hematological toxicity was uncommon: mucositis in 4 (6%) pts and tumor lysis syndrome in 1 (2%) during induction, and heart failure and bleeding in 1 (2%) pt each after consolidation. G4 infections were recorded in 4 (6%) pts during induction and in 2 (3%) after consolidation. Induction and consolidation doses were reduced in 6 (9%) and 4 (7%) pts, respectively. Seven HGBCL and 9 BL pts received ASCT, with expected tolerability. 4 HGBCL and 2 BL pts died of toxicity (sepsis in 4;respiratory failure;COVID-19), with a TRM of 9%. After induction, 18 (82%) HGBCL and 37 (90%) BL pts achieved a response, which was CR in 10 (45%) and 26 (63%) pts, respectively. After the whole treatment, 15 (68%) HGBCL pts and 32 (78%) BL pts achieved a CR, and, at a median follow-up of 54 (2-131) months, 15 (100%) HGBCL and 29 (91%) BL pts remain relapse-free, with a 5-yr PFS of 67% and 70%, respectively. 15 HGBCL and 32 BL pts are alive, with a 5-yr OS of 66% and 77%, respectively. HIV seropositivity did not modify outcome. Age and LDH level were independently associated with OS. Conclusions: With the limitations of a retrospective series, this study shows that CARMEN is a safe and active treatment both in HIVnegative and-positive pts with HGBCL and MYC rearrangement and BL.

The other is Tag1, another vacuolar protein, which signals to terminate autophagy and has three LEA-2 domains in its lumenal domain.

Currently, SARS- CoV-2 is thought to evade innate antiviral immunity, undergo endocytosis, and fuse with the host cell membrane by exploiting ACE2 receptors and the protease TMMPRSS2, with cathepsin B/L as alternative protease, for entry into the epithelial cells of tissues vulnerable to developing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms.

Our survey estimates that most U.S. patient-visits during the early COVID-19 pandemic period were conducted via telehealth. Given this magnitude and potential benefits/challenges of telehealth for U.S. healthcare, we obtain, summarize, and analyze telehealth views/experiences of U.S. practicing-physicians. OBJECTIVE: From the U.S. practicing-physician perspective, we examine extent of shift toward telehealth training and care provision during the early-pandemic. We seek to determine the shift's short- and long-term implications upon quality, access, and mode of U.S. healthcare delivery. METHODS: A purposive, snowball-sampled survey of 148 U.S. practicing-physicians. Data was collected from July 17, 2020 through September 4, 2020. RESULTS: Sample training intensity scaled 21-fold during the early-pandemic period; patient-care visits conducted via telehealth rose from 13.1%, on average, directly before pandemic to 59.7%, on average, during early-pandemic. Physicians feel that telehealth patient-visits and face-to-face patient-visits are comparable in quality; the difference is not statistically significant in a non-parametric sign test (P = 0.11). Physicians feel that telehealth care should continue to play a larger role (44.9% of visits) in U.S. healthcare post-pandemic. Survey findings suggest high market-concentration in telehealth softwares, a market-structural characteristic that may have implications upon cost and access. Results vary markedly by physician employer-type. CONCLUSIONS: During the shift toward telehealth, there has been considerable discovery among physicians regarding U.S. telehealth physicians. Physicians are now better-prepared to undertake telehealth care from a training perspective. They are favorable toward a permanently-expanded telehealth role, with potential for enhanced healthcare access; realization of enhanced access may depend upon market-structural characteristics of telehealth software platforms.

Here, we explore potential predictors for the emergence and maintenance of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in the general population in Israel. MethodsAcross the span of 16 months, 2,478 people completed a repeated self-report survey which inquired psychiatric symptoms and pandemic related stress factors (PRSF). PRSF were divided into four clusters of environmental stressors: financial, health-related, fatigue and sense of protection by authorities. We applied mixed-effects linear models to assess how each stressor contributes to depression, anxiety and PTSS at each time point, alongside a longitudinal exploration among participants who completed at least two consecutive surveys (n=400). ResultsFatigue was the strongest predictor for depression, anxiety and PTSS at all time points (standardized {beta} between 0.28-0.60, p<.0001), and predicted deterioration overtime ({beta} between 0.22-0.36, p<.0001). Financial concerns associated with depression and anxiety at all time points ({beta} between 0.13- 0.26, p<.01), and with their deterioration overtime ({beta} between 0.16-0.18, p<.0001), while health related concerns were uniquely associated with anxiety and PTSS at all time points ({beta} between 0.14-0.29, p<.01) and their deterioration ({beta} between 0.11-0.16, p<.001), but not with depression.

Ongoing military conflict has resulted in many displaced persons and veterans and their families with high burdens of mental health problems. Lack of community-based services and poor uptake of existing psychiatric services led to the current trial to determine the effectiveness of the common elements treatment approach (CETA) on anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTS) among conflict affected adults in Ukraine. METHODS: We conducted a three-armed randomized-controlled trial of CETA delivered in its standard form (8C12 sessions), a brief form (five-sessions), and a wait-control condition. Eligible participants were displaced adults, army veterans and their adult family members with elevated depression and/or PTS and impaired functioning. Treatment was delivered by community-based providers trained in both standard and brief CETA. Outcome data were collected monthly. RESULTS: There were 302 trial participants (n = 117 brief CETA, n = 129 standard CETA, n = 56 wait-controls). Compared with wait-controls, participants in standard and brief CETA experienced clinically and statistically significant reductions in depression, anxiety, and PTS and dysfunction (effect sizes d = 0.46C1.0C6). Comparing those who received standard CETA with brief CETA, the former reported fewer symptoms and less dysfunction with small-to-medium effect sized (d = 0.20C0.55). CONCLUSIONS: Standard CETA is more effective than brief CETA, but brief CETA also had significant effects compared with wait-controls.

During virus replication, these fusogens decorate the host cells membrane enabling them the ability to fuse with neighboring cells, forming syncytia that the viruses use to propagate while evading the immune system. Many of these viruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), infect the brain and may cause serious neurological symptoms through mechanisms which remain poorly understood2C4. Here we show that expression of either the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein or p15 protein from the baboon orthoreovirus is sufficient to induce fusion between interconnected neurons, as well as between neurons and glial cells. This phenomenon is observed across species, from nematodes to mammals, including human embryonic stem cells-derived neurons and brain organoids. We show that fusion events are progressive, can occur between distant neurites, and lead to the formation of multicellular syncytia. Finally, we reveal that in addition to intracellular molecules, fusion events allow diffusion and movement of large organelles such as mitochondria between fused neurons.

METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers were examined using two NCTs, Ocular Response Analyzer and Corvis ST, and two contact tonometers, iCare and Tono-Pen. High-speed videos of the tear film response were captured with at spatial resolution of 20 microns/pixel at 2400 fps. Droplet size, droplet velocity, distance between air puff impact location, and the tear meniscus-lid margin were characterized. RESULTS: One subject was excluded due to technical issues. Droplets were detected only in tests with instilled eye drop. Videos showed the tear film rolls away from the apex while remaining adherent to the ocular surface due to the tendency of the fluid to remain attached to a solid surface explained by the Coanda effect. Twelve out of 38 videos with an eye drop administration showed droplet formation. Only one resulted in droplets with predominantly forward motion, which had the shortest distance between air puff impact location and lower meniscus. This distance on average was 5.9  1.1 mm. The average droplet size was 500  200 m. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate no droplet formation under typical clinical setting. Hence, standard clinical use of NCT tests is not expected to cause droplets. NCT testing with eye drop administration showed droplet formation at the inferior eyelid boundary, which acts as a barrier and interrupts tear flow. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Study of tear film interaction with NCT air puff shows that these tonometers are not expected to cause droplet formation in standard use and that if external drops are required, both eyelids should be held if patients need assistance to maintain open eyes to avoid droplets with predominantly forward motion.","output":"Hydrodynamic Interaction Between Tear Film and Air Puff From Noncontact Tonometry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study explores the association of socioeconomic, demographic, and health-related variables at the regional level with COVID-19 related cases and deaths in Germany during the so-called first wave through mid-June 2020.

When a cue later occurs without punishment, this unexpected omission of aversive outcome is encoded as reward via activation of reward-encoding dopaminergic neurons. How such activation occurs remains unknown. Using real-time in vivo functional imaging, optogenetics, behavioral analysis and synaptic reconstruction from electron microscopy data, we identify the neural circuit mechanism through which Drosophila reward-encoding dopaminergic neurons are activated when an olfactory cue is unexpectedly no longer paired with electric shock punishment. Reduced activation of punishment-encoding dopaminergic neurons relieves depression of olfactory synaptic inputs to cholinergic neurons. Synaptic excitation by these cholinergic neurons of reward-encoding dopaminergic neurons increases their odor response, thus decreasing aversiveness of the odor. These studies reveal how an excitatory cholinergic relay from punishment- to reward-encoding dopaminergic neurons encodes the absence of punishment as reward, revealing a general circuit motif for updating aversive memories that could be present in mammals.","output":"Dopaminergic mechanism underlying reward-encoding of punishment omission during reversal learning in Drosophila."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The dramatic increase in virtual work during the COVID-19 pandemic boosted organizational capacity for virtual work, and is likely to result in a long-term increase in the number of employees working remotely Although virtual work has obvious advantages for both employees and organizations, it comes with many challenges In this article, we identify the challenges inherent in virtual work today, and describe their negative impact on employee stress, well-being, and performance We argue that managers must be proactive in addressing these challenges in order to fully leverage the benefits of virtual work We offer concrete strategies that they can use to counter the problems commonly encountered by virtual workers IEEE","output":"Managing Virtual Workers -- Strategies for Success"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Responsive design allows users to benefit from the web page without having to worry about screen size and resolution.

Methods : Seventy-four SARS-CoV-2 isolates were sequenced using Oxford Nanopore platforms. Generated reads were processed to obtain consensus genome sequences. Sequences with over 80% genome coverage were used for variant calling, phylogenetic analysis and classification using pangolin lineage annotation nomenclature. Results : Phylogenetic analysis based on Pangolin classification clustered South Kivu sequences into seven lineages (A.23.1, B.1.1.6, B.1.214, B.1.617.2, B.1.351, C.16 and P.1). The Delta (B.1.617.2) variant was the most dominant and responsible for outbreaks during the third wave. Based on Wuhan reference genome a total of 289 distinct mutations were detected including 141 missenses, 123 synonymous and 25 insertions/deletions when our isolates were mapped to Wuhan reference strain. The majority of these point mutations were located within the coding sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 genome that includes Spike, ORF1ab, ORF3, and nucleocapsid protein (N) genes. The most common mutation was D614G (1841A>G) observed in 61 sequences followed by L4715L (14143C>T) found in 60 sequences.

However, there is currently no consensus on the potential survival benefit of SpTR in GBM compared to gross total resection (GTR). In this study, we compare the impact of SpTR versus GTR on overall survival (OS) of GBM patients. METHODS We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of literature published on PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov, from inception to August 16, 2018, to identify articles comparing OS after SpTR versus GTR. RESULTS We identified 8902 unique citations, of which 11 articles met study inclusion criteria. 810 patients underwent SpTR out of a total of 2056 patients. 9 of 11 studies demonstrated improved outcomes with SpTR compared to GTR (median improvement in OS of 10.5 months), with no significant difference in postoperative complication rate. Overall study quality was variable, with ten studies presenting level IV evidence and one study presenting level IIIb evidence. Subgroup meta-analysis based on SpTR definition demonstrated a statistically significant 35% lower risk of mortality in patients who underwent anatomical SpTR compared to patients who underwent GTR (Hazard ratio = 0.65, 95% CI 0.47- 0.91, p = 0.003).

Covid-19 caused disruption to medical education. We ask how this disruption impacted PIF through the lens of the activities performed C or not performed C by medical students during the first wave of the covid-19 pandemic, and perceptions of conflicts between activities. METHOD: A pragmatic survey was distributed in spring 2020. Thematic analysis was performed of qualitative responses to two open questions. A social constructivist approach linked participants comments to PIF theory. RESULTS: We analysed 928 responses. Three themes surrounding students activities during covid-19 and their impact on identity were constructed: Status and role as a future doctor. Status and role as a student. Status and role as a member of the wider community. Conflict arose at the intersections between these themes. Students noted lack of clinical exposure was detrimental, implicitly recognising that aspects of PIF require the clinical environment. Participants were keen to volunteer but struggled with balancing academic work. Participants worried about risk to their households and the wider community and wanted their skills to add value in the clinical environment. Volunteers felt frustrated when they were unable to perform tasks aligning with their identity as a future doctor. An exception was participants who worked as interim FY1s, aligned with the role of an FY1. CONCLUSIONS: Medical students feel a duty to help during crises. Conflict arises when different aspects of their identity demand different actions.

To limit viral transmission of infection, by March 10th, 2020, the Italian Government has ordered a national lockdown, which established home confinement, home (smart) working, and temporary closure of non-essential businesses and schools. The present study investigated how these restrictive measures impacted mothers and their pre-school children's behavioral habits (i.e., sleep timing and quality, subjective time experience) and psychological well-being (i.e., emotion regulation, self-regulation capacity). An online survey was administered to 245 mothers with pre-school children (from 2 to 5 years). Mothers were asked to fill the survey thinking both on their habits, behaviors, and emotions and on those of their children during the quarantine, and retrospectively, before the national lockdown (i.e., in late February). A general worsening of sleep quality and distortion of time experience in both mothers and children, as well as increasing emotional symptoms and self-regulation difficulties in children, was observed. Moreover, even when the interplay between the behavioral and psychological factors was investigated, the factor that seems to mostly impact both mothers' and children's psychological well-being was their sleep quality. Overall, central institutions urgently need to implementing special programs for families, including not only psychological support to sustain families with working parents and ameliorating children's management.","output":"The interplay between mothers' and children behavioral and psychological factors during COVID-19: an Italian study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Central nervous system (CNS) infections are important causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide.

The aim of this study was to correlate microbiologic findings with comorbidities in patients with moderate to severe AECOPD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This multicenter observational study included patients with AECOPD seen at 28 hospitals in South Korea between January 2015 and December 2018, and the data were retrospectively collected. Pathogens were examined in patients with either pulmonary or extrapulmonary comorbidities, and compared to those of patients without comorbidities. The relationship between pathogen type and the number of comorbidities was also evaluated. RESULTS: Bacterial infections (178 [37.2%] vs 203 [28.7%], p = 0.002) and co-infections with bacteria and viruses (65 [13.6%] vs 57 [8.1%], p = 0.002) were more prevalent in patients with pulmonary comorbidities. Bacterial pathogens (280 [34.7%] vs 101 [26.7%], p=0.006) were detected at a higher rate in patients with extrapulmonary comorbidities. Previous pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), bronchiectasis, and diabetes mellitus were risk factors for bacterial infection, and congestive heart failure was a risk factor for bacterial and viral co-infection. As the number of comorbidities increased, the risk of bacterial infection increased considerably. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was more frequently identified in patients with previous PTB (57 [15.3%] vs 59 [7.4%], p < 0.001) and bronchiectasis (33 [19.6%] vs 83 [8.3%], p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: AECOPD patients with comorbidities were more likely to experience infection-related exacerbations compared to those without comorbidities.

However, in Taiwan, organic certification is not required before a food product claims itself organic. Since previous research showed that the COVID-19 lockdown effected both Spanish and Romanian subjects' intention to purchase more sustainable products, the aim of this study was to determine whether the perception of organic certification labeling makes a difference in how organic shoppers' purchasing intentions toward organic produce were realized. Data from organic produce shoppers were used to identify organic certification labeling differences. One group of shoppers was asked about their purchase behaviors toward government-certified organic produce labeled with the certification logo (N = 468), while the other was asked about their purchase behaviors toward self-claimed organic produce without a government certification logo (N = 403). Multi-group structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques were employed as the main method of analysis in this study. The results indicated that the hypothesized model was validated.

Therefore, predicting the patterns of droplet spreading in public transport environment is of primary importance. This paper puts forward a novel computational and artificial intelligence (AI) framework for fast prediction of the spread of droplets produced by a sneezing passenger in a bus. The formation of droplets of salvia is numerically modelled using a volume of fluid methodology applied to the mouth and lips of an infected person during the sneezing process. This is followed by a large eddy simulation of the resultant two phase flow in the vicinity of the person while the effects of droplet evaporation and ventilation in the bus are considered. The results are subsequently fed to an AI tool that employs deep learning to predict the distribution of droplets in the entire volume of the bus. This combined framework is two orders of magnitude faster than the pure computational approach. It is shown that the droplets with diameters less than 250 micrometers are most responsible for the transmission of the virus, as they can travel the entire length of the bus.","output":"Prediction of the spread of Corona-virus carrying droplets in a bus - A computational based artificial intelligence approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Approximately 900,000 U.S. children have heart conditions, such as congenital heart disease (1).

Oral health status and receipt of preventive dental care were compared between children with heart conditions (2,928) and without (116,826) using population-based 2016-2019 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) data. Approximately 83% of children with and 80% without heart conditions received preventive dental care in the past year (p = 0.06).

An important feature of GATases is the strong stimulation of glutaminase activity by the associated synthase. To understand the mechanism of this tight activity regulation, we probed by site-directed mutagenesis four residues of the glutaminase subunit TrpG from anthranilate synthase that are located between the catalytic Cys-His-Glu triad and the synthase subunit TrpE. In order to minimize structural perturbations induced by the introduced exchanges, the amino acids from TrpG were substituted with the corresponding residues of the closely related glutaminase HisH from imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase. Steady-state kinetic characterization showed that, in contrast to wild-type TrpG, two TrpG variants with single exchanges constitutively hydrolyzed glutamine in the absence of TrpE. A reaction assay performed with hydroxylamine as a stronger nucleophile replacing water and a filter assay with radiolabeled glutamine indicated that the formation of the thioester intermediate is the rate-limiting step of constitutive glutamine hydrolysis. Molecular dynamics simulations with wild-type TrpG and constitutively active TrpG variants suggest that the introduced amino acid exchanges result in a distance reduction between the active site Cys-His pair, which facilitates the deprotonation of the sulfhydryl group of the catalytic cysteine and thus enables its nucleophilic attack onto the carboxamide group of the glutamine side chain.

We aim to examine the prevalence and associated risk factors for psychological morbidities and fatigue in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Amidst the disease outbreak, 41 out of 105 COVID-19 patients in a local designated hospital in China were successfully assessed using a constellation of psychometric questionnaires to determine their psychological morbidities and fatigue. Several potential biopsychosocial risk factors (including pre-existing disabilities, CT severity score of pneumonia, social support, coping strategies) were assessed through multivariable logistic regression analyses to clarify their association with mental health in patients. RESULTS: 43.9% of 41 patients presented with impaired general mental health, 12.2% had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, 26.8% had anxiety and/or depression symptoms, and 53.6% had fatigue. We did not find any association between pneumonia severity and psychological morbidities or fatigue in COVID-19 patients. However, high perceived stigmatization was associated with an increased risk of impaired general mental health and high perceived social support was associated with decreased risk. Besides, negative coping inclination was associated with an increased risk of PTSD symptoms; high perceived social support was associated with a decreased risk of anxiety and/or depression symptoms.

Self-management may be an effective strategy for KOA, and clinicians have been showing increased interest recently. However, the effectiveness of self-management for KOA remains controversial. PURPOSE: This study aims to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of self-management for KOA. METHODS: We screened articles published in MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science until September 17, 2021. The main outcomes included pain, knee function, stiffness, WOMAC (total), physical function, arthritis self-efficacy (ASE-pain), arthritis self-efficacy (ASE-other symptoms), mental health, and quality of life. RESULTS: Thirteen randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were finally included (n = 1610). Meta-analysis showed differences in pain, knee function, stiffness, ASE-pain, ASE-other symptoms, mental health, and quality of life between the self-management and control groups. Of the nine outcomes evaluated, four were highly heterogeneous, and the quality of evidence ranged from very low to moderate. CONCLUSION: The meta-analysis results showed that self-management might help improve the pain, knee function, stiffness, ASE, mental health, and quality of life in patients with KOA. However, it has no significant effect on WOMAC (total) and physical function. Considering that this study has some limitations, we cannot draw clear conclusions based on the results of this study. Nevertheless, we offer much needed insight and encourage more rigorously designed and implemented RCTs in the future to substantiate our conclusions.","output":"Self-Management for Knee Osteoarthritis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although berberine alkaloids (BAs) are reported to be with broad-spectrum antibacterial and antiviral activities, the interactions among BAs have not been elucidated. In the present study, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was chosen as a model organism, and modified broth microdilution was applied for the determination of the fluorescence absorption values to calculate the anti-MRSA activity of BAs. We have initiated four steps to seek the optimal combination of BAs that are (1) determining the anti-MRSA activity of single BA, (2) investigating the two-component combination to clarify the interactions among BAs by checkerboard assay, (3) investigating the multicomponent combination to determine the optimal ratio by quadratic rotation-orthogonal combination design, and (4) in vivo and in vitro validation of the optimal combination. The results showed that the interactions among BAs are related to their concentrations.

Details on two underwater sites are reported: Cape Bruguieres, comprising > 260 recorded lithic artefacts at depths down to -2.4 m below sea level, and Flying Foam Passage where the find spot is associated with a submerged freshwater spring at -14 m. The sites were discovered through a purposeful research strategy designed to identify underwater targets, using an iterative process incorporating a variety of aerial and underwater remote sensing techniques and diver investigation within a predictive framework to map the submerged landscape within a depth range of 0-20 m. The condition and context of the lithic artefacts are analysed in order to unravel their depositional and taphonomic history and to corroborate their in situ position on a pre-inundation land surface, taking account of known geomorphological and climatic processes including cyclone activity that could have caused displacement and transportation from adjacent coasts. Geomorphological data and radiometric dates establish the chronological limits of the sites and demonstrate that they cannot be later than 7000 cal BP and 8500 cal BP respectively, based on the dates when they were finally submerged by sea-level rise. Comparison of underwater and onshore lithic assemblages shows differences that are consistent with this chronological interpretation. This article sets a foundation for the research strategies and technologies needed to identify archaeological targets at greater depth on the Australian continental shelf and elsewhere, building on the results presented.

It displays both orexigenic and anabolic properties via ghrelin mimetic activity and transient increases in growth hormone (GH). However, increasing GH and insulin-like growth factor-1 in cancer patients raises concerns of potentially stimulating tumor growth. Therefore, we investigated the effect of ghrelin and anamorelin on tumor growth in a murine NSCLC xenograft model. METHODS: Female nude mice (15C21/group) with established A549 tumors were administered ghrelin (2 mg/kg i.p.), anamorelin (3, 10, or 30 mg/kg p.o.), or vehicle controls daily for 28 days. Tumor growth, food consumption, and body weight were monitored. Murine growth hormone (mGH) and murine insulin-like growth factor-1 (mIGF-1) were measured in plasma. RESULTS: Tumor growth progressed throughout the study, with no significant differences between treatment groups. Daily food consumption was also relatively unchanged, while the percentage of mean body weight gain at the end of treatment was significantly increased in animals administered 10 and 30 mg/kg compared with controls (p < 0.01). Peak mGH levels were significantly higher in ghrelin- and anamorelin-treated animals than in controls, while peak mIGF-1 levels were slightly elevated but not statistically significant. All regimens were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that neither anamorelin nor ghrelin promoted tumor growth in this model, despite increased levels of mGH and a trend of increased mIGF-1. Together with anamorelins ability to increase body weight, these results support the clinical development of ghrelin receptor agonist treatments for managing NSCLC-related anorexia/cachexia.","output":"Effect of ghrelin and anamorelin (ONO-7643), a selective ghrelin receptor agonist, on tumor growth in a lung cancer mouse xenograft model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Herd immunity is achieved when in a population, immune individuals are in a sufficiently large proportion.

For Germany, the number of studies is limited. Previous estimations of mortality in Germany are outdated or based on claims data analyses. Various authors discuss whether lacking quality initiatives and treatment standards in Germany could cause higher mortality for sepsis. This contrasts with the internationally well-recognized performance of the German intensive care infrastructure during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to estimate 30-day and 90-day mortality of patients with sepsis and patients with septic shock in Germany and to compare the mortality with that of other industrialized regions (Europe, North America). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic literature search included interventional and observational studies published between 2009 and 2020 in PubMed and the Cochrane Library that analyzed adult patients with sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock in Europe and North America. Studies with less than 20 patients were excluded. The 30-day and 90-day mortality for sepsis and septic shock were pooled separately for studies conducted in Germany, Europe (excluding Germany) and North America in a meta-analysis using a random effects model. Mortality over time was analyzed in a linear regression model. RESULTS: Overall, 134 studies were included. Of these, 15 studies were identified for the estimation of mortality in Germany, covering 10,434 patients, the number of patients per study ranged from 28 to 4183 patients. The 30-day mortality for sepsis was 22.67% (95% confidence interval, CI: 15.30C30.04%) in Germany, 23.85% (95% CI: 20.49C27.21%) in Europe (excluding Germany) and 19.58% (95% CI: 14.03C25.14%) in North America. The 30-day mortality for septic shock was 30.48% (95% CI: 29.30C31.67%) in Germany, 34.57% (95% CI: 33.51C35.64%) in Europe (excluding Germany) and 33.69% (95% CI: 31.51C35.86%) in North America. The 90-day mortality for septic shock was 38.78% (95% CI: 32.70C44.86%) in Germany, 41.90% (95% CI: 38.88C44.91%) in Europe (excluding Germany) and 34.41% (95% CI: 25.66C43.16%) in North America. A comparable decreasing trend in sepsis 30-day mortality was observed in all considered regions since 2009. CONCLUSION: Our analysis does not support the notion that mortality related to sepsis and septic shock in Germany is higher in international comparison. A higher mortality would not be obvious either, since intensive care, for example also during the COVID-19 pandemic, is regarded as exemplary in Germany and the structural quality, such as the number of intensive care beds per 100,000 inhabitants, is high in international comparison. Nevertheless, deficits could also exist outside intensive care medicine. A comparison of international individual studies should take greater account of the structure of healthcare systems, the severity of disease and the limitations resulting from the data sources used.","output":"Sterblichkeit bei Sepsis und septischem Schock in Deutschland.

Despite availability of antibiotics (i.e., penicillin, doxycycline, or clarithromycin) and conjugate vaccines (e.g., PCVs), it is still challenging to treat because of its drug resistance ability. The rise of antibiotic resistance in S. pneumoniae is a major source of concern across the world. Computational subtractive genomics is one of the most applied techniques in which the whole proteome of the bacterial pathogen is gradually reduced to a limited number of potential therapeutic targets. Whole-genome sequencing has greatly reduced the time required and provides more opportunities for drug target identification. The goal of this work is to evaluate and analyze metabolic pathways in serotype 14 of S. pneumonia to identify potential drug targets. In the present study, 47 potent drug targets were identified against S. pneumonia by employing the computational subtractive genomics approach. Among these, two proteins are prioritized (i.e., 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase and Sensor histidine kinase uniquely present in S. pneumonia) as novel drug targets and selected for further structure-based studies. The identified proteins may provide a platform for the discovery of a lead drug candidate that may be capable of inhibiting these proteins and, therefore, could be helpful in minimizing the associated risk related to the drug-resistant S. pneumoniae. Finally, these enzymatic proteins could be of prime interest against S. pneumoniae to design rational targeted therapy.","output":"Comparative Metabolic Pathways Analysis and Subtractive Genomics Profiling to Prioritize Potential Drug Targets Against Streptococcus pneumoniae"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A study was made on the attitudes of 76 students of the Food Technology subjects of the Universidad Nacional de Frontera [1], during the 32 virtual sessions that covered the 2020-I academic semester, Covid 19 world pandemic period;in which it was determined that their own inner motivation, which has no weight in the subject, affects the final grade obtained at the end of the semester The hypothesis asks whether there is a significant relationship between the independent variable called Intrinsic attitudes (Number of participations minus number of tardiness), obtaining three levels of variable: positive, neutral or negative, in comparison with the dependent variable called Final grade, with two levels of variable: passed or failed It was determined that the asymptotic sig value of the pearson chi square of 0 002 less than 0 05 (5% significance level), means that there is dependence between the two variables ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG","output":"Influence of Participation and Tardiness to Synchronous Learning Sessions as a Motivation Factor for E-Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Few methods for the detection of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 currently have the capability to simultaneously detect two genes in a single test, which is a key measure to improve detection accuracy, as adopted by the gold standard RT\\\\qPCR method Developed here is a CRISPR/Cas9\\\\mediated triple\\\\line lateral flow assay (TL\\\\LFA) combined with multiplex reverse transcription\\\\recombinase polymerase amplification (RT\\\\RPA) for rapid and simultaneous dual\\\\gene detection of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 in a single strip test This assay is characterized by the detection of envelope (E) and open reading frame 1ab (Orf1ab) genes from cell\\\\cultured SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 and SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 viral RNA standards, showing a sensitivity of 100 RNA copies per reaction (25 L) Furthermore, dual\\\\gene analysis of 64 nasopharyngeal swab samples showed 100 % negative predictive agreement and 97 14 % positive predictive agreement This platform will provide a more accurate and convenient pathway for diagnosis of COVID\\\\19 or other infectious diseases in low\\\\resource regions","output":"Simultaneous Dual\\\\Gene Diagnosis of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 Based on CRISPR/Cas9\\\\Mediated Lateral Flow Assay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nucleoside and nucleotide analogues are essential antivirals in the treatment of infectious diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV).

Endosymbionts also pose a risk to their hosts because of the mutational decay of their genomes through genetic drift or to selfish mutations that favor symbiont fitness over host fitness. One model for heritable endosymbiosis is the association of aphids with their obligate bacterial symbiont, Buchnera We experimentally established heteroplasmic pea aphid matrilines containing pairs of closely related Buchnera haplotypes and used deep sequencing of diagnostic markers to measure haplotype frequencies in successive host generations. These frequencies were used to estimate the effective population size of Buchnera within hosts (i.e., the transmission bottleneck size) and the extent of within-host selection. The within-host effective population size was in the range of 10 to 20, indicating a strong potential for genetic drift and fixation of deleterious mutations. Remarkably, closely related haplotypes were subject to strong within-host selection, with selection coefficients as high as 0.5 per aphid generation. In one case, the direction of selection depended on the thermal environment and went in the same direction as between-host selection. In another, a new mutant haplotype had a strong within-host advantage under both environments but had no discernible effect on host-level fitness under laboratory conditions. Thus, within-host selection can be strong, resulting in a rapid fixation of mutations with little impact on host-level fitness. Together, these results show that within-host selection can drive evolution of an obligate symbiont, accelerating sequence evolution.","output":"Strong within-host selection in a maternally inherited obligate symbiont: Buchnera and aphids."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] SARS-CoV-2 infection has become a major public health burden and affects many organs including lungs, kidneys, the liver, and the brain.

This retrospective cohort study was conducted from October 2010 to March 2019 at the Showa University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan. We enrolled 94 AHRF patients who had bilateral opacities and received mechanical ventilation in ICU to investigate their prognostic markers including S/F ratio. Significant differences were observed for APACHE II, S/F ratio, PaO(2)/FiO(2) (P/F) ratio, and ventilator?free-days at day 28 for ICU mortality, and for age, S/F ratio, P/F ratio, duration of mechanical ventilation, and ventilator?free days at day 28 for hospital mortality.

Alcohol abuse was measured using the Cut down, Annoyed, Guilty, Eye opener (CAGE) questionnaire score of 2. All participants responded to the seven\\\\item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD\\\\7). Hierarchical logistic regression was also conducted. RESULTS: Among the 1050 students evaluated, 18.7% (n = 196) had a positive screening for alcohol abuse during the pandemic. The prevalence of mild (GAD\\\\7 = 5C9), moderate (GAD\\\\7 = 10C14), and severe (GAD\\\\7 15) anxiety among students were 31.3%, 29.6%, and 24.2%, respectively. The final hierarchical logistic regression model showed that during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, anxiety levels predict the likelihood of alcohol abuse among students with moderate (OR 10.05 [95% IC: 4.12C24.52]) or severe (OR 15.82 [95% IC: 6.46C38.73]) anxiety, especially for male students (moderate anxiety: OR 17.06 [95% CI: 8.36C34.78]; severe anxiety: OR 28.38 [95% CI: 8.62C38.24]).

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to estimate the dose-dependent effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines to prevent severe illness in real-world conditions in Costa Rica, after the Delta variant became dominant. METHODS: This observational study is a secondary analysis of hospitalization prevalence. The sample is all 3.67 million adult residents living in Costa Rica by mid-2021. The study is based on public aggregated data of 5978 COVID-19Crelated hospital records from September 14, 2021, to October 20, 2021, and 6.1 million vaccination doses administered to determine hospitalization prevalence by dose-specific vaccination status. The intervention retrospectively evaluated is vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech (78%) and Oxford-AstraZeneca (22%). The main outcome studied is being hospitalized. RESULTS: Vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization (VEH) was estimated as 93.4% (95% CI 93.0-93.9) for complete vaccination and 76.7% (95% CI 75.0-78.3) for single-dose vaccination among adults of all ages. VEH was lower and more uncertain among older adults aged 58 years: 92% (95% CI 91%-93%) for those who had received full vaccination and 64% (95% CI 58%-69%) for those who had received partial vaccination. Single-dose VEH declined over time during the study period, especially in the older age group. Estimates were sensitive to possible errors in the population count used to determine the residual number of unvaccinated people when vaccine coverage is high. CONCLUSIONS: The Costa Rican COVID-19 vaccination program that administered Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines seems to be highly effective at preventing COVID-19Crelated hospitalization after the Delta variant became dominant. Even a single dose seems to provide some degree of protection, which is good news for people whose second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was postponed several weeks to more rapidly increase the number of people vaccinated with a first dose. Timely monitoring of vaccine effectiveness is important to detect eventual failures and motivate the public to get vaccinated by providing information regarding the effectiveness of the vaccines.","output":"The Effectiveness of Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca Vaccines to Prevent Severe COVID-19 in Costa Rica: Nationwide, Ecological Study of Hospitalization Prevalence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has been a global threat to humankind.

METHODS: We sampled gravid female Culex pipiens L. and Culex restuans Theobald from the field, allowed them to oviposit in the laboratory, and characterized the bacterial communities associated with their egg rafts and midguts for comparison through MiSeq sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. RESULTS: Bacterial richness was higher in egg rafts than in midguts for both species, and higher in Cx pipiens than Cx. restuans. The midgut samples of Cx. pipiens and Cx. restuans were dominated by Providencia. Culex pipiens and Cx. restuans egg rafts samples were dominated by Ralstonia and Novosphingobium, respectively. NMDS ordination based on Bray-Curtis distance matrix revealed that egg-raft samples, or midgut tissues harbored similar bacterial communities regardless of the mosquito species. Within each mosquito species, there was a distinct clustering of bacterial communities between egg raft and midgut tissues. CONCLUSION: These findings expand the list of described bacterial communities associated with Cx. pipiens and Cx. restuans and the additional characterization of the egg raft bacterial communities facilitates comparative analysis of mosquito host tissues, providing a basis for future studies seeking to understand any functional role of the bacterial communities in mosquito biology.

Concerning the recent imposition of COVID-19 societal lockdown, this study attempts to investigate the impacts of COVID-19 lockdown on the changes in noise pollution levels before, during, and after lockdown phase in different residential, commercial, industrial, and silence zones of the city of Kanpur, India. Utilizing data collected from portable environmental sensors, the average noise levels before lockdown and during lockdown were found to be in the range of 44.85 dB to 79.57 dB and 38.55 dB to 57.79 dB, respectively, for different zones. Although a significant reduction in the noise levels was observed during lockdown, except for commercial zone, all other monitoring stations had reported sound levels quite higher than the recommended noise limits set by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) of India. Results further indicated that the impact of road traffic noise on risk of high annoyance and sleep disturbance was found to be lower during lockdown as compared to that of pre-lockdown and unlock phase. While the annoyance level in residential (86.23%), industrial (87.44%), and silence (84.47%) was higher in pre-lockdown period, it reduced to 41.25, 50.28, and 43.07% in the lockdown phase.

Of these, 14 patients (22.6%) had COVID-19 and 48 patients (77.4%) did not have COVID-19. RESULTS: Of the 62 patients included in the study, 41 (66.1%) were male and 21 (33.9%) were female. The mean age was 28.90  16.86 (range, 16C84) years. The most common symptom at admission was chest pain (54.8%). The mean age of the patients with COVID-19 was 39.35  23.04 years and that of the patients without COVID-19 was 25.85  13.45 years (P < 0.001). In receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis, the area under the curve for age was 0.785 (95% confidence interval: 0.648C0.922) and the optimal cut-off value was 24 years for COVID-19-positive patients.

However, due to complex feature behaviors and expensive annotations of US images, it is difficult to apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) assisting approaches for lung's multi-symptom (multi-label) classification. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a novel semi-supervised Two-Stream Active Learning (TSAL) method to model complicated features and reduce labeling costs in an iterative procedure. The core component of TSAL is the multi-label learning mechanism, in which label correlations information is used to design multi-label margin (MLM) strategy and confidence validation for automatically selecting informative samples and confident labels. On this basis, a multi-symptom multi-label (MSML) classification network is proposed to learn discriminative features of lung symptoms, and a human-machine interaction is exploited to confirm the final annotations that are used to fine-tune MSML with progressively labeled data. Moreover, a novel lung US dataset named COVID19-LUSMS is built, currently containing 71 clinical patients with 6,836 images sampled from 678 videos.

The mean absolute percentage error generated by COVID-19Net was 1.447 for Germany, 1.801 for Italy, and 2.828 for Spain, which was considerably better than those of the other models. This indicated that the proposed framework could accurately predict the accumulated number of confirmed cases in the three countries and serve as an essential reference for devising public health strategies.

This paper recognizes the need for instructors to personalize their approach in supporting students needs. While there are opportunities to create automated systems to help instructors personalize their interventions, much care must be taken to prevent the introduction of unintended outcomes. In this study, we designed a weekly personalized intervention cycle based on students self-reports. The effect of such personalized intervention was then evaluated using a repeated measure ANOVA. Findings suggest that students receiving personalized interventions were more time efficient in makerspaces and on assignments. Additionally, they reported a lower level of frustration. Students with personalized intervention, however, expressed a lower sense of community. This suggests that while additional data provided to instructors can support personalized assistance, a more nuanced approach may be needed to avoid unintended consequences.","output":"The Double-Edged Sword of Automating Personalized Interventions in Makerspaces: An Exploratory Study of Potential Benefits and Drawbacks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: New Zealand's response to the COVID-19 pandemic was one of the most restrictive lockdowns of any country, inevitably causing stress for many people. Because situations that increase stress and anxiety are associated with higher smoking prevalence, we examined self-reported smoking before and during the lockdown, and analyzed factors associated with reported changes in cigarette consumption. AIMS AND METHODS: We conducted an online panel survey of a demographically representative sample of 2010 adult New Zealanders during the COVID-19 lockdown; the final, weighted sample included 261 daily smokers and 71 weekly smokers. We measured psychological distress and anxiety, as well as situational factors, tobacco consumption, and demographic attributes. RESULTS: Nearly half of daily smokers reported smoking more during than before the lockdown, on average, an increase of six cigarettes a day; increased daily cigarette consumption was associated with loneliness and isolation. Most weekly smokers reported either that their smoking during the lockdown had not changed or had slightly reduced. CONCLUSIONS: Smoking cessation services need to anticipate that unexpected disruptions, such as pandemic lockdowns, may be associated with increased daily tobacco consumption, and that this increase may be sustained after lockdown. While public health responses to pandemics predictably focus on immediate and obvious consequences, interventions to support recent quitters and those making quit attempts should also form a key component of pandemic planning. IMPLICATIONS: As governments introduce unprecedented measures to manage COVID-19, they need also to consider other public health risks, such as increased smoking among current smokers or relapse among recent quitters. Evidence that loneliness was associated with increased smoking during a lockdown suggests a need for cessation out-reach strategies that promote and support smoke-free practices.","output":"Changes in Tobacco Use During the 2020 COVID-19 Lockdown in New Zealand"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to ravage communities across the world. Despite its primary effect on the respiratory system, the virus does not solely impact those with underlying lung conditions as initially predicted. Indeed, prognosis is worsened (often fatal) in patients with pre-existing hyperinflammatory responses (e.g., hypertension, obesity, diabetes), yet the mechanisms by which this occurs are unknown. A number of psychological conditions are associated with inflammation, suggesting that these may also be significant risk factors for negative outcomes of COVID-19. In this review, we evaluate preclinical and clinical literature suggesting that chronic stress-induced hyperinflammation interacts synergistically with COVID-19-related inflammation, contributing to a potentially fatal cytokine storm syndrome. In particular, we hypothesize that both chronic stress and COVID-19-related hyperinflammation are a product of glucocorticoid insufficiency. We discuss the devastating effects of SARS-CoV-2 on structural and functional aspects of the biological stress response and how these induce exaggerated inflammatory responses, particularly interleukin (IL)-6 hypersecretion. We postulate that chronic stress should be considered a significant risk factor for adverse COVID-19-related health outcomes, given overlapping peripheral and central immune dysregulation in both conditions. We conclude by discussing how people with a history of chronic stress could mitigate their risk for COVID-19 complications, identifying specific strategies that can be implemented during self-isolation.

Here, we utilized small RNA sequencing and bioinformatic analyses to characterize miRNA expression profiles in the liver of domestic cats at 7 days after oral infection with T. gondii (Type II) strain. A total of 384 miRNAs were identified and 82 were differentially expressed, of which 33 were up-regulated and 49 down-regulated. Also, 5690 predicted host gene targets for the differentially expressed miRNAs were identified using the bioinformatic algorithm miRanda. Gene ontology analysis revealed that the predicted gene targets of the dysregulated miRNAs were significantly enriched in apoptosis. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis showed that the predicted gene targets were involved in several pathways, including acute myeloid leukemia, central carbon metabolism in cancer, choline metabolism in cancer, estrogen signaling pathway, fatty acid degradation, lysosome, nucleotide excision repair, progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation, and VEGF signaling pathway.

METHOD AND RESULTS: Patients with unilateral and isolated angle or condylar fractures were included in this retrospective, cross-sectional study. Data was collected from patient records and panoramic x-rays. The predictor variables included the type of occlusal support and the presence or absence of third molars. The outcome variable was angle or condylar fracture, while other predictor variables included demographic factors. Bivariate (&#967;2 test) and logistic regression analyses were conducted to investigate the associations between variables and the outcome. 43 angle (mean age: 29.9  12.8 years; 98.4% male) and 37 condylar (mean age: 46.8  20.2 years; 62.2% male) fracture cases were included in this study. Bilateral occlusal support was present in 81.4% of angle fracture group and in 51.3% of condylar fracture group (p<0.001). In the case of bilateral occlusal support, an odds ratio (OR) of 4.2 was found for angle fractures (p<0.006). A third molar was present in 86% of the angle fracture group and in 43.2% of the condylar fracture group (p<0.001). The presence of a third molar exhibited an odds ratio of 8.1 for the angle fractures (p<0.001). When bilateral occlusal support and third molar were present simultaneously, the risk was 15.9 times higher for an angle fracture (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The presence of occlusal support and/or third molars was significantly associated with angle fractures, however, the absence of occlusal support and/or third molars significantly correlated with condylar fractures.

Given the time limitations (due to their heavy workloads) and need to minimize face-to-face interventions (in order to avoid contagions), psychological interventions for FHCWs should be as brief and remote as possible. Objective To evaluate the usability and clarity of evidence-based psycho-educational videos to prevent B&CF, to deal with uncooperative, hostile, and anxious patients and relatives, and to use personal protective equipment (PPE), from the perspective of Mexican FLHCWs. Method Based on a convenience sampling by intensity approach, videos were distributed requesting feedback based on specific questions through WhatsApp to FLHCWs. Field notes were used to triangulate the information. Results Content analysis of feedback from a final sample of 24 participants &#8210;75% women, 42  8.4 years old&#8210; yielded three general thematic categories and seven subthemes: 1. content evaluation, which included three subthemes: utility, pertinence, and practicality; 2. dissemination and other needs, with two subcategories: willingness to share and receive more videos (other needs); and 3. format aspects, also comprising two subthemes: attractiveness and duration. All participants found the videos content very beneficial, relevant, and applicable to the workplace and even in their everyday personal and family life, and were willing to share them and to receive more videos on other issues, including strategies to manage problems related to isolation.

Users of the COVID Symptom Study smartphone application reported use of aspirin and other NSAIDs between March 24 and May 8, 2020. Users were queried daily about symptoms, COVID-19 testing, and healthcare seeking behavior. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to determine the risk of COVID-19 among according to aspirin or non-aspirin NSAID users. Among 2,736,091 individuals in the U.S., U.K., and Sweden, we documented 8,966 incident reports of a positive COVID-19 test over 60,817,043 person-days of follow-up. Compared to non-users and after stratifying by age, sex, country, day of study entry, and race/ethnicity, non-aspirin NSAID use was associated with a modest risk for testing COVID-19 positive (HR 1.23 [1.09, 1.32]), but no significant association was observed among aspirin users (HR 1.13 [0.92, 1.38]). After adjustment for lifestyle factors, comorbidities and baseline symptoms, any NSAID use was not associated with risk (HR 1.02 [0.94, 1.10]). Results were similar for those seeking healthcare for COVID-19 and were not substantially different according to lifestyle and sociodemographic factors or after accounting for propensity to receive testing.

Materials and methods This retrospective study was conducted in the general surgery department of Nishtar Medical University/Hospital Multan from April 2020 to September 2020. Patients of peritonitis who presented with bilateral pulmonary crepitations, SpO2 less than 92%, PaO2 less than 60 mmHg on arterial blood gas (ABG), and chest x-ray (CXR) finding of bilateral infiltrates are included. Due to high suspicion of associated coronavirus infection such patients needed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for virus detection and special measures were required for resuscitation before any definitive treatment. A delay of six to eight hours is usually encountered while ensuring proper safety measures and dedicated operation theaters. Initial resuscitation started with intravenous fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics were given to all patients. Twenty-seven patients were resuscitated with preoperative intraperitoneal drainage while waiting for PCR and 13 patients were resuscitated without drainage. Data analysis was carried out using the statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS) version 19 software. The mean was calculated for age while frequency and percentages were calculated for gender, comorbidities, and causes of delay. The mortality was compared using the chi-square test. Results The mean age of patients was 43.73  16.04 years. The common cause of peritonitis were perforations due to duodenal ulcer, typhoid, tuberculous (TB), and biliary origin. The variables that led to suspicion of coronavirus were SpO2 < 92%, PaO2 <60mmHg and bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray. PCR for coronavirus was positive in nine patients. Mortality was 29.6% in those resuscitated with intraperitoneal drainage before the definitive procedure and 54% in those not resuscitated with intraperitoneal drainage. Conclusions The surge of coronavirus infection has put the healthcare staff at great risk. This has led to strict protocols and precautionary measures in the management of patients with perforation peritonitis with suspected corona infection. The local guidelines for the management of patients with acute abdomen should include aggressive measures right from the start during the corona pandemic.

There are no data on the impact of the IVDR on laboratories in the European Union. Methods Laboratory tests performed in UZ Leuven were divided in four groups: core laboratory, immunology, special chemistry, and molecular microbiology testing. Each test was classified as Conformit Europenne (CE)-IVD, modified/off-label CE-IVD, commercial Research Use Only (RUO) or LDT. Each matrix was considered a separate test. Results We found that 97.6% of the more than 11.5 million results/year were generated with a CE-IVD method. Of the 922 different laboratory tests, however, only 41.8% were CE-IVD, 10.8% modified/off-label CE-IVD, 0.3% RUO, and 47.1% LDT. Off-label CE-IVD was mainly used to test alternative matrices not covered by the claim of the manufacturer (e.g., pleural or peritoneal fluid). LDTs were mainly used for special chemistry, flow cytometry, and molecular testing. Excluding flow cytometry, the main reasons for the use of 377 LDTs were lack of a CE-IVD method (71.9%), analytical requirements (14.3%), and the fact the LDT was in use before CE-IVD available (11.9%). Conclusions While the large majority of results (97.6%) were generated with a CE-IVD method, only 41.8% of laboratory tests were CE-IVD. There is currently no alternative on the market for 71.5% of the 537 LDTs performed in our laboratory which do not fall within the scope of the current IVD directive (IVDD).

It is thus important to elucidate the radiation-induced effects of germ cell maturation, fertilization and embryonic development. It is well known that DNA methylation levels in CpG sites in gametes are reprogrammed in stages during their maturity. Furthermore, the binding of Izumo on the surface of sperm and Juno on the surface of oocytes is essential for fertilization. Thus, there is a possibility that these genes are useful indicators to evaluate fertility in mice after irradiation exposure. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed global DNA methylation patterns in the testes and gene expression of Izumo1 and Izumo1r (Juno) in the gonads of mice after neonatal acute high-dose ionizing radiation (HDR) and chronic low-dose ionizing radiation (LDR). One-week-old male and female mice were irradiated with a total dose of 4 Gy, with acute HDR at 7 days at a dose rate of 30 Gy/h and LDR continuously at a dose rate of 6 mGy/h from 7 to 35 days.

The results of global DNA methylation patterns in the testes showed that methylation level increased with age in the control group, the LDR group maintained its DNA methylation level, and the HDR group showed decreased DNA methylation levels with age. In the control group, the gene expression level of Izumo1 in the testis did not show age-related changes, although there was high expression at 100 days of age. However, in the LDR group, the expression level recovered after the end of irradiation, while it remained low regardless of age in the HDR group. Conversely, gene expression of Izumo1r (Izumo1 receptor) in the ovary decreased with age in the control group. Although the gene expression of Izumo1r decreased with age in the LDR group, it remained low in the HDR group. Our results indicate that LDR can induce different DNA methylation patterns, and both high- and low-dose radiation before sexual maturity might affect gametogenesis and fertility.","output":"Evaluation of Global DNA Methylation and Gene Expression of Izumo1 and Izumo1r in Gonads after High- and Low-Dose Radiation in Neonatal Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dangerous conditions and worker injuries in the rapidly growing warehousing industry have gained attention in recent years, with accounts typically drawing on worker reports and investigative journalism.

Limitations in early disease intervention highlight the need for effective diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Protein C's role as an anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory molecule makes it an appealing target for sepsis biomarker studies. This meta-analysis aims to assess the diagnostic and prognostic value of protein C (PC) as a biomarker for adult sepsis. METHODS We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL and Cochrane Library from database inception to September 12, 2021. We included prospective observational studies of (1) adult patients (> 17) with sepsis or suspicion of sepsis that; (2) measured PC levels with 24 h of study admission with; and (3) the goal of examining PC as a diagnostic or prognostic biomarker. Two authors screened articles and conducted risk of bias (RoB) assessment, using the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) and the Quality Assessment in Diagnostic Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tools. If sufficient data were available, meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the standardized mean difference (SMD) between patient populations. RESULTS Twelve studies were included, and 8 were synthesized for meta-analysis. Pooled analysis demonstrated moderate certainty of evidence that PC levels were less reduced in sepsis survivors compared to non-survivors (6 studies, 741 patients, SMD = 0.52, 95% CI 0.24-0.81, p = 0.0003, I2 = 55%), and low certainty of evidence that PC levels were less reduced in septic patients without disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) compared to those with DIC (3 studies, 644 patients, SMD = 0.97, 95% CI 0.62-1.32, p < 0.00001, I2 = 67%). PC could not be evaluated as a diagnostic tool due to heterogeneous control populations between studies. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE Our review demonstrates that PC levels were significantly higher in sepsis survivors compared to non-survivors and patients with sepsis but not disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Our evaluation is limited by high RoB in included studies and poor reporting of the sensitivity and specificity of PC as a sepsis biomarker. Future studies are needed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of PC to identify its clinical significance as a biomarker for early sepsis recognition.

Building on our previous surveys during the months of May and June, we report the findings of two additional survey waves collected in early (7-10) and late (21-23) July among nationally representative samples (N = 1064 and N = 1023, respectively). The results show that the decline in compliance that was observed from May to June seems to have halted. At the same time, important predictors of compliance C such as citizens capacity to comply, perceptions of the threat of the virus, and support for mitigation measures C have ceased to decrease, or are increasing. Taken together, these findings suggest that Dutch citizens compliance with mitigation measures may be on the rise again. However, our findings also suggest that social norms for compliance continue to be eroding, which may continue to dampen citizens tendency to comply.","output":"Maintaining Compliance when the Virus Returns: Understanding Adherence to Social Distancing Measures in the Netherlands in July 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Low-grade fever during convalescence is an atypical symptom of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

METHODS: After ethical approval, we reviewed the medical records, retrospectively, of children with COVID-19 or MIS-C requiring surgical consultation for severe gastrointestinal symptoms. RESULTS: The subjects comprised 15 children, 13 with MIS-C and 2 with COVID-19. Twelve children (80%) had been in known close contact with a person with SARS-CoV-19 and 13 were positive for Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG. All the children had experienced fever for at least 1 day and had signs of involvement of two or more systems. Three patients required surgical intervention: one underwent surgical exploration with a presumptive diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the referring center and was transported to our center following clinical deterioration, where a diagnosis of MIS-C was confirmed; and the remaining two developed appendicitis during hospitalization for COVID-19. All three patients had a longer duration of abdominal pain, a higher number of lymphocytes, and a lower level of inflammatory markers than the non-surgically managed patients. None of the patients presenting with MIS-C underwent surgical exploration. CONCLUSION: Gastrointestinal involvement may mimic acute abdomen in children with COVID-19.

In fact, blood's special properties consistently clashed with most materials used in medical practice, provoking a series of material exchanges. Drawing on a combination of epistemological and network approaches, three exemplary cases are presented to examine blood's encounters with plastics, plant and animal extracts: William M. Bayliss's (1860-1926) injections of dissolved gum acacia to expand diminished blood volume; Charles H. Best's (1899-1978) production of the anticoagulant heparin from animal organs; and the preservation of fragile blood cells by silicone coatings inside of John H. Gibbon Jr.'s (1903-1973) heart-lung machine. The case studies demonstrate how the complementarity of blood and these materials produced hybridizations between medicine and a range of industrial branches, from colonial forestry and meatpacking to commercial chemistry.

VHI scores were collected via Google Forms (Google, Mountain View, California), targeting 2 groups of speakers of different nationalities, Portuguese (n = 261) and Spanish (n = 297). A Wilcoxon test was carried out to compare VHI scores between With and Without conditions for each group of speakers; a Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare groups within each condition. Results suggested that VHI overall scores and scores for all dimensions were higher for the With condition, for both Portuguese and Spanish speakers.

METHODS AND RESULTS Bilateral thoracoscopic box isolation was performed with a bipolar RF clamp. Entrance block was defined as absence of a conducted electrogram within the box, while exit block was confirmed by pacing at 10.0 V/2 ms.

Therefore, it is crucial for TB-elimination programs to identify catastrophic costs and their main drivers in order to establish appropriate health and social measures. This study aimed to measure the percent of catastrophic costs experienced by Egyptian TB patients and to identify its determinants. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study with 151 Egyptian TB patients recruited from two chest dispensaries from the Cairo governate from May 2019 to May 2020. We used a validated World Health Organization TB patient-cost tool to collect data on patients demographic information, household income, and direct and indirect expense of seeking TB treatment. We considered catastrophic TB costs to be total costs exceeding 20% of the households annual income. RESULTS: Of the patients, 33% experienced catastrophic costs. The highest proportion of the total came in the pretreatment stage. Being the main breadwinner, experiencing job loss, selling property, and the occurrence of early coronavirus disease 2019 lockdown were independent determinants of the incidence of catastrophic costs. Borrowing money and selling property were the most-often reported coping strategies adopted. CONCLUSION: Despite the availability of free TB care under the Egyptian National TB Program, nearly a third of the TB patients incurred catastrophic costs.

The permeability  surface area product per unit mass of tissue (PS) in brain tumors was estimated in this study by combining the blood flow obtained through pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (PCASL) and K(trans) obtained through DCE MRI. An analytical analysis and a numerical simulation were conducted to understand how errors in the flow and K(trans) estimates would propagate to the resulting PS. Fourteen pediatric patients with brain tumors were scanned on a clinical 3-T MRI scanner. PCASL perfusion imaging was performed using a three-dimensional (3D) fast-spin-echo readout module to determine blood flow. DCE imaging was performed using a 3D spoiled gradient-echo sequence, and the K(trans) map was obtained with the extended Tofts model. The numerical analysis demonstrated that the uncertainty of PS was predominantly dependent on that of K(trans) and was relatively insensitive to the flow. The average PS values of the whole tumors ranged from 0.006 to 0.217 min(-1), with a mean of 0.050 min(-1) among the patients. The mean K(trans) value was 18% lower than the PS value, with a maximum discrepancy of 25%. When the parametric maps were compared on a voxel-by-voxel basis, the discrepancies between PS and K(trans) appeared to be heterogeneous within the tumors. The PS values could be more than two-fold higher than the K(trans) values for voxels with high K(trans) levels.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between school closure date and onset of increased DKA to help clarify the etiology of the increased incidence. DESIGN: A multi-center, quality-controlled Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) database was used to identify the number of admissions to a participating PICU with DKA on each calendar day from 60 days before local school closure to 90 days after, and compared to baseline data from the same periods in 2018C2019. Interrupted time series and multiple linear regression analyses were used to identify admission rates that differed significantly between 2020 and baseline. SETTING: Eighty-one PICUs in the United States Participants: Children ages 29 days to 17 years admitted to a PICU with DKA Exposures: Statewide school closure Main outcome/measure: Rate of admission to the PICU for DKA. RESULTS: There were 1936 admissions for children with DKA in 2020 and 1795 admissions/year to those same PICUs in 2018-2019. Demographics and clinical outcomes did not differ before school closure, but pandemic-era patients were less often white and had longer hospital length of stay in the post-school closure period. The difference between 2020 admissions and 2018-2019 admissions was not different than zero before school closure, and significantly higher than zero after school closure, but was significantly increased in 2020 at >30 days after school closure (p = 0.039). CONCLUSIONS/RELEVANCE: An increase in pediatric DKA admissions began one month after school closures. Given that behavioral changes started near school closure dates and viral activity peaked weeks after, this suggests that behavioral factors may not be the primary etiology and it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 infection may have direct effects on pediatric DKA.","output":"The Temporal Relationship Between Local School Closure and Increased Incidence of Pediatric Diabetic Ketoacidosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has posed a unique challenge to health care systems globally. To curb COVID-19 transmission, mitigation measures such as travel restrictions, border closures, curfews, lockdowns, and social distancing have been implemented. However, these measures may directly and indirectly affect the delivery and utilization of essential health services, including malaria services. The suspension of indoor residual spraying (IRS) and insecticide-treated net (ITN) distribution, shortages of malaria commodities, and reduced demand for health services have hindered the continued delivery of malaria services. The overall goal of this analysis was to describe the trends in malaria incidence and mortality in Zimbabwe prior to and during the pandemic to understand the consequences of COVID-19-related changes in the delivery and utilization of malaria services. METHODS: Monthly data on the number of malaria cases and deaths by district for the period January 2017 to June 2020 were obtained from the national health management information system (HMIS). District-level population data were obtained from the 2012 Census. Malaria incidence per 1000 population and malaria deaths per 100,000 population were calculated for 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 and mapped to describe the spatial and temporal variation of malaria at the district level. RESULTS: Compared to the same period in 2017, 2018 and 2019, there was an excess of over 30,000 malaria cases from January to June 2020. The number of malaria deaths recorded in January to June 2020 exceeded the annual totals for 2018 and 2019. District level maps indicated that areas outside high malaria burden provinces experienced higher than expected malaria incidence and mortality, suggesting potential outbreaks. CONCLUSIONS: The observed surge in malaria cases and deaths in January to June 2020 coincided with the onset of COVID-19 in Zimbabwe. While further research is needed to explore possible explanations for the observed trends, prioritizing the continuity of essential malaria services amid the COVID-19 pandemic remains crucial.","output":"Malaria incidence and mortality in Zimbabwe during the COVID-19 pandemic: analysis of routine surveillance data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Violence against women and girls (VAWG) is one of the most widespread, persistent and devastating human rights violations in the world today and remains largely unreported due to the impunity, silence, stigma and shame surrounding it even in this era with huge social communication.

METHODS: This cross-sectional, population-based, online survey-based study was conducted from November 5 to 20, 2020 and included adults aged 20-49 years in Chungnam Province, Korea. A total of 549 adults were included. RESULTS: In total, 18.8% of the participants had symptoms of depression, 10.6% had symptoms of anxiety, and 5.1% had a high level of perceived stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher levels of stress (odds ratio [OR], 3.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13 to 8.67), anxiety (OR, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.09 to 4.49), and depression (OR, 3.00; 95% CI, 1.64 to 5.50) were found among never married, widowed, divorced, and separated people than among married/cohabiting/partnered participants.

It poses a grave threat to human life and health. The purpose of the study is to investigate the chest CT findings and progression of the disease observed in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Forty-nine confirmed cases of adult COVID-19 patients with common type, severe and critically severe type were included in this retrospective single-center study. The thin-section chest CT features and progress of the disease were evaluated. The clinical and chest imaging findings of COVID-19 patients with different severity types were compared. The CT severity score and MuLBSTA score (a prediction of mortality risk) were calculated in those patients. RESULTS: Among the 49 patients, 35 patients (71%) were common type and 14 patients (28%) were severe and critically severe type. Nearly all patients (98%) had pure ground-glass opacities (GGO) in CT imaging. Of the severe and critically severe type patients, 86% exhibited GGO with consolidation, in comparison with 54% of the patients with common type. Fibrosis presented in 79% of the severe and critically severe type patients and 43% of the common type patients. The severe and critically severe type patients were significantly more prone to experience five-lobe involvement compared to the common type patients (p = 0.002). The severe and critically severe type patients also had higher CT severity and MuLBSTA scores than the common type patients (5.43  2.38 vs 3.37  2.40, p < 0.001;and 10.21  3.83 vs 4.63  3.43, p < 0.001, respectively). MuLBSTA score was positively correlated with admittance to the intensive care unit (p = 0.005, r = 0.351). Nineteen patients underwent three times CT scan. The interval between first and second CT scan was 4[4,8] days, second and third was 3[2,4] days. There were greater improvements in the third CT follow-up findings compared to the second (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The severe and critically severe type patients often experienced more severe lung lesions, including GGO with consolidation. The CT severity score and MuLBSTA score may be helpful for the assessment of COVID-19 severity and progression.

In Sweden, herd immunity policy was implemented and it was difficult to reduce the number of fatalities. In South Korea, the number of fatalities was not high because the public had earlier received a risk warning from the government and followed the policy well. In order to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, the governments policy is important, but it is also important for the people to agree and follow the policy. As such, an individuals behavior such as preventive measures and pre-responses may be linked to the prevention of the spread of COVID-19. Methods: : To evaluate the effect of strategy selection between individuals and groups when pre-response action, we incorporate a comparmental epidemic model into a game theoretical framework and use this to fit the cumluative confirmed data of Sweden (Feb. 27 - Mar. 12) and South Korea (Feb. 4 - Mar. 3). Results: : The transmission rate (  ) is estimated from the fitted model, and the reproduction numbers ( R0 ) of two countries, Sweden and South Korea are estimated by 6.93 and 3.71, respectively. The probability of infection (  p ) of Sweden is about 12% higher than that of South Korea. As the probability of attack that an epidemic occurs (  ) increases, individuals equilibrium gradually increased than group optimum. Conclusions: : When comparing prevention policies of Sweden and South Korea, it was confirmed that pre-response can be an appropriate preventive strategy against the transmission of infection. The selection of a strategy between individuals and groups can lead to the collapse of altruism that tends to select an action strategy for personal benefit, as the probability of the epidemic attack increases.","output":"The Effects of Pre-Response Before COVID-19 Outbreak on Strategic Decision Making"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are important pathogen-carrying vectors that broadly exhibit similar habitat suitability, but that differ at fine spatial scales in terms of competitive advantage and tolerance to urban driven environmental parameters. This study evaluated how spatial and temporal patterns drive the assemblages of these competing species in cemeteries of New Orleans, LA, applying indicators of climatic variability, vegetation, and heat that may drive habitat selection at multiple scales. We found that Ae. aegypti was well predicted by urban heat islands (UHI) at the cemetery scale and by canopy cover directly above the cemetery vase. As predicted, UHI positively correlate to Ae. aegypti, but contrary to predictions, Ae. aegypti, was more often found under the canopy of trees in high heat cemeteries. Ae. albopictus was most often found in low heat cemeteries, but this relationship was not statistically significant, and their overall abundances in the city were lower than Ae. aegypti. Culex quinquefasciatus, another important disease vector, was also an abundant mosquito species during the sampling year, but we found that it was temporally segregated from Aedes species, showing a negative association to the climatic variables of maximum and minimum temperature, and these factors positively correlated to its more direct competitor Ae. albopictus. These findings help us understand the mechanism by which these three important vectors segregate both spatially and temporally across the city. Our study found that UHI at the cemetery scale was highly predictive of Ae. aegypti and strongly correlated to income level, with low-income cemeteries having higher UHI levels. Therefore, the effect of excessive heat, and the proliferation of the highly competent mosquito vector, Ae. aegypti, may represent an unequal disease burden for low-income neighborhoods of New Orleans that should be explored further. Our study highlights the importance of considering socioeconomic aspects as indirectly shaping spatial segregation dynamics of urban mosquito species.","output":"Habitat Segregation Patterns of Container Breeding Mosquitos: The Role of Urban Heat Islands, Vegetation Cover, and Income Disparity in Cemeteries of New Orleans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Skin findings such as acne, hypertrichosis and hyperpigmentation may be a clue for the diagnosis of eating disorders.

Ground truth is established using DANTE and used as the baseline for identifying anomalous behavior. For this, system logs are modeled as a natural language sequence and patterns are extracted from these sequences. We create workflows of sequences of actions that follow a natural language logic and control flow. These flows are assigned various categories of behaviors - malignant or benign. Any deviation from these sequences indicates the presence of a threat. We further classify threats into one of the five categories provided in the CERT insider threat dataset.

Using adenine-fed rats as a uremic model, we separated the calcium and phosphate fractions in rat serum by ultrafiltration, and found that the level of protein-bound phosphate (prPi) in the uremic serum was markedly higher than in control. The elevated prPi level was comparable to the prCa level, consistent with the presence of protein-bound calcium phosphate pr(Ca)j-m(CaPi)m. We then confirmed its presence by ex vivo X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy, revealing the discrete state of the calcium phosphate clusters associated with protein. Finally, in a quantitative investigation using Ca- and Pi-boosted serum, we discovered the threshold concentration for the Pi binding on prCa, and determined the binding constant. The threshold, while preventing Pi from binding to prCa in normal condition, allows the reaction to take place in hyperphosphatemia conditions. The protein-bound calcium phosphate could act as a link between the metabolism of serum proteins and the homeostasis of phosphate and calcium, and it deserves further investigation whether the molar ratio of (prPi/prCa)?100% may serve as a serum index of the vascular calcification status in chronic kidney disease.","output":"Protein-bound calcium phosphate in uremic rat serum: a quantitative study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have become the standard of care treatment for several tumor types. ICI-induced pneumonitis is a serious complication seen with treatment with these agents. Cancer has been reported to be one of the risk factors for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), that has engulfed the world in the last couple of months. In patients with cancer treated with ICI who present at the emergency department with respiratory symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, correct diagnosis can be challenging. Symptoms and radiological features of ICI pneumonitis can be overlapping with those of COVID-19 related pneumonia. For the latter, dexamethasone and remdesivir have shown encouraging results, while vaccines are currently being evaluated in phase III trials. The mainstay of treatment in ICI pneumonitis is immunosuppressive therapy, as this is a potentially fatal adverse event. It has been speculated that immunosuppression may be associated with increased risk of progression to severe COVID-19, especially during the early stage of infection with SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, distinction between these two entities is warranted. We summarize the clinical, radiological features as well as additional investigations of both entities, and suggest a diagnostic algorithm for distinction between the two. This algorithm may be a supportive tool for clinicians to diagnose the underlying cause of the pneumonitis in patients treated with ICI during this COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Differentiation of COVID-19 Pneumonitis and ICI Induced Pneumonitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The promotion of tourists environmentally responsible behavior (TERB) plays a central role in destination management for sustainability.

Survey data from 458 tourists visiting Mount Heng in Hunan Province, Southern China, were used to empirically evaluate the proposed framework. The findings demonstrate that the perception of a destinations natural environment positively impacts tourists sense of awe and satisfaction; the perception of availability of infrastructure positively and significantly influences awe, satisfaction, and TERB; and awe positively impacts satisfaction and TERB.

Summary Objective: In the Basque Country, two cases of COVID-19 were diagnosed on February 28 2020. On March 14, the Spanish Government established a state of alarm. Only cases confirmed by molecular biology (reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) were known. We launched a web-based surveillance tool to estimate the number of symptomatic cases of COVID-19 to contribute to Public Health decision-making. Material and methods: We implemented an anonymous web questionnaire and disseminated it through online social media social. We collected epidemiological information about \\"time\\" (date of onset of symptoms), \\"place\\" (zip code), and \\"person\\" (gender, age). We compared cases detected by RT-PCR with the estimated cases, according to the case definition of the Ministry of Health. We calculated the questionnaire response rate and the cumulative incidence at 14 days. Results: Between March 19 and 26, 128,009 people answered the questionnaire (5.5% of the Basque population). Of these, 26,375 met the case definition (symptom prevalence of 21.4%). The estimated cases were almost six times more than COVID-19 positive RT-PCR. The estimated 14-day cumulative incidence was 578.3 per 100,000 population compared to RT-PCR positive cases, which was 139.6 per 100,000 population. Conclusions: This tool was useful in estimating the minimum number of symptomatic cases in the Basque Country, which could support Public Health actions.","output":"Estimando el nmero de casos de COVID-19 mediante una herramienta web: resultados de la primera semana del proyecto \\"Covid-19 Trends\\" en Euskadi"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Aims: When the world was frantically searching for a drug effective against the coronavirus disease (COVID)-19, remdesivir, a broad-spectrum anti-viral medication, became a part of the COVID treatment We planned a study to evaluate improvement in clinical outcomes with remdesivir treatment for five days Methods: Participants more than 40-years old and with moderate to severe COVID-19 but not on mechanical ventilation were randomly assigned into two groups-remdesivir group (34 cases) to receive the study drug intravenous (IV) remdesivir for five days plus the standard care (SC) and non-remdesivir group (36 cases) to receive the SC but not to receive the study drug Follow-up was continued for 12 days after the beginning of treatment or until discharge/death Patient's clinical status was assessed by laboratory investigations and physical examination (from day 1 to day 12 on a 4-point ordinal scale and from day 12 to 24 on a 6-point ordinal scale) Oxygen support requirements and adverse events were recorded The data were entered and analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22 0 Results: High-flow oxygen support and non-invasive ventilation was required at baseline by lesser patients in the remdesivir group In the end, both groups had similar outcomes after adjustment for baseline clinical status There was no statistical difference in mortality between the two groups (p = 0 749) Patients in both groups had an equal time to recovery There was no difference in the occurrence of adverse effects of remdesivir between the two groups Conclusion: Remdesivir therapy for five days did not produce improvement in clinical outcomes in moderate to severe COVID-19 cases [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Indian Journal of Anaesthesia is the property of Wolters Kluwer India Pvt Ltd and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Clinical outcomes of using remdesivir in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19: A prospective randomised study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose or Objective CD19 CAR-T therapy is the most effective salvage treatment for relapsed/refractory DLBCL. However the manufacture of CAR-T cells takes several weeks and patients (pts) are at risk of progression during this time and usually require some form of bridging therapy to contain their disease. Radiotherapy (RT) is an attractive bridging option, as the chance of response to further conventional cytotoxic therapy is low. RT is generally delivered in the window between apheresis and infusion and requires careful scheduling. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, toxicity and early outcome of bridging RT in a cohort of pts undergoing CAR-T therapy for DLBCL. Materials and Methods This was a prospective analysis of pts receiving bridging RT since the start of CAR-T programme at our institution. We collected data on pt demographics, disease and RT details, as well as outcomes including early response, relapse, survival and toxicity. Results (Table presented.) Between April 2019 & January 2021 a total of 27 pts have received bridging RT. Of these 23 have been infused (1 not infused due to COVID19, 1 due to cardiac function & 2 pending). The CAR-T therapy was delivered in 1 Haematology Institution, but bridging RT in 9 different referring centres. Pt and disease characteristics and RT details are shown in table 1. The median time from CT planning scan to start of RT was 10 days (4-42). The median time between apheresis and start of RT was 5 days (-37-21;3 patients received RT prior to apheresis at -37,-35 &-29 days) and median time between end of RT and CAR-T infusion was 19 days (10-116). No pts were delayed due to RT toxicity. Toxicity data was available for 22 pts. 10 (45.5%) reported no toxicity. Only 1 pt had grade 3 toxicity (vomiting & diarrhoea) and RT was stopped. The most common toxicities were skin reaction (n=5) & fatigue (n=4). 25/27 (92.6%) pts underwent a PET-CT between bridging RT & infusion. In 22 (88%) pts there was response in treatment field (CMR=2, PMR=20). In 13 (59.1%) of those pts there was evidence of progressive disease (PD) outside the field, but none were prevented from receiving CAR-T infusion due to PD. With median FU of 8.8 (0.6-20.6) months from date of CAR-T infusion, 12/ 23 (52.2%) infused pts have relapsed, (2 infield, 5 out of field, 5 in both) with a local control rate of 69.6%;CMR (12;52.2%) and PMR (4;17.4%). 7 pts have died since infusion, 6 due to PD and 1 due to sepsis. Median PFS was 5.1 months (95% CI 0.0-11.9 months) and median OS 17.8 months (95% CI 12.7-22.9 months). 1 pt had infusion delayed due to COVID19 infection and died of PD. Conclusion RT was a safe and effective bridging option in this cohort of DLBCL pts pre CAR-T therapy. With close collaboration between Haematologists and Radiation Oncologists, it is possible to deliver a course of radical dose RT in the narrow window between apheresis and infusion, even across a wide geographical network. Further work is required to determine which pts benefit most from bridging RT and the optimal dose and schedule.","output":"Feasibility and outcome of bridging RT pre CAR-T in DLBCL in one centre with a wide referral network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Mirizzi syndrome (MS) is an impacted stone in the cystic duct or Hartmann's pouch that mechanically obstructs the common bile duct (CBD).

However, recent implants and technique advances may allow for improvement in outcomes. Our institution has developed novel graft constructs and techniques for reconstructions with preclinical data supporting clinical use. Our study purpose was to assess clinical outcomes after reconstruction for MKLI using our constructs and techniques. Overall success rate, failure/revision rates, return to work (RTW)/return to sports (RTS) rates, and complications were evaluated testing the hypothesis that novel methods would be associated with clinical benefits with respect to applications and outcomes compared with historical results. We reviewed a single-surgeon, longitudinal database of 42 patients who underwent multiligament reconstruction at our institution using these techniques for at least two-ligament injuries. Visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score and PROMIS (patient-reported outcomes measurement information system) were collected preoperatively and postoperatively at a minimum 1-year follow-up. Among these patients, 33 patients (mean age of 28.9 years, mean body mass index (BMI) of 33.2 kg/m2, mean follow-up of 14.2 months) were included for outcomes analyses. With the definition of success as having a VAS score of less than or equal to 2 without revision/salvage surgery due to recurrent/residual instability or arthritis, overall success rate was 88% (29/33). The mean VAS scores improved from 5  2 to 2  2. The mean preoperative PROMIS mental health score was 36.2  7, general health was 33.5  6, pain was 62.7  8, and physical function score was 29.4  3.

Our results demonstrated excellent clinical outcomes associated with a primary success rate of 88% and RTW rate of 94%. Intraoperative complications occurred in 9.5% of cases and revision and failure rates were 9% and 3%, respectively.

Three levels (0, 0.01, and 0.02% w/w) of PEE were tested in jelly candies alternatively made with two carbohydrate bases (sugars or fructans) and three fruity dyes and flavours (menthe, orange, or strawberry). Propolis polyphenol content (identified by HPLC-MS and quantified by HPLC-DAD/UV-Vis), antioxidant capacity (total phenolics and radical scavenging activity), physical properties (moisture, pH, CIELab colour, and texture profile analysis), and flavour were studied in candies. PEE was rich in polyphenols (>8.7%), including several prenylated p-coumaric, caffeoylquinic and diterpenic acids, and flavonoids, with Artepillin-C (3.4%) as the main bioactive compound. The incorporation of PEE into the hot liquor at 80 C for 5 min before moulding allowed a good retention of propolis polyphenols in the final product (recovery percentages of up to 97.4% for Artepillin-C). Jelly candies made with sugars or dietetic fructans have poor antioxidant properties, which depend on the dyes and flavours used. Using PEE (at 0.02%) strongly improved the antioxidant capacity (relative increases of up to 465%) of candies without altering the pH, colour, or texture, although off-flavour may appear.

WNV infection of neurons is rapidly progressive and destructive whereas infection of non-neuronal brain cells is limited. However, the role of neurons and pathological consequences of pro-inflammatory cytokines released as a result of WNV infection is unclear. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the role of key cytokines secreted by WNV-infected neurons in mediating neuroinflammatory markers and neuronal death. METHODS: A transformed human neuroblastoma cell line, SK-N-SH, was infected with WNV at multiplicity of infection (MOI)-1 and -5, and WNV replication kinetics and expression profile of key pro-inflammatory cytokines were analyzed by plaque assay, qRT-PCR, and ELISA. Cell death was measured in SK-N-SH cell line in the presence and absence of neutralizing antibodies against key pro-inflammatory cytokines using cell viability assay, TUNEL and flow cytometry. Further, na?ve primary astrocytes were treated with UV-inactivated supernatant from mock- and WNV-infected SK-N-SH cell line and the activation of astrocytes was measured using flow cytometry and ELISA. RESULTS: WNV-infected SK-N-SH cells induced the expression of IL-1, -6, -8, and TNF- in a dose- and time-dependent manner, which coincided with increase in virus-induced cell death. Treatment of cells with anti-IL-1 or -TNF- resulted in significant reduction of the neurotoxic effects of WNV. Furthermore treatment of na?ve astrocytes with UV-inactivated supernatant from WNV-infected SK-N-SH cell line increased expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein and key inflammatory cytokines. CONCLUSION: Our results for the first time suggest that neurons are one of the potential sources of pro-inflammatory cytokines in WNV-infected brain and these neuron-derived cytokines contribute to WNV-induced neurotoxicity. Moreover, cytokines released from neurons also mediate the activation of astrocytes. Our data define specific role(s) of WNV-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines and provide a framework for the development of anti-inflammatory drugs as much-needed therapeutic interventions to limit symptoms associated with WNVE.","output":"Pro-inflammatory cytokines derived from West Nile virus (WNV)-infected SK-N-SH cells mediate neuroinflammatory markers and neuronal death"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As influenza A/H5N1 spreads around the globe the risk of an epidemic increases.

Given the global health crisis caused by COVID-19, mouth and nose-covering masks have become an essential everyday-clothing-accessory.

In addition, the need has arisen for applications capable of detecting whether the subjects are wearing masks to control the spread of the virus. To overcome these problems a full training pipeline is presented based on the ArcFace work, with several modifications for the backbone and the loss function. From the original face-recognition dataset, a masked version is generated using data augmentation, and both datasets are combined during the training process. The selected network, based on ResNet-50, is modified to also output the probability of mask usage without adding any computational cost. Furthermore, the ArcFace loss is combined with the mask-usage classification loss, resulting in a new function named Multi-Task ArcFace (MTArcFace). Experimental results show that the proposed approach highly boosts the original model accuracy when dealing with masked faces, while preserving almost the same accuracy on the original non-masked datasets.

Methods: One-hundred patients with congenital heart disease and 50 controls (M = 29.7, SD = 3.8 years) were recruited. They completed an online survey including the assessment of health-related concerns regarding COVID-19, the 12-item Short Form Health Survey and the Brief Symptom Inventory. Results: Patients considered COVID-19 to be a more serious issue (Generalized odds ratio [GenOR] = 1.67, p = 0.04), were more concerned about becoming infected (GenOR = 2.93, p <0.001)and expressed more fear about leaving their homes (GenOR = 1.81, p = 0.004) while general anxiety symptoms were not different between groups (p = 0.23).

The study attempts to identify differences in learning experience (i.e., general chemistry content, experiment comprehension, laboratory safety knowledge) and laboratory safety behavior. Results indicate learning general content knowledge, laboratory skills, and procedure-related safety behaviors were comparable between RL and VR conditions, but clean-up behaviors were less frequent in VR. Also, the exploratory, risk-free nature of VR environments may have allowed the learners to elaborate and reflect more on general chemistry content and laboratory safety knowledge than in the RL environment.","output":"Exploring Differences in Student Learning and Behavior Between Real-life and Virtual Reality Chemistry Laboratories"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In addition to providing invaluable insights to the host response to viral infection, adenovirus continues to be an important model system for discovering basic aspects of cell biology.

The aim of this research is that it provides a dual-tree complex wavelet transform which is used to find out about the structure of proteins. It also identifies the secondary structure of protein network. Many computer-based methods for predicting protein complexes have also been developed in the field. Identifying the secondary structure of a protein is very important when you are studying protein characteristics and properties. This is how the protein sequence is added to the distance matrix. The scope of this research is that it can confidently predict certain protein complexes rapidly, which compensates for shortcomings in biological research. The three-dimensional coordinates of C atom are used to do this. According to the texture information in the distance matrix, the matrix is broken down into four levels by the double-tree complex wavelet transform because it has four levels. The subband energy and standard deviation in different directions are taken, and then, the two-dimensional feature vector is used to show the secondary structure features of the protein in a way that is easy to understand. Then, the KNN and SVM classifiers are used to classify the features that were found.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the common clinical manifestations of severe COVID-19 and it is also responsible for the current shortage of ventilators worldwide. This study aims to analyze the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 ARDS patients and establish a diagnostic system based on artificial intelligence (AI) method to predict the probability of ARDS in COVID-19 patients. We collected clinical data of 659 COVID-19 patients from 11 regions in China. The clinical characteristics of the two groups were elaborately compared and both traditional machine learning algorithms and deep learning-based methods were used to build the prediction models. Results indicated the median age of ARDS patients was 56.5 years old, which was significantly older than those with non-ARDS by 7.5 years. Male and patients with BMI>25 were more likely to develop ARDS.

Complications include microvascular and macrovascular thrombosis. We present an unusual case of a patient with a history of refractory aTTP who experienced relapsed aTTP following COVID-19 vaccine. Case Description: A 57-year-old African-American male with a history of refractory aTTP experienced a relapse following 3 years of remission after receiving COVID-19 vaccination. The patient was initially diagnosed with aTTP in 2016, after presenting with symptoms of dark urine, mild headaches and transient episodes of aphasia and paresthesia. Due to symptoms and persistently low ADAMTS13 levels, he required prolonged and extensive treatment including over 5 weeks of daily therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE), followed by gradual reduction in frequency of TPE sessions, as well as trials of rituximab, eculizumab, steroids, mycophenolate mofetil and bortezomib. Ultimately, he achieved remission after 9 months of intermittent TPE, 3 months of weekly bortezomib 1 mg/m 2, mycophenolate mofetil up-titrated to 1,750 mg twice daily, and then slowly tapered off over a 2-year period. The patient was doing well for 3 years without manifestations of aTTP (2 years off all therapeutics), until he developed a petechial rash 7 weeks after receiving the second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. He was found to have acute thrombocytopenia with platelets of 38 x 10 9/L (normal range 135-317 x 109/L), from a baseline of 200-300 x 10 9/L. He was referred to the emergency department, where additional labs were notable for mildly elevated LDH of 508 U/L (normal range 122-222 U/L), hemoglobin of 12.4 g/dL (normal range 13.2-16.6 g/dL), creatinine at baseline, and peripheral blood smear showing 1-3 schistocytes per high-powered field. ADAMTS13 activity level was t <5% (normal >/= 70%), with positive ADAMTS13 inhibitor screen and titer of 1.5 (normal <0.4), consistent with relapsed aTTP. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and initiated on daily TPE, with steroids and diphenhydramine prior to each TPE session. He quickly improved with TPE alone , but given his history of refractory aTTP, he was discharged on weekly rituximab for 4 weeks and caplacizumab 11 mg daily for 30 days. His platelets remained stable within the upper limit of normal during his 30 day course of caplacizumab. However, 3 weeks after completion of caplacizumab, he had an acute drop in his platelets to 23 x 10 9/L. His ADAMTS13 level was again found to be <5%, and inhibitor level was the highest that it had ever been at 11.4. He was again hospitalized and underwent 8 sessions of daily TPE, as well as re-initiation of caplacizumab, mycophenolate mofetil 500 mg bid (with increasing taper), and a prednisone taper. Intravenous Cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m 2 was also added every 3 weeks. With this regimen, patient's platelet count normalized and remain stable, and his ADAMTS13 activity level has reached 52-59%. Discussion: Cases of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) have been described as a complication following vaccination with formulations containing replication-defective adenoviral vectors (AstraZeneca-Oxford and Johnson&Johnson COVID-19 vaccines)(Arepally and Ortel 2021, Simpson, Shi et al. 2021). VITT and aTTP are both immune-mediated, however, VITT is distinct and pathogenically linked to autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), given the presence of anti-platelet factor 4 antibodies in these patients, whereas aTTP is due to reduction in ADAMTS13 level, secondary to an antibody inhibitor of ADAMTS13 (Arepally and Ortel 2021). Recently, cases have been reported of de novo aTTP developing shortly after COVID-19 vaccination with all available vaccines, except the Moderna (mRNA-1273) vaccine (Al-Ahmad, Al-Rasheed et al. 2021, de Bruijn, Maes et al. 2021, Maayan, Kirgner et al. 2021, Ruhe, Schnetzke et al. 2021, Waqar, Khan et al. 2021, Yocum and Simon 2021). Additionally, cases of relapsed aTTP have been described following only the BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine (Maayan, Kirgner et al. 2021, Sissa, Al-Khaffaf et al. 2021). This is the first case, to our knowledge, reported in the literature of aTTP following vaccination with Moderna's mRNA-1273 vaccine.

We used the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory score which assesses the different dimensions of burnout (personal (CBIP), professional (CBIPro), relational (CBIR)). Several questions evaluating impact on residents' health and apprehension of the future were included. The survey lasted for 5 days. Comparison of parameters before and during the coronavirus crisis was made using paired samples t-test or Chi2 test were. RESULTS: Fifty percent (62/126) of the ESRU-B members replied to the questionnaire. If 93% of the responders reported a negative impact on the quality of their practical training (CI95=[0.07-1.10]; P=0.83), 56% and 61.7% reported a positive impact of the crisis on their life and on their theoretical training respectively.

It has been widely practised to control many human and animal respiratory diseases. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which resulted in a global pandemic. COVID-19 has reminded some veterinarians of various contagious veterinary diseases, including coronavirus infections in animals. This article discusses the control of highly contagious diseases of veterinary importance with emphasis on an intranasal vaccination approach, and the potential of implementing similar strategies in human medicine to control the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. ABSTRACT: The world is currently facing an ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The disease is a highly contagious respiratory disease which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Current control measures used by many countries include social distancing, wearing face masks, frequent hand washing, self-isolation, and vaccination. The current commercially available vaccines are injectable vaccines, although a few intranasal vaccines are in trial stages. The reported side effects of COVID-19 vaccines, perceptions towards the safety of the vaccines, and frequent mutation of the virus may lead to poor herd immunity. In veterinary medicine, attaining herd immunity is one of the main considerations in disease control, and herd immunity depends on the use of efficacious vaccines and the vaccination coverage in a population. Hence, many aerosol or intranasal vaccines have been developed to control veterinary respiratory diseases such as Newcastle disease, rinderpest, infectious bronchitis, and haemorrhagic septicaemia. Different vaccine technologies could be employed to improve vaccination coverage, including the usage of an intranasal live recombinant vaccine or live mutant vaccine. This paper discusses the potential use of intranasal vaccination strategies against human COVID-19, based on a veterinary intranasal vaccine strategy.","output":"Intranasal Vaccination Strategy to Control the COVID-19 Pandemic from a Veterinary Medicine Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe a study conducted at a large public university campus in the United States which shows the efficacy of network log information for digital contact tracing and prediction of COVID-19 cases.

The association information was used to find potential contacts for approximately 30,000 individuals. Contacts are determined using an AP colocation algorithm, which supposes contact when two individuals connect to the same WiFi AP at approximately the same time. The approach was validated with a truth set of 350 positive COVID-19 cases inferred from the network log data by observing associations with APs in isolation residence halls reserved for individuals with a confirmed (clinical) positive COVID-19 test result.

Key among these include;improved air and water quality, clearer skies and a projected 8% global blip in carbon emissions by the end of 2020. The global wave of restrictive lock downs implemented to contain the spread of COVID-19 in the short term account for these gains. The lockdowns were defined by limited public and private travel, closure of airports and borders, and a decline in industrial activity. However, most of these climate and environmental gains were secondary effects of the COVID-19 induced lockdowns and not based on decisive deliberate policy action, which casts doubts on their sustainability and ability to contribute to a green economy transition. Sustaining accrued environmental and climate benefits will depend on the direction of the COVID-19 stimuli and recovery packages C whether they are designed to work for the planet or against it.

In our descriptive analysis, we compare well-being during this period with a pre-crisis period for different groups. In a difference-in-differences design, we compare the change for individuals with children to the change for individuals without children, accounting for unrelated trends as well as potential survey mode and context effects. We find that the crisis lowered the relative well-being of individuals with children, especially for individuals with young children, for women, and for persons with lower secondary schooling qualifications.

These include elective surgical services due to the synergetic resources required to provide both perioperative surgical care whilst also treating acute COVID\\\\19 patients and also the poor outcomes associated with surgical patients who develop COVID\\\\19 in the perioperative period. This article discusses the important principles and concepts for providing important surgical services during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic based on the model of the RMCancerSurgHub which is providing surgical cancer services for a population of approximately 2 million people across London during the pandemic. The model focusses on creating local and regional hub centres which provide urgent treatment for surgical patients in an environment that is relatively protected from the burden of COVID\\\\19 illness. The model extensively utilises the extended multidisciplinary team to allow for a flexible approach with core services delivered in clean sites which can adapt to viral surges. A key requirement is that of a clinical prioritisation process which allows for equity in access within and between specialties ensuring that patients are treated on the basis of greatest need, while at the same time protecting those whose conditions can safely wait from exposure to the virus.

The possibility to improve the diagnosis of SARS-COV-2 infection in digestive endoscopy is important because gastrointestinal symptoms can be the presenting symptoms of COVID-19.We tried to obtain a fast and bedside diagnosis of gastrointestinal COVID-19 by performing serological rapid test to verify the presence of SARS-COV-2 in gastrointestinal mucosal specimens.From the 4 th to the 30 th January 2021, regular mucosal biopsies were taken from stomach, ileum or colon of 10 COVID-19 patients (7M, 3F, mean age: 49.7 y.o.) and from 10 negative patients ( 6M, 4F, mean age: 50 y.o.) according to standard clinical indications. One specimen for each patient was placed in a sterile test-tube with 5 drops of standard reagent for rapid serological test for 10 minutes.After that period, both the specimen and the drops were put on the platform for serological rapid tests. In all COVID-19 patients, tests were positive for both IgG and IgM bands (and control bands, confirming that the test worked properly). Otherwise, the analysis of gastrointestinal specimen of negative patients showed only the control band.No differences were found for different specimens (stomach, colon or ileum). Statistical analysis conducted to compare the results of the two groups confirmed the difference between COVID-19 positive and negative groups.Applying this kind of analysis, we can immediately verify if gastrointestinal symptoms (especially diarrhea) of a non-tested patient are related to SARS-COV-2 infection and we can use this test as a rapid test in case of suspected endoscopic findings to confirm the association with SARS-COV-2 infection.In the end, the test can contribute to help in the differential diagnosis of gastrointestinal manifestations considering the long-term management of SARS-COV-2 infections.","output":"Serological Rapid Test for Diagnosis of SARS-COVv-2 Works Also on Gastro-intestinal Tissue Samples of COVID-19 Patients: Practical Aspects of Single Center Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE: Fibrosing interstitial pneumonitis can be the common end result to many different lung diseases, including chronic viral inflammations, as COVID-19. Some SARS-CoV-2 infected patients develop the acute respiratory distress syndrome. This condition is histopathologically known as diffuse alveolar damage which may be followed by a proliferative phase. Whereas COVID-19 has showed a longer disease outcome until clinical cure or death compared to other chronic infections, our hypothesis is that COVID-19 patients tend to develop a more prominently proliferative phase, even those who progress to death, with an exacerbated fibroblast and myofibroblast proliferation. METHODS: Minimally invasive autopsy(MIA) was performed on 47 confirmed COVID- 19 patients for lung samples. Clinical, demographic, mechanical ventilation parameters and radiological data were collected by electronic medical record. A detailed histomorphological analysis by two pulmonary pathologists was performed by H&E staining. Verhoeff, picrosirius red and SMA staining were performed for histomorphometric analysis of interstitial fibrosis according to ATS/ERS morphometric guidelines. RT-qPCR was performed to detect the viral genome of SARS-CoV-2, targeting the E and N2 genes, in lung tissue collected from all patients at MIA. RESULTS: Patients were equally distributed in men and women and the mean age was 67 years old. The average time of death after the onset of typical COVID-19 symptoms was approximately 18 days. Regarding the most common comorbidities, 55% of the patients had systemic arterial hypertension, 40% were obese, 25% were smokers and 22% had chronic cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. In the radiological exams, ground glass was the most prevalent finding. The clinical and histomorphological correlation revealed two phenotypes: 1) Poor lung outcome - a progressive decline in PaO2/FiO2 ratio and high complacency levels, closely related to fibrosing interstitial pneumonitis (P&lt;0.05) together with an increased collagen fibers deposition (P&lt;0.05), SMA+ stained cells (P&lt;0.05), elastic rarefaction (P&lt;0.05) and higher viral load;2) Better lung outcome - a progressive increase in PaO2/FiO2 ratio and low complacency levels, usual pattern of elastic and collagen fibers and SMA+ cells, but sudden death due to acute pulmonary thromboembolism. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 viral genome was detected in all lung tissue collected(47), with a mean of 3,403,775 and 90,683,263 copies/mg for N2 and E genes respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The fibrotic septal thickening is related to poor lung outcome by progressive decline in PaO2/FiO2 ratio and late death. This pathophysiological process may be an important sequel in pos- COVID19 patients to trigger a fibrosing interstitial pneumonitis.

Recent studies demonstrated the potent contribution of adipose tissues renin-angiotensin system (RAS) to systemic RAS, which plays a key role in regulating blood pressure (BP). In this study, we investigated the effects of prenatal dexamethasone (DEX) exposure and postnatal HF diet on RAS of adipose tissue. METHODS: RAS and BP of 6-month old rats exposed to prenatal DEX and/or postnatal HF diet were examined. RESULTS: Prenatal DEX plus postnatal HF exerted a synergistic effect on systolic BP. Prenatal DEX exposure suppressed plasma angiotensin (ANG) I and ANG II, whereas postnatal HF suppressed plasma ANG-(1C7) level. Prenatal DEX increased prorenin receptor and renin levels, but suppressed angiotensinogen (AGT) and angiotensin-converting-enzyme 1 (ACE1) mRNA expressions in adipose tissue. Postnatal HF increased AGT mRNA expression, but suppressed prorenin receptor, renin, ACE2, ANG II type 2 receptor (AT2R), and Mas receptor (MasR) mRNA expression levels. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal GC exposure altered the ACE1/ANG II/ANG II type 1 receptor (AT1R) axis, whereas postnatal HF negatively impacted the ACE2/ANG-(1C7)/MasR axis. Prenatal DEX exposure and postnatal HF synergistically elevated BP through a distinct programming mechanism of systemic and adipose RAS.

We find that while the announcement of the liquidity option improved overall municipal bond market functioning, lower-rated issuers additionally benefited from direct access to the facility---their bonds traded at higher prices and were issued more frequently, suggesting a potential credit-risk sharing channel on top of the Feds role as liquidity-provider of last resort. Local governments, by contrast, responded to emergency liquidity measures by recalling a greater share of service-providing government employees (mostly educational institution workers), but recalls were only sustained for higher-rated municipalities. This hiring responsiveness is consistent with the view that large government furloughs might have over-weighted the worst possible outcomes based on past experience.

RESULTS: We analyzed 911 cycles of 313 adult patients treated with 4 to 6 cycles of eBEACOPP. We found a significant decrease in the occurrence of infections during chemotherapy for HL during COVID-19 lockdown from 131 (19.6%) of 670 cycles in 2017C2019 to 30 (12.6%) of 239 cycles during COVID-19 lockdown [OR 0.574 (95% CI 0.354C0.930), P = 0.024]. The strongest effect was evident for unspecified infections with 39 cycles (5.8%) during 2017C2019 in comparison to 5 cycles (2.1%) during COVID-19 lockdown. 20 (24.1%) of 83 patients had an infection during the COVID-19 lockdown versus 99 (43.2%) of 229 patients in the years 2017C2019 (P = 0.0023).

These are the mediators of the two paths shown in the job demands-resources model. A cross-sectional study was conducted using a questionnaire survey among 15,158 non-managerial employees from seven companies in Japan considered to have relatively high perceived organizational support for health (POSH). PSSH was evaluated with a single question, My supervisor supports employees to work vigorously and live a healthy life, on a four-point scale. Presenteeism was estimated using the quantity and quality method. Multilevel logistic regression analyses nested by company were conducted. Lower PSSH was more likely to be associated with presenteeism, but after adjusting for psychological distress evaluated by K6 and for work engagement, the relationship between PSSH and presenteeism weakened. Our results suggested that lower PSSH is linked to presenteeism through both psychological states because of its role as a resource, and other independent factors, even with relatively high POSH. Increased PSSH could act as a measure against presenteeism in the workplace. To achieve this, it is important to create an environment where supervisors can easily encourage employees to improve their health.","output":"Perceived Supervisor Support for Health Affects Presenteeism: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 infections initiate cytokine storms and activate genetic programs leading to progressive hyperinflammation in multiple organs of COVID-19 patients.

Recently, a novel candidate gene encoding the carboxypeptidase X member 2 (CPXM2) was found to be associated with hypertension-induced LVH. CPXM2 belongs to the M14 family of metallocarboxypeptidases, yet it lacks detectable enzyme activity, and its function remains unknown. Here, we investigated the impact of micro (mi)RNA-29b, miRNA-195, and miRNA-497 on the posttranscriptional expression control of CPXM2. Candidate miRNAs for CPXM2 expression control were identified in silico. CPXM2 expression in rat cardiomyocytes (H9C2) was characterized via real-time PCR, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence. Direct miRNA/target mRNA interaction was analysed by dual luciferase assay. CPXM2 was expressed in H9C2 and co-localised with z-disc associated protein PDZ and LIM domain 3 (Pdlim3). Transfection of H9C2 with miRNA-29b, miRNA-195, and miRNA-497 led to decreased levels of CPXM2 mRNA and protein, respectively. Results of dual luciferase assays revealed that miRNA-29b and miRNA-497, but not miRNA-195, directly regulated CPXM2 expression on a posttranscriptional level via binding to the 3UTR of CPXM2 mRNA. We identified two miRNAs capable of the direct posttranscriptional expression control of CPXM2 expression in rat cardiomyocytes. This novel data may help to shed more light on theso farwidely unexplored expression control of CPXM2 and its potential role in LVH.","output":"MiRNA-29b and miRNA-497 Modulate the Expression of Carboxypeptidase X Member 2, a Candidate Gene Associated with Left Ventricular Hypertrophy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We and others have previously shown that COVID-19 results in vascular and autonomic impairments in young adults. However, the newest variant of COVID-19 (Omicron) appears to have less severe complications. Therefore, we investigated whether recent breakthrough infection with COVID-19 during the Omicron wave impacts cardiovascular health in young adults. We hypothesized that measures of vascular health and indices of cardiac autonomic function would be impaired in those who had the Omicron variant of COVID-19 when compared to controls who never had COVID-19. We studied 23 vaccinated adults who had COVID-19 after Dec 25, 2021 (Omicron; age: 233years; 14F) within 6 weeks of diagnosis compared to 13 vaccinated adults who never had COVID-19 (age: 264 years; 7F). Macro and micro-vascular function were assessed using flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and reactive hyperemia, respectively. Arterial stiffness was determined as carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) and augmentation index (AIx). Heart rate (HR) variability and cardiac baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) were assessed as indices of cardiac autonomic function. FMD was not different between control (5.9  2.8%) and Omicron (6.1  2.3%; p=0.544). Similarly, reactive hyperemia (p=0.884) and arterial stiffness were not different between groups (e.g., cfPWV; control, 5.9  0.6 m/s and Omicron, 5.7  0.8 m/s; p=0.367). Lastly, measures of HR variability and cardiac BRS were not different between groups (all: p>0.05).

Infections in this age group, most recently with SARS-CoV-2, cause substantial morbidity and mortality. Major improvements have been made in vaccines for older people, either through the addition of novel adjuvants-as in the new recombinant zoster vaccine and an adjuvanted influenza vaccine-or by increasing antigen concentration, as in influenza vaccines. In this article we review improvements in immunization for the three most important vaccine preventable diseases of aging. The recombinant zoster vaccine has an efficacy of 90% that is minimally affected by the age of the person being vaccinated and persists for more than four years. Increasing antigen dose or inclusion of adjuvant has improved the immunogenicity of influenza vaccines in older adults, although the relative effectiveness of the enhanced influenza vaccines and the durability of the immune response are the focus of ongoing clinical trials. Conjugate and polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccines have similar efficacy against invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumococcal pneumonia caused by vaccine serotypes in older adults. Their relative value varies by setting, depending on the prevalence of vaccine serotypes, largely related to conjugate vaccine coverage in children. Improved efficacy will increase public confidence and uptake of these vaccines. Co-administration of these vaccines is feasible and important for maximal uptake in older people.

A Core-2 branch can also be formed from core-1 by the core-2 1,6 N-acetyl-d-glucosamine transferase (1,6 GlcNAc T) that leads to chain extension. Increased levels of the 2,3 SAT (O) and decreased levels of the core-2 1,6 GlcNAc T are seen in breast cancer cells and correlate with differences in the structure of the O-glycans synthesized (Brockhausen et al., 1995; Lloyd et al., 1996). Since in mucin type O-glycosylation sugars are added individually and sequentially in the Golgi apparatus, the position of the transferases, as well as their activity, can determine the final structure of the O-glycans synthesized. A cDNA coding for the human 2,3 SAT (O) tagged with an immunoreactive epitope from the myc gene has been used to map the position of the glycosyltransferase in nontumorigenic (MTSV1-7) and malignant (T47D) breast epithelial cell lines. Transfectants were analyzed for expression of the enzyme at the level of message and protein, as well as for enzymic activity. In T47D cells, which do not express core-2 1,6 GlcNAc T, the increased activity of the sialyltransferase correlated with increased sialylation of core-1 O-glycans on the epithelial mucin MUC1. Furthermore, in MTSV1-7 cells, which do express core-2 1,6 GlcNAc T, an increase in sialylated core-1 structures is accompanied by a reduction in the ratio of GlcNAc: GalNAc in the O-glycans attached to MUC1, implying a decrease in branching. Using quantitative immunoelectron microscopy, the sialyltransferase was mapped to the medial- and trans-Golgi cisternae, with some being present in the TGN. The data represent the first fine mapping of a sialyltransferase specifically active in O-glycosylation and demonstrate that the structure of O-glycans synthesized by a cell can be manipulated by transfecting with recombinant glycosyltransferases.","output":"A Transfected Sialyltransferase That Is Elevated in Breast Cancer and Localizes to the medial/trans-Golgi Apparatus Inhibits the Development of core-2Cbased O-Glycans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the late 2019 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causes a respiratory disease which could put myasthenia gravis (MG) patients at a greater risk of developing severe disease course, since infections and some drugs are a well-recognized trigger of symptom exacerbation in MG patients. Out of ten most commonly used past and present drugs used in COVID-19 treatment, two (quinolone derivatives and azithromycin) are known to worsen MG symptoms, whereas another two (tocilizumab and eculizumab) might have positive effect on MG symptoms. Colchicine, remdesivir, lopinavir, ritonavir and favipiravir seem to be safe to use, while data are insufficient for bamlanivimab, although it is also probably safe to use. Considering MG treatment options in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, acetylcholine esterase inhibitors are generally safe to use with some preliminary studies even demonstrating therapeutic properties in regard to COVID-19. Corticosteroids are in general safe to use, even recommended in specific circumstances, whereas other immunosuppressive medications (mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, cyclosporine, methotrexate) are probably safe to use. The only exception is rituximab since the resulting B cell depletion can lead to more severe COVID-19 disease.

It is not yet known whether men with advanced prostate cancer can elicit such adaptations following a program of exercise. The purpose is to examine myokine levels of serum acquired from metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients recruited to the INTERVAL-GAP4 trial before and after 6 months of exercise and its tumour-suppressive effect. METHODS: Twenty-five men with mCRPC (age = 74.7  7.1 yrs) were randomised to supervised multimodal (aerobic and resistance) exercise (EX) or self-directed exercise control group (CON). Body composition was assessed using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and fasting blood in a rested state was collected at baseline and at 6 months. Serum levels of myokines (SPARC, OSM, decorin, IGF-1, and IGFBP-3) were measured. Serum was applied to the prostate cancer cell line DU145, and growth was assessed for 72 h. RESULTS: No significant change in body composition was observed. Adjusted serum OSM (P = 0.050) and relative OSM (P = 0.083), serum SPARC (P = 0.022) and relative SPARC (P = 0.025) increased in EX compared to CON. The area under curve (AUC) over 72 h showed a significant reduction in DU145 growth after applying post-intervention serum from the EX vs CON (P = 0.029).

We compared response to NAC for T4 BCa in the U.S. and Nigeria to direct future interventions. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cross-sectional retrospective analysis included all non-metastatic T4 BCa patients treated from 2010-2016 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (New York, U.S.) and Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex (Ile Ife, Nigeria). Pathologic complete response (pCR) and survival were compared and factors contributing to disparities evaluated. RESULTS 308 patients met inclusion criteria: 157 (51%) in the U.S. and 151 (49%) in Nigeria. All U.S. patients received NAC and surgery compared with 93 (62%) Nigerian patients. 56/93 (60%) Nigerian patients completed their prescribed course of NAC. In Nigeria, older age and higher socioeconomic status were associated with treatment receipt. Fewer patients in Nigeria had immunohistochemistry performed (100% U.S. vs. 18% Nigeria). Of those with available receptor subtype, 18% (28/157) of U.S. patients were triple negative vs. 39% (9/23) of Nigerian patients. Overall pCR was seen in 27% (42/155) of U.S. patients and 5% (4/76) of Nigerian patients. Five-year survival was significantly shorter in Nigeria vs. the U.S. (61% vs. 72%). However, among the subset of patients who received multimodality therapy, including NAC and surgery with curative intent, 5-year survival (67% vs. 72%) and 5-year recurrence-free survival (48% vs. 61%) did not significantly differ between countries. CONCLUSION Addressing health system, socioeconomic, and psychosocial barriers is necessary for administration of complete NAC to improve BCa outcomes in Nigeria. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE This cross-sectional retrospective analysis of T4 breast cancer patients in Nigeria and the U.S. found a significant difference in pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (5% Nigeria vs. 27% U.S.). Five-year survival was shorter in Nigeria, but in patients receiving multimodality treatment, including neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery with curative intent, 5-year overall and recurrence-free survival did not differ between countries.

METHODS: We conducted a web-based survey sent electronically to 21 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education accredited IC fellowship program directors (PDs) and their respective fellows. RESULTS: Fourteen programs (67%) responded to the survey and all acknowledged a significant decrease in CCL procedural volumes. More than half of the PDs reported part of their CCL being converted to inpatient units and IC fellows being redeployed to COVID-19 related duties. More than two-thirds of PDs believed that the COVID-19 pandemic would have a moderate (57%) or severe (14%) adverse impact on IC fellowship training, and 21% of the PDs expected their current fellows' average percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) volume to be below 250. Of 25 IC fellow respondents, 95% expressed concern that the pandemic would have a moderate (72%) or severe (24%) adverse impact on their fellowship training, and nearly one-fourth of fellows reported performing fewer than 250 PCIs as of March 1st. Finally, roughly one-third of PDs and IC fellows felt that there should be consideration of an extension of fellowship training or a period of early career mentorship after fellowship.

The article shows that politics infiltrates WHO activities in different ways, influencing even the processes that are conventionally seen as purely technical and science-based. At the same time, it argues that the influence of politics in WHOs work should not be seen as some kind of atrophy, but should rather be considered a natural element that should be managed rather than dreaded.","output":"The Uneasy Coexistence of Expertise and Politics in the World Health Organization: Learning from the Experience of the Early Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Abdominal pain and liver injury have been frequently reported during Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19). In the setting of a systemic infection these features can induce misleading surgical diagnostics. Our aim was to investigate characteristics of abdominal pain in COVID-19 patients and its association with disease severity and liver injury. METHODS: Data of all COVID-19 hospitalized patients over 16 years old were retrieved from the beginning of the epidemic in Switzerland until end of June 2020. Patients admitted exclusively for other pathologies (including surgical abdominal conditions) and/or recovered from COVID-19, and pregnant women were excluded. Abdominal pain was linked to COVID-19 only after evident alternative diagnostic exclusion. Five times the upper limit of transaminases was considered as liver injury. RESULTS: Among the 1026 patients who fulfill the inclusion/exclusion criteria, 199 (19.4%) exhibited spontaneous abdominal pain and 165 (16.2%) after abdomen palpation. Systematized abdominal pain was most frequently localized in the epigastric (39.8%) and upper right quadrant (23.7%). Considering baseline ALT levels, 7.14% of patients with epigastric pain had pathological ALT value versus 0.29% of patients without symptoms (p = 0.008). When taking the 30days maximal transaminases value, this reached respectively 16.3% versus 2.7% (p < 0.001) and 20% versus 3.8% (p < 0.001) for respectively AST and ALT. With logistic regression we demonstrated that baseline pathological AST value was associated with hospital mortality and/or admission to intensive/intermediate care unit with an odds ratio of 13.9 (CI 1.5-124.7, p = 0.019). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that COVID-19-induced abdominal pain is associated with liver injury which could predict poor evolution of disease.","output":"COVID-19-related abdominal pain is associated with elevated liver transaminases, which could predict poor clinical outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND health measures as the global activity limitation indicator (GALI) or self-rated health (SRH) allow to quantify and monitor the health of the population. The GALI is widely used in the European Union; however, evidence of its construct validity is still limited. We examine whether the GALI reflects disability in specific living contexts such as self-care, domestic life and work activity, whether it does so consistently across gender and age and its added value concerning SRH. METHODS We used the subsample of adults aged 16-64 years (N = 15 934) from the 2009 European Health Interview Survey in Spain and analyzed the data with logistic regression models using the GALI and SRH as response variables. RESULTS The GALI was strongly and significantly associated with the three measures of disability: self-care (OR = 22.8, 95% CI: 15.9-32.7), domestic life (OR = 16.3, 95% CI: 13.6-19.5) and work activity (e.g. impossibility to work: OR = 41.9, 95% CI: 30.3-57.8; prolonged sick leave: OR = 10.7, 95% CI: 9-12.7). There were significant interactions with age on all three disability measures and with the gender on one (domestic life), although they were small. SRH was also strongly associated with all three disability measures, but to a lesser extent than the GALI. CONCLUSIONS The GALI reflects well and better than SRH, disability in self-care, domestic life and work activity. It is unknown whether the GALI performs equally in other living contexts such as social relations and community life.","output":"Association of the global activity limitation indicator with specific measures of disability in adults aged below 65."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Healthcare organizations are an attractive target for cyber-attacks, because the digitization of health processes is emerging as a necessity.

This is particularly important in high-risk procedures like dental treatment. The present randomized control trial evaluated the efficacy of three commercial mouth-rinse viz. povidone-iodine (PI), chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) and cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), in reducing the salivary SARS-CoV-2 viral load in COVID-19 patients compared with water. METHODS: A total of 36 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients were recruited, of which 16 patients were randomly assigned to four groups-PI group (n = 4), CHX group (n = 6), CPC group (n = 4) and water as control group (n = 2). Saliva samples were collected from all patients at baseline and at 5 min, 3 h and 6 h post-application of mouth-rinses/water. The samples were subjected to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR analysis. RESULTS: Comparison of salivary Ct values of patients within each group of PI, CHX, CPC and water at 5 min, 3 h and 6 h time points did not show any significant differences. However, when the Ct value fold change of each of the mouth-rinse group patients were compared with the fold change of water group patients at the respective time points, a significant increase was observed in the CPC group patients at 5 min and 6 h and in the PI group patients at 6 h. CONCLUSION: The effect of decreasing salivary load with CPC and PI mouth-rinsing was observed to be sustained at 6 h time point. Within the limitation of the current study, as number of the samples analyzed, the use of CPC and PI formulated that commercial mouth-rinses may be useful as a pre-procedural rinse to help reduce the transmission of COVID-19.

Methods: We summarize what is known about the epidemiology, virology, phylogeny and emergence of MERS-CoV to inform public health policies. Results: The median age of patients (n=161) was 50 years (range 14 months to 94 years), 64.5% were male and 63.4% experienced severe respiratory disease. 76.0% of patients were reported to have 1 underlying medical condition and fatal cases, compared to recovered or asymptomatic cases were more likely to have an underlying condition (86.8% vs. 42.4%, p<0.001). Analysis of genetic sequence data suggests multiple independent introductions into human populations and modelled estimates using epidemiologic and genetic data suggest R0 is <1, though the upper range of estimates may exceed 1. Index/sporadic cases (cases with no epidemiologic-link to other cases) were more likely to be older (median 59.0 years vs. 43.0 years, p<0.001) compared to secondary cases, although these proportions have declined over time. 80.9% vs. 67.2% of index/sporadic and secondary cases, respectively, reported 1 underlying condition.

Improved right ventricular (RV) function, thereby reducing venous congestion, may play a role. We assessed the effect of HR control with esmolol during sepsis on RV function, macrocirculation, microcirculation, end-organ-perfusion, and ventricular-arterial coupling. Sepsis was induced in 10 healthy anesthetized and mechanically ventilated sheep by continuous IV administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Esmolol was infused after successful resuscitation of the septic shock, to reduce HR and stopped 30-min after reaching targeted HR reduction of 30%. Venous and arterial blood gases were sampled and the small intestines' microcirculation was assessed by using a hand-held video microscope (CytoCam-IDF). Arterial and venous pressures, and cardiac output (CO) were recorded continuously. An intraventricular micromanometer was used to assess the RV function. Ventricular-arterial coupling ratio (VACR) was estimated by catheterization-derived single beat estimation. The targeted HR reduction of >30% by esmolol infusion, after controlled resuscitation of the LPS induced septic shock, led to a deteriorated RV-function and macrocirculation, while the microcirculation remained depressed. Esmolol improved VACR by decreasing the RV end-systolic pressure. Stopping esmolol showed the reversibility of these effects on the RV and the macrocirculation. In this animal model of acute severe endotoxic septic shock, early administration of esmolol decreased RV-function resulting in venous congestion and an unimproved poor microcirculation despite improved cardiac mechanical efficiency.","output":"The influence of esmolol on right ventricular function in early experimental endotoxic shock."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Antibiotics are essential to treat infections during pregnancy and to reduce both maternal and infant mortality. Overall use, but especially non-indicated use, and misuse of antibiotics are drivers of antibiotic resistance (ABR). High non-indicated use of antibiotics for uncomplicated vaginal deliveries is widespread in many parts of the world. Similarly, irrational use of antibiotics is reported for children. There is scarcity of evidence regarding antibiotic use and ABR in Lao PDR (Laos). The overarching aim of this project is to fill those knowledge gaps and to evaluate a quality improvement intervention. The primary objective is to estimate the proportion of uncomplicated vaginal deliveries where antibiotics are used and to compare its trend before and after the intervention. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This 3-year, prospective, quasiexperimental study without comparison group includes a formative and interventional phase. Data on antibiotic use during delivery will be collected from medical records. Knowledge, attitudes and reported practices on antibiotic use in pregnancy, during delivery and for children, will be collected from women through questionnaires. Healthcare providers knowledge, attitudes and practices of antibiotics administration for pregnant women, during delivery and for children, will be collected via adapted questionnaires. Perceptions regarding antibiotics will be explored through focus group discussions with women and individual interviews with key stakeholders. Faecal samples for culturing of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. and antibiotic susceptibility testing will be taken before, during and 6 months after delivery to determine colonisation of resistant strains. The planned intervention will comprise training workshops, educational materials and social media campaign and will be evaluated using interrupted time series analysis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The project received ethical approval from the National Ethics Committee for Health Research, Ministry of Health, Laos.

Over two days, the Hungarian parliament introduced and unanimously approved a new regulation, Act C of 2020 on the Employment Status of Health Workers, that replaces the existing public employment relationship between health professionals, public providers and their controlling authorities. The Act, passed on 6 October 2020, brings the employment of health workers under strict central control by introducing a new employment status similar to that of the armed forces. The Act also provides doctors with an unprecedented 120% salary increase and criminalizes informal payments. The reception has been overwhelmingly negative, with thousands of health professionals indicating that they would not sign the new contracts, and the policy also contains serious technical and feasibility concerns.

METHODS: Study participants were from the Kaiser Permanente Research Bank (KPRB), a biorepository that includes adult Kaiser Permanente members from across the United States. Starting in April 2020, electronic surveys were sent to KPRB members to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. These surveys collected information on self-report of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-related risk factors, including electronic cigarette and combustible cigarette smoking history. We also used electronic health records data to assess COVID-19 diagnoses, positive PCR lab tests, hospitalizations, and death. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) comparing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection between individuals by e-cigarette use categories (never, former, and current). Among those with SARS-CoV-2 infection, we used multivariable logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs comparing the odds of hospitalization or death within 30 days of infection between individuals by e-cigarette use categories. RESULTS: There were 126,475 individuals who responded to the survey and completed questions on e-cigarette and combustible cigarette use (48% response rate). Among survey respondents, 819 (1%) currently used e-cigarettes, 3,691 (3%) formerly used e-cigarettes, and 121,965 (96%) had never used e-cigarettes. After adjustment for demographic, behavioral, and clinical factors, there was no association with SARS-CoV-2 infection and former e-cigarette use (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.99; CI: 0.83C1.18) or current e-cigarette use (HR = 1.08; CI: 0.76C1.52).

The developing world continues to face challenges in closing the large treatment gap for epilepsy, due to a high burden of disease and few experienced providers to manage the condition. Children with epilepsy are susceptible to higher rates of developmental impairments and refractory disease due to delays or absence of appropriate management as a result. We demonstrated that a structured education intervention on pediatric epilepsy can improve knowledge, confidence, and impact clinical practice of first level providers in Zambia. Methods. Three first-level facilities across Zambia were included. After initial pilot versions and revisions, the final course was implemented at each site. Pre- and post-intervention knowledge and confidence assessments were performed. Additionally, chart reviews were conducted prior to intervention and 4 months after completion of training at each site to assess change on management. Results. Twenty-three of the original 24 participants from all 3 sites completed the training; 48% clinical officers, 43% nurses, 9% other expertise.

A repeated-measures ANOVA series was conducted to investigate differences in public responses between the two aforementioned time points. Main Findings: After controlling for the effects from gender, age, and education levels, the participants reported practicing more infection-prevention behaviors, experiencing a lower level of fear as a psychological response, and paying less attention to COVID-19-related information during T2 than T1. Conclusions: This study addressed the need to monitor public responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, including changes in people's behaviors and psychological responses across time. The results also suggest that the HK public was steered toward striking a balance between strengthening their infection-prevention behaviors and reducing their fear of COVID-19 infection.","output":"Health-Promoting Behaviors, Risk Perceptions, and Attention to COVID-19-Related Information: Comparing People's Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic Across Times of Chinese New Year and Summer 2020 in Hong Kong"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A patient with a complete right ureteral triplication presented with recurrent pyelonephritis and flank pain that was refractory to medical management.

A single-center analysis concluded that venous thromboembolism (VTE) chemoprophylaxis (CP) posed no significant bleeding risk in patients following ICPM implementation; however, there is still debate about the optimal use and timing of CP in patients with ICPMs for fear of worsening intracranial hemorrhage. We hypothesized that ICPM use is associated with increased time to VTE CP and thus increased VTE in patients with severe TBI. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the Trauma Quality Improvement Program (2010C2016) was performed to compare severe TBI patients with and without ICPMs. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was completed. RESULTS: From 35,673 patients with severe TBI, 12,487 (35%) had an ICPM. Those with ICPMs had a higher rate of VTE CP (64.3% vs. 49.4%, p < 0.001) but a longer median time to CP initiation (5 vs. 4 days, p < 0.001) as well as a longer hospital length of stay (LOS) (18 vs. 9 days, p < 0.001) compared to those without ICPMs. After adjusting for covariates, ICPM use was found to be associated with a higher risk of VTE (9.2% vs 4.3%, OR = 1.75, CI = 1.42C2.15, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to patients without ICPMs, those with ICPMs had a longer delay to initiation of CP leading to an increase in VTE. In addition, there was a nearly two-fold higher associated risk for VTE in patients with ICPMs even when controlling for known VTE risk factors.

A growing number of studies have focused on immunological determinants to develop better biomarkers for therapies. AIM: Studies of the insurgence of immunity is at the core of both SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development and therapies. This paper attempts to describe the insurgence (and the span) of immunity in COVID-19 at the population level by developing an in-silico model. We simulate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and analyze the impact of infecting viral load, affinity to the ACE2 receptor, and age in an artificially infected population on the course of the disease. METHODS: We use a stochastic agent-based immune simulation platform to construct a virtual cohort of infected individuals with age-dependent varying degrees of immune competence. We use a parameter set to reproduce known inter-patient variability and general epidemiological statistics. RESULTS: By assuming the viremia at day 30 of the infection to be the proxy for lethality, we reproduce in-silico several clinical observations and identify critical factors in the statistical evolution of the infection. In particular, we evidence the importance of the humoral response over the cytotoxic response and find that the antibody titers measured after day 25 from the infection are a prognostic factor for determining the clinical outcome of the infection. Our modeling framework uses COVID-19 infection to demonstrate the actionable effectiveness of modeling the immune response at individual and population levels. The model developed can explain and interpret observed patterns of infection and makes verifiable temporal predictions. Within the limitations imposed by the simulated environment, this work proposes quantitatively that the great variability observed in the patient outcomes in real life can be the mere result of subtle variability in the infecting viral load and immune competence in the population. In this work, we exemplify how computational modeling of immune response provides an important view to discuss hypothesis and design new experiments, in particular paving the way to further investigations about the duration of vaccine-elicited immunity especially in the view of the blundering effect of immunosenescence.","output":"From Infection to Immunity: Understanding the Response to SARS-CoV2 Through In-Silico Modeling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Perilla/Hadden-Perilla research team at the University of Delaware presents an overview of computational structural biology, their efforts to model the SARS-CoV-2 viral particle, and their perspective on how their work and training endeavors can contribute to public health.","output":"Coronavirus through Delawares Computational Microscope"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The recent COVID-19 pandemic has led several countries worldwide to confine the population. Consequently, people's mobility and physical activity are limited in addition to a negative psychosocial effect. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of COVID-19 crisis on short-term weight loss and the remission of obesity-associated comorbidities in patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy (SG). METHODS: A case-control study was conducted comparing percentage of total weight loss (%TWL), excess weight lost (%EWL), and the remission rate of obesity-related comorbidities at the first postoperative year between patients who underwent primary SG between June 2019 and October 2019 (1-year postoperative period affected by COVID-19 lockdown; COV-group), and a control group operated between June 2018 and October 2018 (1-year postoperative period not affected by COVID-19 lockdown; CONTROL-group). RESULTS: In total, 45 patients from COV-group were compared to 57 patients from CONTROL-group. Demographic data were similar between groups. The follow-up rate at 1 year was 100%. The mean %TWL and %EWL was lower at 28.2  12.7% and 67.6  23.5% in COV-group patients compared to 34.3  14.1% and 78.3  27.2% in CONTROL-group patients at 1 year from SG (p=0.025 and p=0.036, respectively).

We aimed to analyze real-world registry data focused primarily on participants with cardiometabolic diseases (CMD), which were remotely obtained via a digital platform. METHODS: Participants were divided into two groups: CMD or no cardiometabolic disease (non-CMD). They were evaluated based on their medical history, current medications/supplements, COVID-19 status, demographics, and baseline characteristics. The frequency of medications/supplements for CMD were compared using relative risks and 95% confidence intervals. The WHO (Five) Well-Being Index (WHO-5) were collected monthly for 6 months to assess psychological well-being which included cheerfulness, calmness, vigor, rest, and engagement with daily activities of interest. RESULTS: The 791 enrollees represented 49 U.S. states. The CMD group had significantly higher (p < 0.0001) BMI (mean + 3.04 kg/m(2)) and age (mean + 9.15 years) compared to non-CMD group. In the CMD group, participants who tested positive for COVID-19 had lower (p < 0.0001) well-being scores than those without COVID-19. For the 274 participants on CMD medications/supplements, there was no statistical difference in risk of COVID-19 contracture based on medication/supplement type; however, all six participants who were not being treated for CMD were COVID-19 positive (RR ~ 104). For 89 participants who were on treatment for diabetes or insulin resistance, there was a 90% reduced risk of COVID-19 incidence (p = 0.0187). CONCLUSION: The well-being score of the CMD group was dependent on whether they tested positive for COVID-19.

RESULTS 211 physicians completed the survey. Most respondents recommend endovascular treatment as the first-line management strategy for most ruptured (78%) and unruptured (71%) aneurysms. Thirty-eight per cent of respondents indicate that they routinely treat all patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage regardless of grade. Most physicians use the International Study of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms data for counseling patients on natural history risk (80%); a small minority (11%) always or usually recommend treatment of anterior circulation aneurysms of <5 mm. Two-thirds of respondents continue to recommend clipping for most middle cerebral artery aneurysms, while most (51%) recommend flow diversion for wide-necked internal carotid artery aneurysms.

The resulting global human confinement, dubbed as the Anthropause, has created an unprecedented opportunity for us to evaluate the environmental consequences of large-scale changes in anthropogenic activities. Based on a methodical and in-depth review of related literature, this study critically evaluates the positive and negative externalities of COVID-19 induced lockdown on environmental components including air, water, noise, waste, forest, wildlife, and biodiversity. Among adverse impacts of the lockdown, increased amount of healthcare waste (300-400%), increased level of atmospheric ozone (30-300%), elevated levels of illicit felling in forests and wildlife poaching were prominent. Compared to the negative impacts, significant positive changes in various quality parameters related to key environmental components were evident. Positive impacts on air quality, water quality, noise level, waste generation, and wildlife were apparent in varying degrees as evaluated in this study. By presenting a critical overview of the recommendations given in the major literature in light of these documented impacts, this paper alludes to potential policy reforms as a guideline for future sustainable environmental management planning. Some of the key recommendations are e.g., enhance remote working facilities, cleaner design, use of internet of things, automation, systematic lockdown, and inclusion of hazardous waste management in disaster planning.

Patients without any suspicious findings on thorax tomography and having oxygen saturation above 90% at the time of presentation were included as the first group. Patients with suspicious tomography findings but having oxygen saturation above 90% were designed as the second group, and patients with both suspicious tomography findings for COVID-19 and low oxygen saturation levels (<90%) at the time of admission were taken as the third group. Patients with oxygen desaturation were significantly older than the patients with normal oxygen saturations (P = 0.001). Patients with thorax tomography findings were having significantly higher D-dimer levels (P = 0.001). Patients with oxygen desaturation were having significantly higher D-dimer levels than the patients with normal oxygen saturations (P = 0.001). There was a significant negative correlation between oxygen saturation and D-dimer levels in all patients with and without tomography findings (r = -0.301, P = 0.016). Similarly, there was a significant positive correlation between the oxygen saturation and the lymphocyte count (r = 0.300, P < 0.017).

To analyze FFs in Italy during 1997C2020 with the aim of gaining observational insights into the effectiveness of the legislation in force and consequently of inspection activities, FFs were determined from official food inspections carried out by the Central Inspectorate of Quality Protection and Fraud Repression of Agri-food Products in 1997C2020. Inspected sectors were wine, oils and fats, milk and dairy products, fruit and vegetables, meat, eggs, honey, feeds and supplements, and seeds. Data show that the inspection activities have significantly improved in terms of sampling and fraud detection. However, a higher incidence of fraud involving the meat sector was observed. The obtained results demonstrate that there has not been a clear change of direction after the so-called hygiene package (food hygiene rules in the EU) came into force.

Methods: Nationwide retrospective observational study based on electronic health data. 4 248 253 individuals aged 15 to 75 years with a diagnosis of obesity were included. All obese inpatients, undergoing bariatric surgery or not, recorded during a hospital stay by the French National Health Insurance were followed, during a mean observation time of 5.43  2.93 years. This exposition was bariatric surgery (n=389,671) including adjustable gastric banding, sleeve gastrectomy, gastric bypass versus no bariatric surgery (n=3,858,582). The primary outcome was Covid-19 related death and the secondary outcome was the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. Results: 8 286 (0.2%) obese individuals were admitted for Covid-19 infection between January 1 st and May 15 th 2020 with a diagnosis of Covid-19 infection. 541 (0.14%) had a history of bariatric surgery and 7,745 (0.2%) did not. Invasive mechanical ventilation was necessary in 14.54% of patients and death occurred in 13.58% of cases. The need for an invasive mechanical ventilation and death occurred in 7% and 3.5% in the bariatric surgery group versus 15% and 14.2% in the non-bariatric surgery group, respectively (both p <0.0001). After a logistic regression, the risk of invasive mechanical ventilation significantly increased with age being higher in the age class 61-75, male gender, and hypertension, whereas bariatric surgery showed an independent protective effect. Mortality was independently associated with increasing age, male gender, known history of heart failure, cancer, and diabetes, whereas BS was in favor with a protective effect.

Children are at particularly high risk of both sustaining a TBI and experiencing serious long-term consequences, such as cognitive deficits, mental health problems and post-traumatic epilepsy. Severe TBI patients are highly susceptible to nosocomial infections, which are mostly acquired within the first week of hospitalization post-TBI. Yet the potential chronic impact of such acute infections following pediatric TBI remains unclear. In this study, we hypothesized that a peripheral immune challenge, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mimicking a hospital-acquired infection-would worsen inflammatory, neurobehavioral, and seizure outcomes after experimental pediatric TBI. To test this, three-week old male C57Bl/6J mice received a moderate controlled cortical impact or sham surgery, followed by 1 mg/kg i.p. LPS (or 0.9% saline vehicle) at 4 days TBI. Mice were randomized to four groups; sham-saline, sham-LPS, TBI-saline or TBI-LPS (n = 15/group). Reduced general activity and increased anxiety-like behavior were observed within 24 h in LPS-treated mice, indicating a transient sickness response. LPS-treated mice also exhibited a reduction in body weights, which persisted chronically. From 2 months post-injury, mice underwent a battery of tests for sensorimotor, cognitive, and psychosocial behaviors. TBI resulted in hyperactivity and spatial memory deficits, independent of LPS; whereas LPS resulted in subtle deficits in spatial memory retention. At 5 months post-injury, video-electroencephalographic recordings were obtained to evaluate both spontaneous seizure activity as well as the evoked seizure response to pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). TBI increased susceptibility to PTZ-evoked seizures; whereas LPS appeared to increase the incidence of spontaneous seizures. Post-mortem analyses found that TBI, but not LPS, resulted in robust glial reactivity and loss of cortical volume. A TBI  LPS interaction in hippocampal volume suggested that TBI-LPS mice had a subtle increase in ipsilateral hippocampus tissue loss; however, this was not reflected in neuronal cell counts. Both TBI and LPS independently had modest effects on chronic hippocampal gene expression. Together, contrary to our hypothesis, we observed minimal synergy between TBI and LPS. Instead, pediatric TBI and a subsequent transient immune challenge independently influenced chronic outcomes. These findings have implications for future preclinical modeling as well as acute post-injury patient management.","output":"Pediatric traumatic brain injury and a subsequent transient immune challenge independently influenced chronic outcomes in male mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Motivated by the two-decade-long scientific debate over the existence of the ego-depletion effect, our paper contributes to exploring the scope conditions of ego-depletion theory.

We described the clinical presentation and course of COVID-19 in LTCF residents who were tested either because of presence of core symptoms (S-based) or because of transmission prevention (TP-based) Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting and participants: Amsta (Amsterdam, The Netherlands), is a 1185-bed LTCF. All LTCF residents who underwent SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing between March 16, 2020 and May 31, 2020 were included (n = 380). Measures: Clinical symptoms, temperature and oxygen saturation were extracted from medical records, 7 days before testing up to 14 days after testing. Results: SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in 81 (21%) residents. Of these 81, 36 (44%) residents were tested S-based and 45 (56%) residents were tested TP-based. Yet, CT-values did not differ between the groups. In the 7 days prior to the test the most common symptoms in both groups were: falling (32%), somnolence (25%) and fatigue (21%). Two days before the test, we observed a stronger decrease in oxygen saturation and an increase in temperature for the S-based group compared to the T-based group that remained up to 10 days after testing. Residents with in the S-based group were 2.5 times more likely to decease within 30 days than residents in the TP-based group (HR, 2.56; 95% 1.3 to 5.2). Even though, 73% of the T-based group did eventually developed core symptoms. Conclusion and implications: Many LTCF residents with a positive PCR did not have core symptoms when tested but had other signs/symptoms in the week before the positive test.

Calves were then infected with a virulent rotavirus inoculum, J-160, to investigate the role of immune responses both in recovery from primary rotavirus infection and in resistance to secondary rotavirus infection. Treatment of calves with DX markedly suppressed in vitro responsiveness of peripheral blood lymphocytes to mitogens within 48 h of the start of DX treatment. Suppression was similar in rotavirus-naive and rotavirus-immune calves. In contrast, the effect of DX treatment on specific antibody responses differed depending on when DX treatment started in relation to rotavirus infection. When DX treatment commenced prior to primary rotavirus infection both systemic and local specific antibody responses were inhibited. These calves, in which mitogen and antibody responses were suppressed, exhibited greater clinical signs than did control calves after infection with virulent rotavirus, but virus excretion was affected in only one of the two calves. When DX treatment was started after primary rotavirus infection but before secondary infection, systemic and local antibody responses to the primary infection and to the challenge infection were not affected. These calves resisted challenge with virulent virus as did DX-untreated rotavirus-immune calves, even though mitogen responses were suppressed. We conclude that in a primary rotavirus infection, virus excretion ceased when both antibody and mitogen responses were suppressed. Resistance to secondary rotavirus infection occurred when mitogen responsiveness was suppressed, but when antibody levels were normal. Thus, no evidence was obtained that fully functional cell-mediated immune mechanisms are essential for resistance to rotavirus infection. Evidence was provided for the ability of parenteral treatment with DX to suppress mucosal as well as systemic antibody responses.","output":"The effect of dexamethasone-induced immunosuppression on the development of faecal antibody and recovery from and resistance to rotavirus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Correction for 'Inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pyroptosis with the ethyl acetate fraction of Bungeanum ameliorated cognitive dysfunction in aged mice' by Meihuan Zhao et al., Food Funct., 2021, DOI: 10.1039/D1FO00876E.","output":"Correction: Inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pyroptosis with the ethyl acetate fraction of Bungeanum ameliorated cognitive dysfunction in aged mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: To identify international and periodically updated models of the COVID-19 epidemic, compile and visualize their estimation results, at the global and country levels, and periodically update the compilations.

The heterogeneity in transmission can be measured by describing the distribution of the number of secondary cases as a negative binomial (NB) distribution with dispersion parameter, k. However, such inference framework usually neglects the under-ascertainment of sporadic cases, which are those without known epidemiological link and considered as independent clusters of size one, and this may potentially bias the estimates. METHODS: In this study, we adopt a zero-truncated likelihood-based framework to estimate k. We evaluate the estimation performance by using stochastic simulations, and compare it with the baseline non-truncated version. We exemplify the analytical framework with three contact tracing datasets of COVID-19. RESULTS: We demonstrate that the estimation bias exists when the under-ascertainment of index cases with 0 secondary case occurs, and the zero-truncated inference overcomes this problem and yields a less biased estimator of k. We find that the k of COVID-19 is inferred at 0.32 (95%CI: 0.15, 0.64), which appears slightly smaller than many previous estimates. We provide the simulation codes applying the inference framework in this study. CONCLUSIONS: The zero-truncated framework is recommended for less biased transmission heterogeneity estimates.

DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective observational study in a single-center bed pediatric intensive care unit serving two Dutch provinces. PATIENTS: 533 mechanically ventilated children aged 0C16 years, all of whom met the North-American European Consensus Conference criteria for ARDS. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Chest radiographs were screened for the novel presence of bilateral infiltrates, in patients with bilateral infiltrates the PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio was calculated on two separate consecutive measurements. If below 200, the patient was classified as having ARDS. Left ventricular dysfunction was ruled out by echocardiography. The incidence was calculated by obtaining the number of children aged 0C16 years in our region. For each patient it was noted whether the patient was currently considered to have ARDS. Forty-one patients (7.7%) met the criteria for ARDS, with an incidence of 2.2 per 100,000 per year. The mortality rate was 20.4%. Thirty patients (73.1%) had primary ARDS, mainly from viral lower respiratory tract disease. Only ten patients (24.4%) currently had ARDS.

Children with COVID-19 differ from adults in that they are less often and less severely affected. Additional precautions required in the management of children address their increased radiosensitivity, need for accompanying carers, and methods for dealing with children in a mixed adult-paediatric institution. In this guidance document, our aim is to define a pragmatic strategy for imaging children with an emphasis on proven or suspected COVID-19 cases. Children suspected of COVID-19 should not be imaged routinely. Imaging should be performed only when expected to alter patient management, depending on symptoms, preexisting conditions and clinical evolution. In order to prevent disease transmission, it is important to manage the inpatient caseload effectively by triaging children and carers outside the hospital, re-scheduling nonurgent elective procedures and managing symptomatic children and carers as COVID-19 positive until proven otherwise. Within the imaging department one should consider conducting portable examinations with COVID-19 machines or arranging dedicated COVID-19 paediatric imaging sessions and performing routine nasopharyngeal swab testing before imaging under general anaesthesia. Finally, regular personal hygiene, appropriate usage of personal protective equipment, awareness of which procedures are considered aerosol generating and information on how to best disinfect imaging machinery after examinations should be highlighted to all staff members.","output":"Management strategies for children with COVID-19: ESPR practical recommendations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent outbreak of a new zoonotic origin Coronavirus has ring the bell for the potential spread of epidemic Coronavirus crossing the species.

Three nasopharyngeal swabs in the 96 hours following hospital admission were negative, despite a CT thorax suggestive for an early stage of infection. COVID-infection was finally confirmed in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, performed for exclusion of an alternative diagnosis in immunocompromised. In the BAL an increased cellularity with marked lymphocytosis of 35%, a reduced CD4/CD8 ratio of 0.1 and borderline neutrophilia of 3% were found. This finding might be due to the concomitant therapy with anti-CD20 antibodies, but the presence of lymphocytosis in the BAL despite peripheral lymphopenia with decreased CD4/CD8 T-cells ratio are described here for the first time in a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea), fever and initially headache were the predominant symptoms. The respiratory symptoms were scarce (variable mild dyspnea mMRC1). The respiratory conditions worsened during the hospital stay, with tachypnea up to 35/min, increased need for supplemental oxygen up to 8 L/min and worsening lung infiltrates on CT thorax on day 5. A therapy with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and an immunoglobulin-supplementation were given, with clinical and respiratory improvement, without need for intensive care or any ventilator support, and hospital discharge on day 16.

STUDY DESIGN: Abbott ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassay was compared to an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) on sera from patients with COVID-19 collected at different days after symptoms onset or infected by other human coronaviruses. Comparison with neutralization test was also performed. RESULTS: After 7, 14 and >14 days after onset ARCHITECT was positive on 8.3%; 61.9% and 100% of the tested samples compared to 58.3%; 85.7% and 100% by IFA. The sensitivity was 72% vs. IFA and 66.7% vs. a real-time PCR, the specificity was 100%. On 18 samples with neutralizing activity, 17 were positive by Abbott ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, Abbott ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay showed a satisfactory performance, with a very high specificity. IgG reactivity against SARSCoV-2 N antigen was detectable in all patients by two weeks after symptoms onset. In addition, concordance between this serological response and viral neutralization suggests that a strong humoral response may be predictive of a neutralization activity, regardless of the target antigens.

Given the high prevalence, this study focused on ABs for Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTI). Methods: The qualitative, semi-structured interviews followed a guide organized by major themes such as common symptoms, consultations with doctors and external influences in decision-making. Patient participants were recruited via convenience sampling. Fifty-five interviews were conducted among patients using ABs for URTIs purchased with or without prescription. Data was analyzed using a direct content analysis and validation rounds were conducted between interviewers and data analyzers. Results: Self-medication with ABs seemed a common practice across all five Russian regions; in some cases, patients tried to persuade pharmacists into selling them ABs without prescription. Factors, such as time spent going to the doctor, need of a sick leave or self-persuasion, influenced the decisions of whether or not to seek the doctor for symptoms of URTIs. Knowledge of ABs and AMR was generally low; however, some patients with seemingly good knowledge practiced self-medication from time to time. Family members and friends were often involved in decisions about how to handle symptoms of URTIs, especially among those patients using ABs without prescription. Few patients had noticed ABs awareness campaigns, and very few reported having learned something important from them. Conclusion: Despite enforced regulation of AB use in Russia, self-medication still exists.

Over the past decade, a critical role for the Ubiquitin Proteasome System (UPS) in counteracting host immune factors during viral infection has emerged. This counteraction is commonly achieved by the expression of viral proteins capable of sequestering host ubiquitin E3 ligases and their regulators. In particular, many viruses hijack members of the Cullin-RING E3 Ligase (CRL) family. Viruses interact in many ways with CRLs in order to impact their ligase activity; one key recurring interaction involves re-directing CRL complexes to degrade host targets that are otherwise not degraded within host cells. Removal of host immune factors by this mechanism creates a more amenable cellular environment for viral propagation. To date, a small number of target host factors have been identified, many of which are degraded via a CRL-proteasome pathway. Substantial effort within the field is ongoing to uncover the identities of further host proteins targeted in this fashion and the underlying mechanisms driving their turnover by the UPS. Elucidation of these targets and mechanisms will provide appealing anti-viral therapeutic opportunities. This review is focused on the many methods used by viruses to perturb host CRLs, focusing on substrate sequestration and viral regulation of E3 activity.","output":"Cullin E3 Ligases and Their Rewiring by Viral Factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"STUDY OBJECTIVES: By March 2020, COVID-19 forced much of the world to stay at home to reduce the spread of the disease. Some health care workers transitioned to working from home while many continued to report to work in person as essential employees. We sought to explore changes in sleep, health, work, and mood in health care workers during the stay-at-home orders. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey administered to health care workers. The survey assessed changes in sleep, work, screen time, media exposure, diet, exercise, substance use, and mood. The survey data was collected between March 28, 2020, and April 29, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 834 of 936 individuals completed the entire survey. Respondents were from 41 US states. Mood after the stay-at-home orders worsened and screen time and substance use increased. Total sleep time (TST) shortened in those continuing to work in-person (p<.001), whereas TST was unchanged in those working from home (p=.73). Those working from home went to bed later, woke up later, and worked fewer hours. Reduced TST and increased screen time before bed were associated with worse mood and screen time. Longer sleep time was associated with better mood. CONCLUSIONS: Health care workers' mood worsened regardless of whether work was in person or remote, though TST was shorter for those working in person. Those working from home perhaps shifted sleep time to be more in line with endogenous circadian phase.

We considered a material with high hydrogen bonding capacity (cellulose) and a material capable of strong hydrophobic interactions (graphite). Initially, the spike adsorbs to both surfaces through essentially the same residues belonging to the receptor binding subunit of its three monomers. Adsorption onto cellulose stabilizes in this configuration, with the help of a large number of hydrogen bonds developed between cellulose and the three receptor-binding domains of the glycoprotein spike.

Despite its critical and multifunctional nature, the molecular details that underlie how N protein mediates these functions are poorly understood. Here we combine single-molecule spectroscopy with all-atom simulations to uncover the molecular details that contribute to the function of SARS-CoV-2 N protein. N protein contains three intrinsically disordered regions and two folded domains. All three disordered regions are highly dynamic and contain regions of transient helicity that appear to act as local binding interfaces for protein-protein or protein-RNA interactions. The two folded domains do not significantly interact with one another, such that full-length N protein is a flexible and multivalent RNA binding protein. As observed for other proteins with similar molecular features, we found that N protein undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation when mixed with RNA. Polymer models predict that the same multivalent interactions that drive phase separation also engender RNA compaction. We propose a simple model in which symmetry breaking through specific binding sites promotes the formation of metastable single-RNA condensate, as opposed to large multi-RNA phase separated droplets. We speculate that RNA compaction to form dynamic single-genome condensates may underlie the early stages of genome packaging. As such, assays that measure how compounds modulate phase separation could provide a convenient tool for identifying drugs that disrupt viral packaging.","output":"The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein is dynamic, disordered, and phase separates with RNA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over one million cases of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have been confirmed worldwide, with the death toll exceeding 50,000 people.

RSV, influenza, and other viruses are common causes of severe viral lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), and COVID-19 pneumonia is associated with high mortality rates. With limited treatment options currently available, viral COVID-19 LRTI in particular represents a significant unmet medical need. Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is a highly promising treatment option, given its documented antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects as well as beneficial effects on pulmonary vasculature. In particular, the antiviral effect of iNO on SARS-CoV-2 has been attributed to covalent binding to SARS-CoV-2 protease. In multiple clinical trials and compassionate use cases, intermittent exposure to 150 - 250 ppm iNO was well tolerated, resulted in improved physical and lung function, reduced bacterial load in patients with cystic fibrosis , and shortened time to improvement of clinical signs and time to fit for discharge in patients with acute bronchiolitis. Based on these data, we have initiated a prospective, randomized, open label, multi-center pilot clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of iNO for the treatment of viral pneumonia in adult patients. METHODS: In the current study, subjects (ages 18-80) with COVID-19 (COVID group) or other acute viral pneumonias (Viral LRTI group) requiring inpatient hospitalization are being randomized 1:1 to be treated with intermittent inhalations of 150 ppm iNO, given for 40 minutes 4 times daily for up to 7 days in addition to standard supportive treatment (SST), or to receive SST alone. iNO is being delivered by the LungFitTM, an innovative portable device under development (Beyond Air, NY, USA) that generates NO from room air.

In this paper, we propose BU - Trace, a novel permissionless mobile system for privacy-preserving intelligent contact tracing based on QR code and NFC technologies. First, a user study is conducted to investigate and quantify the user acceptance of a mobile contact tracing system. Second, a decentralized system is proposed to enable contact tracing while protecting user privacy. Third, an intelligent behavior detection algorithm is designed to ease the use of our system. We implement BU - Trace and conduct extensive experiments in several real-world scenarios. The experimental results show that BU - Trace achieves a privacy-preserving and intelligent mobile system for contact tracing without requesting location or other privacy-related permissions. ? 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"BU-Trace: A Permissionless Mobile System for Privacy-Preserving Intelligent Contact Tracing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Volume resuscitation is an important early treatment for haemorrhagic shock. Haemoglobin-based oxygen carrier (HBOC) can expand the volume and provide oxygen for tissues. Vascular leakage is common complication in the process of haemorrhagic shock and resuscitation. The aim of this study was to observe the effects of HBOC (a bovine-derived, cross-linked tetramer haemoglobin oxygen-carrying solution, 0.5 g/L) on vascular leakage in rats after haemorrhagic shock. A haemorrhagic shock rat model and hypoxic vascular endothelial cells (VECs) were used. The role of intercellular junctions and endothelial glycocalyx in the protective effects of HBOC and the relationship with mitochondrial function were analysed. After haemorrhagic shock, the pulmonary vascular permeability to FITC-BSA, Evans Blue was increased, endothelial glycocalyx was destroyed and the expression of intercellular junction proteins was decreased. After haemorrhagic shock, a small volume of HBOC solution (6 ml/kg) protected pulmonary vascular permeability, increased structural thickness of endothelial glycocalyx, the levels of its components and increased expression levels of the intercellular junction proteins ZO-1, VE-cadherin and occludin. Moreover, HBOC significantly increased oxygen delivery and consumption in rats, improved VEC mitochondrial function and structure. In conclusion, HBOC mitigates endothelial leakage by protecting endothelial glycocalyx and intercellular junctions through improving mitochondrial function and tissue oxygen delivery.","output":"Protective effects of HBOC on pulmonary vascular leakage after haemorrhagic shock and the underlying mechanisms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To explore the correlation between symptoms and their contribution to syndrome based on syndrome of lung damp-heat accumulation in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), thus to provide methodological basis for the syndrome diagnosis METHODS: Based on 654 clinical investigation questionnaires data of COVID-19 patients, a model based on syndrome of lung damp-heat accumulation was set Using SPSS Modeler 14 1 software, association rules and Bayesian network were applied to explore the correlation between symptoms and their contribution to syndrome RESULTS: There were 121 questionnaires referring to syndrome of lung damp-heat accumulation in total 654 questionnaires The symptoms with frequency &gt; 40% were fever (53 72%), cough (47 93%), red tongue (45 45%), rapid pulse (43 80%), greasy fur (42 15%), yellow tongue (41 32%), fatigue (40 50%) and anorexia (40 50%) Association rule analysis showed that the symptom groups with strong binomial correlation included fever, thirst, chest tightness, shortness of breath, cough, yellow phlegm, etc The symptom groups with strong trinomial correlation included cough, yellow phlegm, phlegm sticky, anorexia, vomiting, heavy head and body, fever, thirst, fatigue, etc Based on SPSS Modeler 14 1 software, with syndrome of lung damp-heat accumulation (yes = 1, no = 0) as target variable, and the selected symptoms with frequency &gt; 15 0% as input variables, the Bayesian network model was established to obtain the probability distribution table of symptoms (groups), in which there was only one parent node (the upper node of each input variable) of fever, and the conditional probability was 0 54 The parent node of cough had yellow phlegm and syndrome of lung damp-heat accumulation, indicating that there was a direct causal relationship between cough and yellow phlegm in syndrome of lung damp-heat accumulation, and the conditional probability of cough was 0 99 under the condition of yellow phlegm The common symptom groups and their contribution to syndrome were as follows: fever and thirsty (0 47), cough and yellow phlegm (0 49), chest tightness and polypnea (0 46), anorexia and heavy cumbersome head and body (0 61), yellow greasy fur and slippery rapid pulse (0 95) CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible and objective to analyze the correlation between symptoms and their contribution to syndromes by association rules combined with Bayesian network It could provide methodological basis for the syndrome diagnosis","output":"[Correlation between symptoms and their contribution to syndrome based on association rule combined with Bayesian network: syndrome of lung damp-heat accumulation in coronavirus disease 2019]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lack of knowledge and mistrust towards vaccines represent a challenge in achieving the vaccination coverage required for population immunity. The aim of this study is to examine the opinion that specific demographic groups have about COVID-19 vaccination, in order to detect potential fears and reasons for negative attitudes towards vaccination, and to gain knowledge on how to prepare strategies to eliminate possible misinformation that could affect vaccine hesitancy. The data collection approach was based on online questionnaire surveys, divided into three groups of questions that followed the main postulates of the health belief theorya theory that helps understanding a behaviour of the public in some concrete surrounding in receiving preventive measures. Ordinary least squares regression analyses were used to examine the influence of individual factors on refusing the vaccine, and to provide information on the perception of participants on the danger of COVID-19 infection, and on potential barriers that could retard the vaccine utility. There was an equal proportion of participants (total number 276) who planned on receiving the COVID-19 vaccine (37%), and of those who did not (36.3%). The rest (26.7%) of participants were still indecisive. Our results indicated that attitudes on whether to receive the vaccine, on how serious consequences might be if getting the infection, as well as a suspicious towards the vaccine efficacy and the fear of the vaccine potential side effects, may depend on participants age (<40 vs. >40 years) and on whether they are healthcare workers or not.

This study aimed to develop and validate a simple scoring system to predict post-AMI infection in such patients. METHODS: All patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing PCI consecutively enrolled from January 2010 to May 2016 were served as derivation cohort, and those from June 2016 to May 2018 as validation cohort, respectively. The primary endpoint was post-AMI infection during hospitalization, and all-cause death and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were considered as secondary endpoints. The simplified risk model was established using logistic regression. The area under the receiver operating curve and calibration of predicted and observed infection risk were calculated. RESULTS: A 24-point risk score was developed, with infection risk ranging from 0.7 to 99.6% for patients with the lowest and highest score. Seven variables including age, Killip classification, insulin use, white blood cell count, serum albumin, diuretic use, and transfemoral approach were included. This model achieved the same high discrimination in the development and validation cohort (C-statistic:0.851) and revealed adequate calibration in both datasets. The incidences of post-AMI infection increased steadily across risk score groups in both development (1.3, 5.1, 26.3, and 69.1%; P < 0.001) and validation (1.8, 5.9, 27.2, and 79.2%; P < 0.001) cohort. Moreover, the risk score demonstrated good performance for infection, in-hospital all-cause death, and MACE among these patients, as well as in patients with the non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome. CONCLUSION: This present risk score established a simple bedside tool to estimate the risk of developing infection and other in-hospital outcomes in patients with STEMI undergoing PCI.

Some chronic diseases may also affect individuals susceptibility to infectious diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of the host genetic factors mostly involved in inflammation, as well as hypercholesterolemia and diabetes with mild flu in an Iranian population. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from 93 patients referred to primary care centers of Markazi, Semnan, and Zanjan provinces (central Iran) due to flu-like symptoms between March 2015 and December 2018. Of these, PCR test identified 49 influenza A/H1N1 and 44 flu-negative individuals. Twelve single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in RPAIN, FCGR2A, MBL-2, CD55, C1QBP, IL-10, TNF- and an unknown gene were genotyped using iPLEX GOLD SNP genotyping analysis. Hypercholesterolemia and diabetes status was determined based on the physician diagnosis. Association of the host genetic variants, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes with mild A/H1N1 flu was assessed with univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis as implemented in Stata software (v.14). Statistical tests were considered as significant at 0.05 levels. RESULTS: Frequency of diabetes and hypercholesterolemia, as well as participants mean age was significantly higher in the flu-negative rather than the flu-positive group. Of 12 SNPs, nine did not show any significant association with mild flu in our study (rs1801274, rs1800451, rs2564978, rs361525, rs1800450, rs1800871, rs1800872, rs1800896, rs1800629). Possessing G vs. A allele in two SNPs (rs3786054 and rs8070740) was associated with a threefold increase in the chance of mild flu when compared to flu-negative patients (95% CI: 1.1, 22.0). Possessing C allele (vs. A) in the rs9856661 locus also increased the chance of mild flu up to 2 folds (95% CI: 1.0, 10.0). CONCLUSION: The results showed that possessing the G allele in either rs3786054 or rs8070740 loci in C1QBP and RPAIN genes, respectively, increased the risk of H1N1 infection up to 3.3 folds, regardless of the patients age, BMI, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia.

It is characterized by a poly-adenylated structure capping the genomic terminus.

As a route to proposing potential chemotherapy, this study suggests simple biplanar adenine quadruplexes (A4s) which may fold in specific sequences of the viral genome. To the best of our knowledge, uniquely biplanar A4s have not been previously described in any context. Using molecular modeling techniques and molecular dynamics simulations, some of these non-canonical structures show reasonable stability in a biological context. Notably, mRNA configured as a biplanar A4, shows less dynamic activity than DNA equivalents. This observation may be especially relevant in a physiological context. Furthermore, in contrast to well-characterized guanine quadruplexes, co-ordination with cations appears not to impact on stability.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on patients' adherence to HD and medical regimens. METHODS: Two hundred five ESRD patients on HD were interviewed with the ESRD Adherence Questionnaire (ESRD-AQ) and the Fear-of-COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S). Clinical and laboratory correlates of adherence were retrieved from patients' records. RESULTS: Self-reported adherence to HD showed that 19.5% were not adherent to HD during the pandemic compared to 11.7% before the pandemic (p < 0.001), with a significant agreement with the actual attendance of HD sessions (Kappa = 0.733, p < 0.001).

We introduced an exercise programme with the aim of increasing minutes of physical activity per week. Secondary outcome measures were weight, mood and energy levels. This project took place in the context of COVID-19 restrictions having reduced opportunities for off-ward activity and staff noting subsequent deconditioning and weight gain amongst the patient cohort. Cohort consisted largely of patients with a severe mental illness, many of whom had physical health co-mobridities. Method This project included all patients in the 16-bedded unit. Baseline data were collected prior to programme introduction, including weekly activity levels and weights. A questionnaire explored patient confidence and attitude towards physical activity. Focus groups were held with patients and staff in order to identify how best to introduce the programme, discuss content, and identify potential barriers. We introduced an eight-week programme of weekly, thirty-minute, mixed ability exercise sessions. These were led collectively by the multi-disciplinary team. Patients actively participated in programme design;choosing session soundtracks and contributing to content planning. Likert scales were used to measure self-report mood and energy levels pre- and post-session. Staff engaged in a weekly post session de-brief, where challenges were identified and solutions suggested. Weekly qualitative feedback was sought from participants. The sessions were thus developed and adapted according to patient and staff feedback over the programme's course. Following the 8-week programme, activity levels and weight were re-measured and compared to baseline. Pre-programme questionnaires were also repeated. Result Patients reported increased enjoyment and confidence engaging in physical activity, as well as improved overall self- confidence and a sense of pride and ownership of the sessions. Staff reported a more cohesive team environment, greater sense of work-place fulfilment and improved therapeutic relationships. Comparing pre and post session ten-point-Likert scales showed a 153% mean increase in self-rated energy levels and a 98% mean increase in self-rated mood. This reflected a mean score increase of 3.8 in both. Minutes of physical activity per week increased for all session participants, although remained below national guidance. Weight reduction did not occur. Conclusion Exercise benefits not only physical health, but also emotional and psychological well-being. This project demonstrates how introduction of a weekly ward-based exercise class can offer this as well as improving working environment, team cohesion and therapeutic relationships. Weight reduction may be observed in the longer term.","output":"Let's get moving!

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Keywords were searched in PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus and Institute for Scientific Information Web of Science, as well as the search engine of Google Scholar. Keywords included PCR, LAMP, RAA, RPA, Virus and COVID-19. RESULTS: LAMP technology has been extensively applied for the detection of human pathogenic bacteria, crop pests, pathogenic organisms and components in meat products. A new isotheral method, Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), can amplify the DNA as well as RPA. RPA involves benefits of isothermal PCR as well as simplicity and rapid amplification. Recombinase aided amplification (RAA) assay has been favorably used in the detection of bacterial and viral pathogens and solved the technical difficulties posed by DNA amplification methods because it does not need thermal denaturation of the template and involves a low and constant temperature. CONCLUSION: Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, digital PCR, LAMP, nicking endonuclease amplification reaction, recombinase polymerase amplification, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats are different nucleic acid amplification tests of COVID-19. LAMP methods can be more specific than qPCR and immunoassays. The LAMP assay can be applied for rapid detection of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and influenza, because LAMP is a highly sensitive and specific DNA/RNA amplification technique.","output":"Different Methods for Molecular and Rapid Detection of Human Novel Coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) displays a particularly poor prognosis and low survival rate, mainly due to late diagnosis and high incidence of chemotherapy resistance.

This endows them with malignant attributes that enable them to not only overcome chemotherapeutic challenges, but to also attain diverse oncogenic properties. In fact, certain genetic amplifications elicit a rewiring of calcium signaling, which can confer ER stress resistance to tumors while also aberrantly activating known drivers of oncogenic programs such as NFAT. While calcium is a well-known second messenger, the transcriptional programs driven by aberrant calcium signaling remain largely undescribed in pancreatic cancer. In this review, we focus on calcium-dependent signaling and its role in epigenetic programs and transcriptional regulation.

First, all recommendations from public health authorities regarding COVID-19 containment must continue to be followed to minimize disease spread, ensure patient safety, and protect health care personnel. Second, patients awaiting elective cardiac surgery need to be proactively managed, reprioritizing those with high-risk anatomy or whose clinical status is deteriorating.

In relation to the reference standard, which was established as the result obtained by two of the three studied methods, the positive percent agreement (PPA) was highest for cobas(R) test (100%), followed by Amplidiag(R) test and the LDT (98.9%). The negative percent agreement (NPA) was lowest for cobas(R) test (89.4%), followed by Amplidiag(R) test (98.8%) and the highest value was obtained for LDT (100%). The dilution series conducted for specimens, however, suggests significantly higher sensitivity for the cobas(R) assay in comparison with the other two assays and the low NPA value may be due to the same reason. In general, all tested assays performed adequately. Both the time from sample to result and hands-on time per sample were shortest for cobas(R) test.

Due to global limitations in testing capacity, effective prioritization of individuals for testing is essential. Methods We devised a model estimating the probability of an individual to test positive for COVID-19 based on answers to 9 simple questions that have been associated with COVID-19 infection. Our model was devised from a subsample of a national symptom survey that was answered over 2 million times in Israel in its first 2 months and a targeted survey distributed to all residents of several cities in Israel. Overall, 43,752 adults were included, from which 498 self-reported as being COVID-19 positive. Findings Our model was validated on a held-out set of individuals from Israel where it achieved an auROC of 0.737 (CI: 0.712-0.759), auPR of 0.144 (CI: 0.119-0.177) and demonstrated its applicability outside of Israel in an independently-collected symptom survey dataset from the U.S., U.K. and Sweden. Our analyses revealed interactions between several symptoms and age, suggesting variation in the clinical manifestation of the disease in different age groups. Conclusions our tool can be used online and without exposure to suspected patients, thus suggesting worldwide utility in combating COVID-19 by better directing the limited testing resources through prioritization of individuals for testing, thereby increasing the rate at which positive individuals can be identified.

Numerous clinical studies have examined the direct causes of TB-related mortality, but its wider, systemic drivers are less well understood. Applying systems thinking, we aimed to identify factors underlying TB mortality in South Africa and describe their relationships. At a meeting organised by the Optimising TB Treatment Outcomes task team of the National TB Think Tank, we drew on the wide expertise of attendees to identify factors underlying TB mortality in South Africa. We generated a causal loop diagram to illustrate how these factors relate to each other. RESULTS: Meeting attendees identified nine key variables: three drivers (adequacy & availability of tools, implementation of guidelines, and the burden of bureaucracy); three links (integration of health services, integration of data systems, and utilisation of prevention strategies); and three outcomes (accessibility of services, patient empowerment, and socio-economic status). Through the development and refinement of the causal loop diagram, additional explanatory and linking variables were added and three important reinforcing loops identified. Loop 1, Leadership and management for outcomes illustrated that poor leadership led to increased bureaucracy and reduced the accessibility of TB services, which increased TB-related mortality and reinforced poor leadership through patient empowerment. Loop 2, Prevention and structural determinants describes the complex reinforcing loop between socio-economic status, patient empowerment, the poor uptake of TB and HIV prevention strategies and increasing TB mortality. Loop 3, System capacity describes how fragmented leadership and limited resources compromise the workforce and the performance and accessibility of TB services, and how this negatively affects the demand for higher levels of stewardship. CONCLUSIONS: Strengthening leadership, reducing bureaucracy, improving integration across all levels of the system, increasing health care worker support, and using windows of opportunity to target points of leverage within the South African health system are needed to both strengthen the system and reduce TB mortality.

Little is known about the subsequent behaviors of such patients in terms of managing cancer risks and informing relatives. METHODS All adult patients who were counseled and tested at the Stanford Cancer Genetics Clinic from January 2013 to July 2015 and had a pathogenic variant in a non-BRCA1/2, non-Lynch syndrome gene were invited to participate in a telephone interview about adherence to risk-reducing recommendations, genetic testing by relatives, and new cancer incidence. RESULTS Fifty-seven (40%) of 142 eligible patients were successfully contacted, and all 57 patients participated; median follow-up was 677 days (range, 247 to 1,401 days). Most patients (82%; 95% CI, 70% to 90%) recalled that a risk-reducing intervention (screening, medication, or surgery) was recommended, and most patients (85%; 95% CI, 72% to 93%) adhered to the recommendation. Nearly all patients (91%; 95% CI, 81% to 97%) shared results with relatives, and most patients (78%; 95% CI, 64% to 88%) reported that a relative was subsequently tested. During the follow-up period, 9% of patients (95% CI, 3% to 19%) developed second cancers, and in 14% of patients (95% CI, 7% to 26%), a first-degree relative developed cancer, some of which were detected by recommended screening. CONCLUSION Patients with a pathogenic variant in a less familiar cancer susceptibility gene report high adherence to risk-reducing interventions. Furthermore, in the 57 carriers and subsequently tested relatives with two years of follow-up, a total of three cancers (one in a proband and two in relatives) were detected through interventions recommended on the basis of the pathogenic variant.

Various processes, such as ventilation and filtration, have been shown to reduce the probability of disease spread by removing or deactivating exhaled aerosols that potentially contain infectious material. However, such qualitative recommendations fail to specify how much of these or other disinfection techniques are needed to achieve acceptable risk levels in a particular space. An additional complication is that application of these techniques inevitably increases energy costs, the magnitude of which can vary significantly based on local weather. Moreover, the operational flexibility available to the HVAC system may be inherently limited by equipment capacities and occupant comfort requirements. Given this knowledge gap, we propose a set of dynamical models that can be used to estimate airborne transmission risk and energy consumption for building HVAC systems, based on comfort preferences and weather conditions. By combining physics-based material balances with phenomenological models of the HVAC control system, it is possible to predict time-varying airflows and other HVAC variables, which are then used to calculate the key metrics. Through a variety of examples involving real and simulated commercial buildings, we show that our models can be used for monitoring purposes by applying them directly to transient building data as operated, or they may be embedded within a multi-objective optimization framework to evaluate the tradeoff between infection risk and energy consumption. By combining these applications, building managers can determine which spaces are in need of infection risk reduction and how to provide that reduction at the lowest energy cost. The key finding is that both the baseline infection risk and the most energy-efficient disinfection source can vary significantly from space to space and depend sensitively on the weather, thus underscoring the importance of the quantitative predictions provided by the models.","output":"Modeling and Multiobjective Optimization of Indoor Airborne Disease Transmission Risk and Associated Energy Consumption for Building HVAC Systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Telemedicine is the remote diagnosis and treatment of patients by means of telecommunications technology The advantages of telemedicine include reduced travel time/cost and enhanced access to healthcare The coronavirus pandemic in 2020 has necessitated the rapid implementation of remote consultations across all healthcare platforms, in most cases without any formal training We present an educational framework for conducting telephone consultations in secondary care to help fill this gap There are five key steps in a telephone consultation;patient introduction, information gathering, establishing a working diagnosis and plan for clinical care, planning the next step and closing the consultation By focusing on what each step entails, this paper aims to help those new to telemedicine techniques and those responsible for training them, to shorten the learning curve CPD/clinical relevance: This article aims to help clinicians become proficient and comfortable in conducting telephone consultations by providing a structure to the consultation which they can customize to their specific setting ? 2020 George Warman Publications All rights reserved","output":"How to conduct a telephone consultation;An informative guide"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, COVID-19, a severe respiratory illness caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China.

Between 1 March and 30 June 2020, 31 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19: 19 had positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in nasopharyngeal swabs; 1 had negative RT-PCR but typical COVID-19 signs on a CT scan; and 11 had positive SARS-CoV-2 serology. Fifteen were males, median (range) age was 31 (9C60) years, and 12 patients were living with a lung transplant. The majority of the patients had CF-related diabetes (n = 19, 61.3%), and a mild lung disease (n = 19, 65%, with percent-predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (ppFEV(1)) > 70). Three (10%) patients remained asymptomatic. For the 28 (90%) patients who displayed symptoms, most common symptoms at admission were fever (n = 22, 78.6%), fatigue (n = 14, 50%), and increased cough (n = 14, 50%). Nineteen were hospitalized (including 11 out of the 12 post-lung transplant patients), seven required oxygen therapy, and four (3 post-lung transplant patients) were admitted to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Ten developed complications (including acute respiratory distress syndrome in two post-lung transplant patients), but all recovered and were discharged home without noticeable short-term sequelae. Overall, French CF patients were rarely diagnosed with COVID-19. Further research should establish whether they were not infected or remained asymptomatic upon infection. In diagnosed cases, the short-term evolution was favorable with rare acute respiratory distress syndrome and no death. Post-lung transplant patients had more severe outcomes and should be monitored more closely.","output":"First Wave of COVID-19 in French Patients with Cystic Fibrosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has spread rapidly throughout the world since its discovery in 2019. Three vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna/NIAID/BARDA, and Johnson & Johnsons Janssen) have been developed for use in the U.S. to aid in the fight against this virus, but have been scrutinized intensely for their efficacy and safety. It is important to understand and interpret the adverse events or reactions (AERs) associated with these vaccines in an objective and analytical manner. The goal of this descriptive study was to provide a resource outlining AERs associated with the three available vaccines in Kansas. METHODS: Reports were obtained from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), representing AERs observed in Kansas from December 11, 2020 to May 13, 2021. All data were screened and coded, and descriptive statistics were used to describe AERs based on vaccine manufacturer, patient age and biological sex, and reported deaths. RESULTS: Only 0.00068% of COVID-19 vaccine doses given in Kansas were associated with an AER (1,445/2,120,350). There were 4,297 individual AERs reported, and the most common were fatigue/tiredness (266; 6.2%), tingling/itching (251; 5.9%), fever (226; 5.3%), hives (223; 5.2%), and muscle/joint pain (209; 4.9%). Only 0.002% of COVID-19 vaccine doses in Kansas were associated with a death (38/2,120,350). The majority of VAERS reports were by females (1,139; 78.8%) and those aged 30 to 39 years (297; 20.6%). CONCLUSIONS: No reported AERs were unexpected compared to national data, and no VAERs report provided a causal relationship between vaccine administration and death. Vaccines are, and will continue to be, essential tools to fight COVID-19 in the quest to reach herd immunity. Providing a resource of potential AERs could aid in individual decisions to receive a vaccine and may help in the control of COVID-19. Future studies may include describing reported AERs for children under age 12 as the vaccines become available for those age groups, as well as reporting AERs for those who have received the vaccine after our study time period.","output":"The COVID-19 Vaccines: A Description of Adverse Events of Reactions Reported in Kansas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Widespread, non-stop, and often sensational coverage of the coronavirus (COVID-19) has caught many governments flat-footed in efforts to protect the health and safety of their citizens In response to the current global health event, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic Mass gatherings present a historic challenge in protecting the health and safety of attendees The majority of the prominent mass gatherings are religious in nature Global sporting events, such as the Olympics and the World Cup, pose unique health risks to attendees and host nations Deferment or cancellation of such mass gatherings may exert an extraordinary economic loss to the host nation Universal adoption of best practices for infection control is the surest way for governments to prepare for mass gatherings In these uncertain times, it is up to intergovernmental organizations to be the voice of reason","output":"An Ounce of Prevention: Coronavirus (COVID-19) and Mass Gatherings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2019 a viral disease spread from Wuhan Hubei Province in China.

Objective Postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak is a known complication of intraoperative durotomy. Intraoperative placement of subfascial epidural drains following primary dural repair has been proposed as a potential management strategy to prevent formation of CSF cutaneous fistula and symptomatic pseudomeningocele. Here we describe our experience with subfascial drain after intentional durotomy. Methods Medical records of patients who underwent placement of subfascial epidural drains during spinal procedures with intentional intraoperative durotomies over a 4-year period at two institutions were retrospectively reviewed. Primary outcomes of interest were postoperative CSF cutaneous fistula or symptomatic pseudomeningocele formation. Results Twenty-five patients were included. Mean length of follow-up was 9.5 months. Twelve patients (48%) underwent simultaneous arthrodesis. The average duration of the drain was 5.3 days with average daily output of 126.5 mL. Subgroup analyses revealed that average drain duration for the arthrodesis group was 6.33 days, which is significantly greater than that of the nonfused group, which was 3.7 days (p = 0.016). Similarly, the average daily drain output for the arthrodesis subgroup at 153.1 mL was significantly higher than that of the nonfused subgroup (86.8 mL, p = 0.04). No patient developed postoperative CSF cutaneous fistula or symptomatic pseudomeningocele or had negative sequelae associated with overdrainage of CSF. One patient had a delayed wound infection. Conclusions The intraoperative placement of subfascial epidural drains was not associated with postoperative development of CSF cutaneous fistula, symptomatic pseudomeningocele, overdrainage, or subdural hematoma in the cases reviewed. Subfascial closed wound drain placement is a safe and efficacious management method after intentional spinal durotomies. It is particularly helpful in those who undergo simultaneous arthrodesis, as those patients have statistically higher daily drain output and longer drain durations.","output":"Postoperative Cerebrospinal Fluid Leak Rates with Subfascial Epidural Drain Placement after Intentional Durotomy in Spine Surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Innovation in cultivated meat development has been rapidly accelerating in recent years because it holds the potential to help attenuate issues facing production of dietary protein for a growing world population. There are technical obstacles still hindering large-scale commercialization of cultivated meat, of which many are related to the media that are used to culture the muscle, fat, and connective tissue cells. While animal cell culture media has been used and refined for roughly a century, it has not been specifically designed with the requirements of cultivated meat in mind. Perhaps the most common industrial use of animal cell culture is currently the production of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, which sell for orders of magnitude more than meat. Successful production of cultivated meat requires media that is food grade with minimal cost, can regulate large-scale cell proliferation and differentiation, has acceptable sensory qualities, and is animal ingredient-free. Much insight into strategies for achieving media formulations with these qualities can be obtained from knowledge of conventional culture media applications and from the metabolic pathways involved in myogenesis and protein synthesis. In addition, application of principles used to optimize media for large-scale microbial fermentation processes producing lower value commodity chemicals and food ingredients can also be instructive.

However, experimental studies regarding the roles of inflammation in the arrhythmogenesis of BrS and its underlying mechanism are still lacking. This study aimed to investigate the influence of inflammation on BrS-phenotype features using human-induced stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) from a BrS-patient carrying an SCN10A variant (c.3749G > A). After LPS treatment, the peak sodium current decreased significantly in SCN10A-hiPSC-CMs, but not in healthy donor-hiPSC-CMs. LPS also changed sodium channel gating kinetics, including activation, inactivation, and recovery from inactivation. NAC (N-acetyl-l-cysteine), a blocker of ROS (reactive oxygen species), failed to affect the sodium current, but prevented the LPS-induced reduction of sodium channel currents and changes in gating kinetics, suggesting a contribution of ROS to the LPS effects. Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), a main form of ROS in cells, mimicked the LPS effects on sodium channel currents and gating kinetics, implying that ROS might mediate LPS-effects on sodium channels. The effects of H(2)O(2) could be attenuated by a PKC blocker chelerythrine, indicating that PKC is a downstream factor of ROS. This study demonstrated that LPS can exacerbate the loss-of-function of sodium channels in BrS cells.

An overview is required of healthcare interventions improving and decreasing quality of life (QOL) for children with serious illness at the end of life. METHODS A systematic review was performed in five databases, January 2000 to July 2018 without language limit. Reviewers selected quantitative studies with a healthcare intervention, for example, medication or treatment, and QOL outcomes or QOL-related measures, for example, symptoms, for children aged 1-17 years with serious illness. One author assessed outcomes with the QualSyst and GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) Framework; two authors checked a 25% sample. QOL improvement or reduction was categorized. RESULTS Thirty-six studies met the eligibility criteria studying 20 unique interventions. Designs included 1 randomized controlled trial, 1 cross-sectional study, and 34 cohort studies. Patient-reported symptom monitoring increased QOL significantly in cancer patients in a randomized controlled trial. Dexmedetomidine, methadone, ventilation, pleurodesis, and palliative care were significantly associated with improved QOL, and chemotherapy, stem cell transplant, and hospitalization with reduced QOL, in cohort studies. CONCLUSIONS Use of patient-controlled symptom feedback, multidisciplinary palliative care teams with full-time practical support, inhalation therapy, and off-label sedative medication may improve QOL.

The fluoride removal properties of ettringite and metaettringite were first compared at pH 10, and metaettringite was found to be more effective. The dominant reaction mechanism for fluoride adsorption in metaettringite was found to be recrystallization of metaettringite by rehydration; this was accompanied by precipitation of calcium fluoride. The adsorption kinetics followed the pseudo-second order model. Metaettringite was also able to remove fluoride effectively in low pH environment (i.e., at pH 3.5). The influence of coexistence of sulfate ions in solution on the fluoride removal performance was investigated, and a small decrease in performance was noted. The residual fluoride concentrations obtained with higher doses of metaettringite were lower than those specified by the Japanese effluent standard (non-coastal areas: 8 mg-F/L; coastal areas: 15 mg-F/L). The fluoride removal capacity of metaettringite was compared with those of other solid materials. The observed maximum capacity was 174.7 mg-F/g-metaettringite. In the case of high fluoride concentration solution, the main removal mechanism will be changed to calcium fluoride precipitation.

Quality of Services is queried by most users by the fact of increased on users from time to time. Therefore, it is crucial to know the network performance contrary to the number of devices connected to the TM UniFi network. The main objective of this research is to analyze TM UniFi performance with the impact of multiple device connections or users' services. The study was conducted to analyze the QoS on its traffic, packets transfer, RTT, latency, and throughput. Wireshark simulation program has been used as a network traffic capture where PCAP files have been analyzed by using PCAP Analyzer for Splunk. Traffic filtering has been enabled to capture selected traffic to measure network performance. The result shows that better network performance can be achieved if a smaller number of devices are connected at the same time. The percentage of packet loss, RTT, latency is increased when more users connected at the same time. The throughput also shows a decrease for multidevice connections.

OBJECTIVE: To address this gap, we examine how e-visits have impacted clinical outcomes and health care quality, access, utilization, and costs. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review; MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science were searched from January 2000 through October 2020 for peer-reviewed studies that assessed e-visits' impacts on clinical and health care delivery outcomes. RESULTS: Out of 1859 papers, 19 met the inclusion criteria. E-visit usage was associated with improved or comparable clinical outcomes, especially for chronic disease management (eg, diabetes care, blood pressure management). The impact on quality of care varied across conditions. Quality of care was equivalent or better for chronic conditions, but variable quality was observed in infection management (eg, appropriate antibiotic prescribing). Similarly, the impact on health care utilization varied across conditions (eg, lower utilization for dermatology but mixed impact in primary care). Health care costs were lower for e-visits than those for in-person visits for a wide range of conditions (eg, dermatology and acute visits). No studies examined the impact of e-visits on health care access. It is difficult to draw firm conclusions about effectiveness or impact on care delivery from the studies that were included because many used observational designs. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the evidence suggests e-visits may provide clinical outcomes that are comparable to those provided by in-person care and reduce health care costs for certain health care conditions. At the same time, there is mixed evidence on health care quality, especially regarding infection management (eg, sinusitis, urinary tract infections, conjunctivitis). Further studies are needed to test implementation strategies that might improve delivery (eg, clinical decision support for antibiotic prescribing) and to assess which conditions can be managed via e-visits.","output":"Impact of Asynchronous Electronic Communication-Based Visits on Clinical Outcomes and Health Care Delivery: Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: This study aims to quantify the strength of patients heterogeneous preferences for various aspects of Artificial intelligence (AI) diagnosis versus clinicians under the epidemic of COVID-19 in china Moreover, to illustrate the different decision-making factors of the latent class of discrete choice experiment (DCE) and prospects for application of AI techniques in diagnosis treatment in the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 and future Methods: A DCE approach was used Attributes from different dimensions which have been hypothesized were diagnostic method;waiting periods;diagnosis time;the precision of diagnosis;Follow-up support service, and diagnostic expenses With data from the DCE component, a restricted latent class model was estimated with fixed size of each class to determine discrete classes of diagnosis preferences For statistical analysis, we construct generalized logit and mixed logit models with the 428 datasets Results: 55 74 per cent of the respondents are opted for AI diagnosis regardless of the description of the clinicians Logit models presented the evident patients' preference of 'AI+clinician' diagnosis method And clearly, the higher accuracy is, the more patients would prefer In addition, the most acceptable latent class model is consisting of three latent classes of respondents, defined by different preferences for the diagnosis cost, time, method, waiting time and accuracy Attributes with the most substantial effect on choices were the accuracy and payments, especially the preferences for diagnosis accuracy attribute, was constant across classes Except for class 1, in which people highlight the diagnosis methods All attributes had a significant effect on choices in the expected direction Conclusions: Considerable segments of respondents had fixed preferences for either diagnosis option Applying latent class analysis was essential in quantifying preferences for attributes of diagnosis choice Peoples preference to the Accuracy was palpable AI will have a potential market, however, accuracy and diagnosis expense are needed to be taken into consideration","output":"SP3 Should I Choose Artificial Intelligence or Clinicians' Diagnosis? a Discrete Choice Experiment of Patients' Preference UNDER COVID-19 Pandemic in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Livelihoods and microfinance programs for women often show reduced impacts after scale-up. Yet, program scale-up may reduce average per capita costs and maintain cost-effectiveness despite lower impact. This paper presents evidence on the association between program scale, costs, and cost-effectiveness by analyzing how the costs of a large-scale Self-Help Group (SHG) program in India changed from its inception in 2007 to its scale-up in 2019. We use expenditure data from program's audit statements of Jeevika - the Bihar Rural Livelihoods Promotion Society - and find that a 1% increase in program membership was associated with a 0.6% increase in annual program expenditures, indicating large economies of scale. Predicted costs from regressions suggest that the annual per capita program expenditures declined from $29 when the program covered 100,000 members to $5 when it reached 10 million members. Previous impact evaluations of Jeevika showed sizeable but smaller substitutions away from high-cost debt after scale-up than during the pilot, but we found that economies of scale led to similar cost-effectiveness ratios for this outcome. We also found that formation of higher-level federations is associated with lower marginal costs than setting up SHGs. However, previous evidence suggests that Jeevika did not generate average impacts on women's agency and asset ownership after scale-up. Building on a rich history of research on Jeevika, we argue that program implementers must identify key success factors in pilot programs to minimize tradeoffs between cost savings and potentially reduced impacts after scale-up. Further, we suggest investments in linking SHGs to federations to improve the cost-effectiveness of SHGs.","output":"Economies of scale of large-scale international development interventions: Evidence from self-help groups in India."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Congress of the European Society for Dermatology and Psychiatry (ESDaP), held in conjunction with the 2nd Brain Skin Colloquium conference, hosted over 60 speakers delivering 47 oral presentations, 41 poster presentations and 5 keynote talks via 2 simultaneous livestream platforms.

The antiparasitic medicine ivermectin, which has anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties, has been tested in numerous clinical trials with promising results. Methods: We assessed the efficacy of ivermectin treatment and/or prophylaxis among people with, or at high risk of covid-19 infection. We searched bibliographic databases up to February 2021 and two review authors sifted for studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Meta-analyses were conducted and certainty of the evidence was assessed using GRADE approach. Findings: Twenty-one RCTs involving 2741 participants met review inclusion. Meta-analysis of 13 trials found ivermectin reduced risk of death compared with no ivermectin (average Risk Ratio 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 0.72;n=1892;I 2 =57%;low to moderate-certainty evidence. Low-certainty evidence found ivermectin prophylaxis reduced covid-19 infection by an average 86% (95% CI 79% to 91%). Secondary outcomes provided very-low or low certainty evidence. Low certainty evidence suggests that that there may be no benefit with ivermectin for need for mechanical ventilation, whereas effect estimates for improvement and deterioration favoured ivermectin use. Severe adverse events were rare and evidence of no difference was assessed as low to very low-certainty. Evidence on other secondary outcomes was very low certainty. Interpretation Low to moderate-certainty evidence suggests reductions in covid-19 deaths and infections may be possible by using ivermectin. Employing ivermectin early on may reduce the number of people progressing to severe disease.

In order to improve accuracy and confidence in targeting tumors, many centers rely on fiducial implantation. We evaluated the migration of a novel fiducial marker specifically designed for lung tissue implanted via electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB). METHODS We retrospectively quantified the individual and group migrations of SuperLock nitinol coil fiducials for 15 patients receiving lung stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), in order to evaluate the reliability of using these fiducials as a target surrogate for cases where tumors cannot be clearly delineated on cone beam CTs (CBCTs). For each fraction, we compared the individual and group migrations of the fiducials between the planning CT and the acquired CBCT. The group migration was defined as the distance between the centroids of the fiducial group and GTV. RESULTS A total of 16 lung targets were included in our study for these 15 patients (one patient with two targets). Of 55 fiducials placed, we observed a 100% retention rate. The mean individual migration was 1.87 mm (range, 0.63-5.25 mm) with a standard deviation of 1.26 mm. The mean group migration was 1.94 mm (range, 0.03-6.19 mm) with a standard deviation of 1.45 mm. Overall, there was minimal change in the relative locations of the markers with respect to each other, as well as to the target. CONCLUSIONS We found that the SuperLock nitinol coil fiducial marker positions are stable throughout the radiation treatment, and can be used as a reliable surrogate to target, and to avoid geometric misses during gated treatments.","output":"Minimal Inter-Fractional Fiducial Migration during Image-Guided Lung Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy Using SuperLock Nitinol Coil Fiducial Markers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since March 2020, many countries around the world have been experiencing a large outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

The knowledge of clinically relevant markers distribution might become a useful tool in COVID-19 therapy using personalized approach in the lack of unified recommendations for COVID-19 patients management during pandemic. We aimed to identify the frequencies and distribution patterns of rs11385942 and rs657152 polymorphic markers, associated with severe COVID-19, among populations of the world, as well at the national level within Russia. The study was also dedicated to reveal whether population frequencies of both polymorphic markers are associated with COVID-19 cases, recovery and death rates. Methods. We genotyped 1883 samples from 91 ethnic populations from Russia and neighboring countries by rs11385942 and rs657152 markers. Local populations which were geographically close and genetically similar were pooled into 28 larger groups. In the similar way we compiled a dataset on the other regions of the globe using genotypes extracted or imputed from the available datasets (32 populations worldwide). The differences in alleles frequencies between groups were estimated and the frequency distribution geographic maps have been constructed. We run the correlation analysis of both markers frequencies in various populations with the COVID-19 epidemiological data on the same populations. Findings. The cartographic analysis revealed that distribution of rs11385942 follows the West Eurasian pattern: it is frequent in Europeans, West Asians, and particularly in South Asians but rare or absent in all other parts of the globe. Notably, there is no abrupt changes in frequency across Eurasia but the clinal variation instead. The distribution of rs657152 is more homogeneous. Higher population frequencies of both risk alleles correlated positively with the death rate. For the rs11385942 we can state the tendency only (r=0.13, p=0.65), while for rs657152 the correlation was significantly high (r=0.59, p=0.02). These reasonable correlations were obtained on the Russian dataset, but not on the world dataset. Interpretation. Using epidemiological statistics on Russia and neighboring countries we revealed the evident correlation of the risk alleles frequencies with the death rate from COVID-19. The lack of such correlations at the world level should be attributed to the differences in the ways epidemiological data have been counted in different countries. So that, we believe that genetic differences between populations make small but real contribution into the heterogeneity of the pandemic worldwide.

This study aims to assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 on healthcare leaders (HeLs), along with the leadership skills and coping strategies needed for successful leadership. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Friuli-Venezia Giulia (Italy) between October and November 2020. We assessed the presence of depressive symptoms (DS), anxiety symptoms (AS), perceived stress (PS) and insomnia using internationally validated tools. Coping strategies and skills needed to overcome the crisis were examined, along with the most challenging phases. Results A total of 48 HeLs participated. The prevalence of DS and AS was 14.6% and 12.5%, respectively. Moderate and severe insomnia was found in 12.5% and 6.3% of them, respectively. Leaders showed moderate (45.8%) and high 4,2%) level of PS. The two most challenging phases were recognised in early recognition (45.2%) and peak phase (31.0%). Concerning healthcare leaders skills required to manage with pandemic, the most reported were communication (35.1%) and decision-making (25.5%).

We aimed to estimate the burden of COVID-19 using years of potential life lost (YPLL) and quality-adjusted years of life lost (QALYL). YPLL were calculated by multiplying the number of deaths due to COVID-19 in the analyzed age/sex group by the residual life expectancy for that group. Standard and country-specific (local) life tables were used to calculate SPYLL and LPYLL, respectively. QALYL were calculated adjusting LPYLL due to COVID-19 death by age/sex specific utility values. Deaths from COVID-19 in Poland in 2020 caused loss of 630,027 SPYLL, 436,361 LPYLL, and 270,572 QALYL. The loss was greater among men and rose with age reaching the maximum among men aged 65C69 and among women aged 70C74. Burden of COVID-19 in terms of YPLL is proportionate to external-cause deaths and was higher than the burden of disease in the respiratory system. Differential effects by sex and age indicate important heterogeneities in the mortality effects of COVID-19 and justifies policies based not only on age, but also on sex. Comparison with YPLL due to other diseases showed that mortality from COVID-19 represents a substantial burden on both society and on individuals in Poland.","output":"Burden of COVID-19 Mortality and Morbidity in Poland in 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objecive : This study aimed to evaluate whether Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can be detected in the tears in the eyes of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-2019) infected patients and compare the detection consistency of two simultaneously collected samples, from the tears and throat swabs. Methods : A total of 35 COVID-2019 patients were included in this cross-sectional case series study. Throat samples from all enrolled patients were collected with sampling swab, and simultaneously, tear samples were collected with sampling swab from 9 patients (No.1-9) and with Schirmer's strip from the remaining patients (No.10-35) (bilateral eyes for all patients). Sample collecting and testing were performed in three separate time points: first from patients No.1-9, second from patients No.10-29, and third from patients No. 30-35. Reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay was performed. Results : Among enrolled patients, 29 (No.1-29) had mild or moderate clinical symptoms and 6 (No.30-35) had severe symptoms. The mean time interval from the sample collection day to diagnosis confirmation day was 9.71  6.50 days (ranged from 3 to 29 days). None of the patients had conjunctivitis. Nineteen out of 35 (54.3%) throat samples presented positive Rt-PCR results. Three (no.13,21,31) out of 35 (8.6%) tear samples presented positive RT-PCR results. Two (no.21, 31) of these three patients were throat swab positive and one (No. 13) was negative. The consistency analysis indicated that tears and throat samples showed poor consistency (Kappa = -0.009, P = .9).The cycle threshold value (Ct-value) of tear samples collected by sampling swab was significantly higher than that by Schirmer's strip (t = 2.288, P = .03). Conclusion : In spite of the low SARS-CoV-2 positive detection rate of tear samples from COVID-2019 patients, we cannot fully rule out the transmission by ocular surface. Whether tear testing can be used as an aid in judging of SARS-CoV-2 infection need further investigation.","output":"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Simultaneously Collected Tear and Throat Swab Samples from the Patients with 2019- new SARS-CoV-2 Infection Disease: A Single Center Cross-sectional Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the face of the threats posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Solidarity has become the term of the hour. The World Health Organization organized a solidarity series of events, under the hashtag together at home, and chose the title Solidarity for the ambitious global initiative to find a treatment to the virus, establishing a Solidarity response fund. Within countries, solidarity was raised as a value requiring the imposition of various social distancing measures and limitations, needed, it was argued, in order to protect both society as a whole, as well as individuals who were especially vulnerable to the virus. The different approaches taken by countries in responding to the COVID-19 crisis can, in part, be explained by the different social perceptions regarding the importance of social solidarity and the duties that stem from it. The notion of solidarity, explored below, underlies the web of mutual commitments among members of a community, and, in the case of states, among members of the political community. This article examines the role solidarity can play when recognized as a constitutional value. Narratives of solidarity are prevalent in constitutions world-wide, both implicitly and explicitly. Despite this prevalence, constitutional scholarship has payed relatively little attention to the notion of solidarity. The article aims to take a step in filling this gap. It calls for recognition and discussion of the significance, potential and perils of recognizing solidarity as a constitutional value and of applying it in constitutional adjudication. The article argues that despite the liberal aversion of the notion of solidarity, which is understandable in light of potential abuses of the concept to justify limitations of individual freedom, solidarity is a precondition for the existence of just societies and for distributive justice, as well as for ensuring that human rights are equally and inclusively realized.The article argues that the relationship between collective identity and solidarity is complex, that solidarity is a multi-layered phenomenon, and that these complexities can and should be reflected in the constitutional manifestation of solidarity. Constitutions do and should refer to more than one layer of solidarity, and courts can and should play a part in instilling substance in these layers. Where solidarity is recognizing as a value, it can serve to examine the effect of laws and policies on under-privileged members of society, and as a source for deriving duties towards them. Finally, the article argues that although constitutional solidarity may intuitively be expected to endorse only intra-state solidarity, that is, solidarity among members of the political community, constitutions can and do endorse notions of transnational solidarity. The article argues that constitutionalism can thus be an important source of bottom-up transnational and global solidarity.","output":"Solidarity as a Constitutional Value"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Data about the effect of different immunosuppressive treatments of IBD patients on seroconversion and on different SARSCoV- 2 vaccinations are scarce. To avoid impaired vaccine responses and worse outcome of COVID-19, factors attenuating protective immunity shoud be shought. Methods: Anti SARS-CoV-2S antibody levels of IBD patients in remission were measured by immunoassay (Roche) before vaccination and on the second week. Antibody responses were compared among different treatment groups (biologics, combination, azathioprin, without immunomodulation) and between mRNA and other type of vaccines. Anti TNF alpha levels were also assesed, 24 hours before vaccination considering correlation with seroconversion. Results: Thirty-eight (31.7%) ulcerative colitis and eighty-two (68,2%) Crohn's disease patients were included (median age, 39.1 years, 53.3% female). No serious comorbidities were present. Eighty-two patients (68.3%) were on biological therapy, fifty-two (43%) were treated with azathioprine alone or in combination. Two doses of mRNA vaccines were administered to ninty-eight patients ((81,7%) Moderna:, 20, Pfizer:, 78). The other type of vaccines were AstraZeneca (16) Sputnik V (3) and Sinopharm (3). The median anti-SARS-CoV-2S antibody level was, 2733 U/mL (IQR:, 535-7764) on the, 14th day after vaccination (IQR:, 14-17). Significant differences were revealed between the groups of patients treated with biological agents or non-biological therapy (median:, 1649 U/ml vs., 5711.5 U/ml;p=0.013) and between patients recieving mRNA and non-mRNA vaccine (median:, 3367.5 U/ml vs., 392.6 U/ml;p<0.001). Considering the varying effect of immunosupression related to combination therapy, biological drugs, azathioprin and other non-immunomodulating treatments antibody response were assesed in these groups also. The median antibody levels were, 850,5 U/ ml (IQR:, 251.0-4899.5), 1837 U/ml (IQR:, 544.5-5902), 3141 U/ml (IQR:, 1066-7988), 7764 U/ml (IQR:, 5601-13808) demonstrating significant differences among them (p<0.001). No correlation between anti-TNF-alpha serum level and antibody response were found. Conclusion: Altough all vaccines cause seroconversion in IBD patients who are in remission, the rate of seroconversion is lower in patients treated with immunosupressant, biological agent or combo therapy or recieving non-mRNA vaccines. As the level of anti-TNF-alpha agents do not affect the rate of seroconversion there is probably no need for matching the time of vaccination and anti-TNF therapy.","output":"Seroconversion after COVID-19 vaccination in inflammatory bowel disease patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Bubble tea drinks contain tea and tapioca pearls. Chewing tapioca pearls in bubble tea drinks may increase salivary components. Because of its proteins, inorganic components, and enzymes, saliva plays an important role in the bodys defense against bacteria and viruses. This study aims to analyze the effect of chewing tapioca pearls in bubble tea drinks on salivary C-reactive protein (CRP) and calcium (Ca) levels. Methods: The inclusion criterion was 18C25 years of age. The exclusion criteria were receiving medication, using dentures, a history of dry mouth, smoking and systemic disease. In the first week of the experiment, subjects drank bubble tea with tapioca pearls for three days (intervention week). In the second week, the same subjects drank tea without pearls for three days (control week). Each subject drank the bubble tea for 5 minutes per day over 3 days. Saliva samples were collected on the first day before bubble tea consumption (pretest) and on the third day after tea consumption (posttest). Saliva collection was performed in the morning (09:00 amC12:00 pm) for 1 minute. Sixty saliva samples were collected from 15 subjects. Salivary CRP levels were measured using a commercial ELISA kit, and Ca levels were determined using semi-quantitative test strips. Results: Salivary CRP decreased significantly on the third day in the intervention group but showed no significant difference with the control group. Calcium levels increased significantly on the third day in both groups. Conclusion: Bubble tea drinks could improve the quality of saliva by decreasing salivary CRP and increasing Ca levels.

At the moment, the therapeutic strategies to deal with this disease are only supportive. It is well known that zinc (Zn) possesses a variety of direct and indirect antiviral properties, which are realized through different mechanisms. Administration of Zn supplement has a potential to enhance antiviral immunity, both innate and humoral, and to restore depleted immune cell function or to improve normal immune cell function, in particular in immunocompromised or elderly patients. Zn may also act in a synergistic manner when co-administered with the standard antiviral therapy, as was demonstrated in patients with hepatitis C, HIV, and SARS-CoV-1. Effectiveness of Zn against a number of viral species is mainly realized through the physical processes, such as virus attachment, infection, and uncoating. Zn may also protect or stabilize the cell membrane which could contribute to blocking of the virus entry into the cell. On the other hand, it was demonstrated that Zn may inhibit viral replication by alteration of the proteolytic processing of replicase polyproteins and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) in rhinoviruses, HCV, and influenza virus, and diminish the RNA-synthesizing activity of nidoviruses, for which SARS-CoV-2 belongs. Therefore, it may be hypothesized that Zn supplementation may be of potential benefit for prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19.","output":"Potential role of zinc supplementation in prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Climate and air quality change due to COVID 19 lockdown (LCD) are extremely concerned subjects of several research recently. The contribution of meteorological factors and emission reduction to air pollution change over the north of Morocco has been investigated in this study using the framework generalized additive models (GAM), that have been proved to be a robust technique for the environmental data sets, focusing on main atmospheric pollutants in the region including ozone (O 3 ), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), particulate matter (PM 2.5 and PM 10 ), secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA), nom-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) and carbon monoxide (CO) from the regional air pollution dataset of the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS). Our results indicate that secondary air pollutants (PM 2.5 , PM 10 and O 3 ) are more influenced by metrological factors and the other air pollutants reported by this study in comparison with primary air pollutants (NO 2 and SO 2) . We found that meteorological factors contribute to O 3 , PM 2.5 , PM 10 and SIA average mass concentration by 22%, 5%, 3% and 34% before LCD and by 28%, 19%, 5% and 42% during LCD respectively. The increase in meteorological factors effect during LCD shows the contribution of photochemical oxidation to air pollution due to increase in atmospheric oxidant (O 3 and OH radical) during LCD, which can explain the response of PM to emission reduction. Our study indicates that PM (PM 2.5 , PM 10 ) has more controlled by SO 2 due to the formation of sulfate particles especially under high oxidants level. The positive correlation between westward wind at 10m (WW10M), Northward Wind at 10m (NW10M) and PM indicates the implication of sea salt particles transported from Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean.

However, the use of bee venom has shown adverse effects. Therefore, there is a need for research that can remove the cytotoxicity of bee venom and enhance its efficacy. In this study, we hydrolyzed melittin, the main component of bee venom, and removed the other components to eliminate the toxicity of bee venom. To compare the efficacy of bee venom and detoxified bee venom, we examined their antioxidant effects using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay. In addition, cytotoxicity was confirmed in MCF 10A and RAW 264.7 cells, using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS) assay. Detoxified bee venom showed a strong antioxidant activity and decreased a cytotoxicity in MCF 10A and RAW 264.7 cells. The anti-inflammatory activity of detoxified bee venom and bee venom were assessed by comparison of the expression of inflammatory cytokine mRNA and phosphorylation of IB in RAW 264.7 cells. Degranulation in RBL-2H3 cells was analyzed through -hexosaminidase release assay to confirm the allergenic activity of bee venom and detoxified bee venom. Treatment of the detoxified bee venom inhibited inflammatory cytokine mRNA expression, IB phosphorylation, and -hexosaminidase release. Taken together, the results indicated that compared to bee venom, detoxified bee venom exhibited decreased cytotoxicity and allergenicity and increased anti-inflammatory activity. In conclusion, detoxification of bee venom efficiently decreases the adverse effects, making it suitable for medicinal applications.

Phase I screening (August 2020) covered a total of 1305 individuals screened at major markets/lorry stations, major shopping malls, hospitals and research institutions involved in COVID-19 work. The screening was performed using a strip-in-cassette lateral flow type Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) kit that simultaneously and separately detected IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. In Phase I, 252/1305 (19%) tested positive for IgM or IgG or both. Exposure rate was significantly higher among individuals tested at markets/lorry stations (26.9%) compared to those at Shopping Malls (9.4%). The 41--60-years age group had the highest exposure rate (27.2%). People with only a basic level or no formal education had a higher exposure rate (26.2%) than those with tertiary level education (13.1%); and higher in informally employed workers (24.0%) than those in the formal sector (15.0%). Phases II and III screening activities in October and December 2020, respectively, showed no evidence of increased seroprevalence, indicating either a reduced transmission rate or loss of antibody expression in a subset of the participants. The Upper East region has the lowest exposure rate, with only 4 of 200 participants (2%) seropositivity. Phase IV screening in February 2021 showed that exposure rates in the upper income earners (26.2%) had almost doubled since August 2020, reflective of Ghana's second wave of symptomatic COVID-19 cases, which began in December 2020. The Phase IV results suggest that seroprevalence levels have become so high that the initial socioeconomic stratification of exposure has been lost. Overall, the data indicates a much higher COVID-19 seroprevalence in the Greater Accra Region than was officially acknowledged, likely implying a considerably lower case fatality rate than the current national figure of 0.84%. Additionally, the high exposure levels seen in the communities suggest that COVID-19 in Ghana still predominantly presents with none-to-mild symptoms.

METHODS: A rapid scoping review was carried out by searching PubMed to know if children are more contagious than adults, and the proportion of asymptomatic cases in children. Google Scholar and MedRxiv/bioRxiv were also searched. The time period was restricted from 1 December 2019 until 28 May 2020. Only studies published in English, Italian, French or Spanish were included. RESULTS: Fourteen out of 1099 identified articles were finally included. Studies included cases from China (n=9 to 2143), China and Taiwan (n=536), Korea (n=1), Vietnam (n=1), Australia (n=9), Geneva (n=40), the Netherlands (n=116), Ireland (n=3) and Spain (population-based study of IgG, n=8243). Although no complete data were available, between 15% and 55%C60% were asymptomatic, and 75%C100% of cases were from family transmission. Studies analysing school transmission showed children as not a driver of transmission. Prevalence of COVID-19 IgG antibody in children <15 years was lower than the general population in the Spanish study. CONCLUSIONS: Children are not transmitters to a greater extent than adults.

This article uses an existing framework linking engagement in global health to foreign policy to explore differing levels of engagement by BRICS countries in the global health arena, with a particular focus on access to medicines. It concludes that countries' differing and complex motivations reinforce the need for realistic, pragmatic approaches to global health debates and their analysis.

Large increases occurred between 2016-2019, with significant increases predominately found among employed Australians. Patterns, and prevalence of workers' cocaine use were examined using the 2016 and 2019 National Drug Strategy Household Survey data via frequency analyses. Logistic regression modelling identified predictors of employed Australian's: cocaine use (2019); and increased use over time (2016-2019). Workers' cocaine use increased 63% between 2016-2019 (3.8%-6.2%). Predictors of use, and increased use, were age, marital status, state, remoteness, smoking status, alcohol use, and cocaine approval level. Income and psychological distress predicted cocaine use in 2019 only. Highest prevalence in 2019 occurred among workers who approved of regular cocaine use (47.9%), currently smoked (14.9%), were very highly distressed (14.0%), risky alcohol consumers (13.7%), and aged 18-24 years (13.9%). Numerous individual-level characteristics influence workers' cocaine use. Workplace cultural norms and substance use climates may facilitate increased cocaine use. The workplace is a powerful setting for cocaine prevention and intervention efforts. Potential strategies include targeting social norms, shifting positive drug use workplace cultures, and providing health and safety training focussing on the risk of use to self and co-workers whilst also examining demographic subgroups' motivations for use.","output":"Increasing cocaine use amongst employed Australians: who is most at-risk?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For three decades now, knowledge-based scoring functions that operate through the \\"potential of mean force\\" (PMF) approach have continuously proven useful for studying protein structures. Although these statistical potentials are not to be confused with their physics-based counterparts of the same name-i.e. PMFs obtained by molecular dynamics simulations-their particular success in assessing the native-like character of protein structure predictions has lead authors to consider the computed scores as approximations of the free energy. However, this physical justification is a matter of controversy since the beginning. Alternative interpretations based on Bayes' theorem have been proposed, but the misleading formalism that invokes the inverse Boltzmann law remains recurrent in the literature. In this article, we present a conceptually new method for ranking protein structure models by quality, which is (i) independent of any physics-based explanation and (ii) relevant to statistics and to a general definition of information gain. The theoretical development described in this study provides new insights into how statistical PMFs work, in comparison with our approach. To prove the concept, we have built interatomic distance-dependent scoring functions, based on the former and new equations, and compared their performance on an independent benchmark of 60,000 protein structures. The results demonstrate that our new formalism outperforms statistical PMFs in evaluating the quality of protein structural decoys. Therefore, this original type of score offers a possibility to improve the success of statistical PMFs in the various fields of structural biology where they are applied.

As of April 22, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to take its toll, with >2.6 million confirmed infections and >183,000 deaths. Dire projections are surfacing almost every day, and policymakers worldwide are using projections for critical decisions. Given this background, we modeled unobserved infections to examine the extent to which we might be grossly underestimating COVID-19 infections in North America. METHODS: We developed a machine-learning model to uncover hidden patterns based on reported cases and to predict potential infections. First, our model relied on dimensionality reduction to identify parameters that were key to uncovering hidden patterns. Next, our predictive analysis used an unbiased hierarchical Bayesian estimator approach to infer past infections from current fatalities. RESULTS: Our analysis indicates that, when we assumed a 13-day lag time from infection to death, the United States, as of April 22, 2020, likely had at least 1.3 million undetected infections. With a longer lag timefor example, 23 daysthere could have been at least 1.7 million undetected infections. Given these assumptions, the number of undetected infections in Canada could have ranged from 60,000 to 80,000. Duartes elegant unbiased estimator approach suggested that, as of April 22, 2020, the United States had up to >1.6 million undetected infections and Canada had at least 60,000 to 86,000 undetected infections. However, the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering data feed on April 22, 2020, reported only 840,476 and 41,650 confirmed cases for the United States and Canada, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified 2 key findings: (1) as of April 22, 2020, the United States may have had 1.5 to 2.029 times the number of reported infections and Canada may have had 1.44 to 2.06 times the number of reported infections and (2) even if we assume that the fatality and growth rates in the unobservable population (undetected infections) are similar to those in the observable population (confirmed infections), the number of undetected infections may be within ranges similar to those described above.

Directly after 11 autopsies of exhumed bodies, we used an NTD system based on a peroxone vapor to disinfect the air and surfaces. We measured microbial burden in the air and on surfaces before and after NTD. The NTD system reduced the mean bacterial burden in the air from 171 colony forming units (CFU)/m(3) to 3CFU/m(3). The mean fungal burden in the air decreased from 221 CFU/m(3) to 9CFU/m(3). The mean all-surface microbial burden was 79 CFU/100 cm(2) after all autopsies, and it decreased to 2 CFU/100 cm(2) after NTD.

Organ-to-organ transmission has not been ruled out, thereby raising the possibility of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on multiple organ systems. The male reproductive system has been hypothesized to be a potential target of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is supported by some preliminary evidence. This may pose a global threat to male fertility potential, as men are more prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection than women, especially those of reproductive age. Preliminary reports have also indicated the possibility of sexual transmission of SARS-CoV-2. It may cause severe complications in infected couples.

However, the mechanisms of myocardial injury remain unclear and prior studies have not reported cardiovascular imaging data. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to characterize the echocardiographic abnormalities associated with myocardial injury and their prognostic impact in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted an international, multicenter cohort study including 7 hospitals in New York City and Milan of hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who had undergone transthoracic echocardiographic (TTE) and electrocardiographic evaluation during their index hospitalization. Myocardial injury was defined as any elevation in cardiac troponin at the time of clinical presentation or during the hospitalization. RESULTS: A total of 305 patients were included. Mean age was 63 years and 205 patients (67.2%) were male. Overall, myocardial injury was observed in 190 patients (62.3%). Compared with patients without myocardial injury, those with myocardial injury had more electrocardiographic abnormalities, higher inflammatory biomarkers and an increased prevalence of major echocardiographic abnormalities that included left ventricular wall motion abnormalities, global left ventricular dysfunction, left ventricular diastolic dysfunction grade II or III, right ventricular dysfunction and pericardial effusions. Rates of in-hospital mortality were 5.2%, 18.6%, and 31.7% in patients without myocardial injury, with myocardial injury without TTE abnormalities, and with myocardial injury and TTE abnormalities. Following multivariable adjustment, myocardial injury with TTE abnormalities was associated with higher risk of death but not myocardial injury without TTE abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with COVID-19 who underwent TTE, cardiac structural abnormalities were present in nearly two-thirds of patients with myocardial injury.

Methods: Thirty-six non-COVID-19 and 27 COVID-19 non-immunocompromised patients with severe pneumonia were prospectively enrolled, most requiring intensive care. Clinical and biological characteristics (including plasma biomarkers of coagulopathy) were compared. Results: At similar baseline severity, COVID-19 patients required mechanical ventilation (MV) for significantly longer than non-COVID-19 patients (p = 0.0049) and more frequently developed venous thrombotic complications (p = 0.031).

Research exploring low-grade systemic inflammation and its impact on the development and progression of neurodegenerative disease has increased. A particular research focus has been whether systemic inflammation arises only as a secondary effect of disease, or it is also a cause of pathology. The inflammasomes, and more specifically the NLRP3 inflammasome, are crucial components of the innate immune system and are usually activated in response to infection or tissue damage. Although inflammasome activation plays critical roles against various pathogens in host defense, overactivation of inflammasome contributes to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, including acute central nervous system (CNS) injuries and chronic neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD. This review summarizes the current literature on the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathogenesis of AD, and its involvement in infections, particularly SARS-CoV-2.

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included adult patients with a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and hospitalised at the cantonal hospital Aarau (Switzerland) between 26 February 2020 and 30 April 2020. Our primary endpoint was severe COVID-19 progression defined as a composite of transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 99 patients (median age 67 years [interquartile range 56&ndash;76], 37% females) were included and 35% developed severe COVID-19 progression (24% needed ICU treatment, 19% died). Patients had a high burden of comorbidities with a median Charlson comorbidity index of 3 points and a high prevalence of hypertension (57%), chronic kidney disease (28%) and obesity (27%). Baseline characteristics with the highest prognostic value for the primary endpoint by means of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were male gender (0.63) and initial laboratory values including shock markers (lactate on ambient air 0.67; lactate with O2 supply 0.70), markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein 0.72, procalcitonin 0.80) and markers of compromised oxygenation (pO2 0.75 on ambient air), whereas age and comorbidities provided little prognostic information. CONCLUSION: This analysis provides insights into the first consecutively hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19 at a Swiss tertiary care hospital during the initial period of the pandemic. Markers of disease progression such as inflammatory markers, markers for shock and impaired respiratory function provided the most prognostic information regarding severe COVID-19 progression in our sample.","output":"Characteristics, predictors and outcomes among 99 patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in a tertiary care centre in Switzerland: an observational analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine enteric alphacoronavirus (PEAV) is a newly identified swine enteropathogenic coronavirus that causes watery diarrhea in newborn piglets. In this study, an original, highly virulent PEAV strain GDS04 was serially passaged in Vero cells. The virus titers and sizes of syncytia increased gradually with the cell passages. Newborn piglets were orally inoculated with PEAV P15, P67 and P100. Compared with P15 and P67, P100 resulted in only mild clinical signs and intestinal lesions in piglets. The virus shedding in feces and viral antigens in intestinal tract were markedly reduced in P100-inoculated piglets. Importantly, all P100-inoculated newborn piglets survived, indicating that P100 was an attenuated variant. Sequence analysis revealed that the virulent strain GDS04 had four, one, six and eleven amino acid differences in membrane, nucleocapsid, spike and ORF1ab proteins, respectively, from P100. Furthermore, more differences in the predicted three-dimensional structure of S protein between GDS04 and P100 were observed, indicating that these differences might be associated with the pathogenicity of PEAV.

Despite considerable diversity in the BabA sequence, it shows an extraordinary adaptation in attachment to mucosal layers. In the current study, multiple replica molecular dynamics simulations were conducted in a neutral aqueous solution to elucidate the conformational landscape of isoforms of BabA bound to Lewis b (Le(b)) hexasaccharide. In addition, we also investigated the underlying molecular mechanism of the BabA-glycan complexation using the MM/GBSA scheme. The conformational dynamics of Le(b) in the free and protein-bound states were also studied. The carbohydrate-binding site across the four isoforms was examined, and the conformational variability of several vital loops was observed. The cysteineCcysteine loops and the two diversity loops (DL1 and DL2) were identified to play an essential role in recognizing the glycan molecule. The flexible crown region of BabA was stabilized after association with Le(b). The outward movement of the DL2 loop vanished upon ligand binding for the Spanish specialist strain (S381). Our study revealed that the S831 strain shows a stronger affinity to Le(b) than other strains due to an increased favorable intermolecular electrostatic contribution. Furthermore, we showed that the 1-2-linked fucose contributed most to the binding by forming several hydrogen bonds with key amino acids. Finally, we studied the effect of the acidic environment on the BabA-glycan complexation via constant pH MD simulations, which showed a reduction in the binding free energy in the acidic environment.

The aim of this study was to investigate the roles of human herpes viruses (HHVs) and other respiratory viruses in CAP not caused by typical bacterial infection and to determine their prevalence and clinical significance. METHODS: Induced sputum (IS) samples were collected from 354 hospitalised patients (infants, n = 205; children, n = 149) with respiratory illness (CAP or non-CAP) admitted to Wenling Hospital of China. We tested for HHVs and respiratory viruses using PCR-based assays. The epidemiological profiles were also analysed. RESULTS: High rate of virus detection (more than 98%) and co-infection (more than 80%) were found among IS samples from 354 hospitalised infants and children with respiratory illness in this study. Of 273 CAP samples tested, CMV (91.6%), HHV-6 (50.9%), RSV (37.4%), EBV (35.5%), HBoV (28.2%), HHV-7 (18.3%) and rhinovirus (17.2%) were the most commonly detected viruses. Of 81 non- CAP samples tested, CMV (63%), RSV (49.4%), HHV-6 (42%), EBV (24.7%), HHV-7 (13.6%) and HBoV (8.6%) were the dominant viruses detected. The prevalence of several viral agents (rhinovirus, bocavirus, adenovirus and CMV) among IS samples of CAP were significantly higher than that of non-CAP control group. We also found the prevalence of RSV coinfection with HHVs was also higher among CAP group than that of non-CAP control. CONCLUSIONS: With sensitive molecular detection techniques and IS samples, high rates of viral identification were achieved in infants and young children with respiratory illness in a rural area of China.

Previous research has demonstrated that the opportunity for cross-species transmission and parasite adaptation can play an important role in determining if and when a host shift occurs. Another possibility is that the genetic basis of infection and resistance, when coupled with the process of coevolution (i.e., coevolutionary genetics), plays a pivotal role in determining when, if ever, a host shift occurs. Here we explore this possibility by developing and analyzing a genetically explicit epidemiological model that allows for coevolution and alternative forms of infection genetics. Approximate analytical solutions to this model demonstrate that infection genetics can influence the likelihood of a host shift. Stochastic simulations confirm the important role of infection genetics but in some cases reveal that coevolutionary dynamics modulate the likelihood of host shifts. Our results demonstrate that predicting host shifts requires a detailed understanding of the underlying genetics of infection and resistance.

Of note, routine nasolaryngoscopy did not lead to a statistically significant increase in aerosols. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the PNLH is a safe and effective form of protection that can be used in clinical practice to help mitigate the generation of aerosols during nasolaryngoscopy. While nasolaryngoscopy itself was not shown to produce significant aerosols, the PNLH managed to lessen the aerosol burden during sneezing episodes associated with nasolaryngoscopy.","output":"Evaluating a Prototype Nasolaryngoscopy Hood During Aerosol-Generating Procedures in Otolaryngology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fungi, particularly yeasts, are known essential components of the host microbiota but their functional relevance in development of immunity and physiological processes of fish remains to be elucidated. In this study, we used a transcriptomic approach and a germ-free (GF) fish model to determine the response of newly hatched zebrafish larvae after 24 h exposure to Pseudozyma sp. when compared to conventionally-raised (CR) larvae. We observed 59 differentially expressed genes in Pseudozyma-exposed GF zebrafish larvae compared to their na?ve control siblings. Surprisingly, in CR larvae, there was not a clear transcriptome difference between Pseudozyma-exposed and control larvae. Differentially expressed genes in GF larvae were involved in host metabolic pathways, mainly peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, steroid hormone biosynthesis, drug metabolism and bile acid biosynthesis. We also observed a significant change in the transcript levels of immune-related genes, namely complement component 3a, galectin 2b, ubiquitin specific peptidase 21, and aquaporins. Nevertheless, we did not observe any significant response at the cellular level, since there were no differences between neutrophil migration or proliferation between control and yeast-exposed GF larvae. Our findings reveal that exposure to Pseudozyma sp. may affect metabolic pathways and immune-related processes in germ-free zebrafish, suggesting that commensal yeast likely play a significant part in the early development of fish larvae.","output":"Pseudozyma Priming Influences Expression of Genes Involved in Metabolic Pathways and Immunity in Zebrafish Larvae"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objetivos: Identi5car las consecuencias psicosociales de la pandemia y de5nir propuestas para sobrellevar los efectos negativos de la pandemia y el con5namiento en la salud mental.

In this study, we demonstrate an improved vortex-assisted salt-induced liquid-liquid microextraction (VA-SI-LLME) technique coupled with UHPLC-PDA and UHPLC-MS/MS for rapid determination of RDV in human plasma. This technique involves simple one-step protein precipitation with hydrochloric acid and subsequent extraction with acetonitrile for analysis. Under the optimal VA-SI-LLME conditions (500 L of acetonitrile with 2.5 g ammonium sulfate under 2 min vortex extraction), method validation results indicated an excellent correlation coefficient of 0.9969 for UHPLC-PDA (monitored at 254 nm) and 0.9990 for UHPLC-MS/MS (monitored at electrospray ionization with + ion mode transitions of m/z 603.1a??m/z 402.20 and m/z 603.1a?? m/z 199.90).

Stress has an important impact on dreams, and stress-induced sleep difficulties may also impact dream recall. The present study evaluated associations between sleep, stress and dream content on dream recall during the pandemic. METHODS: A sample of N=419 US adults completed online surveys about sleep and COVID-19 experiences. Participants were asked if they remember more, fewer or about the same amount of dreams as before the pandemic. They were also asked whether the pandemic was associated with more stress, a more regular schedule, improved sleep, worse sleep, more early insomnia, more middle-of-the-night insomnia, more sleepiness, and more naps. They also completed the Insomnia Severity Index, Fatigue Severity Scale, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Brief Index of Sleep Control, Assessment of Sleep Environment, GAD-7 anxiety scale, and PHQ9 depression scale. Multinomial logistic regressions examined correlates of increased or decreased recall (versus same), adjusted for age, sex, and race/ethnicity. RESULTS: Those who experienced greater schedule regularity were less likely to report decreased recall (RRR=0.50,p<0.0005), as were those who reported sleep improvement (RRR=0.48,p=0.006). Those whose sleep worsened were more likely to report both increased (RRR=1.64,p=0.003) and decreased (RRR=2.16,p<0.0005) recall. Those suffering maintenance insomnia were more likely to report both increased (RRR=1.70,p=0.001) and decreased (RRR=2.68,p<0.0005) recall, as did those who reported more daytime sleepiness (Increased RRR=1.57,p=0.006; Decreased RRR=1.94,p=0.001). Those whose dream content was more negative were more likely to report both increased (RRR=4.05,p<0.005) and decreased (RRR=3.35,p<0.0005) recall, as did those who reported less negative content (Increased RRR=4.20,p<0.0005; Decreased RRR=5.05,p<0.0005). Similarly, those who reported more positive dream content reported both increased (RRR=17.37,p<0.0005) and decreased (RRR=7.14,p=0.02) recall, as did those who reported less positive content (Increased RRR=4.49,p<0.0005; Decreased RRR=5.59,p<0.0005). Less recall was associated with greater insomnia severity (RRR=1.08,p=0.001), fatigue (RRR=1.04,p=0.001), sleepiness (RRR=1.09,p=0.01), COVID stress (RRR=1.67,p=0.03), anxiety (RRR=1.08,p=0.01), and depression (RRR=1.06,p=0.007), worse sleep environment (RRR=1.06,p=0.005), and less sleep control (RRR=0.56,p=0.001). CONCLUSION: The results of this survey suggest that a sudden decrease in dream recall in reaction to a new stress could be considered as a pejorative indicator regarding sleep quality and mental health.

Virions were isolated from the allantoic fluid of the coinfected eggs and putative hybrid RNAs were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using strain-specific oligonucleotides. PCR products, of the expected sizes, were obtained as predicted from potential recombination events between the nucleoprotein (N) gene and the 3-untranslated region of the two IBV genomes. Sequencing confirmed that they corresponded to hybrid RNAs. Virus produced as a result of the mixed infection was treated with an M41-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibody and passaged in Vero cells, in which IBV-Beaudette, but not IBV-M41, replicated. Hybrid RNA was still detectable after three serial passages. Since no IBV-M41 was detectable this confirmed that infectious recombinant genomes had been produced in the embryonated eggs. These findings not only support the circumstantial evidence, from sequencing studies of IBV field strains, that recombination occurs during replication of IBV and contributes to the diversity of IBV, but also show that coronavirus RNA recombination is not limited to mouse hepatitis virus.","output":"Experimental Evidence of Recombination in Coronavirus Infectious Bronchitis Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of determining the level of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) in the gingival fluid in patients with chronic generalized periodontitis (CGP) and exacerbation of inflammatory periodontal diseases in patients with cancer of the oral mucosa (OM). A clinical study was carried out with the participation of 60 patients with CGP (group 1) and 22 patients with cancer of OM (group 2) of the T1-2N0M0 stage, as well as 15 healthy individuals with no revealed periodontal pathology. CGP patients, depending on the depth of periodontal pockets (PC), were divided into two subgroups - with a mild degree (PC depth up to 3.5 mm) and an average degree (PC depth from 4 to 6 mm). Group 2 patients were also divided into two subgroups - with exacerbation of CGP (n=12) and patients with no complications (n=10). The content of HIF-1 in the gingival fluid was determined by enzyme immunoassay. The results of the study made it possible to establish that in patients of group 1, the concentration of HIF-1 in inflammatory exudate increased by 2.4 times (p<0.001) compared with the control group. The concentration of HIF-1 in the contents of periodontal pockets in patients with CGP depended on the severity of the disease: with mild CGP, it did not differ from the control group, and with moderate CGP it was 3.15 times higher (p<0.001). In patients with cancer of OM, the concentration of HIF-1 in the gingival fluid did not depend on the presence of inflammatory periodontal lesions and was determined by a multiple increase in the biomarker level (7.5 times) due to the development of a malignant process in the oral cavity. Therefore, monitoring the concentration of HIF-1 in the gingival fluid is informative in patients with CGP in assessing the severity of periodontal conditions, as well as in differential diagnosis with malignant formations of the oral cavity.","output":"[Hypoxia-dependent transcriptional control of activity of destructive inflammatory and malignant periodontium changes]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to estimate long-term impacts of health education interventions on cardiometabolic health disparities. METHODS The model simulates how health education implemented in the United States throughout 2019 to 2049 would lead to changes in adult BMI and consequent hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Health outcome changes by sex, racial/ethnic (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic), and weight status (normal: 18.5  BMI < 25; overweight: 25  BMI < 30; and obesity: 30  BMI) subpopulations were compared under a scenario with and one without health education. RESULTS By 2049, the intervention would reduce average BMI of women with obesity to 27.7 kg/m2 (CI: 27.4-27.9), which would be 2.9 kg/m2 lower than the expected average BMI without an intervention. Education campaigns would reduce type 2 diabetes prevalence, but it would remain highest among women with obesity at 27.7% (CI: 26.2%-29.2%). The intervention would reduce hypertension prevalence among White women by 4.7 percentage points to 38.0% (CI: 36.4%-39.7%). For Black women in the intervention, the 2049 hypertension prevalence would be 52.6% (CI: 50.7%-54.5%). Results for men and women were similar.

Online teaching typically involves large-groups and covers theoretical topics rather than practical skills. We investigated the effectiveness of a six-part online small-group tutorial series, teaching key practical skills to medical students in their first clinical year. METHODS: Tutors taught using Microsoft Teams, with a tutor:student ratio being between 1:3 to 1:5. Tutorial themes were: examinations (Cardiovascular & Respiratory, Abdominal), A-E assessment and imaging (Thorax imaging & Histology, AXR & CT). Tutees completed a post-tutorial feedback form; the primary outcome was confidence improvement on the subject content. Likert Scales were used to measure the primary aim, with 1 corresponding to the worst outcome, and 4 corresponding to the best outcome. RESULTS: 152 tutee feedback responses were analysed, a 60.0% response rate. Response numbers were lowest in the examinations tutorials. Mean tutee confidence improved markedly, from 1.954(SD 0.7918) to 3.414(SD 0.5572, p < 0.0001). This was highest in imaging tutorials (p < 0.05). Mean scores for effectiveness of delivery and effect of technical issues were 3.868(SD 0.3762) and 3.908(SD 0.3327) respectively. From tutors feedback, 100% preferred teaching small-group over large-group sessions. However, only 33.3% prefer to teach online over face-to-face. Mean student engagement was rated at 3.417(SD 0.5149). CONCLUSIONS: Small-group teaching improves students confidence in practical skills.

METHODS: During February 20 and April 20, 2020, patients who underwent orthopedic surgery and healthcare staff who were in contact with these patients were screened for COVID-19. To identify patients who were in the incubation period of COVID-19 during their hospital stay, all patients were tested again for COVID-19 4 weeks after discharge. RESULTS: Overall, 1244 patients underwent orthopedic surgery (1123 emergency and 121 elective) during the study period. Overall, 17 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 during hospital admission and seven after discharge. Among the total 24 patients with COVID-19, 15 were (62.5%) males with a mean (SD) age of 47.01.6 years old. Emergency surgeries were performed in 20 (83.3%) patients, and elective surgery was done in the remaining 4 patients which included one case of posterior spinal fusion, spondylolisthesis, acromioclavicular joint dislocation, and one case of leg necrosis. A considerable number of infections occurred in patients with intertrochanteric fractures (n=7, 29.2%), followed by pelvic fractures (n=2, 8.3%), humerus fractures (n=2, 8.3%), and tibial plateau fractures (n=2, 8.3%). Fever (n=11, 45.8%) and cough (n=10, 37.5%) were the most common symptoms among patients. Laboratory examinations showed leukopenia in 2 patients (8.3%) and lymphopenia in 4 (16.7%) patients. One patient with a history of cancer died 2 weeks after discharge due to myocardial infarction. Among hospital staff, 26 individuals contracted COVID-19 during the study period, which included 13 (50%) males. Physicians were the most commonly infected group (n = 11), followed by operation room technicians (n = 5), nurses (n = 4), and paramedics (n = 4). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who undergo surgical treatment for orthopedic problems, particularly lower limb fractures with limited ambulation, are at a higher risk of acquiring COVID-19 infections, although they may not be at higher risks for death compared to the general population. Orthopedic surgeons in particular and other hospital staff who are in close contact with these patients must be adequately trained and given appropriate personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 outbreak.","output":"COVID-19 among patients with orthopedic surgery: our experience from the Middle East"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Preprints allow researchers to make their findings available to the scientific community before they have undergone peer review.

The Se-NPs@starch were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping analysis, TEM, and FT-IR. Starch plays a crucial role in the stabilization and dispersion of Se NPs, as noticed from the TEM and EDS investigations. Furthermore, the atomic ratio of Se distribution over the starch surface is approximately 1.67%. The current study was conducted on four groups of adult male rats, and the oral daily treatments for 28 days were as follows: group I served as control, group II received Se-NPs@starch, group III was exposed to melamine, while group IV was treated with melamine and Se-NPs@starch. The results reveal a significant alteration in the histoarchitecture of both hepatic and renal tissues induced by melamine. Furthermore, elevated liver and kidney function markers, high malondialdehyde, and increased expression levels of apoptosis-related genes besides a reduction in GSH and expression levels of antioxidant genes were observed in the melamine-exposed group. Interestingly, the administration of the Se-NPs@starch resulted in remarkable protection of rats against melamine-induced toxicity through increasing the antioxidant capacity and inhibiting oxidative damage.

With a motivation to monitor airflow from building ventilation systems through commodity sensing devices, we present FlowSense, a machine learning-based algorithm to predict airflow rate from sensed audio data in indoor spaces. Our ML technique can predict the state of an air vent-whether it is on or off-as well as the rate of air flowing through active vents. By exploiting a low-pass filter to obtain low-frequency audio signals, we put together a privacy-preserving pipeline that leverages a silence detection algorithm to only sense for sounds of air from HVAC air vent when no human speech is detected. We also propose the Minimum Persistent Sensing (MPS) as a post-processing algorithm to reduce interference from ambient noise, including ongoing human conversation, office machines, and traffic noises. Together, these techniques ensure user privacy and improve the robustness of FlowSense. We validate our approach yielding over 90% accuracy in predicting vent status and 0.96 MSE in predicting airflow rate when the device is placed within 2.25 meters away from an air vent. Additionally, we demonstrate how our approach as a mobile audio-sensing platform is robust to smartphone models, distance, and orientation. Finally, we evaluate FlowSense privacy-preserving pipeline through a user study and a Google Speech Recognition service, confirming that the audio signals we used as input data are inaudible and inconstructible.","output":"FlowSense: Monitoring Airflow in Building Ventilation Systems Using Audio Sensing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, the world is going through a pandemic, COVID-19, that affects the four pillars of organizational sustainability At this point, institutions&rsquo;sustainability depends on how they handle crisis communication It seems that institutions that can adapt themselves to changes regarding the usage of digital communication platforms are survivors, and even winners, of this crisis The general belief concerning education in developing countries claims that these countries are slow in adapting to technological innovations Being a developing country, North Cyprus has a multi-cultural environment due to the presence of international students in tertiary education This study explores how two public and two private universities maintained sustainability in higher education during COVID-19 by discussing the public relations models (PR) that they have used regarding digital communication This study uses a qualitative content analysis and a quantitative method The paper asserts that the effective usage of digital communication contributes to the sustainability of universities during this crisis The findings revealed that the posts (text/image/poster) and videos these universities share are more concentrated on either press agentry or the public information model Yet, a two-way symmetrical model that maintains dialogue within stakeholders is practiced less than the other PR models Hence, there is a need for the universities to listen to their stakeholders not only in face to face communication but more through digital communication platforms as well","output":"The Impact of Digital Communication and PR Models on the Sustainability of Higher Education during Crises"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) are the focus of increasing interest for human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) prevention and treatment. Although several bNAbs are already under clinical evaluation, the development of antibodies with even greater potency and breadth remains a priority. Recently, we reported a novel strategy for improving bNAbs against the CD4-binding site (CD4bs) of gp120 by engraftment of the elongated framework region 3 (FR3) from VRC03, which confers the ability to establish quaternary interactions with a second gp120 protomer. Here, we applied this strategy to a new series of anti-CD4bs bNAbs (N49 lineage) that already possess high potency and breadth. The resultant chimeric antibodies bind the HIV-1 envelope (Env) trimer with a higher affinity than their parental forms. Likewise, their neutralizing capacity against a global panel of HIV-1 Envs is also increased. The introduction of additional modifications further improved the neutralization potency. We also tried engrafting the elongated CDR1 of the heavy chain (CDRH1) from bNAb 1-18, another highly potent quaternary-binding antibody, onto several VRC01-class bNAbs, but none of them was improved. These findings point to the highly selective requirements for the establishment of quaternary contact with the HIV-1 Env trimer.

The authors hypothesized that the choice of neuromuscular blockade reversal (neostigmine vs. sugammadex) may be associated with a lower incidence of major pulmonary complications. METHODS Twelve U.S. Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group hospitals were included in a multicenter observational matched-cohort study of surgical cases between January 2014 and August 2018. Adult patients undergoing elective inpatient noncardiac surgical procedures with general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation receiving a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockade agent and reversal were included. Exact matching criteria included institution, sex, age, comorbidities, obesity, surgical procedure type, and neuromuscular blockade agent (rocuronium vs. vecuronium). Other preoperative and intraoperative factors were compared and adjusted in the case of residual imbalance. The composite primary outcome was major postoperative pulmonary complications, defined as pneumonia, respiratory failure, or other pulmonary complications (including pneumonitis; pulmonary congestion; iatrogenic pulmonary embolism, infarction, or pneumothorax). Secondary outcomes focused on the components of pneumonia and respiratory failure. RESULTS Of 30,026 patients receiving sugammadex, 22,856 were matched to 22,856 patients receiving neostigmine. Out of 45,712 patients studied, 1,892 (4.1%) were diagnosed with the composite primary outcome (3.5% sugammadex vs. 4.8% neostigmine). A total of 796 (1.7%) patients had pneumonia (1.3% vs. 2.2%), and 582 (1.3%) respiratory failure (0.8% vs. 1.7%). In multivariable analysis, sugammadex administration was associated with a 30% reduced risk of pulmonary complications (adjusted odds ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.77), 47% reduced risk of pneumonia (adjusted odds ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.62), and 55% reduced risk of respiratory failure (adjusted odds ratio, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.56), compared to neostigmine. CONCLUSIONS Among a generalizable cohort of adult patients undergoing inpatient surgery at U.S. hospitals, the use of sugammadex was associated with a clinically and statistically significant lower incidence of major pulmonary complications. : WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THIS TOPIC: Approximately 5% of patients experience a major pulmonary complication after noncardiac surgeryInadequate reversal of neuromuscular blockade increases the risk of pulmonary complicationsIn the United States, sugammadex is used with similar frequency as neostigmine at many hospitalsSugammadex provides more rapid and effective restoration of neuromuscular tone without systemic anticholinergic activity; however, neostigmine currently remains the mainstay of practice WHAT THIS ARTICLE TELLS US THAT IS NEW: In a multicenter observational matched cohort study of noncardiac surgery, sugammadex administration was associated with a 30% reduced risk of pulmonary complications, a 47% reduced risk of pneumonia, and a 55% reduced risk of respiratory failure compared to neostigmine.","output":"Sugammadex versus Neostigmine for Reversal of Neuromuscular Blockade and Postoperative Pulmonary Complications (STRONGER): A Multicenter Matched Cohort Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The small envelope (E) protein has recently been shown to play an essential role in the assembly of coronaviruses. Expression studies revealed that for formation of the viral envelope, actually only the E protein and the membrane (M) protein are required. Since little is known about this generally low-abundance virion component, we have characterized the E protein of mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59), an 83-residue polypeptide. Using an antiserum to the hydrophilic carboxy terminus of this otherwise hydrophobic protein, we found that the E protein was synthesized in infected cells with similar kinetics as the other viral structural proteins. The protein appeared to be quite stable both during infection and when expressed individually using a vaccinia virus expression system. Consistent with the lack of a predicted cleavage site, the protein was found to become integrated in membranes without involvement of a cleaved signal peptide, nor were any other modifications of the polypeptide observed. Immunofluorescence analysis of cells expressing the E protein demonstrated that the hydrophilic tail is exposed on the cytoplasmic side. Accordingly, this domain of the protein could not be detected on the outside of virions but appeared to be inside, where it was protected from proteolytic degradation. The results lead to a topological model in which the polypeptide is buried within the membrane, spanning the lipid bilayer once, possibly twice, and exposing only its carboxy-terminal domain. Finally, electron microscopic studies demonstrated that expression of the E protein in cells induced the formation of characteristic membrane structures also observed in MHV-A59-infected cells, apparently consisting of masses of tubular, smooth, convoluted membranes. As judged by their colabeling with antibodies to E and to Rab-1, a marker for the intermediate compartment and endoplasmic reticulum, the E protein accumulates in and induces curvature into these pre-Golgi membranes where coronaviruses have been shown earlier to assemble by budding.","output":"Characterization of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 small membrane protein E."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We conducted a retrospective cohort review of 180 patients aged 0C18 years with positive COVID-19 nasal PCR swab admitted to the only designated paediatric COVID-19 hospital in Abu Dhabi from 1 March to 1 June 2020. 60 (33%) patients were asymptomatic, 117 (65%) patients had mild or moderate symptoms and 3 patients required intensive care with no mortality reported.

In this review, we summarize the contemporary evidence of the etiology; diagnostic work-up, with particular emphasis on the contribution of multimodality imaging; therapeutic options; and short- and long-term outcomes of these patients. RECENT FINDINGS: In recent years, an important piece of information has contributed to put together several missing parts of the puzzle of pericardial effusion. The most recent 2015 guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology for the diagnosis and management of pericardial diseases are a valuable aid for a tailored approach to this condition. Actually, current guidelines suggest a 4-step treatment algorithm depending on the presence or absence of hemodynamic impairment; the elevation of inflammatory markers; the presence of a known or first-diagnosed underlying condition, possibly related to pericardial effusion; and finally the duration and size of the effusion. In contrast to earlier perceptions, based on the most recent evidence, it seems that in the subgroup of asymptomatic patients with large (> 2-cm end-diastolic diameter), chronic (> 3 months) C-reactive protein negative, idiopathic (without an apparent cause) pericardial effusion, a conservative approach is the most reasonable option.

RESULTS: The study included 689 patients (67.3  13.2 year-old, 69.4% males), of whom 43.6% were non-invasively ventilated and 15.8% invasively. 52 (7.5%) had PE over 15 (9C24) days of follow-up. Compared with those without PE, these subjects had younger age, higher BMI, less often heart failure and chronic kidney disease, more severe cardio-pulmonary involvement, and higher admission d-dimer [4344 (1099C15,118) vs. 818.5 (417C1460) ng/mL, p < 0.001]. They also received more frequently darunavir/ritonavir, tocilizumab and ventilation support.

We hypothesized that snakes can generate propulsion using a similar mechanism of posteriorly propagating vertical waves pressing against suitably oriented environmental asperities. Using an array of horizontally oriented cylinders, one of which was equipped with force sensors, and a motion capture system, we found snakes generated substantial propulsive force and propulsive impulse with minimal contribution from lateral undulation. Additional tests showed that snakes could propel themselves via vertical undulations from a single suitable contact point, and this mechanism was replicated in a robotic model. Vertical undulations can provide snakes a valuable locomotor tool for taking advantage of vertical asperities in a variety of habitats, potentially in combination with lateral undulation, to fully exploit the 3D structure of the habitat.","output":"Generation of propulsive force via vertical undulations in snakes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Experiencing a pandemic can be very unsettling and may have a negative impact on the mental health of frontline healthcare workers (HCWs). This may have serious consequences for the overall well-being of HCWs, which in turn may adversely affect patient safety and the productivity of the institution. AIMS: We designed a study to assess the prevalence of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), depression and work-related stress experienced by the National Health Service staff in a large tertiary London hospital treating patients with COVID-19 during the current active phase of the COVID-19 era. METHODS: An anonymous survey was designed with demographic data and three questionnaires. The Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 were used to assess anxiety and depression, respectively. The Health and Safety Executive Management Standards Indicator Tool was used to assess work-related stress. Staff from multiple specialties embracing cardiothoracic surgery, cardiology, respiratory medicine, endocrinology, oncology, imaging, anaesthesia and intensive care at our hospital were asked to complete the questionnaire between 25 May and 15 June 2020. RESULTS: A total of 302 staff members (106 males and 196 females) completed the survey. The overall prevalence of GAD and depression was 41.4% and 42.7%, respectively. The prevalence of GAD and depression was significantly higher in females than in males and was statistically significant. Nurses were four times more likely to report moderate to severe levels of anxiety and depression as compared with doctors. Work-related stress was also observed to be prevalent in our surveyed population with the following standards: relationships, role, control and change showing a need for improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Our study presents early evidence suggestive of a high prevalence of GAD, depression and work-related stress in HCWs. It is imperative that coherent strategies are implemented to improve the healthcare work environment during this pandemic and mitigate further injury to the mental health status of the healthcare population.","output":"NHS staff mental health status in the active phase of the COVID-19 era: a staff survey in a large London hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medical education, research, and health care practice continue to grow with minimal coproduction guidance.

Alcohol-related social media posts often glamorize heavy drinking, with increased exposure to such content associated with greater alcohol use. Comparatively less is known, however, about how social media promotes alcohol-related health behavior change. Greater scientific knowledge in this area may enhance our understanding of the relationship between social media and alcohol behaviors, helping to inform clinical and public health recommendations. We examined the relationship between exposure to peer alcohol-related social media posts (pro-drinking, negative consequences, and pro-treatment/recovery) and treatment-seeking intentions among heavy drinkers, as well as potential mediators of the relationship (e.g., attitudes toward treatment effectiveness). METHOD: Hazardous drinking adults (aged 18C55 years) who use social media (N = 499) completed an online questionnaire. Linear regression analysis examined the association between alcohol-related social media exposures and treatment-seeking intentions. Mediation was tested using structural equation modelling RESULTS: Exposure to peer pro-drinking posts was negatively associated with intentions to seek treatment ( = -0.67, p < 0.01), whereas exposures to peer alcohol-related negative consequences posts and peer posts about positive experiences with treatment/recovery were positively associated with treatment-seeking intentions ( = 0.69, p < 0.01;  = 1.23, p < 0.001, respectively). Mediation analysis concluded the effect of exposures on intentions was explained partially by attitudes toward treatment effectiveness (25.5%) and alcohol treatment stigma (6.1%). Conclusions: Findings suggest peers alcohol-related social media posts may both promote and hinder health behavior change depending on the nature of the post.

Early evidence indicated that the variant was more transmissible and less severe than previous variants. As the virus was expected to spread quickly through the population of England, it was important that some understanding of the immunological landscape of the country was developed. This paper attempts to estimate the number of people with good immunity to the Omicron variant, defined as either recent infection with two doses of vaccine, or two doses of vaccine with a recent booster dose. To achieve this, we use a process of iterative proportional fitting to estimate the cell values of a contingency table, using national immunisation records and real-time model infection estimates as marginal values. Our results indicate that, despite the increased risk of immune evasion with the Omicron variant, a high proportion of Englands population had good immunity to the virus, particularly in older age groups.

METHODS: Thirty patients with BVH and 30 age- and gender-matched healthy controls participated in a continuous 2-week assessment of daily activities and mobility using a body-worn inertial sensor and a 6-month prospective fall risk assessment. At inclusion, patients and controls further underwent a multi-modal clinical, score- and instrument-based assessment of general health and balance status. We analyzed the relationship between clinical, lab-, and sensor-based measures and their validity to identify those patients at a risk of general, frequent, and severe falling. RESULTS: Patients exhibited impairments in daily activity in particular in terms of reduced ambulatory activity (p = 0.009). 43% of patients experienced falls (13% in controls, p = 0.008) and 70% of these patients reported recurrent falling (0% in controls, p = 0.001) during prospective assessment. Severe fall-related injuries that would require medical attention neither occurred in patients nor in controls. Classificatory models based on multi-modal clinical, lab-, and sensor-based measures of balance and mobility identified patients who fell with an accuracy of 93% and patients who recurrently fell with an accuracy of 89%. CONCLUSION: BVH is linked to particular impairments of patients' daily activities which in turn are related to patients' fall risk. Hence, off-laboratory measures of daily mobility may supplement standard clinical assessment in BVH to more adequately capture the burden of disease and to reliably identify those patients at a specific risk of falling.","output":"Impact on daily mobility and risk of falling in bilateral vestibulopathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Three assays for SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection in nasopharyngeal swabs (Lumipulse?

The destructive, disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and unabated violence targeting individuals who are Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) exact an incalculable toll on BIPOC students and students from other groups that are historically underrepresented in medicine (UIM). Failing to recognize and act on the well-documented differential experience of BIPOC medical students impedes medical educators' ability to cultivate learning environments where all learners have an equitable opportunity to thrive. Holistic review admission processes, now widely accepted, have challenged admissions committees to consider the \\"whole applicant\\" to diversify matriculating classes. While gaining admission is critical, it is merely the first step for BIPOC students, who may face marginalization within what the authors have termed a \\"sink-or-swim\\" culture in medical education. For the tremendous potential afforded by holistic review to be realized, the medical education community must extend the holistic approach throughout the medical education continuum, beginning with student affairs practices and support. The authors propose the use of Integrated Holistic Student Affairs (IHSA), a systems-based model that fosters the re-examining and re-engineering of existing student affairs structures, policies, and processes to promote a personalized, equitable student-centered approach. The IHSA Model consists of 4 strategic actions-establish vertical and horizontal collaboration, conduct systems thinking analysis, target leverage points for change, and operationalize the change process-and 4 areas of priority for collaboration with student diversity affairs staff and faculty. The IHSA Model provides student affairs staff and faculty with a framework for shifting from reactive, deficit-oriented practices to proactive, empowering, equitable practices, with the goal of allowing BIPOC and all other UIM students to thrive during their journey from matriculation to graduation.","output":"Integrated Holistic Student Affairs: A Personalized, Equitable, Student-Centered Approach to Student Affairs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study explores the experiences of Punjabi (i.e., from the Punjab region in India) international undergraduate students (hereafter PS) attending Canadian higher education through a case study of a teaching university in British Columbia.

A total of 358 respondents answered the online questionnaire containing 69 question items, with the data analyzed using the structural equation modeling technique to examine the hypotheses. The results showed that the relationship between consumers' attitudes, perceived behavioral control, subjective norms, and information adoption had the highest and lowest effects on consumers' behavioral intention. Moreover, the consumers' attitudes had the most significant effect on their attitudinal intention to use digital signatures. The significant positive impact of these consumers' attitudes had relevant implications for the sustainable adoption of the signature system.

Dignity is not a useless concept because it is able to account for why we respect autonomy and for why it can be legitimate to override autonomy in times of critical care resource shortages. Dignity affirms the worth of the human individual as a meaning-making embodied subject, who is always in relationship to others, the world, time, and transcendence, and who realizes their dignity through their moral behaviour. Such an understanding means people should be helped to make morally right decisions about their own treatment, which may include forgoing potentially beneficial treatment for the good of others. Respect for dignity does not require fulfilling the morally wrong choices of one who insists on treatment at the expense of others. Dignity also protects the discretion of clinicians to make decisions appropriate to their competence by prohibiting the application of broad-based criteria such as age.","output":"Dignity, Autonomy, and Allocation of Scarce Medical Resources During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This report highlights details on a pregnant case of COVID-19 who unfortunately did not survive.

The research results show that (1) Usability and reading need are the key factors in e-book usage. Usability refers to convenient keyword searches, portability, and any time reading. E-books are considered to make searching and reading large amounts of data easier. (2) E-books are not restricted to time and space so that the overall reading quantity is increasing. Readers become accustomed to reading e-books, and the quality of their digital reading is gradually enhanced. (3) Students should complete e-book use courses offered by libraries to enhance their familiarity with e-books and their use of e-book software, thereby enhancing postgraduate student readers' e-book information literacy. The results of the research prompt suggestions to enhance the promotion of reading and e-book information to encourage student readers' e-book reading intention.","output":"Discussion of Students' E-book Reading Intention With the Integration of Theory of Planned Behavior and Technology Acceptance Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emergency departments (EDs) in the United States remain a frontline resource for pediatric health care emergencies during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, patterns of health-seeking behavior have changed during the pandemic (1,2).

Corneal endothelial transplantation has been described using two different techniques: Descemet's membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) and Descemet's stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK). Both are still performed worldwide. OBJECTIVES To compare the effectiveness and safety of Descemet's membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) versus Descemet's stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) for the treatment of corneal endothelial failure in people with Fuch's endothelial dystropy (FED) and pseudophakic bullous keratopathy (PBK). SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2017, Issue 7); MEDLINE Ovid; Embase Ovid; LILACS BIREME; the ISRCTN registry; ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). The date of the search was 11 August 2017. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised paired, contralateral-eye studies in any setting where DMEK was compared with DSAEK to treat people with corneal endothelial failure. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently screened the search results, assessed trial quality and extracted data using the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcome was best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) measured in logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution (logMAR). Secondary outcomes were endothelial cell count, graft rejection, primary graft failure and graft dislocation. We graded the risk of bias of non-randomised studies (NRSs) using ROBINS-I. MAIN RESULTS We did not identify any RCTs but found four non-randomised studies (NRSs) including 72 participants (144 eyes), who had received DSAEK in the first eye followed by DMEK in the fellow eye. All the studies included adult participants where there was evidence of FED and endothelial failure requiring a corneal transplant for the treatment of visual impairment. We did not find any studies that included PBK. The trials were published between 2011 and 2015, and we assessed them as high risk of bias due to potential unknown confounding factors since DSAEK preceded DMEK in all participants. Two studies reported results at 12 months, one at 6 months, and one between 6 and 24 months. At one year, using DMEK in cases of endothelial failure may result in better BCVA compared with DSAEK (mean difference (MD) -0.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.18 to -0.10 logMAR, 4 studies, 140 eyes, low-certainty evidence). None of the participants had severe visual loss (BCVA of 1.0 logMAR or more; very low-certainty evidence). Regarding endothelial cell count data (4 studies, 134 eyes) it is hard to draw any conclusions since two studies suggested no difference and the other two reported that DMEK provides a higher cell density at one year (very low-certainty evidence). No primary graft failure and only one graft rejection were recorded over four studies (144 eyes) (very low-certainty evidence). The most common complications reported were graft dislocations, which were recorded in one or two out of 100 participants with DSAEK but were more common using DMEK, although this difference could not be precisely estimated (risk ratio (RR) 5.40, 95% CI 1.51 to 19.3; 4 studies, 144 eyes, very low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS This review included studies conducted on people with corneal endothelium failure due to FED for whom both DMEK and DSAEK can be considered, and found low-certainty evidence that DMEK provides some advantage in terms of final BCVA, at the cost of more graft dislocations needing 're-bubbling' (very low-certainty of evidence).","output":"Descemet's membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) versus Descemet's stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) for corneal endothelial failure."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the onset of the COVID-19, online learning has taken centre stage across the world as authorities have been pushed to close educational institutes to contain and manage the pandemic. The effect of the abruptness of the switch to full-fledged online learning has been disruptive for educators and students alike. In particular, educators are torn between different goals such as effectiveness (i.e., trying to emulate in-person classes online and cover the same material), inclusiveness (i.e., no student is excluded from the learning process), and equity (i.e., trying to ensure that no students are left behind). Matters are made more serious by the fact that we are in the midst of the worst pandemic in the last 100 years with students locked inside their homes with their siblings and family members in stressful situations (which makes paying attention and engaging in learning very difficult).

TCS usually sinks in the activated sludge. However, the effects of TCS in activated sludge remain largely unknown. The changes in nitrogen cycles and the abundances of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) caused by TCS were investigated in this study. The addition of 1000 g/L TCS significantly inhibited nitrification since the ammonia conversion rate and the abundance of nitrification functional genes decreased by 12.14%. The other nitrogen cycle genes involved in nitrogen fixation and denitrification were also suppressed. The microbial community shifted towards tolerance and degradation of phenols. The addition of 100 g/L TCS remarkably increased the total abundance of ARGs and mobile genetic elements by 33.1%, and notably, the tetracycline and multidrug resistance genes increased by 54.75% and 103.42%, respectively. The co-occurrence network revealed that Flavobacterium might have played a key role in the spread of ARGs. The abundance of this genus increased 92-fold under the addition of 1000 g/L TCS, indicating that Flavobacterium is potent in the tolerance and degradation of TCS. This work would help to better understand the effects of TCS in activated sludge and provide comprehensive insight into TCS management during the pandemic era.","output":"Triclosan weakens the nitrification process of activated sludge and increases the risk of the spread of antibiotic resistance genes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The broad use of immunosuppressants and biologicals in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) patients increases the susceptibility to severe infections, and possibly COVID-19. Recently, in a Swedish population-based study it was suggested that IBD patients are at an increased risk of hospitalization for COVID-19, although course of COVID-19 did not differ from controls. Data on the outcome of COVID-19 in IBD patients from heavily affected regions remain, however, limited. South-Limburg has the second highest COVID-19 mortality rate in the Netherlands. We aimed to determine the incidence rate and outcome of severe COVID-19 in IBD patients in a population-based setting in South-Limburg. METHODS: We identified all IBD patients who presented at the emergency department (ED) of the only two hospitals covering the whole South-Limburg region with COVID-19 associated symptoms between February 27 and November 1, 2020. Confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis was defined by a combination of COVID-19 associated symptoms and either a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR or a CT-CORADS score 4. As primary outcome, the incidence rate of severe COVID-19 (i.e. confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis requiring hospitalization, and/or resulting in ICU admission or death) was determined. Baseline characteristics and data on COVID-19 course were collected. At present, the total IBD population in South-Limburg is set at 4980 patients. RESULTS: During a follow-up of 3384 person-years, a total of 61 IBD patients (1.22%) presented with COVID-19 associated symptoms at one of the two hospitals ED. Of these, 18 IBD patients (0.36%; 11 UC, 7 CD) fulfilled the criteria for severe COVID-19, corresponding to an incidence rate of 5.3 per 1000 person-years. Furthermore, 12/18 patients were using immunosuppressive medication for their IBD. Mean age at time of admission was 64.5 years (SD: 10.8) and 55.6% were male. All hospitalized patients had at least one comorbidity (with  1 comorbidity in 13/18 patients (72.2%)), cardiovascular disease being most prevalent (12/18). Mean BMI at time of admission was 27.3 (SD: 4.2). Thirteen patients (72.2%) required oxygen support and three patients (16.7%) ICU admission (of which two needed mechanical ventilation), translating to an incidence rate of 0.9 per 1000 patient-years for ICU admission. Median length of hospitalization was 11 days (IQR: 5.3C18.3). No IBD patients died due to severe COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The incidence rate of severe COVID-19 among IBD patients in a population-based setting in a heavily affected region was 5.3 per 1000 person-years. Despite frequent use of immunosuppressive medication and high region-specific mortality rates, clinical outcomes of severe COVID-19 were comparable to the general population and in line with recent literature.","output":"P637 Incidence rate and clinical outcome of severe COVID-19 in Inflammatory Bowel Disease patients in a population-based setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 disease affects the nervous system and led to an increase in neurological consults for patients at admission and through the period of hospitalization during the peak of the pandemic. METHODS: Patients with clinical and laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19 that required a neurologic consultation or those who presented with neurological problems on admission that led to a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection during a 2-month period at the peak of the pandemic were included in this study. Demographic and clinical variables were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were included. The presenting neurologic manifestations on admission led to the diagnosis of COVID-19 in 14 patients (40%). The most common reasons for consultation during the hospitalization period were stroke (11), encephalopathy (7), seizures (6), and neuropathies (5) followed by a miscellaneous of syncope (2), migraine (1), anosmia (1), critical illness myopathy (1), and exacerbation of residual dysarthria (1). The most common neurological disturbances were associated with severe disease except for neuropathies. Patients with encephalopathies and seizures had markedly increased D-dimer and ferritin values, even higher than stroke patients. RT-PCR was performed in 8 CSF samples and was negative in all of them. CONCLUSION: Neurological disturbances represent a significant and severe burden in COVID-19 patients, and they can be the presenting condition that leads to the diagnosis of the viral infection in a high percentage of patients.

The therapeutic use of botulinum toxin has generally been safe and well tolerated. Adverse effects are considered mild, transient, and self-limited. However, as with all other injectable procedures, this one is also susceptible to adverse events and complications. When the safety zones are respected, the chance of any of these complications is practically null. Thus, this review aims to describe the main complications of treatment with BoNT on the upper face and to present a practical guide based on current evidence on how to avoid them. METHODS: The literature research considered published journal articles (clinical trials or scientific reviews). Studies were identified by searching electronic databases (MEDLINE and PubMed) and reference lists of respective articles. RESULTS: The main complications secondary to BoNT injections on the upper face are: ptosis of eyelid or eyebrow, eyebrow asymmetry, diplopia, Lakeophthalmos, Palpebral ectropion, and prominence of the palpebral bags. To avoid such complications, it is necessary to have knowledge of the anatomy of this region and adequate and individualized planning based on the existing patterns of the frontalis muscle, glabella, and crow's feet. This review presents the specificities of each of these regions and practical suggestions to obtain satisfactory results, avoiding complications. CONCLUSION: Particularly on the upper face treatment with BoNT offers predictable results, has few adverse effects, and is associated with high patient satisfaction. However, it is suggested that the commented parameters and safety areas be incorporated into daily practice so that the possibilities of complications are minimized as much as possible.

Among them, leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors (LILRs) consist of activating and inhibitory receptors that play an important role in regulating immune responses modulating the course of disease progression. On the one hand, inhibitory LILRs constitute a safe-guard system that mitigates the inflammatory response, allowing a prompt return to immune homeostasis. On the other hand, because of their unique capacity to attenuate immune responses, pathogens use inhibitory LILRs to evade immune recognition, thus facilitating their persistence within the host. Conversely, the engagement of activating LILRs triggers immune responses and the production of inflammatory mediators to fight microbes. However, their heightened activation could lead to an exacerbated immune response and persistent inflammation with major consequences on disease outcome and autoimmune disorders. Here, we review the genetic organisation, structure and ligands of LILRs as well as their role in regulating the immune response and inflammation. We also discuss the LILR-based strategies that pathogens use to evade immune responses. A better understanding of the contribution of LILRs to hostCpathogen interactions is essential to define appropriate treatments to counteract the severity and/or persistence of pathogens in acute and chronic infectious diseases lacking efficient treatments.","output":"Leukocyte Immunoglobulin-Like Receptors in Regulating the Immune Response in Infectious Diseases: A Window of Opportunity to Pathogen Persistence and a Sound Target in Therapeutics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The number of skin infections caused by atypical mycobacteria has increased in recent decades.

Hospital-based care for COVID-19 is often needed, particularly among older adults. However, a key barrier to accessing hospital care in sub-Saharan Africa is travel time to the nearest health-care facility. To inform the geographical targeting of additional health-care resources, we aimed to estimate travel time at a 1 km  1 km resolution to the nearest hospital and to the nearest health-care facility of any type for adults aged 60 years and older in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods We assembled a dataset on the geolocation of health-care facilities, separately for hospitals and any type of health-care facility and including both private-sector and public-sector facilities, using data from the OpenStreetMap project and the Kenya Medical Research InstituteCWellcome Trust Programme. Population data at a 1 km  1 km resolution were obtained from WorldPop. We estimated travel time to the nearest health-care facility for each 1 km  1 km grid using a costCdistance algorithm. Findings 96% (95% CI 52C169) of adults aged 60 years or older across sub-Saharan Africa had an estimated travel time to the nearest hospital of 6 h or longer, varying from 00% (00C37) in Burundi and The Gambia to 409% (318C507) in Sudan. For the nearest health-care facility of any type (whether primary, secondary, or tertiary care), 159% (95% CI 101C244) of adults aged 60 years or older across sub-Saharan Africa had an estimated travel time of 2 h or longer, ranging from 04% (00C44) in Burundi to 594% (501C690) in Sudan. Most countries in sub-Saharan Africa contained populated areas in which adults aged 60 years and older had a travel time to the nearest hospital of 12 h or longer and to the nearest health-care facility of any type of 6 h or longer. The median travel time to the nearest hospital for the fifth of adults aged 60 years or older with the longest travel times was 348 min (IQR 240C576; equal to 58 h) for the entire population of sub-Saharan Africa, ranging from 41 min (34C54) in Burundi to 1655 min (1065C2440; equal to 276 h) in Gabon. Interpretation Our high-resolution maps of estimated travel times to both hospitals and health-care facilities of any type can be used by policy makers and non-governmental organisations to help target additional health-care resources, such as makeshift hospitals or transport programmes to existing health-care facilities, to older adults with the least physical access to care. In addition, this analysis shows the locations of population groups most likely to under-report COVID-19 symptoms because of low physical access to health-care facilities. Beyond the COVID-19 response, this study can inform the efforts of countries to improve physical access to care for conditions that are common among older adults in the region, such as chronic non-communicable diseases.

METHODS: Adult OHCA cases attended by St John WA Emergency Medical Service (EMS) between 16th March and 17th May 2020 (COVID-19 period) were compared with those for the same period in 2017-9. We calculated crude OHCA incidence for all OHCA cases and modelled the effect of the COVID-19 period on 30-day survival for OHCA cases with EMS attempted resuscitation; comparing our results with those published for Victoria (Australia), which had a higher incidence of COVID-19. RESULTS: In WA there was no significant difference between the 2020 COVID-19 period (n=423) and the same period in 2017-9 (n=501) in the OHCA incidence in adults (117.9 vs 126.1 per 100,000 person-years, p=0.23). In OHCA cases with EMS-resuscitation attempted, there was no change in bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation rates. Despite an increase in EMS response time, neither the crude nor risk-adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for 30-day survival in 2020 was significantly different to 2017-9 (11.7% vs 9.6%; p=0.45) (aOR=1.19, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.76-1.52, p=0.64).

This study aimed to explore the links between contextual variables related to the COVID-19 pandemic and disease and psychological outcomes. METHODS: The sample included 124 Portuguese patients with Crohns disease or ulcerative colitis (85.48% women) who completed self-reported measures in an online survey during April 2020. RESULTS: Fear of contracting COVID-19 and medication adherence were both high and unrelated. About half of the sample presented moderate (37.10%) to severe (14.50%) anxiety. Normal and mild anxiety levels were at 29.80% and 18.50%, respectively. Regarding depressive symptoms, 51.60% of the sample presented normal levels, 27.40% mild severity, 16.10% moderate, and 4.8% severe. No differences were found between Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis patients. Regression analyses showed that anxiety explained IBD symptom perception ( = 0.29; P = 0.022); fear of contracting COVID-19 ( = 0.35; P < 0.001) and IBD symptom perception ( = ?0.22; P = 0.009) explained depressive symptoms; and fear of contracting COVID-19 ( = 0.41; P < 0.001), IBD symptom perception ( = 0.26, P < 0.001), and being in isolation ( = ?0.16, P = 0.041) explained anxiety.

The arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) is the most clinically used variable to assess such oxygenation, since it decisively influences the oxygen transported by hemoglobin (expressed by its percentage of saturation, SaO2). However, two recent studies conducted respectively in silico and using omic techniques in red blood cells of COVID-19 patients have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could decrease the affinity of oxygen for the hemoglobin (which would imply that PaO2 would overestimate SaO2), and also reduce the amount of this carrier molecule. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate this hypothesis in blood samples from COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Blood gases of all COVID-19 patients performed in our laboratory in two months were included, as well as those from two control groups: synchronous patients with negative PCR for SARS-CoV-2 (SCG) and a historical group (HCG). Both SaO2 and venous saturations (SvO2) measured by cooximetry (COX) were compared separately with those calculated using the Kelman (K), Severinghaus (SV) and Siggaard-Andersen (SA) equations in each group. RESULTS: Measured and calculated SaO2 and SvO2 were practically equivalent in all groups. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for SaO2 in COVID-19 were 0.993 for COX-K and 0.992 for both COX-SV and COX-SA; being 0.995 for SvO2 for either COX-K, COX-SV or COX-SA.

MethodsThis is a community-based house-to-house survey conducted from September to November 2020 at the Petaling district in Selangor, Malaysia. Five hundred and four households were identified using random sampling, and heads of eligible households were recruited. Inclusion criteria were age [] 18 years with monthly household income []RM6960 (estimated USD 1600) without acute psychiatric illness. The PHQ-9, GAD-7 and EQ-5D were used for depression, anxiety, and quality of life. Multivariable logistic regression was performed for the final analysis. ResultsA total of 432 (85.7%) respondents with a mean age of 43.1 years completed the survey. Mild to severe depression was detected in 29.6%, mild to severe anxiety in 14.7%, and problematic quality of life in 27.8% of respondents. Factors associated with mild to severe depression were younger age, chronic health conditions, past stressful events, lack of communication gadgets and lack of assets or commercial property. While respiratory diseases, marital status, workplace issues, financial constraints, absence of investments, substance use and lack of rental income were associated with mild to severe anxiety. Not attributing poverty to structural issues, help-seeking from professionals, and self-stigma were barriers, while resiliency facilitated good psychological health.

OBJECTIVE: i-Dashboard is a custom-developed visualization dashboard that supports (1) key information retrieval and reorganization, (2) time-series data, and (3) display on large touch screens during MDRs. This study aimed to evaluate the performance, including the efficiency of prerounding data gathering, communication accuracy, and information exchange, and clinical satisfaction of integrating i-Dashboard as a platform to facilitate MDRs. METHODS: A cluster-randomized controlled trial was performed in 2 surgical ICUs at a university hospital. Study participants included all multidisciplinary care team members. The performance and clinical satisfaction of i-Dashboard during MDRs were compared with those of the established electronic medical record (EMR) through direct observation and questionnaire surveys. RESULTS: Between April 26 and July 18, 2021, a total of 78 and 91 MDRs were performed with the established EMR and i-Dashboard, respectively. For prerounding data gathering, the median time was 10.4 (IQR 9.1-11.8) and 4.6 (IQR 3.5-5.8) minutes using the established EMR and i-Dashboard (P<.001), respectively. During MDRs, data misrepresentations were significantly less frequent with i-Dashboard (median 0, IQR 0-0) than with the established EMR (4, IQR 3-5; P<.001). Further, effective recommendations were significantly more frequent with i-Dashboard than with the established EMR (P<.001). The questionnaire results revealed that participants favored using i-Dashboard in association with the enhancement of care plan development and team participation during MDRs. CONCLUSIONS: i-Dashboard increases efficiency in data gathering. Displaying i-Dashboard on large touch screens in MDRs may enhance communication accuracy, information exchange, and clinical satisfaction. The design concepts of i-Dashboard may help develop visualization dashboards that are more applicable for ICU MDRs.

Background: This paper focuses on the case study of a patient in the UK who showed - as far as we know today - all typical symptoms of an infection with SARS-CoV-2 but without dyspnoea. The diagnose was made on the basis of the symptoms, which were described by the patient, and confirmed by an antibody test in August 2020. Aim: Due to the public interest in knowing more about the cluster of symptoms and their implications for nursing, the patient and the author of this paper decided to present this case study to the professional audience. Methods: For the anamnesis, the patient's COVID-19 diary and an essay by her about her experiences with the National Health Service (NHS) were analysed and completed by information collected during a structured interview. Results: It became apparent that the nursing diagnoses \\"Acute pain\\" and \\"Chronic pain\\" stand at the forefront. These nursing diagnoses have not been discussed in the context of COVID-19 yet. Conclusions: This leads to the conclusion that nursing diagnoses, which are orientated towards an alleged lung disease, might not be complete when it comes to the complex disease process of COVID-19.

This Slovenian nationwide population study is the first longitudinal 6-month serosurvey using probability-based samples across all age categories. METHODS: Each participant supplied two blood samples: 1316 samples in April 2020 (first round) and 1211 in October/November 2020 (second round). The first-round sera were tested using Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG (ELISA) and, because of uncertain estimates, were retested using Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Elecsys-N) and Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (Elecsys-S). The second-round sera were concomitantly tested using Elecsys-N/Elecsys-S. RESULTS: The populations of both rounds matched the overall population (n = 3000), with minor settlement type and age differences. The first-round seroprevalence corrected for the ELISA manufacturer's specificity was 2.78% (95% highest density interval [HDI] 1.81%C3.80%), corrected using pooled ELISA specificity calculated from published data 0.93% (95% CI 0.00%C2.65%), and based on Elecsys-N/Elecsys-S results 0.87% (95% HDI 0.40%C1.38%). The second-round unadjusted lower limit of seroprevalence on 11 November 2020 was 4.06% (95% HDI 2.97%C5.16%) and on 3 October 2020, unadjusted upper limit was 4.29% (95% HDI 3.18%C5.47%). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Slovenia increased four-fold from late April to October/November 2020, mainly due to a devastating second wave. Significant logistic/methodological challenges accompanied both rounds. The main lessons learned were a need for caution when relying on manufacturer-generated assay evaluation data, the importance of multiple manufacturer-independent assay performance assessments, the need for concomitant use of highly-specific serological assays targeting different SARS-CoV-2 proteins in serosurveys conducted in low-prevalence settings or during epidemic exponential growth and the usefulness of a Bayesian approach for overcoming complex methodological challenges.","output":"Seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in Slovenia: results of two rounds of a nationwide population study on a probability-based sample, challenges and lessons learned"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Internet-based technologies play an increasingly important role in the management and outcome of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The healthcare system is currently flooded with digital innovations and internet-based technologies as a consequence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, information about the attitude of German CKD-patients with access to online tools towards the use of remote, internet-based interactions such as video conferencing, email, electronic medical records and apps in general and for health issues in particular, are missing. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND MEASUREMENTS: To address the use, habits and willingness of CKD patients in handling internet-based technologies we conducted a nationwide cross-sectional questionnaire survey in adults with CKD. RESULTS: We used 380 questionnaires from adult CKD patients (47.6% on dialysis, 43.7% transplanted and 8.7% CKD before renal replacement therapy) for analysis. Of these 18.9% denied using the internet at all (nonusers). Nonusers were significantly older (74.4 years, SD 11.4) than users (54.5 years, SD 14.5, p < 0.001), had a lower educational level than users ( 12 years: 6.9% versus 47.1%, p < 0.001) and were more often on dialysis. Within the group of internet users only a minority (2.6%) was using video conferencing with their physician, only 11.7% stated that they were using email to report symptoms and 26.6% were using the internet to schedule appointments. Slightly more than one-third of internet users (35.1%) are concerned that their personal medical data are not safe when submitted via the internet. CONCLUSIONS: Within our group of German CKD-patients we found that almost one out of five patients, especially older patients and patients with a lower educational level, did not use the internet at all. The majority of internet users reported in our survey that they have not used internet-based technologies within a medical context so far, but are willing to consider it.

Most published CAD methods perform lung cancer diagnosis by classifying each lung nodule in isolation. However, this does not reflect clinical practice, where clinicians diagnose a patient based on a set of images of nodules, instead of looking at one nodule at a time. Besides, the low interpretability of the output provided by these methods presents an important barrier for their adoption. METHOD In this article, we treat lung cancer diagnosis as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem, which better reflects the diagnosis process in the clinical setting and provides higher interpretability of the output. We selected radiomics as the source of input features and deep attention-based MIL as the classification algorithm. The attention mechanism provides higher interpretability by estimating the importance of each instance in the set for the final diagnosis. In order to improve the model's performance in a small imbalanced dataset, we propose a new bag simulation method for MIL. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION The results show that our method can achieve a mean accuracy of 0.807 with a standard error of the mean (SEM) of 0.069, a recall of 0.870 (SEM 0.061), a positive predictive value of 0.928 (SEM 0.078), a negative predictive value of 0.591 (SEM 0.155) and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.842 (SEM 0.074), outperforming other MIL methods. Additional experiments show that the proposed oversampling strategy significantly improves the model's performance. In addition, our experiments show that our method provides a good indication of the importance of each nodule in determining the diagnosis, which combined with the well-defined radiomic features, make the results more interpretable and acceptable for doctors and patients.

Despite this, non-pharmacological interventions are infrequently used. The aim of this systematic review is to determine whether non-pharmacological interventions delivered prior to, or during, radiotherapy are effective in reducing procedural anxiety. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Data sources will include the bibliographic databases CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL) (from inception onward). Eligible studies will include adult patients with cancer undergoing radiotherapy treatment.

However, despite evidence that online health MDI (on the web, on social media, and within mobile apps) also has negative real-world effects, there has been a lack of comparable action by either online service providers or state-sponsored public health bodies. We argue that this is problematic and seek to answer three questions: why has so little been done to control the flow of, and exposure to, health MDI online; how might more robust action be justified; and what specific, newly justified actions are needed to curb the flow of, and exposure to, online health MDI? In answering these questions, we show that four ethical concerns-related to paternalism, autonomy, freedom of speech, and pluralism-are partly responsible for the lack of intervention. We then suggest that these concerns can be overcome by relying on four arguments: (1) education is necessary but insufficient to curb the circulation of health MDI, (2) there is precedent for state control of internet content in other domains, (3) network dynamics adversely affect the spread of accurate health information, and (4) justice is best served by protecting those susceptible to inaccurate health information. These arguments provide a strong case for classifying the quality of the infosphere as a social determinant of health, thus making its protection a public health responsibility.

To assess the significance of seagrass belowground production to carbon sequestration, belowground carbon budgets were constructed in intertidal seagrass beds of the late-successional species Thalassia hemprichii and the early-successional species Haloduleuninervis in southern Taiwan. For both species, the turnover rates of the belowground portions were much longer than that of the aboveground portion, so the belowground biomass was much higher than the aboveground biomass. The leaf productivity of both species was significantly higher than the belowground productivity, but most of the leaf production decomposed within a year. The lower turnover and slower decomposition rates of the belowground portions allowed the late-successional seagrass T. hemprichii to store more carbon in the sediments than the early-successional seagrass H. uninervis. Long-term changes for the past 20 years in the sediment depth showed that the sediments of seagrass beds were increasing in the habitats at low elevation but were decreasing or had no clear trends in the habitats at high elevation or on the windward side. The carbon storage rates according to the belowground production of T. hemprichii and H. uninervis were 0.3-4.7 and 1.5-2.3 g C m-2 yr-1, respectively, which can potentially contribute 53% of the long-term organic carbon storage in the low-elevation sediments.","output":"Significance of belowground production to the long-term carbon sequestration of intertidal seagrass beds."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The policy for the implementation of the Community Activities Restrictions (a.k.a PPKM) recently implemented by the government due to the increased of COVID-19 outbreak in Indonesia has an impact of the activities restriction.

The world is now immobilized by this infectious RNA virus. As of June 15, already more than 7.9 million people have been infected and 432k people died. This RNA virus has the ability to do the mutation in the human body. Accurate determination of mutation rates is essential to comprehend the evolution of this virus and to determine the risk of emergent infectious disease. This study explores the mutation rate of the whole genomic sequence gathered from the patient's dataset of different countries. The collected dataset is processed to determine the nucleotide mutation and codon mutation separately. Furthermore, based on the size of the dataset, the determined mutation rate is categorized for four different regions: China, Australia, the United States, and the rest of the World. It has been found that a huge amount of Thymine (T) and Adenine (A) are mutated to other nucleotides for all regions, but codons are not frequently mutating like nucleotides. A recurrent neural network-based Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model has been applied to predict the future mutation rate of this virus. The LSTM model gives Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.06 in testing and 0.04 in training, which is an optimized value. Using this train and testing process, the nucleotide mutation rate of 400 thpatient in future time has been predicted. About 0.1% increment in mutation rate is found for mutating of nucleotides from T to C and G, C to G and G to T. While a decrement of 0.1% is seen for mutating of T to A, and A to C. It is found that this model can be used to predict day basis mutation rates if more patient data is available in updated time.","output":"Time series prediction of COVID-19 by mutation rate analysis using recurrent neural network-based LSTM model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/AIMS: To assess the effectiveness and feasibility of a brief session of hypnosis to reduce distress in children with functional constipation undergoing anorectal manometry (ARM). METHODS: A partially-blinded randomized controlled pilot trial was conducted in children 4-18 years old scheduled for ARM. Children were randomized to receive a brief session of hypnosis prior to ARM or standard care. Non-blinded and blinded observers rated the childs level of distress using the Observation Scale of Behavioral Distress and a 4-point-Likert scale, respectively. Differences between groups were analyzed using Fishers exact test or Mann-Whitney U test as appropriate. RESULTS: Data from 32 children (15 hypnosis and 17 standard care) were analyzed. Prior to insertion of the catheter, the observed mean levels of distress were lower in the hypnosis group according to both the non-blinded observer (median 0.0 [interquartile range {IQR} 0.0-0.3] vs 1.4 [IQR 0.3-2.4]; P = 0.009) and the blinded observer (median 0.0 [IQR 0.0-0.0] vs 0.5 [IQR 0.0-1.0]; P = 0.044). During ARM, observed and reported levels of distress did not differ significantly. In the hypnosis group, 92.9% of parents and children reported that hypnosis helped the child to relax. There were no significant differences in resting pressure, squeeze pressure, or duration of the procedure between both groups. CONCLUSION: A brief session of hypnosis for children before ARM is an easily incorporable intervention that lowers distress levels prior to the procedure and is positively perceived by children and parents.","output":"Hypnosis to Reduce Distress in Children Undergoing Anorectal Manometry: A Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: New SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations in the spike glycoprotein have arisen independently at multiple locations and may have functional significance. The combination of mutations in the 501Y.V2 variant first detected in South Africa include the N501Y, K417N, and E484K mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) as well as mutations in the N-terminal domain (NTD). Here we address whether the 501Y.V2 variant could escape the neutralizing antibody response elicited by natural infection with earlier variants. Methods: We were the first to outgrow two variants of 501Y.V2 from South Africa, designated 501Y.V2.HV001 and 501Y.V2.HVdF002. We examined the neutralizing effect of convalescent plasma collected from adults hospitalized with COVID-19 using a microneutralization assay with live (authentic) virus. Whole genome sequencing of the infecting virus of the plasma donors confirmed the absence of the spike mutations which characterize 501Y.V2. We infected with 501Y.V2.HV001 and 501Y.V2.HVdF002 and compared plasma neutralization to first wave virus which contained the D614G mutation but no RBD or NTD mutations. Results: We observed a reduction in antibody activity ranging from 6-fold to knockout for the 501Y.V2 (B.1.351) relative to the B.1.1 variant derived from the first wave of the pandemic in South Africa. Conclusion: This observation indicates that 501Y.V2 may escape the neutralizing antibody response elicited by prior natural infection.

However, older people who delegate their food activities (food purchasing, cooking) have been reported to have a worse nutritional status than people who take care of their food activities. In this context, we will conduct a systematic review of all studies related to the nutritional issue in home-delivered meal older recipients. Methods: In June 2020, we searched 3 databases (Pubmed, Web of Science, EMBASE) to identify studies from all years on older adults at home and receiving home-delivered meal services (population). The following outcomes were considered: nutritional status (Body Mass Index, weight, undernutrition) and nutritional intake. Any nutritional intervention, comparator, and study design were relevant for inclusion. Results: Forty-eight original studies met the inclusion criteria, most of them being published after the year 2000 (n = 34) and undertaken in the USA (n = 32). The selection includes 30 cross-sectional and 18 longitudinal studies. The main findings of this review are the following: (1) home-delivery meal older recipients are at high risk of undernutrition; (2) providing home-delivery meals may improve the nutritional status and nutrient intake; (3) this improvement is even higher when the home-delivery meal service is improved, for instance by providing dietetic counseling or adding supplementary snacks/meals or enriched food. However, even an improved service does not allow all the older recipients meeting their recommended nutritional allowance. Conclusion: This review reveals a need to further develop strategies allowing home-delivery meal older recipients to fulfill their nutritional needs. From a methodological point of view, there is a need to describe in more detail the home-delivered services provided to studies' participants to better consider meal frequency and meal content in the results.","output":"The Nutritional Issue of Older People Receiving Home-Delivered Meals: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We study the properties of the potential overlap between two networks [Formula: see text] sharing the same set of [Formula: see text] nodes (a two-layer network) whose respective degree distributions [Formula: see text] are given.

METHODS: Using cause-deleted life tables and previous work on future costs in England and Wales, we illustrate how such estimates can be adjusted. RESULTS: While the effect of including future healthcare costs can have substantial effects on incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of specific life-extending interventions, we find that including future costs has relatively little impact (an increase of 743 per quality-adjusted life-year) on the threshold estimate.

In turn, since individuals travel between countries and states, at least during periods when quarantines are less restrictive, the policy in one country may ultimately affect the infection level in other countries. Therefore, major questions are whether the policy dictated by a decentralized government is efficient, and if not, how the governments can coordinate a better policy.

We consider a game theory model in which each of two governments decides when to switch from a restrictive to a non-restrictive quarantine and vice versa. We used parameter values driven by the literature and publically available data. We show that, if travel is sufficiently frequent during the non-restrictive quarantine periods, then the strategies are sub-optimal: Each governor tends to release the quarantine sooner, which ultimately leads to longer periods of restrictive quarantines and a higher prevalence of the disease. In turn, if the governments restrict international and interstate travel to a low level even when the quarantines are non-restrictive, the policy dictated by the decentralized governance may become optimal.","output":"Decentralized governance may lead to higher infection levels and sub-optimal releases of quarantines amid the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"METHODS: One hundred and sixty-one very old patients (aged 80 years) devoid of cognitive decline were eligible for analyses.

MAIN BODY/TEXT: Immune-mediated thrombocytopenia occurs when specific antibodies bind to platelet factor 4 /heparin complexes. Platelet factor 4 is a naturally occurring chemokine, and under certain conditions, may complex with negatively charged molecules and polyanions, including heparin. The antibody-platelet factor 4/heparin complex may lead to platelet activation, accompanied by other cascading reactions, resulting in cerebral sinus thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, lower limb arterial thrombosis, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, skin necrosis, and thrombotic stroke. If untreated, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia can be life threatening. In parallel, rare incidents of spontaneous vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia can also occur in some patients administered certain coronavirus vaccines. The role of platelet factor 4 in vaccine-induced thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome further reinforces the importance the platelet factor 4/polyanion immune complexes and the complications that this might pose to susceptible individuals. These findings demonstrate, how auxiliary factors can complicate heparin therapy and drug development. An increasing interest in biomanufacturing heparins from non-animal sources has driven a growing interest in understanding the biology of immune-mediated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and therefore, the development of safe and effective biosynthetic heparins. SHORT CONCLUSION: In conclusion, these findings further reinforce the importance of the binding of platelet factor 4 with known and unknown polyanions, and the complications that these might pose to susceptible patients. In parallel, these findings also demonstrate how auxiliary factors can complicate the heparin drug development.","output":"Platelet factor 4 polyanion immune complexes: heparin induced thrombocytopenia and vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Along with the rest of the world, the United States is inundated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Since TVOCs (total volatile organic compounds) cause serious harm to human health and plants, the prevention of such damages with a reduction in their occurrence frequency becomes not an optional process but an essential one in manufacturing, as well as for chemical industries and laboratories. In this study, with consideration of the characteristics of the machine learning technique and ICT (information and communications technology), TVOC sensors are explored as a function of grounded data analysis and the selection of machine learning models, determining their performance in real situations. For representative scenarios, considering features from an ICT semiconductor sensor and one targeting TVOC gas, we investigated suitable analysis methods and machine learning models such as LSTM (long short-term memory), GRU (gated recurrent unit), and RNN (recurrent neural network). Detailed factors for these machine learning models with respect to the concentration of TVOC gas in the atmosphere are compared with original sensory data to obtain their accuracy.

To combat it, it is necessary to develop a better understanding of how the virus infects host cells. Infection normally starts with the attachment of the virus to cell-surface glycans like heparan sulfate (HS) and sialic acid-containing glycolipids/glycoproteins. In this study, we examined and compared the binding of the subunits and spike (S) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV to these glycans. Our results revealed that the S proteins and subunits can bind to HS in a sulfation-dependent manner and no binding with sialic acid residues was detected. Overall, this work suggests that HS binding may be a general mechanism for the attachment of these coronaviruses to host cells, and supports the potential importance of HS in infection and in the development of antiviral agents against these viruses.","output":"Binding of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein to Glycans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a decrease in interventional treatment for structural heart disease worldwide.

Immune eradication of cancer cells is dependent on polymorphisms of HLA class I molecules and antigen-processing machinery (APM) components. We have already published highly significant associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the ERAP1 gene with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in Chinese, but not in Polish populations. However, the smoking status of participants was not known in the previous study. Here, we compared the distribution of APM polymorphic variants in larger cohorts of Polish patients with NSCLC and controls, stratified according to their smoking status. We found significant but opposite associations in never-smokers and in smokers of all tested SNPs (rs26653, rs2287987, rs30187, and rs27044) but one (rs26618) in ERAP1. No significant associations were seen in other genes. Haplotype analysis indicated that the distribution of many ERAP1/2 haplotypes is opposite, depending on smoking status. Additionally, haplotypic combination of low activity ERAP1 and the lack of an active form of ERAP2 seems to favor the disease in never-smokers. We also revealed interesting associations of some APM polymorphisms with: age at diagnosis (ERAP1 rs26653), disease stage (ERAP1 rs27044, PSMB9 rs17587), overall survival (ERAP1 rs30187), and response to chemotherapy (ERAP1 rs27044).

Recently, it has been reported that haloperidol, an antipsychotic medication, dose-dependently increases expression of claudin-5 in vitro and in vivo, in brain endothelium. Notably, claudin-5 is highly expressed in both brain and lung tissues. However, the effects of haloperidol on EC barrier function are unknown. We hypothesized that haloperidol increases lung EC claudin-5 expression and attenuates agonist-induced lung EC barrier disruption. Human pulmonary artery ECs were pretreated with haloperidol at variable concentrations (0.1C10 M) for 24 h. Cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting for claudin-5, in addition to occludin and zona occludens-1 (ZO-1), two other tight junctional proteins. To assess effects on barrier function, EC monolayers were pretreated for 24 h with haloperidol (10 M) or vehicle prior to treatment with thrombin (1 U/mL), with measurements of transendothelial electrical resistance (TER) recorded as a real-time assessment of barrier integrity. In separate experiments, EC monolayers grown in Transwell inserts were pretreated with haloperidol (10 M) prior to stimulation with thrombin (1 U/mL, 1 h) and measurement of FITC-dextran flux. Haloperidol significantly increased claudin-5, occludin, and ZO-1 expression levels. Measurements of TER and FITC-dextran Transwell flux confirmed a significant attenuation of thrombin-induced barrier disruption associated with haloperidol treatment. Finally, mice pretreated with haloperidol (4 mg/kg, IP) prior to the intratracheal administration of LPS (1.25 mg/kg, 16 h) had increased lung claudin-5 expression with decreased lung injury as assessed by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid protein content, total cell counts, and inflammatory cytokines, in addition to lung histology. Our data confirm that haloperidol results in increased claudin-5 expression levels and demonstrates lung vascular-protective effects both in vitro and in vivo in a murine ALI model.

Anti-vaccine movements could undermine efforts to end the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that ethical and responsible behavior of mass media, a careful advisory from the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority, stern measures from healthcare authorities, effective maneuvers to increase public awareness on COVID-19, vigorous analysis of information by data or communications scientists, and publication of counter opinions from health professionals against such theories will go a long way in neutralizing such misleading claims.

A modified assessment of frailty using Fried's classification was generated from baseline data. COVID-19 test results (England) were available for 16/03/2020-01/06/2020, mostly taken in hospital settings. Logistic regression was used to discern associations between frailty, multimorbidity and COVID-19 diagnoses, after adjusting for sex, age, BMI, ethnicity, education, smoking and number of comorbidity groupings, comparing COVID-19 positive, COVID-19 negative and non-tested groups. RESULTS: 4510 participants were tested for COVID-19 (positive = 1326, negative = 3184). 497,996 participants were not tested. Compared to the non-tested group, after adjustment, COVID-19 positive participants were more likely to be frail (OR = 1.4 [95%CI = 1.1, 1.8]), report slow walking speed (OR = 1.3 [1.1, 1.6]), report two or more falls in the past year (OR = 1.3 [1.0, 1.5]) and be multimorbid (&#8805; 4 comorbidity groupings vs 0-1: OR = 1.9 [1.5, 2.3]).

Such patients have a higher risk of death, especially in critical illness. Although much attention has been recently given to fungal infections that may have devastating consequences, data on this issue is scarce. METHODS We systematically searched for studies that focused on critically ill adults who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and fungal co-infection. Mortality was the outcome of interest. The search was conducted within MEDLINE, Web of Science, clinicaltrials.gov, Embase and Cochrane Library on 8 January 2022. RESULTS We reviewed 38 papers covering 17,695 patients, 1182 (6.7%) of whom had an acquired fungal infection. The overall mortality in papers retrieved for a systematic review (n=38) varied from 29 to 100% (median=56%; IQR 40-77%). In a meta-analysis (19 studies), patients with fungal infection were more likely to die than the controls (OR=2.987; 95% CI 2.369 - 3.767; p<0.001; I2 = 26.63%). Subgroup analyses showed that COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) increased mortality by 3 times (OR=3.279; 95%CI 2.692 - 3.994; p<0.001; I2 = 0%) and that COVID-19-associated candidiasis (CAC) increased mortality by 2 times (OR=2.254; 95%CI 1.322- 3.843; I2=26.14%). CONCLUSIONS In critically ill patients with COVID-19, CAPA is rather common and significantly increases mortality. The evidence regarding other fungal infections is weaker, however, CAC occurs less frequently but impacts mortality.

Criticisms of the single-incision laparoscopic surgery technique include a larger incision and increased incidence of wound-related complications. We present our initial experience with a novel technique aimed at performing strategic laparoscopy for improved cosmesis (SLIC) for cholecystectomy. METHODS Twenty-five patients with biliary symptoms were selected for SLIC cholecystectomy. Access to the abdomen was obtained with a 5-mm optical trocar in the left upper quadrant and a 5-mm trocar in the umbilicus. Retraction was performed by a transabdominal suture in the dome of the gallbladder and a needlescopic grasper. Age, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, body mass index, operative time, length of stay, pathology results, and short-term complications at follow-up were prospectively recorded. RESULTS The 25 female patients had a mean age of 34.3 years and mean body mass index of 24 kg/m(2). American Society of Anesthesiologists scores ranged from 1 to 3. The mean operative time was 51.3 minutes. Pathology revealed chronic cholecystitis in all patients. All procedures were performed on an outpatient basis. The only complication was one ultrasonography-documented deep vein thrombosis. All 25 planned SLIC cholecystectomies were successfully completed.

Results in this study revealed that supervisory career support influences career commitment in health workers, which in turn enhances their wellbeing at the workplace. Moreover, the effect of supervisory career support on career commitment was found to be stronger for individuals with low FWSS compared to those with high FWSS. These findings also enlighten us on how to enhance employees career commitment and workplace wellbeing.","output":"Supervisory Career Support and Workplace Wellbeing in Chinese Healthcare Workers: The Mediating Role of Career Commitment and the Moderating Role of Future Work Self-Salience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cytauxzoonosis is described as an emerging tick-borne disease of domestic and wild felids caused by protozoans of the genus Cytauxzoon. While in the Americas the condition is described as a fatal disease, in Europe, reports on the clinical expression of the infection are scarce. This study describes the first case of Cytauxzoon sp. infection in Germany, in a domestic cat. A 6-year-old male domestic cat living in Saarlouis (Saarland) was presented with anorexia, lethargy and weight loss. The cat had an outdoor lifestyle and had not travelled abroad. Serum clinical chemistry analysis revealed azotaemia with markedly increased symmetric dimethylarginine, hypercreatinemia, hyperphosphatemia and hypoalbuminemia. Moreover, a mild non-regenerative anaemia was present. Approximately 1 year prior to these findings, the domestic cat was diagnosed with a feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection. These results pointed toward a decreased glomerular filtration rate, presumably as a result of kidney dysfunction. Round to oval signet ringCshaped intraerythrocytic organisms, morphologically suggestive for a piroplasm, were revealed during blood smear evaluation with a degree of parasitaemia of 33.0%. PCR analyses and sequencing of a region of the 18S rRNA gene confirmed the presence of a Cytauxzoon sp. infection, with 99C100% nucleotide sequence identity with previously published Cytauxzoon sp. isolates. As this is the first molecularly confirmed Cytauxzoon sp. infection in a domestic cat in Germany, these findings suggest that cytauxzoonosis should be considered as a differential diagnosis in cases of anaemia in outdoor domestic cats, particularly in areas where wild felid populations are present.","output":"First report of Cytauxzoon sp. infection in Germany: organism description and molecular confirmation in a domestic cat"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"QUESTION: Mental disorders typically start in childhood and persist, causing high individual and collective burdens. To inform policymaking to address childrens mental health in high-income countries we aimed to identify updated data on disorder prevalence. METHODS: We identified epidemiological studies reporting mental disorder prevalence in representative samples of children aged 18 years or youngerincluding a range of disorders and ages and assessing impairment (searching January 1990 through February 2021). We extracted associated service-use data where studies assessed this. We conducted meta-analyses using a random effects logistic model (using R metafor package). FINDINGS: Fourteen studies in 11 countries met inclusion criteria, published from 2003 to 2020 with a pooled sample of 61 545 children aged 4C18 years, including eight reporting service use. (All data were collected pre-COVID-19.) Overall prevalence of any childhood mental disorder was 12.7% (95% CI 10.1% to 15.9%; I(2)=99.1%). Significant heterogeneity pertained to diagnostic measurement and study location. Anxiety (5.2%), attention-deficit/hyperactivity (3.7%), oppositional defiant (3.3%), substance use (2.3%), conduct (1.3%) and depressive (1.3%) disorders were the most common. Among children with mental disorders, only 44.2% (95% CI 37.6% to 50.9%) received any services for these conditions. CONCLUSIONS: An estimated one in eight children have mental disorders at any given time, causing symptoms and impairment, therefore requiring treatment. Yet even in high-income countries, most children with mental disorders are not receiving services for these conditions. We discuss the implications, particularly the need to substantially increase public investments in effective interventions. We also discuss the policy urgency, given the emerging increases in childhood mental health problems since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (PROSPERO CRD42020157262).","output":"Prevalence of childhood mental disorders in high-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis to inform policymaking"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: To safely and remotely assess longitudinal SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in at-risk health care workers at the onset of the epidemic.

DESIGN: Cross\\\\sectional online survey with open questions. METHODS: Nurse managers from different healthcare institutions, for example, hospitals and nursing homes, were included. Data collection took place from November 2020 to March 2021. Open questions were analysed with qualitative content analysis. RESULT: In total, 321 managers took part. With regard to professional relationships, four main themes were identified: cooperation, cohesion, communication and consequences. While cooperation and cohesion in the nursing and the interprofessional team were predominantly considered positive, communication was seen as challenging. Additional work duties arose in relation to fulfilling regulatory requirements, managing personnel and carrying out both organizational and informational tasks. Consequences of the pandemic were mentioned in two thematic categories (professional relations and additional work duties). Participants referred to a loss of image, a reduction in job satisfaction and mental stress. CONCLUSION: The regulation of certain tasks by the central authority, such as the enrolment of employees to manage the use of personal protective equipment, would make the managers' duties simpler. This would enable them to direct their attention towards their teams and provide necessary support in other parts of their profession. IMPACT: What problem did the study address? Nursing managers are important members of the nursing team and faced particular challenges during the pandemic. Nevertheless, their perspectives are rarely presented in research. What were the main findings? Overall, communication was perceived as good, and cohesion was strengthened during the pandemic. However, heavy burdens were placed on nursing managers due to the numerous additional tasks. On whom will the research have an impact?

Although major progress in the prophylaxis of CINV has been made during the past 40 years, nausea in particular remains a significant problem. Older patients have a lower risk of CINV than younger patients, but are at a higher risk of severe consequences of dehydration and electrolyte disturbances following emesis. Age-related organ deficiencies, comorbidities, polypharmacy, risk of drugCdrug interactions, and lack of compliance all need to be addressed in the older patient with cancer at risk of CINV. Guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for the prophylaxis of CINV, but none of these guidelines offer specific recommendations for older patients with cancer. This means that the recommendations may lead to overtreatment in some older patients.

Despite the importance, it is often difficult to determine the shear modulus accurately by using many of the conventional methods; therefore, it is desirable to establish another method to measure the shear modulus with a high accuracy. Among various methods, torsional vibration test is advantageous because it can be performed easily under the pure shear stress condition in the test sample and both the in-plane and out-of-plane shear moduli can be obtained. However, it is difficult to find any examples performing the torsional vibration tests. In this study, the in-plane and out-of-plane shear moduli of XPS were determined through torsional vibration tests using samples of various widths. In addition, the shear moduli were also determined through flexural vibration tests and compared with those obtained from the torsional vibration tests. In the torsional vibration tests, the anisotropy in these shear moduli became an obstacle, and the in-plane shear modulus determined using a single sample was often dependent on the width/thickness ratio of the sample. In this condition, the coefficient of variation of the in-plane shear modulus value was often close to 10%. However, when using data obtained from the samples with various width/thickness ratios, both the in-plane and out-of-plane shear moduli could be obtained while reducing the abovementioned dependence. Additionally, the coefficients of variation were restricted to those below 2% and 7% for the in-plane and out-of-plane shear moduli, respectively, and these values were obviously lower than those obtained from the flexural vibration tests (approximately 20%). In the proposed method, both the in-plane and out-of-plane shear moduli can be obtained accurately without using any numerical analyses, which are often required in the standardized methods to improve the accuracy. Thus, for accurate measurement of both types of shear moduli of XPS, we recommend performing torsional vibration tests using a range of samples of various width/thickness ratios.","output":"Torsional Vibration Tests of Extruded Polystyrene with Improved Accuracy in Determining the Shear Modulus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Federally-funded community health centers (CHCs) serve on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic, providing essential COVID-19 testing and care for vulnerable patient populations. Overlooked in the scholarly literature is a description of how different characteristics and vulnerabilities shaped COVID-19 care delivery at CHCs in the first year of the pandemic. Our research objective was to identify organization- and state-level factors associated with more or fewer COVID-19 care and testing visits at CHCs in 2020. METHODS: Multilevel random intercept regression models examined associations among organization and state-level predictor variables and the frequency of COVID-19 care and testing visits at CHCs in 2020. The study sample included 1267 CHCs across the 50 states and the District of Columbia. RESULTS: The average CHC provided 932 patient visits for COVID-19-related care in 2020. Yet, the CHCs role in delivering COVID-19 services proved as diverse as the populations and localities CHCs serve. For example, after adjusting for other factors, each percentage-point increase in a CHCs Hispanic patient population size was associated with a 1.3% increase in the frequency of patient visits for COVID-19 care in 2020 (P < .001). Serving a predominantly rural patient population was associated with providing significantly fewer COVID-19-related care visits (P = .002). Operating in a state that enacted a mask-wearing policy in 2020 was associated with a 26.2% lower frequency of COVID-19 testing visits at CHCs in 2020, compared to CHCs operating in states without mask-wearing policies (P = .055). CONCLUSIONS: In response to the pandemic, the federal government legislated funding to help CHCs address challenges associated with COVID-19 and provide services to medically-underserved patient populations. Policymakers will likely need to provide additional support to help CHCs address population-specific vulnerabilities affecting COVID-19 care and testing delivery, especially as highly contagious COVID-19 variants proliferate (eg, Delta and Omicron).","output":"Early Data on Predictors of COVID-19 Treatment Frequency at Community Health Centers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bacteriophage P22 binds to its cell surface receptor, the repetitive O-antigen structure in Salmonella lipopolysaccharide, by its six homotrimeric tailspikes. Receptor binding by soluble tailspikes and the receptor-inactivating endorhamnosidase activity of the tailspike protein were studied using octa- and dodecasaccharides comprising two and three O-antigen repeats of Salmonella enteritidis and Salmonella typhimurium lipopolysaccharides. Wild-type tailspike protein and three mutants (D392N, D395N, and E359Q) with defective endorhamnosidase activity were used. Oligosaccharide binding to all three subunits, measured by a tryptophan fluorescence quench or by fluorescence depolarization of a coumarin label attached to the reducing end of the dodecasaccharide, occurs independently. At 10 degrees C, the binding affinities of all four proteins to oligosaccharides from both bacterial strains are identical within experimental error, and the binding constants for octa- and dodecasaccharides are 1 x 10(6) M(-1) and 2 x 10(6) M(-1), proving that two O-antigen repeats are sufficient for lipopolysaccharide recognition by the tailspike. Equilibration with the oligosaccharides occurs rapidly, but the endorhamnosidase produces only one cleavage every 100 s at 10 degrees C or about 2 min(-1) at the bacterial growth temperature.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included 30 patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA). Acetabular cup migration at 1 year was measured with RSA and CTMA. To determine the precision of both methods, 20 double examinations (postoperatively) with repositioning of the patients were performed. The precision was calculated from zero by assuming that there was no motion of the prosthesis between the 2 examinations. RESULTS: The precision of RSA ranged from 0.06 to 0.15 mm for translations and 0.21 to 0.63 for rotations. Corresponding values for CTMA were 0.06 to 0.13 mm and 0.23 to 0.35.

Exploring primary cause of death, higher stillbirth rates due to congenital anomalies were observed in babies of Pakistani, Bangladeshi and black African ethnicities (range 0.63C1.05 per 1000 births) and more placental causes in black ethnicities (range 1.97 to 2.24 per 1000 births). For the whole population, over 40% of stillbirths were of unknown cause; however, this was particularly high for babies of other Asian (60%), Bangladeshi (58%) and Indian (52%) ethnicities. CONCLUSIONS: Stillbirth rates declined in the UK, but substantial excess risk of stillbirth persists among babies of black and Asian ethnicities. The combined disadvantage for black, Pakistani and Bangladeshi ethnicities who are more likely to live in most deprived areas is associated with considerably higher rates. Key causes of death were congenital anomalies and placental causes. Improved strategies for investigation of stillbirth causes are needed to reduce unexplained deaths so that interventions can be targeted to reduce stillbirths.","output":"Understanding ethnic inequalities in stillbirth rates: a UK population-based cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the risk stratification of patients with myocarditis undergoing ventricular tachycardia (VT) ablation. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to describe VT ablation results and identify factors associated with arrhythmia recurrences in a cohort of patients with myocarditis. METHODS: The authors enrolled 125 consecutive patients with myocarditis, undergoing VT ablation. Before ablation, disease stage was evaluated, to identify active (AM) versus previous myocarditis (PM). The primary study endpoint was assessment of VT recurrences by 12-month follow-up. Predictors of VT recurrences were retrospectively identified. RESULTS: All patients (age 51  14 years, 91% men, left ventricular ejection fraction 52%  9%) had history of myocarditis diagnosed by endomyocardial biopsy (59%) and/or cardiac magnetic resonance (90%). Furthermore, all had multiple episodes of drug-refractory VTs. Multimodal pre-procedural staging identified 47 patients with AM (38%) and 78 patients with PM (62%). All patients showed low-voltage areas (LVA) at electroanatomical map (97% epicardial or endoepicardial); of them, 25 (20%) had wide borderzone (WBZ, constituting >50% of the whole LVA). VT recurrences were documented in 25 patients (20%) by 12 months, and in 43 (34%) by last follow-up (median 63 months; interquartile range: 39 to 87). At multivariable analysis, AM stage was the only predictor of VT recurrences by 12 months (hazard ratio: 9.5; 95% confidence interval: 2.6 to 35.3; p < 0.001), whereas both AM stage and WBZ were associated with arrhythmia recurrences anytime during follow-up. No VT episodes were found after redo ablation was performed in 23 patients during PM stage. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that VT ablation should be avoided during AM, but is often of benefit for recurrent VT after the acute phase of myocarditis.","output":"Inflammation as a Predictor of Recurrent Ventricular Tachycardia After Ablation in Patients With Myocarditis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Starting from 12,000 years ago in the Middle East, the Neolithic lifestyle spread across Europe via separate continental and Mediterranean routes. Genomes from early European farmers have shown a clear Near Eastern/Anatolian genetic affinity with limited contribution from hunter-gatherers. However, no genomic data are available from modern-day France, where both routes converged, as evidenced by a mosaic cultural pattern. Here, we present genome-wide data from 101 individuals from 12 sites covering today's France and Germany from the Mesolithic (N = 3) to the Neolithic (N = 98) (7000-3000 BCE). Using the genetic substructure observed in European hunter-gatherers, we characterize diverse patterns of admixture in different regions, consistent with both routes of expansion. Early western European farmers show a higher proportion of distinctly western hunter-gatherer ancestry compared to central/southeastern farmers.

Currently, there is no universally approved protocol for disinfecting lead garments in the electrophysiology laboratory. This study explores the feasibility of using ATP testing to assess the microbial burden of lead aprons and evaluates the impact of a sanitary intervention. METHODS: Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) testing is a well-established hospital standard to quantify biological matter on a surface and, by proxy, the microbial burden. It is measured in RLU (relative light units). Pre-intervention ATP testing was performed on 34 lead garments after use for electrophysiology procedures. The thyroid collar, mid-chest vest, and left axillary areas of the garments were swabbed using a Hygiena SystemSure II luminometer with ATP swabs (Hygiena, Camarillo, CA). These sites were then disinfected with disinfectant wipes (PDI Super Sani-cloth Germicidal Disposable Wipe) and ATP testing was repeated. RESULTS: The mean duration of garment wear was 213 min. The thyroid collars had the highest mean RLU before intervention, followed by the mid-chest vest and the left axillary areas. The intervention was found to significantly decrease ATP readings for all three sites (p = 0.0002, p = 0.0001, p = 0.0002 respectively). Linear regression modeling to assess the impact of intervention showed a significant correlation with pre-intervention ATP values for all three sites but no correlation with fluoroscopy time, fluoroscopy dose, or total time spent within the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Lead garments harbor microbial contamination after use according to ATP testing. A sanitary intervention can decontaminate lead garments and potentially reduce rates of hospital infection.","output":"A novel disinfection protocol using ATP testing for lead garments in the electrophysiology lab"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Goal: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus, initially identified in the mainland of China, late December 2019. COVID-19 has been confirmed as a higher infectious disease that can spread quickly in a community population depending on the number of susceptible and infected cases and also depending on their movement in the community. Since January 2020, COVID-19 has reached out to many countries worldwide, and the number of daily cases remains to increase rapidly. Method: Several mathematical and statistical models have been developed to understand, track, and forecast the trend of the virus spread. Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Quarantined-Recovered-Death-Insusceptible (SEIQRDP) model is one of the most promising epidemiological models that has been suggested for estimating the transmissibility of the COVID-19. In the present study, we propose a fractional-order SEIQRDP model to analyze the COVID-19 pandemic. In the recent decade, it has proven that many aspects in many domains can be described very successfully using fractional order differential equations. Accordingly, the Fractional-order paradigm offers a flexible, appropriate, and reliable framework for pandemic growth characterization. In fact, due to its non-locality properties, a fractional-order operator takes into consideration the variables memory effect, and hence, it takes into account the sub-diffusion process of confirmed and recovered cases. ResultsCThe validation of the studied fractional-order model using real COVID-19 data for different regions in China, Italy, and France show the potential of the proposed paradigm in predicting and understanding the pandemic dynamic. Conclusions: Fractional-order epidemiological models might play an important role in understanding and predicting the spread of the COVID-19, also providing relevant guidelines for controlling the pandemic.","output":"Fractional-Order SEIQRDP Model for Simulating the Dynamics of COVID-19 Epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The physiological effects of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) are well documented, yet the behavioural effects are largely unknown. Risk compensation suggests that gains in personal safety, as a result of vaccination, are offset by increases in risky behaviour, such as socialising, commuting and working outside the home. This is potentially problematic because transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is driven by contacts, which could be amplified by vaccine-related risk compensation behaviours. Here, we show that social behaviours were overall unrelated to personal vaccination, but - adjusting for variation in mitigation policies - were responsive to the level of vaccination in the wider population: individuals in the UK were risk compensating when rates of vaccination were rising. This effect was observed across four nations of the UK, each of which varied policies autonomously.","output":"COVID-19 vaccination, risk-compensatory behaviours, and social contacts in four countries in the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biotechnology derives from the Greek words C bios C life, technos C technology and logos C language, proof C that is biotechnology deals with the technical usage of living organisms for various purposes such as food, medicine, pharmaceuticals, recycling.

We evaluate the experience of ED clinicians with embedded PC in the ED during COVID. METHODS: ED clinicians completed a survey about their perceptions of embedded PC in the ED. We summarized responses to closed-ended items using descriptive statistics and analyzed open-ended items using thematic analysis. RESULTS: There were 134 ED clinicians surveyed. 101 replied (75% response rate). Of those that had interacted with PC, 100% indicated a benefit of having PC involved. These included freeing up ED clinicians for other tasks (89%), helping them feel more supported (84%), changing the patients care trajectory (67%), and contributing to clinician education (57%) and skills (49%). Among barriers related to engaging PC were difficulty locating them (8%) and lack of time to consult due to ED volume (5%). 98% of respondents felt that having PC in the ED was either valuable or very valuable. Open-ended responses reflected a positive impact on clinician wellness and improvement in access to high quality goal concordant care. Clinicians expressed gratitude for having PC in the ED and noted the importance of having readily available and easily accessible PC in the ED. CONCLUSION: ED clinicians perception of embedded PC was overall positive, with an emphasis on the impact related to task management, enrichment of PC skills, providing support for the team, and improved care for ED patients.","output":"The Experience of Emergency Department Providers with Embedded Palliative Care during COVID"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral infections can have profound and durable functional impacts on the immune system. There is an urgent need to characterize the long-term immune effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection given the persistence of symptoms in some individuals and the continued threat of novel variants including the recent rapid acceleration in infections. As the majority of COVID-19 patients experienced mild disease, here we use systems immunology approaches to comparatively assess the post-infection immune status (mean: 151 [5(th) C 95(th) percentile: 58 C 235] days after diagnosis) and subsequent innate and adaptive responses to seasonal influenza vaccination (as an immune challenge) in 33 previously healthy individuals after recovery from mild, non-hospitalized COVID-19, as compared to 40 age- and sex-matched healthy controls with no history of COVID-19. Sex-specific, temporally stable shifts in signatures of metabolism, T-cell activation, and innate immune/inflammatory processes suggest that mild COVID-19 can establish new post-infection immunological set-points. COVID-19-recovered males had an increase in CD71(hi) B-cells (including influenza-specific subsets) before vaccination and more robust innate, influenza-specific plasmablast, and antibody responses after vaccination compared to healthy males. Intriguingly, by day 1 post-vaccination in COVID-19-recovered subjects, the expression of numerous innate defense/immune receptor genes (e.g., Toll-like receptors) in monocytes increased and moved away from their post-COVID-19 repressed state toward the pre-vaccination baseline of healthy controls, and these changes tended to persist to day 28 in females, hinting that the acute inflammatory responses induced by vaccination could partly reset the immune states established by prior mild COVID-19. Our study reveals sex-dimorphic immune imprints and in vivo functional impacts of mild COVID-19 in humans, suggesting that prior COVID-19 could change future responses to vaccination and in turn, vaccines could help reset the immune system after COVID-19, both in an antigen-agnostic manner.","output":"Influenza vaccination reveals and partly reverses sex dimorphic immune imprints associated with prior mild COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to an infection. OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence and outcome of sepsis in RICU PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was conducted upon 403 patients admitted at RICU of the Abbassia Chest Hospital, Cairo, Egypt; 100 of them had sepsis either on admission or acquired in the RICU during the period from May 2019 to November 2019. Severity of illness was assessed by Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II score), which was recorded within 24 h from patient admission. Quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment (qSOFA) score was recorded in emergency room, and sepsis-related organ failure assessment (SOFA) score was recorded on ICU admission and on the 3rd and 7th day of ICU stay. Type of infection (community or hospital acquired), infection site, and pathogenic organisms, all were recorded. Assessment was done also regarding mechanical ventilation, length of RICU stay, the presence of comorbidities, survived patients, and dead ones, as regards causes of death and risk factors. RESULTS: The study included 100 cases with sepsis out of 403 admitted cases in the same duration with frequency 24%. Among sepsis patients, 72% were males and 28%were females, with mean age 51.62  18.62 years. The main diagnosis was pneumonia (62%), and the main comorbidity was diabetes mellitus (23%). There was significant increase in age among non-survivors when compared with survivors. There was significant increase in number of mechanically ventilated patients and a highly significant incidence of complications and need for vasoactive drugs among non-survivors when compared with survivors. There was a highly significant higher APACHE II score on the 1st day of admission among non-survivor patients. The SOFA score was significantly higher on the 1st day of admission and significantly higher on the 3rd and 7th day of admission among non-survivor patients when compared to survived patients. CONCLUSION: The current study showed that sepsis affects nearly one quarter of cases admitted at RICU, and it is usually associated with higher mortality rate in those patients.

In most studies, increased risk of ill health in women with IDD and health and developmental problems in their children were fully or partially accounted for by socioeconomic and psychosocial hardships. New research has found that pregnant women with IDD tend to have risk factors for pregnancy, birth, and postpartum complications that may contribute to adverse child outcomes. Intervention research is gradually becoming more contextualized. SUMMARY: More studies are needed on multicultural aspects of parenting, programs that could help parents with IDD overcome social and health disadvantages, comprehensive and coordinated service models that start during pregnancy, innovative parent support arrangements, parenting education for teens and young adults with IDD, use of technology, and dissemination and implementation of evidence-based programs.","output":"Recent Trends and Future Directions in Research Regarding Parents with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a still-unfolding series of novel, potentially traumatic moral and ethical challenges that place many healthcare workers at risk of developing moral injury.

Despite knowledge of this widespread exposure, to date, empirical data are scarce as to how to prevent and, where necessary, treat COVID-19-related moral injury in healthcare workers. Given the relation between moral injury and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), we point here to social and interpersonal factors as critical moderators of PTSD symptomology and consider how this knowledge may translate to interventions for COVID-19-related moral injury. Specifically, we first review alterations in social cognitive functioning observed among individuals with PTSD that may give rise to interpersonal difficulties. Drawing on Nietlisbach and Maercker's 2009 work on interpersonal factors relevant to survivors of trauma with PTSD, we then review the role of perceived social support, social acknowledgment and social exclusion in relation to potential areas of targeted intervention for COVID-19-related moral injury in healthcare workers. Finally, building on existing literature (e.g., Phoenix AustraliaCentre for Posttraumatic Mental Health and the Canadian Centre of ExcellencePTSD, 2020) we conclude with individual and organizational considerations to bolster against the development of moral injury in healthcare workers during the pandemic.","output":"Healthcare Workers and COVID-19-Related Moral Injury: An Interpersonally-Focused Approach Informed by PTSD"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A comprehensive study about the spread of COVID-19 cases in Turkey and South Africa has been presented in this paper . An exhaustive statistical analysis encompassing arithmetic, geometric, harmonic means, standard deviation, skewness, variance, Pearson and Spearman correlation was derived from the data collected from Turkey and South Africa within the period of 11 March 2020 to 3 May 2020 and 05 March and 3 of May respectively. It was observed that in the case of Turkey, a negative Spearman correlation for the number of infected class and a positive Spearman correlation for both the number of deaths and recoveries were obtained. This implied that the daily infections could decrease, while the daily deaths and number of recovered people could increase under current conditions. In the case of South Africa, a negative Spearman correlation for both daily deaths and daily infected people was obtained, indicating that these numbers may decrease if the current conditions are maintained. The utilization of a statistical technique predicted the daily number of infected, recovered and dead people for each country; and three results were obtained for Turkey, namely an upper boundary, a prediction from current situation and lower boundary. The prediction shows that Turkey may register in the near future approximately more than 6000 new infections in a day as worst case scenario; and less than 300 cases in the perfect scenario. However, the country could register in the near future a daily number of 27000 people recovered from COVID-19 in the perfect scenario; and less than 5000 people in a worst scenario. Moreover, Turkey in a worst-case scenario could record a high number of approximately 200 deaths per day; and less than 150 deaths in a perfect scenario. Similarly, in the case of South Africa, the prediction results show that in the near future the country could register about 500 new infected cases daily and more than 25 deaths in the worst scenario; while in a perfect scenario less than 50 new infected and zero death cases could be recorded.

While some viruses fuse with the plasma membrane, many viruses are endocytosed prior to fusion. Specific cues in the endosomal microenvironment induce conformational changes in the viral fusion proteins leading to viral and host membrane fusion. In the present study we investigated the entry of coronaviruses (CoVs). Using siRNA gene silencing, we found that proteins known to be important for late endosomal maturation and endosome-lysosome fusion profoundly promote infection of cells with mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV). Using recombinant MHVs expressing reporter genes as well as a novel, replication-independent fusion assay we confirmed the importance of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and demonstrated that trafficking of MHV to lysosomes is required for fusion and productive entry to occur. Nevertheless, MHV was shown to be less sensitive to perturbation of endosomal pH than vesicular stomatitis virus and influenza A virus, which fuse in early and late endosomes, respectively. Our results indicate that entry of MHV depends on proteolytic processing of its fusion protein S by lysosomal proteases. Fusion of MHV was severely inhibited by a pan-lysosomal protease inhibitor, while trafficking of MHV to lysosomes and processing by lysosomal proteases was no longer required when a furin cleavage site was introduced in the S protein immediately upstream of the fusion peptide. Also entry of feline CoV was shown to depend on trafficking to lysosomes and processing by lysosomal proteases. In contrast, MERS-CoV, which contains a minimal furin cleavage site just upstream of the fusion peptide, was negatively affected by inhibition of furin, but not of lysosomal proteases. We conclude that a proteolytic cleavage site in the CoV S protein directly upstream of the fusion peptide is an essential determinant of the intracellular site of fusion.","output":"Coronavirus Cell Entry Occurs through the Endo-/Lysosomal Pathway in a Proteolysis-Dependent Manner"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: The aim of this case study was to assess whether 8 sessions of mobile call based integrated Body-Mind-Spirit (IBMS) intervention could help COVID-19 patient to deal with psychological issues.

Failure of embryos to firmly adhere results in implantation failure and infertility. A receptive endometrial luminal epithelium is achieved through the expression of adhesion molecules in the mid-secretory phase and is a requirement for implantation. Cadherin 6 (CDH6) is an adhesion molecule localizing to the endometrial luminal epithelial cell surface in the mid-secretory/receptive phase and knockdown of CDH6 in the Ishikawa cells (receptive endometrial epithelial cell line) compromises cell integrity. However, there are no studies investigating the role of CDH6 on receptivity and infertility. This study aimed to investigate whether CDH6 is dysregulated in the endometrium of women with infertility during the receptive window and the effect of CDH6 on endometrial adhesion and receptivity. METHODS The expression and the localization of CDH6 in the human endometrium were determined by immunohistochemistry. Ishikawa cells were used to investigate the functional consequences of CDH6 knockdown on endometrial adhesive capacity to HTR8/SVneo (trophoblast cell line) spheroids in vitro. CDH6 knockdown was assessed by qPCR and immunoblotting. After CDH6 knockdown, the expression of type II cadherin family members and CDH6 functional partners were assessed by qPCR. Two-tailed unpaired student's t-test or one-way ANOVA as appropriate were used for statistical analysis with a significance threshold of P < 0.05. RESULTS A significant reduction of CDH6 immunolocalization was recorded in the luminal and glandular epithelium of endometrium from women with infertility (P < 0.05) compared to fertile group respective cellular compartments in the mid-secretory phase. Functional analysis using Ishikawa cells demonstrated that knockdown of CDH6 (treated with 50 nM CDH6 siRNA) significantly reduced epithelial adhesive capacity (P < 0.05) to HTR8/SVneo spheroids compared to control and other type II cadherin family members likely failed to compensate for the loss of CDH6. The expression levels of CDH6 functional partners, catenin family members were not changed after CDH6 knockdown in Ishikawa cells. CONCLUSION Together, our data revealed that CDH6 was dysregulated in the endometrium from women with infertility and altered Ishikawa cell adhesive capacity. Our study supports a role for CDH6 in regulating endometrial adhesion and implantation.","output":"Characterization of the role for cadherin 6 in the regulation of human endometrial receptivity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The inner-crystal quantum electronic pressure was estimated for unstrained C6Cl6, C6Br6, and C6I6 crystals and for those under external compression simulated from 1 to 20a?

Among these problems, in Brazil, the lack of a transparent, formal and standardized mental health information model stands out, thus hindering the generation of knowledge, which directly influences the quality of the mental healthcare services provided to the population. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a computational ontology to serve as a common knowledge base among those involved in this domain, to make inferences about treatments, symptoms, diagnosis and prevention methods, helping health professionals in clinical decisions. To do this, we initially carried out a literature review involving scientific papers and the most current WHO guidelines on mental health, later we transferred this knowledge to a formal computational model, building the proposed ontology. Also, the Hermit Reasoner inference engine was used to deduce facts and legitimize the consistency of the logic rules assigned to the model. Hence, it was possible to develop a semantic computational artifact for storage and generate knowledge to assist mental health professionals in clinical decisions.","output":"Ontology-Based Inference for Supporting Clinical Decisions in Mental Health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antibody deficiencies constitute the majority of primary immunodeficiencies in adults.

Ideally such investigations are performed operando, i.e. during a catalytic reaction. An example of operando measurements is to observe the degradation of fuel cell catalysts during an accelerated stress test (AST). Fuel cell catalysts consist of Pt or Pt alloy nanoparticles (NPs) supported on a high surface area carbon. A key challenge of operando SAXS measurements is a proper background subtraction of the carbon support to extract the information of the size distribution of the Pt NPs as a function of the AST treatment. Typically, such operando studies require the use of synchrotron facilities. The background measurement can then be performed by anomalous SAXS or in a grazing incidence configuration. In this work we present a proof-of-concept study demonstrating the use of a laboratory X-ray diffractometer for operando SAXS. Data acquisition of operando SAXS with a laboratory X-ray diffractometer is desirable due to the general challenging and limited accessibility of synchrotron facilities. They become even more crucial under the ongoing and foreseen restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although, it is not the aim to completely replace synchrotron-based studies, it is shown that the background subtraction can be achieved by a simple experimental consideration in the setup that can ultimately facilitate operando SAXS measurements at a synchrotron facility.","output":"Operando SAXS study of a Pt/C fuel cell catalyst with an X-ray laboratory source"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic extended to reach most countries in the globe during few months.

Here, we combined B cell sorting with single-cell VDJ- and RNA-seq and monoclonal antibody (mAb) testing to characterize the colonic PC repertoire in healthy individuals and patients with UC. We show that a large fraction of B cell clones is shared between different colon regions and that inflammation in UC disrupts this landscape, causing clonal expansion and isotype skewing from IgA1 and IgA2 to IgG1. mAbs produced from expanded PC clones show low polyreactivity and autoreactivity and target specific bacterial strains. Expression profiles of individual PCs from inflamed and non-inflamed colon regions indicate that inflammation is associated with up-regulation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and antigen presentation genes.

The aim of this study was to learn how COVID-19 influenced patients suffering from IBD during the quarantine period, focusing in particular on psychological distress through the Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10) and also the impact of the pandemic on therapeutic adherence using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective, single-centre and analytical observational study was carried out in the IBD unit in August 2020. Patients were contacted and interviewed by phone. A descriptive analysis was carried out and subsequently the factors associated with the loss of therapeutic adherence and higher-moderate levels of stress were analyzed through logistic regression multivariate analyses. RESULTS: A total of 426 patients were included with a median PSS-10 score of 12 (10-16). A higher level of stress was reported by those who were not married, women and those who experienced an increase in IBD-related symptoms. Adherence to treatment was not associated with stress based on the PSS-10 questionnaire.

The objective of this study was to describe possible changes in substance use in the first months of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Europe. METHODS: Data were obtained from a cross-sectional online survey of 36,538 adult substance users from 21 European countries conducted between April 24 and July 22 of 2020. Self-perceived changes in substance use were measured by asking respondents whether their use had decreased (slightly or substantially), increased (slightly or substantially), or not changed during the past month. The survey covered alcohol (frequency, quantity, and heavy episodic drinking occasions), tobacco, cannabis, and other illicit drug use. Sample weighted data were descriptively analysed and compared across substances. RESULTS: Across all countries, use of all substances remained unchanged for around half of the respondents, while the remainder reported either a decrease or increase in their substance use. For alcohol use, overall, a larger proportion of respondents indicated a decrease than those reporting an increase. In contrast, more respondents reported increases in their tobacco and cannabis use during the previous month compared to those reporting decreased use. No distinct direction of change was reported for other substance use. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest changes in use of alcohol, tobacco and cannabis during the initial months of the pandemic in several European countries. This study offers initial insights into changes in substance use. Other data sources, such as sales statistics, should be used to corroborate these preliminary findings.

Little is known about the relationship between the impact of COVID-19 and ones mental health status, and thus research needs to be conducted to identify the factors involved and develop tailored evidence-based strategies in response to reduce the adverse psychological impact. Methods: From February to June 2020, we conducted an online Global Mental Health survey which recruited participants via a respondent-driven sampling country in 8 countries (China, Pakistan, Philippines, Iran, Poland, Spain, USA and Vietnam). The online survey collected information on demographic characteristics, physical symptoms and health service utilisation, contact history, knowledge and concerns regarding COVID-19, precautionary measures taken and additional health information variables among the countries involved. The psychological impact was measured by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) questionnaire and the mental health status was measured by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Results: There were 5555 participants involved in the study, 31.4% male and 68.6% female, with an age range of 12-to above 50 years of age. There were significant differences in the mean IES-R and DASS-21 scores between the 8 countries (F(7, 55477) = 71.605, 2=0.085, p<0.001). China had the highest IES-R score (mean=32.98, SD=15.42). Poland and Pakistan were found to be the two countries with the highest levels of anxiety, depression and stress;conversely, Vietnam had the lowest scores in stress (mean = 3.80, SD = 5.81), anxiety (mean = 2.10, SD = 4.91) and depression (mean = 2.28, SD = 5.43). Female gender, age older than 50 years, crowded home environment, unemployment and student status were significant associated with adverse mental health (p<0.05). However, higher education background, greater level of satisfaction with health information, staying with family members, spending less than 2 hours a day monitoring health information, taking suitable precautionary measures, use of face masks and less time spent at home were found to be protective factors for mental health (p<0.05). Interpretation: During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the mental health of the global population was significantly affected as shown empirically by the results of our study, and each country faced their own set of unique challenges in their response to COVID-19.

Over recent decades, risk managing institutions have experienced what by many has been described as a decline in public trust. Strategies like stakeholder involvement and communication of scientific uncertainties are increasingly implemented to rebuild levels of trust but often prove less effective. Also, trust-related research mainly revolves around the relation between regulators and authorities, on one hand, and the public, on the other, with less attention given to the role of the scientific risk assessor. In this paper, we argue that assessors can act to improve conditions of trust by adopting an understanding of risk, stressing uncertainty and knowledge aspects when conceptualizing and characterizing risk. While full trust commonly is seen as an ideal situation and distrust as a state of affairs to be prevented, this approach involves recognizing distrust as a resource. Based on an example regarding the authorization and regulation of a feed additive and the Social Amplification of Risk Framework, we show how such a perspective affects trust, both as a filter for processing, interpreting and responding to risk-related information and as an impact following such processes. Drawing on a typology of trust, we also illustrate how this relates to different dimensions and forms of trust.","output":"Creating conditions for critical trust C How an uncertainty-based risk perspective relates to dimensions and types of trust"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For a searchable version of these abstracts, please visit www.acrabstracts.org.","output":"ACR Convergence 2020 Abstract Supplement."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Paleogenomics is one of the urgent and promising areas of interdisciplinary research in the todays world science.

Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 patients and efforts to curb disease transmission affected health care delivery in the United States causing negative effects on the delivery of routine primary care, the closures of schools, the implementation of shelter-in-place orders, and the cancellation of typical activities for children. The impact of these factors and the COVID-19 epidemic on pediatric EDs has yet to be fully understood. Our study contributes by demonstrating the COVID-19 epidemics impact on our tertiary care pediatric ED and level 1 trauma center. Methods: This retrospective time series study was conducted in a southern state with data coming from three sources: 1. State Office of EMS 2. ED visits and admissions 3. Hospital trauma database. The hospital is a free-standing childrens hospital with an annual ED census around 75,000 prior to 2020. The hospital is the only state certified pediatric level I trauma center. Strict criteria exist for triggering trauma team activation. Four years of data were analyzed for number of patients seen, number and percent of patients admitted to a critical care unit, number and percent patients who met trauma activation criteria, and number of EMS transfers. This study was deemed exempt by the institutional review board since data were de-identified and aggregate. Data were managed using Excel?. Results: Overall volume decreased 34% from 74,513 (2019) to 48,924 (2020) in contrast to trends of volume from 2017 through 2019, which had shown a steady increase by an additional 1,100 patients per year. Annual admission rate rose from 13.4-13.9% in 2017-2019 to 18.6% in 2020. The institution saw a linear increase in combined admission rates to the intensive care and intermediate care units from a high of 23.7% (2019) to 25.4% (2020) with a corresponding decrease in admission rates to acute care floors. Rate of admission to inpatient psychiatry unit increased from an average yearly rate of 7.2-7.7% in 2017-2019 to 9.3% in 2020. The number of patients transferred via EMS to our institution from outside facilities increased 8.8% from 1,868 in 2019 to 2,034 in 2020.

METHODS: We downloaded the full-length genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 from the databases of GISAID and NCBI Using the software for bioinformatics including MEGA-X, BEAST, and TempEst, we constructed the genomic evolution tree, inferred the time evolution signal of the virus, calculated the tMRCA time of the virus and analyzed the selection pressure of the virus during evolution RESULTS: The phylogenetic tree showed that SARS-CoV-2 belonged to the Sarbecovirus subgenus of beta Coronavirus genus together with bat coronavirus BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013, bat-SL-CoVZC45, bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and SARS-CoV The genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from the ongoing epidemic showed a weak time evolution signal with an average tMRCA time of 73 days (95% CI: 38 9-119 3 days) No positive time evolution signal was found between SARS-CoV-2 and BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013, but the former virus had a strong positive temporal evolution relationship with bat-SL-CoVZC45 and SARS-CoV The major

(SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus that mainly affects the upper and lower respiratory tract and is responsible for extremely different degrees of disease, ranging from flu-like symptoms to atypical pneumonia that may evolve to acute respiratory distress syndrome and, ultimately, death. No specific therapy for SARS-CoV-2 has yet been identified, but since the beginning of the outbreak, several pre-existing therapeutics have been reconsidered for the treatment of infected patients. The aim of this article is to discuss current therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. A literature review was performed using PubMed, collecting data from English-language articles published until June 20th, 2020. Literature analysis showed that with the acquisition of more in-depth knowledge on the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and the pathogenesis of the different clinical manifestations, a more rationale use of available drugs has become possible. However, the road to defining which drugs are effective and which schedules of administration must be used to maximize efficacy and minimize adverse events is still very long. To date, it is only clear that no drug can alone cope with all the problems posed by SARS-CoV-2 infection and effective antivirals and inflammatory drugs must be given together to reduce COVID-19 clinical manifestations. Moreover, choice of therapy must always be tailored on clinical manifestations and, when they occur, drugs able to fight coagulopathy and venous thromboembolism that may contribute to respiratory deterioration must be prescribed.","output":"Therapeutic strategies against COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: In the pandemic, healthcare professionals face even higher levels of stress.

It has been proposed that the most iconic Antarctic animal, the penguin, experiences low pathogen pressure, accounting for their disease susceptibility in foreign environments. However, there is a limited understanding of virome diversity in Antarctic species, the extent of in situ virus evolution, or how it relates to that in other geographic regions. To test the idea that penguins have limited microbial diversity we determined the viromes of three species of penguins and their ticks sampled on the Antarctic peninsula. Using total RNA-Sequencing we identified 107 viral species, comprising likely penguin associated viruses (n = 13), penguin diet and microbiome associated viruses (n = 82) and tick viruses (n = 8), two of which may have the potential to infect penguins. Notably, the level of virome diversity revealed in penguins is comparable to that seen in Australian waterbirds, including many of the same viral families. These data therefore reject the theory that penguins are subject to lower pathogen pressure. The repeated detection of specific viruses in Antarctic penguins also suggests that rather than being simply spill-over hosts, these animals may act as key virus reservoirs.","output":"Sustained virome diversity in Antarctic penguins and their ticks: geographical connectedness and no evidence for low pathogen pressure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The international cannabis prohibition system appears to be fragmenting.

Considering the role of cannabis as a coping strategy or self-medicating behavior, there is a need to understand how individuals who use cannabis have adapted their use amid the pandemic. Therefore, this study examined changes in self-reported cannabis use among US adults in the context of COVID-19 pandemic by (1) describing trends of use during the first 8 months of the pandemic among adults who used cannabis in this period; and (2) characterizing trends of use within sociodemographic subgroups and by state cannabis policy status. METHODS: The sample consisted of 1,761 US adults who used cannabis at least once during the 8-month study period from the nationally representative Understanding America Study. Linear mixed-effect models were used to model changes in the number of days of past-week cannabis use across 16 waves from March 10, 2020, to November 11, 2020. RESULTS: Compared to early March, the number of days cannabis was used per week was significantly higher at the start of April (=0.11, 95% CI=0.03, 0.18) and May (=0.21,95% CI=0.05, 0.36). In subsequent months (June - November), the number of days of cannabis use attenuated to levels comparable to March. Trends of cannabis use across the study period generally did not differ across sociodemographic characteristics and state cannabis policy status.

This study aims to test the KAP towards COVID-19 in Lebanon. Methods: : A cross-sectional study of Lebanese population comprising of 1861 participants was used to analyze the knowledge, attitude and practices of individuals concerning COVID-19 in relationship to multiple variables such as age, gender, marital status, living area, education level, occupation in addition to their degree of worrying about this disease. Results: : Our participants showed an overall appropriate knowledge (67.1%), positive attitude and practices that ranged from fair to very good, depending on its type, regarding COVID-19. When the components of KAP were analyzed with respect to variables, we found that levels of knowledge and practices positively correlated with people who were ever married, older, with higher degrees, worked in a healthcare field and with the degree of worry about getting COVID-19. Conclusions: : In the absence of a vaccine, pandemics such as the current COVID-19 are best combatted by increasing public awareness leading to collective preventative practices.

Severe pediatric COVID-19 disease is rare, limiting potential data accumulation on associated respiratory failure in children. Pediatric intensivists and pulmonologists managing COVID-19 patients look to adult guidelines and pediatric-specific consensus statements to guide management. The purpose of this article is to review the current literature and recommended strategies for the escalation of noninvasive and invasive respiratory support for acute respiratory failure associated with COVID-19 disease in children. RECENT FINDINGS: There are no prospective studies comparing COVID-19 treatment strategies in children. Adult and pediatric ventilation management interim guidance is based on evidence-based guidelines in non-COVID acute respiratory distress syndrome, with considerations of (1) noninvasive positive pressure ventilation versus high-flow nasal cannula and (2) high versus lower positive end expiratory pressure strategies related to lung compliance and potential lung recruitability. SUMMARY: Management of acute respiratory failure from COVID-19 requires individualized titration of noninvasive and invasive ventilation modalities with consideration of preserved or compromised pulmonary compliance. Research regarding best practices in the management of pediatric severe COVID-19 with respiratory failure is lacking and is acutely needed as the pandemic surges and vaccination of the pediatric population will be delayed compared to adults.","output":"Invasive and noninvasive ventilation strategies for acute respiratory failure in children with coronavirus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronovirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

The aim of this study was to investigate the humoral response in immunosuppressed IBD patients after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. In this prospective study, IgG antibody levels (AB) against the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (spike-protein) were quantitatively determined. For assessing the potential neutralizing capacity, a SARS-CoV-2 surrogate neutralization test (sVNT) was employed in IBD patients (n = 95) and healthy controls (n = 38). Sera were examined prior to the first/second vaccination and 3/6 months after second vaccination. Patients showed lower sVNT (%) and IgG-S (AU/mL) AB both before the second vaccination (sVNT p < 0.001; AB p < 0.001) and 3 (sVNT p = 0.002; AB p = 0.001) and 6 months (sVNT p = 0.062; AB p = 0.061) after the second vaccination. Although seroconversion rates (sVNT, IgG-S) did not differ between the two groups 3 months after second vaccination, a significant difference was seen 6 months after second vaccination (sVNT p = 0.045). Before and three months after the second vaccination, patients treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents showed significantly lower AB than healthy subjects.

This study employed a novel approach by integrating compromise programming and multicriteria group decisionCmaking methods to evaluate the efficiency of four global gridded temperature datasets based on observation data at 44 stations. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated by comparing the results obtained using symmetrical uncertainty, a machine learning similarity assessment method. The most reliable gridded data was used to assess the spatial distribution of global warming-induced unidirectional trends in thermal bioclimatic indicators (TBI) using a modified MannCKendall test. Ranking of the products revealed Climate Prediction Center (CPC) temperature as most efficient in reconstruction observed temperature, followed by TerraClimate and Climate Research Unit. The ranking of the product was consistent with that obtained using SU.

Three groups of patients were identified; group I (16 patients: 22 eyelids) had frontalis suspension surgery using silicone suspension set, group II (18 patients: 25 eyelids) underwent the surgery using Ethibond suture, and group III (15 patients: 23 eyelids) was operated on using combined silicone and Ethibond suture. The primary outcome measures were postoperative marginal reflex distance-1 (MRD-1) and postoperative symmetry, and the secondary outcome measures were the occurrence of complications; mainly recurrence and wound-related complications. The follow-up data were collected after 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, 12 months and every 6 months thereafter. Results: The follow-up period ranged from 18 to 36 months. By the last follow-up visit, 13 eyelids in silicone group (59%), 11 eyelids in the Ethibond group (44%), and 13 eyelids in the double sling group (57%) achieved good surgical correction with MRD1 3mm; these differences were not statistically significant. The difference in symmetry among the three groups was not significant. The highest rates of recurrence (44%) and wound-related problems (8%) were encountered in the Ethibond group, while the silicone group had no cases of wound-related problems. The lowest recurrence rate (26.1%) was in the double sling group but those differences were not significant. Conclusion: Combined use of silicone and Ethibond suture in frontalis suspension surgery could offer lower recurrence rate and good final surgical outcome when compared to silicone rod or Ethibond suture alone.","output":"The Combined Use of Silicone and Green Braided Polyester Suture (Ethibond) versus Silicone or Ethibond Alone for Frontalis Suspension Surgery in Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present global scenario of a pandemic has affected the human race as a whole and still continues to create unrest among all segments of the society, be it those from the economically weaker background or the affluent part of the society When the entire human race is dealing with such a scenario, it is known that anxiety and fear among the masses grow due to lack of knowledge and lack of preparedness of healthcare infrastructure Through this article, I want to highlight the effects of such an unexpected mass event and particu-larly throw light on its effects on the mental well-being of individuals It also aims to showcase the gravity of the issues related to mental health and how the number of people affected is exponentially increasing The article will also dis-cuss various coping mechanisms and ways to deal with stress, anxiety etc , to keep us mentally healthy and also suggest methods to promote mental health, thus creating a positive environment during such times of crisis Thus it is safe to say that mental health is as important if not more important than physical health A person is said to be COVID-19 positive when the person tests positive in an RT-PCR test A CT Chest has proved to be helpful in judging the risk of complications Imaging reveals non-specific changes like that of pneumonia As of now, there is no definitive therapy for Covid-19, although a few drugs like dexamethasone have proved to reduce the severity of the disease","output":"Effects of covid-19 on mental health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESIS: The authors investigate whether there is a difference in Press Ganey (PG; patient satisfaction scores) scores for the emergency physicians before and during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) outbreak at a regional group of emergency departments in the southeastern United States.

Consumers' price sensitivity was explicitly quantified by the price elasticity of demand. Consumer behavior in nine categories of products considered as life necessities were studied in two non-overlapping time periods: a year before the onset of the COVID pandemic and a year following the initial panic buying caused by the declaration of the COVID pandemic. The changes in price elasticity of demand between the the two periods across the nine product categories were determined from the weekly sales data of a Dutch retailer. Using the proposed demand modeling system applied to available data, it was empirically found that the majority of essential food products were price inelastic, while the majority of non-food products were price elastic during the COVID period. Among the nine product categories, four categories were identified to have significantly different elasticities across the two time periods, while eight categories were observed to have practically smaller magnitudes in elasticities. These insights not only prove the usefulness of the proposed demand modeling system, but also provide valuable theoretical and managerial implications for retail business practitioners, particularly in pricing and inventory planning.","output":"Were Consumers Less Price Sensitive to Life Necessities during the COVID-19 Pandemic?

Methods A total of 186 samples from 84 PCR-positive COVID-19 patients and 120 control samples taken before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic were analyzed using commercial serologic assays from Roche, Siemens and DiaSorin. Time after the positive COVID-19 PCR result and onset of symptoms was retrieved from the medical record. An extended golden standard, using the result of all three assays was defined, judging if antibodies are present or absent in a sample. Diagnostic and screening sensitivity/specificity and positive/negative predictive value were calculated. Results Diagnostic sensitivity (ability to detect a COVID-19 positive patient) 14 days after positive PCR testing was 96.7% (95% CI 88.5-99.6%) for DiaSorin, 93.3% (95% CI 83.8-98.2%) for Roche and 100% (95% CI 94.0-100%) for Siemens.

The EMI model resolves the detailed characteristics of individual cell membranes, which is where the affected ion channels are localized, thus making it uniquely suitable for studying such effects. We compare simulations from data from healthy cells, cells that exhibit LQT1 syndrome, and cells that have been treated with a drug to restore healthy heart function.

Design and setting This is a cross-sectional, quantitative survey study, carried out during July and August 2020, which included atopic dermatitis patients. The study used Arabic versions of a self-administered, Internet-based questionnaire of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Face-to-face patient interviews were not applicable due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Results A total of 400 patients participated in this survey study. Eighty-six percent (86%) were females while 39.6% were in the age group of 18 to 25 years old. A third of the responders could not sleep within half an hour, and a third of them woke up at night or early in the morning more than three times a week. Twenty-three point eight percent (23.8%) of the responders rated their sleep quality as a very good quality of sleep while 17.8% rated it as very bad. Inability to get to sleep within half an hour (p-value=0.002), waking up at night (p-value=0.005), and not being able to sleep because of pain (p-value<0.001) were all significantly correlated to the occurrence of many or a lot of skin symptoms of atopic dermatitis.

Five patients with non-respiratory symptoms as the first manifestation were hospitalized from the emergency department, and were later confirmed to have COVID-19, between 23 January and 20 February 2020, at the Wuhan Children's Hospital. SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection was positive for all the patients. Four of the patients were male and one was female, and their ages ranged from 2-months to 5.6 years. All lived in Wuhan. One patient had a clear history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, one had a suspected history of exposure, while the others had no exposure history. For three of the five patients, the primary onset disease required an emergency operation or treatment, and included intussusception, acute suppurative appendicitis perforation with local peritonitis, and traumatic subdural hemorrhage with convulsion, while for the other two it was acute gastroenteritis (including one patient with hydronephrosis and a stone in his left kidney). During the course of the disease, four of the five patients had a fever, whereas one case had no fever or cough. Two patients had leukopenia, and one also had lymphopenia.

Despite improvements in the cardiac disease management, OHCA outcomes remain poor. The purpose of this review is to provide information on the management of OHCA survivors, evidence-based treatments, and current gaps in the knowledge. RECENT FINDINGS: Most common cause of death from OHCA is neurological injury followed by shock and multiorgan failure. Prognostication tools are available to help with the clinical decision-making. Taking measures to improve EMS response time, encouraging bystander CPR, early defibrillation, and targeted temperature management are shown to improve survival. Early activation of cardiac catheterization lab for coronary angiography, hemodynamic assessment, and mechanical circulatory support should be considered in patients with shockable rhythm and presumed cardiac cause, those with ST elevation, ongoing ischemia, or evidence of hemodynamic and electrical instability. Randomized controlled trials are lacking in this field and benefits of interventions should be weighed against risk of pursuing a futile treatment. COVID-19 pandemic has added new challenges to the care of OHCA patients. SUMMARY: Clinical decision-making to care for OHCA patients is challenging.

Although attention should now be paid to the experiences of students after they returned to campus, few studies have explored the factors and mechanisms that have influenced these students' school adaptation. The present study investigated the multiple roles of social support and resilience in mediating associations the relationship between Chinese university students' interpersonal relationships and their school adaptation during COVID-19 control period. METHODS A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 4534 Chinese university students (Mage = 19.70, SD = 1.14) at two universities in Jiangxi provinces. The independent variable was interpersonal relationships; mediating variables were social support and resilience; and the dependent variable was school adaptation. Multiple mediation analysis was performed using the MPlus software. RESULTS Controlling for demographic variables, the quality of students' interpersonal relationships was significantly and positively related to their school adaptation, with students' ratings of social support and resilience mediating these associations. More interestingly, social support and resilience played multiple mediating roles in the relationship between interpersonal relationships and school adaptation. LIMITATIONS The age stage of the sample and the methods in which the data were collected may affect the generalizability of the results. CONCLUSIONS During COVID-19 control period, interpersonal relationships can influence school adaptation either directly or indirectly by enhancing social support or resilience (parallel mediation) or by activating resilience via the experience of social support (serial mediation). This study's results emphasize the role of interpersonal relationships, as well as the contributions of positive external and internal factors on students' school adaptation during the epidemic control period.

CHIKV has been emerging globally, while neither a vaccine nor antiviral medication is available. The anti-parasitic drug suramin was previously shown to inhibit CHIKV replication. In this study we aimed to obtain more detailed insight into its mechanism of action. We found that suramin interacts with virions and can inhibit virus binding to cells. It also appeared to inhibit post-attachment steps of the infection process, likely by preventing conformational changes of the envelope glycoproteins required for fusion and the progression of infection. Suramin-resistant CHIKV strains were selected and genotyping and reverse genetics experiments indicated that mutations in E2 were responsible for resistance. The substitutions N5R and H18Q were reverse engineered in the E2 glycoprotein in order to understand their role in resistance. The binding of suramin-resistant viruses with these two E2 mutations was inhibited by suramin like that of wild-type virus, but they appeared to be able to overcome the post-attachment inhibitory effect of suramin. Conversely, a virus with a G82R mutation in E2 (implicated in attenuation of vaccine strain 181/25), which renders it dependent on the interaction with heparan sulfate for entry, was more sensitive to suramin than wild-type virus. Using molecular modelling studies, we predicted the potential suramin binding sites on the mature spikes of the chikungunya virion.

For over two months of stay-at-home, houses became the only place where people slept, ate, worked, practiced sports, and socialized. As consolidated evidence exists on housing as a determinant of health, it is of great interest to explore the impact that COVID-19 response-related lockdown measures had on mental health and wellbeing. METHODS: We conducted a large web-based survey on 9261 subjects in Northern Italy, one of the Regions most heavily hit by the pandemic in Europe. Participants were recruited among university staff, faculty and students. The questions included socio-demographic features of the participants; international evaluation scales designed to recognize depressive-, anxiety- and sleep-related symptoms, impulsivity, quality of life; architectural parameters investigating housing physical characteristics. RESULTS: As emerges from our analysis poor housing is associated with increased risk of depressive symptoms during lockdown. In particular, living in apartments < 60 m2, with poor quality view and indoor area is associated with, respectively, 1.31 (95CI), 1.368 (95CI), and 2.253 (95CI) time the risk of moderate/severe and severe depressive symptoms. Subjects reporting worsened working performance from home were over four times more likely to also report depression (OR = 4.28, 95%CI). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest housing played a major role in influencing people mental health and wellbeing during COVID-19 pandemic. We argue strengthened multi-interdisciplinary approach involving urban planning, public mental health, environmental health, epidemiology, and sociology, is needed to inform the planning implementation and monitoring of housing policies centered on population health.

Infection control in hospitals is usually implemented by an infection control team (ICT). Initially, ICTs consisted of doctors, nurses, epidemiologists and microbiologists; then, in the 1980s, the infection control link nurse (ICLN) system was introduced. ICTs (with or without the ICLN system) work to ensure the health and well-being of patients and healthcare professionals in hospitals and other healthcare settings, such as acute care clinics, community health centres and care homes. No previous study has reported the effects of ICTs on HCAIs. This systematic review aims to assess the effectiveness of ICTs with or without the ICLN system in reducing HCAIs in hospitals and other healthcare settings. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will perform a comprehensive literature search for randomised controlled trials in four databases: PubMed, Embase, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library. The primary outcomes are: patient-based/clinical outcomes (rate of HCAIs, death due to HCAIs and length of hospital stay) and staff-based/behavioural outcomes (compliance with infection control practices). The secondary outcomes include the costs to the healthcare system or patients due to extended lengths of stay. Following data extraction, we will assess the risk of bias by using the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care risk of bias tool. If data can be pooled across all the studies, we will perform a meta-analysis.

METHODS Data were retrospectively collected from the clinical case files of 1271 myopic subjects (1271 right eyes). The AC curvatures calculated with a previously published algorithm were used as the target data sets. Four kinds of machine learning algorithms were implemented in the experimental analyses to predict the targeted AC curvatures: robust linear regression models, support vector machine (SVM) regression models with linear kernel functions, bagging decision trees, and Gaussian processes. The previously published calculation method and the novel machine learning method were then compared to assess the final parameters of ordered lenses. RESULTS The linear SVM and Gaussian process machine learning models achieved the best performance. The input variables included sex, age, horizontal visible iris diameter (HVID), spherical refraction (SER), cylindrical refraction, eccentricity value (e value), flat K (K1) and steep K (K2) readings, anterior chamber depth (ACD), and axial length (AL).

Until now, whenever a new, dominant, variant appeared, it overpowered its predecessor after a short parallel period. The latest variant of concern, Omicron, is spreading swiftly around the world with record morbidity reports. Unlike the Delta variant, previously considered to be the main variant of concern in most countries, including Israel, the dynamics of the Omicron variant showed different characteristics. To enable quick assessment of the spread of this variant we developed an RT-qPCR primers-probe set for the direct detection of Omicron variant. Characterized as highly specific and sensitive, the new Omicron detection set was deployed on clinical and wastewater samples. In contrast to the expected dynamics whereupon the Delta variant diminishes as Omicron variant increases, representative results received from wastewater detection indicated a cryptic circulation of the Delta variant even with the increased levels of Omicron variant. Resulting wastewater data illustrated the very initial Delta-Omicron dynamics occurring in real time. Despite this, the future development and dynamics of the two variants side-by-side is still mainly unknown. Based on the initial results, a double susceptible-infected-recovered model was developed for the Delta and Omicron variants. According to the developed model, it can be expected that the Omicron levels will decrease until eliminated, while Delta variant will maintain its cryptic circulation. If this comes to pass, the mentioned cryptic circulation may result in the reemergence of a Delta morbidity wave or in the possible generation of a new threatening variant.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study compared telehealth patients with matched controls seen in the office. The feasibility of a thorough patient evaluation in a single telehealth visit without a follow-up office visit was assessed. Both groups were also compared for completeness of physical exam, management, follow-up recommendations, and correlation of physical exam findings with intraoperative findings. RESULTS: 100 children [mean age (SD) = 20.7 (15.6) months] with a chief complaint of recurrent acute otitis media and 128 children [5.4 (3.2) years] with a chief complaint of sleep-disordered breathing were evaluated. Recommendations for surgery, additional studies, or routine follow-up were similar between telehealth and office-based groups.

To understand the significance of the vitamin D endocrine system in SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology, computational approaches were applied to transcriptomic datasets from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells of such patients or healthy individuals. Levels of vitamin D receptor, retinoid X receptor, and CYP27A1 in BALF cells of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were found to be reduced. Additionally, 107 differentially expressed, predominantly downregulated genes, as potentially modulated by vitamin D endocrine system, were identified in transcriptomic datasets from patient's cells. Further analysis of differentially expressed genes provided eight novel genes with a conserved motif with vitamin D-responsive elements, implying the role of both direct and indirect mechanisms of gene expression by the dysregulated vitamin D endocrine system in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells.

Currently, the standard paradigm for HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) is based on central air systems that tie delivery of heating and cooling to delivery of fresh air. To prevent heat loss, the delivery of fresh air must be tightly controlled and often limited through recirculation of already heated air. Buildings are designed with air-tight envelopes, which do not allow for natural ventilation, and depend on energy-intensive central-air systems. As closed environments, buildings have become sites of rapid COVID-19 transmission. In this research, we demonstrate the energy cost of increasing outdoor air supply with standard systems per COVID-19 recommendations and introduce an alternative HVAC paradigm that maximizes the decoupling of ventilation and thermal control. We first consider a novel analysis of the energy costs of increasing the amount of conditioned fresh air using standard HVAC systems to address COVID-19 concerns. We then present an alternative that includes a novel membrane-assisted radiant system we have studied for cooling in humid climates, in place of an air conditioning system. The proposed system can work in conjunction with natural ventilation and thus decreases the risk of indoor spread of infectious diseases and significantly lowers energy consumption in buildings. Our results modeling HVAC energy in different climates show increased outdoor air in standard HVAC systems can double cooling costs, while increasing natural ventilation with radiant systems can halve HVAC costs. More specifically it is possible to add up to 100 days worth of natural ventilation while saving energy, when coupling natural ventilation and radiant systems.

Two hundred thirty-four patients (30%) died in the ICU (15.3 deaths/1,000 ICU patient-days). Patients with HAIs complicated by septic shock showed an almost doubled mortality rate (52% vs 29%), whereas noncomplicated infections did not affect mortality. HAIs prolonged mechanical ventilation (median, 24 days [interquartile range (IQR), 14-39 days] vs 9 days [IQR, 5-13 days]; P < .001), ICU stay (24 days [IQR, 16-41 days] vs 9 days [IQR, 6-14 days]; P = .003), and hospital stay (42 days [IQR, 25-59 days] vs 23 days [IQR, 13-34 days]; P < .001). INTERPRETATION: Critically ill patients with COVID-19 are at high risk for HAIs, especially VAPs and BSIs resulting from MDR organisms. HAIs prolong mechanical ventilation and hospitalization, and HAIs complicated by septic shock almost doubled mortality.

However, there are challenges for virtual teams C such as reduced informal communication C with implications for team effectiveness. Team flow is a concept with high potential for promoting team effectiveness, however its measurement and promotion are challenging. Traditional team flow measurements rely on self-report questionnaires that require interrupting the team process. Approaches in artificial intelligence, i.e., machine learning, offer methods to identify an algorithm based on behavioral and sensor data that is able to identify team flow and its dynamics over time without interrupting the process. Thus, in this article we present an approach to identify team flow in virtual teams, using machine learning methods. First of all, based on a literature review, we provide a model of team flow characteristics, composed of characteristics that are shared with individual flow and characteristics that are unique for team flow. It is argued that those characteristics that are unique for team flow are represented by the concept of collective communication. Based on that, we present physiological and behavioral correlates of team flow which are suitable C but not limited to C being assessed in virtual teams and which can be used as input data for a machine learning system to assess team flow in real time. Finally, we suggest interventions to support team flow that can be implemented in real time, in virtual environments and controlled by artificial intelligence.

There are no effective treatments for the most severe forms of many inflammatory lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, corticosteroid-resistant asthma, and coronavirus disease 2019; hence, new treatment options are required. Here, we review the role of oxidative imbalance in the development of difficult-to-treat inflammatory lung diseases. The inflammation-induced overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) means that endogenous antioxidants may not be sufficient to prevent oxidative damage, resulting in an oxidative imbalance in the lung. In turn, intracellular signaling events trigger the production of proinflammatory mediators that perpetuate and aggravate the inflammatory response and may lead to tissue damage. The production of high levels of ROS in inflammatory lung diseases can induce the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, the inactivation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling and histone deacetylase 2, a decrease in glucocorticoid binding to its receptor, and thus resistance to glucocorticoid treatment. Hence, antioxidant treatment might be a therapeutic option for inflammatory lung diseases. Preclinical studies have shown that antioxidants (alone or combined with anti-inflammatory drugs) are effective in the treatment of inflammatory lung diseases, although the clinical evidence of efficacy is weaker. Despite the high level of evidence for the efficacy of antioxidants in the treatment of inflammatory lung diseases, the discovery and clinical investigation of safer, more efficacious compounds are now a priority.","output":"Oxidative Imbalance as a Crucial Factor in Inflammatory Lung Diseases: Could Antioxidant Treatment Constitute a New Therapeutic Strategy?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is an emerging coronavirus that causes vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, and even death of piglets, resulting in significant losses to the pig industry worldwide.

A quality medication reconciliation (MedRec) process is a crucial intervention used to reduce ADE in the hospital and community setting. Amid the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, preventing medication errors is vital to avoid patient readmission, reduce disease complications, and reduce cost and patient burden on the healthcare system. OBJECTIVES: To develop a standardized MedRec framework that can be implemented in all healthcare settings to reduce patient and staff harm during COVID-19. Also, to create a standardized auditing tool used to assess the quality of the MedRec process and allow for continuous quality improvement. METHODS: A multi-site gap analysis (MGA) was performed to collect observational data that were collected from four different healthcare sites (two hospitals, a long-term care facility, and a community pharmacy). MGA consists of collecting data across several sites which answer a standardized questionnaire. A standardized MedRec framework and auditing tool were developed based on the gaps observed in each site and literature reviews. RESULTS: A standardized MedRec process was not implemented in any of the observed sites. The healthcare sites lacked a designated MedRec team and training related to the MedRec process leading to multiple discrepancies at discharge. Patients were not counselled on changes to home medications, and a discharge report was often not provided upon discharge. Communication mechanisms between community pharmacies and hospital physicians are not available or easily accessible. CONCLUSION: The proposed structured MedRec framework is vital to reduce medication errors and patient harm amid COVID-19. Moreover, the comprehensive auditing tool developed in this study allows for continuous quality improvement resulting in superior quality care, reduction of workflow inefficiencies, cost savings on hospital readmissions, and overall enhanced healthcare system performance.","output":"Avoiding a Med-Wreck: a structured medication reconciliation framework and standardized auditing tool utilized to optimize patient safety and reallocate hospital resources"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose Attempts to mitigate the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID) have disrupted the delivery of non-pandemic care. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of the COVID pandemic on surgical volume and variety at an academic oral and maxillofacial surgery program. Materials and methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the surgical logs of the University of Pennsylvania, Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery from January 2012 through January 2021. Each record identified patient demographics and case classifications. Of note, the surgical logs analyzed were only those which were performed in the operating room and not the outpatient clinic nor emergency department. The study predictor was timing of care, which was divided into pre-pandemic, peak pandemic, or post-peak pandemic. The primary study outcomes were the monthly procedure count and the procedure categories. The secondary dependent variables were patient age and race. Multivariate and univariate analyses of variance were used to determine whether pandemic effects existed within outcome groups. Results The final sample included 64,709 surgical procedures (Table 1). Before, during, and after the pandemic peak, there were means of 691.0, 209.0, and 789.4 procedures per time period, respectively (p < 0.01) (Table 2). There were significantly more infection (baseline 2.2%, peak 6.0%, post-peak 2.0%, p<0.01) and trauma (baseline 5.3%, peak 26.7%, post-peak 3.9%, p<0.01) cases during the pandemic peak (Table 3). The mean percentage of pediatric patients increased during the peak and post-peak periods (baseline 2.4%, peak 12.9%, post-peak 10.2%, p<0.01) (Table 3). No differences were observed among the mean percentage of white (p=0.12), black (p=0.21), and Hispanic (p=0.25) patients treated (Table 3). Conclusion Along with a predictable decline in surgical numbers, a greater proportion of infection and trauma procedures were performed at the pandemic's peak; trauma accounted for over a quarter of surgical cases during this peak. One potential reason for this could be due to an increase in at-home domestic violence. Pennsylvania issued a stay-at-home order for Philadelphia County from March 23 until May 8, 2020. A recent study highlighted that there was a regional decrease in the overall volume of trauma at the University of Pennsylvania [1]. This was largely driven by parallel decreases in the number of unintentional injury mechanisms, such as motor vehicle collisions. Interestingly, there was a paradoxical increase in the number of intentional interpersonal injuries [1]. In fact, the number of domestic assault cases grew by at least 5% during this time at the national level [2]. The increase in infections may be due to outpatient dental services being inaccessible during the pandemic's peak, causing patients with odontogenic infections to have limited care options. Furthermore, because most patients were avoiding local emergency departments that were overwhelmed with COVID, it is probable that certain mild infections that otherwise could be treated in-office may have transformed into more severe airway threatening conditions that required operating room drainage. Despite all these changes, surgery volume normalized, and case variety returned to pre-pandemic levels in the post-peak period. Our study suggests that the addition of COVID restrictions did not change the case volume or variety in the months after the initial crisis.","output":"How has the COVID-19 Pandemic Impacted the Clinical Volume and Variety of an Academic Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Program?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Patients treated for malignancy are considered at risk of severe COVID-19.

We identified five categories of information that increased microblog traffic pertaining to infectious diseases: news of an outbreak or a case; health education / information; alternative health information / Traditional Chinese Medicine; commercial advertisement / entertainment; and social issues. News unrelated to the specified infectious diseases also led to elevated microblog traffic. Our study showcases the diverse contexts from which increased social media traffic occur. Our results will facilitate better health communication as causes underlying increased social media traffic are revealed.","output":"Chinese Social Media Reaction to Information about 42 Notifiable Infectious Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since its first detection in December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread worldwide, resulting in over 79.2 million documented cases in one year. Lack of pre-existing immunity against this newly emerging virus has pushed the urgent development of anti-viral therapeutics and vaccines to reduce the spread of the virus and alleviate disease. Appropriate animal models recapitulating the pathogenesis of and host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans have and will continue to accelerate this development process. Several animal models including mice, hamsters, ferrets, and non-human primates have been evaluated and actively applied in preclinical studies. However, since each animal model has unique features, it is necessary to weigh the strengths and weaknesses of each according to the goals of the study. Here, we summarize the key features, strengths and weaknesses of animal models for SARS-CoV-2, focusing on their application in anti-viral therapeutic and vaccine development.","output":"Animal models for SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Throughout the spring of 2020, stay-at-home orders were imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19. There is limited data on the effectiveness of stay-at-home orders, particularly in rural as compared to urban areas. Objective: To examine the association between stay-at-home order implementation and the incidence of COVID-19 in rural vs. urban counties. Design: Interrupted time series analysis using a mixed effects zero-inflated Poisson model. Participants: 3,142 U.S. counties. Interventions: Stay-at-home orders. Main Measures: COVID-19 daily incidence (primary) and mobility (secondary and intermediate measure of stay-at-home effectiveness) Key Results: Stay-at-home orders were implemented later (median March 30 vs. March 28) and were shorter (median 35 vs. 54 days) in rural than urban counties. Indoor mobility was, on average, 2.6-6.9% higher in rural than urban counties both during and after stay-at-home orders. Compared to the baseline (pre-stay-at-home) period, the number of new COVID-19 cases increased under stay-at-home by IRR 1.60 (95% CI, 1.57-1.64) in rural and 1.36 (95% CI, 1.30-1.42) in urban counties. For each day under stay-at-home orders, the number of new cases changed by a factor of 0.982 (95% CI 0.981-0.982) in rural and 0.952 (95% CI, 0.951-0.953) in urban counties compared to prior to stay-at-home. Each day after stay-at-home orders expired, the number of new cases changed by a factor of 0.995 (95% CI, 0.994-0.995) in rural and 0.997 (95% CI, 0.995-0.999) in urban counties compared to prior to stay-at-home. Conclusion: Stay-at-home orders decreased mobility and slowed the spread of COVID-19, but less effectively in rural than in urban counties. This necessitates a critical reevaluation of how stay-at-home orders are designed, communicated, and implemented in rural areas.","output":"The Association of Stay-at-Home Orders and the Spread of COVID-19 in Rural and Urban United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The understanding of HIV-1 pathogenesis and clinical progression is incomplete because of the variable contribution of host, immune and viral factors. The involvement of viral factors has been investigated in extreme clinical phenotypes from rapid progressors to long-term non-progressors (LTNPs). Among HIV-1 proteins, the envelope glycoprotein complex (Env) has concentrated many studies for its important role in the immune response and in the first steps of viral replication. In this study, we analyzed the contribution of 41 Envs from 24 patients with different clinical progression rates and viral loads (VLs), LTNP-Elite Controllers (LTNP-ECs); Viremic LTNPs (vLTNPs), and non-controllers individuals contemporary to LTNPs or recent, named Old and Modern progressors. We analyzed the Env expression, the fusion and cell-to-cell transfer capacities as well as viral infectivity. The sequence and phylogenetic analysis of Envs were also performed. In every functional characteristic, the Envs from subjects with viral control (LTNP-ECs and vLTNPs) showed significant lower performance compared to those from the progressor individuals (Old and Modern). Regarding sequence analysis, the variable loops of the gp120 subunit of the Env (i.e., V2, V4 and mainly V5) of the progressor individuals showed longer and more glycosylated sequences than controller subjects. Therefore, HIV-1 Envs presenting poor viral functions and shorter sequences were associated with viremic control and the non-progressor clinical phenotype, whereas functional Envs were associated with the lack of virological control and progressor clinical phenotypes. These correlations support the central role of Env genotypic and phenotypic characteristics in the in vivo HIV-1 infection and pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE The role of the virus in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection has not been investigated in isolates from individuals with different progression rates. In this work, we studied the properties of the envelope glycoprotein complex (Env) in individuals with different progression rates to elucidate its role in pathogenesis. We estimated the Env expression, the CD4 binding, the fusion and cell-to-cell viral transfer capacities that affect the infectivity of the viral Envs in recombinant viruses. The Envs from individuals which control viral replication and lack clinical progression (LTNP-ECs and vLTNPs) showed lower functional capacities than from subjects with clinical progression (Old and Modern). The functional increase of the Envs characteristics was associated with an increase in viral infectivity and in increased length of variable loops and the number of glycosylation sites of the Env (gp120/SU). These results support the concept that viral characteristics contribute to viral infection and pathogenesis.","output":"The characteristics of the HIV-1 Env glycoprotein contribute to viral pathogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Population-based data about the COVID-19 risk in patients with IMID remain scarce. Objectives: To investigate the cumulative incidence and risk factors for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection and SARS-CoV2 testing in patients with IMID compared with matched non-IMID patients from the general population. Methods: A population-based, matched cohort study was conducted using health administrative data from adults living in Ontario, Canada from January to December 2020. Cohorts for each of the following IMID were assembled: rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (including lupus, systemic sclerosis, Sjogren's, inflammatory myositis), multiple sclerosis (MS), iritis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) and vasculitis. Each patient was matched with 5 non-IMID comparators based on age, sex, area of residence and living in long term care (LTC). Standardized cumulative rates of testing for SARS-CoV2, and for receiving a positive test between IMID and non-IMID were compared between IMID and non-IMID patients. Multivariable logistic regression analyses assessed sociodemographic factors associated with COVID-19 testing and positivity. Results: A total of 493,499 IMID patients and 2,466,946 non-IMID comparators were assessed. Significantly more IMID patients versus non-IMID were tested for SARS-CoV2 (27.4% vs. 22.7%), while the proportions of those positive for COVID-19 were identical (0.9% of all patients in both groups). Overall, IMID patients were more likely to undergo SARS-CoV2 testing (odds ratio (OR) 1.28, 95% CI 1.27, 1.29), but their overall risk of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 was not elevated (OR 0.97 (95% CI 0.93, 1)). However, the risk of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection was lower in IBD (OR 0.75), MS (OR 0.77) and psoriasis (OR 0.94) and marginally higher in RA (OR 1.07) and iritis (OR 1.13) compared with non-IMID comparators (Figure 1A). The highest standardized rates of COVID-19 infection were found in vasculitis (115 per 10,000 patients) and iritis (109 per 10,000 patients) (Figure 1B). Risk factors for COVID-19 infection included younger age, living in LTC, multimorbidity, urban living and lower income (Table 1). Conclusion: Patients across all IMID were more likely to be tested for COVID-19 versus non-IMID patients. IMID patients were not at higher risk for testing positive for COVID-19 as an overall group, yet risk varied across disease subgroups.","output":"Are patients with immune mediated inflammatory diseases (imid) more likely to receive COVID-19 tests and test positive for SARS-CoV-2 a matched population-based study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly advancing among human population.

A screening program based on fecal immunological occult blood test, followed in case of a positive test by colonoscopy, was launched in Tunis region in 2016. We aimed to evaluate this screening program in order to make recommendations for a better implementation of this program in years to come. METHODS: A mixed approach has been adopted with a quantitative component based on the production of indicators related to activity, monitoring and screening quality; and a qualitative component conducted through focus groups with frontline health care professionals (HCP) and individual interviews with those lost to follow-up after a positive screening test. SWOT analysis was then performed in order to assess main strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the program. RESULTS: This study showed a coverage rate of 41.2% [40.5-41.8] for population consulting the first line of care, and an effective participation rate estimated at 23.1% [22.6-23.6]. Out of 5856 tests performed, 6% (n=352) were non-treatable and 6.7 % (n=390) were positive. Only 18.6% (n=72) of those tested positive had undergone colonoscopy. A total of 26 polyps, 03 cases of cancer and 04 cases of dysplasia were recorded. SWOT analysis pointed out that the variable adherence of HCP, lack of awareness of general population regarding CRC screening, the non-acceptability of colonoscopy without sedation with a problem of affordability for its realization in the private sector, and long appointments delays in public sector, were main weaknesses and of this program. CONCLUSION: This evaluation underlined certain strengths regarding the program implementation and revealed, in return, several shortcomings which certainly impair the programs effectiveness and efficiency. The involvement of the national health insurance fund in CRC screening tests and colonoscopies reimbursement, as well as the establishment of a performance-based payment modality for HCP, constitute main key pillars to reach success and sustainability for any CCR mass screening program in Tunisia.","output":"Profil des initiatives communautaires de riposte contre la pandmie COVID-19 en Tunisie"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the unprecedented situation caused by a global pandemic, the traditional way of teaching that is reliant on face-to-face interaction between teachers and students has been dismantled.

The research follows a qualitative design, in which ten university teachers were interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide. Three themes interwoven with a common thread were identified through teachers reflections, including displacement, routine, and role. The common thread was identified as the interaction between teachers and students, and analysing the quality of this interaction led to understanding the social kernel of teaching as embedded in social practice, suggesting that physical dislocation demands teachers to recreate meaning in the new situation.

This study aimed to establish consensus on the priorities for translation of US into clinical practice for the assessment of swallowing and laryngeal function. Nominal Group Technique (NGT) was used as a formal method of consensus development. Clinicians and academics, all members of an international US working group, were invited to participate in the study. Two NGT meetings were held, where participants silently generated and then shared ideas. Participants anonymously ranked items. Rankings were aggregated before participants re-ranked items in order of priority. Discussions regarding rankings were recorded and transcribed to inform analysis. Member-checking with participants informed the final analysis. Participants (n = 15) were speech and language pathologists, physiotherapists and sonographers representing six countries. Fifteen items were identified and prioritised 1C13 (including two equally ranked items). Reliability, validity and normative data emerged as key areas for research while development of training protocols and engagement with stakeholders were considered vital to progressing US into practice. Analysis revealed common themes that might be addressed together in research, in addition to the ranked priority. A measured approach to the translation of US into clinical practice will enable effective implementation of this tool.

Previous studies have determined that CD8(+) T lymphocytes are required to restrict acute, productive MCMV infection within the central nervous system (CNS). In this study, we investigated the contribution of humoral immune responses in control of MCMV brain infection. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Utilizing our MCMV brain infection model, we investigated B-lymphocyte-lineage cells and assessed their role in controlling the recovery of reactivated virus from latently infected brain tissue. Brain infiltrating leukocytes were first phenotyped using markers indicative of B-lymphocytes and plasma cells. Results obtained during these studies showed a steady increase in the recruitment of B-lymphocyte-lineage cells into the brain throughout the time-course of viral infection. Further, MCMV-specific antibody secreting cells (ASC) were detected within the infiltrating leukocyte population using an ELISPOT assay. Immunohistochemical studies of brain sections revealed co-localization of CD138(+) cells with either IgG or IgM. Additional immunohistochemical staining for MCMV early antigen 1 (E1, m112C113), a reported marker of viral latency in neurons, confirmed its expression in the brain during latent infection. Finally, using B-cell deficient (Jh(?/?)) mice we demonstrated that B-lymphocytes control recovery of reactivated virus from latently-infected brain tissue. A significantly higher rate of reactivated virus was recovered from the brains of Jh(?/?) mice when compared to Wt animals. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results demonstrate that MCMV infection triggers accumulation and persistence of B-lymphocyte-lineage cells within the brain, which produce antibodies and play a significant role in controlling reactivated virus.","output":"Persistent Humoral Immune Responses in the CNS Limit Recovery of Reactivated Murine Cytomegalovirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this retrospective analysis, we describe weekly croup and corresponding viral prevalence patterns in a pediatric quaternary care system in metropolitan Atlanta.

One prior report suggested that use of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), which downregulates TMPRSS2, may protect men with prostate cancer from infection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cohort study of a prospective registry of all patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 between March 12 and June 10, 2020, with complete follow-up until disease recovery or death. The main exposure examined was the use of ADT, and the outcome measures were the rate of SARS-CoV-2 positivity and disease severity as a function of ADT use. RESULTS: The study cohort consisted of 1,779 men with prostate cancer from a total tested population of 74,787, of whom 4,885 (6.5%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of those with prostate cancer, 102 (5.7%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive and 304 (17.1%) were on ADT. Among those on ADT, 5.6% were positive as compared to 5.8% not on ADT. Men on ADT were slightly older (75.5 vs. 73.8 years, p=.009), more likely to have smoked (68.1% vs. 59.3%, p =.005), and more likely to report taking steroids (43.8% vs. 23.3%, p < .001).

The NS is protected by rather complicated multi-layer barriers that allow access to nutrients and facilitate contact with the peripheral tissues, but block entry of pathogens and toxins. Virus infections usually begin in peripheral tissues and if these barriers are weakened, they can spread into the PNS and more rarely into the CNS. Most viral infections of the NS are opportunistic or accidental pathogens that gain access via the bloodstream (e.g., HIV and various arboviruses). But a few have evolved to enter the NS efficiently by invading neurons directly and by exploiting neuronal cell biology (e.g., rhabdoviruses and alphaherpesviruses). Most NS infections are devastating and difficult to manage. Remarkably, the alphaherpesviruses establish life-long quiescent infections in the PNS, with rare but often serious CNS pathology. In this review, we will focus on how alphaherpesviruses gain access to and spread in the NS, with particular emphasis on bidirectional transport and spread within and between neurons and neural circuits, which is regulated by complex viral-host protein interactions. Finally, we will describe the wide use of alphaherpesviruses as tools to study nerve connectivity and function in animal models.","output":"Invasion of the Nervous System."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has put a serious burden on the healthcare system worldwide. Due to varied manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection, many scoring systems, which were earlier used for community acquired pneumonia (CAP) are in use to determine the disease severity and the need of ICU admissions for proper management. COVID-19 is a relatively new disease and the validity of these scoring systems in SARS-CoV-2 infection is not completely known. This study aimed to validate these scoring systems in cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in an Indian setup. The study has also tried to find the most accurate indicator of disease severity and 14-day mortality among these scoring systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 122 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients at a tertiary hospital in Ranchi, Jharkhand. The severity of the disease according to ICMR protocol for COVID-19, the PSI/PORT score, the CURB-65 score and the SCAP score were calculated in all the patients and analysed with the disease outcome, that is, 14-day mortality. RESULTS: SCAP score, PSI/PORT score and CURB-65 criteria, all were good indicators of disease severity and 14-day mortality. However, when compared to other scoring systems, SCAP score was a more accurate marker of disease severity and 14-day mortality.

A meta-analysis was performed to clarify the incidence and the impact of COVID-19-related AKI on mortality. METHODS: All trials reporting the incidence of AKI in COVID-19 patients were searched using MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and EMBASE databases (last update April 26, 2020). RESULTS: Ten trials with a sample of 5,166 patients were included. AKI occurred in 947 out of 5,166 (18.3%) patients. AKI incidence was higher in severe cases: 62/305 severe patients developed AKI (20%) versus 27/1,268 nonsevere patients (2%) (p = 0.00001). AKI occurred in 475 out of 915 (52%) deceased patients versus 183 out of 2,678 (7%) survivors (p = 0.00001). Continuous renal replacement therapy was significantly more frequent in severe cases and in dead patients. CONCLUSION: A significant increase in mortality rate was observed in COVID patients who developed AKI, and AKI incidence was also higher in severe cases.

While humoral immunity plays an important role during virus infections, cellular aspects of this response are less well understood. Here, we investigated the antiviral response of circulating B cells upon experimental rhinovirus infection in healthy individuals and asthma patients. METHODS We purified B cells from experimentally infected healthy individuals and patients with asthma and subjected them to total RNA-sequencing. Rhinovirus-derived RNA was measured in isolated B cells using a highly sensitive PCR. B cells were stimulated with rhinovirus in vitro to further study gene expression, expression of antiviral proteins and B cell differentiation in response rhinovirus stimulation. Protein expression of proinflammatory cytokines in response to rhinovirus was assessed using a proximity extension assay. RESULTS B cells isolated from experimentally infected subjects exhibited an anti-viral gene profile linked to IFN-alpha, carried viral RNA in vivo, and were transiently infected by rhinovirus in vitro. B cells rapidly differentiated into plasmablasts upon rhinovirus stimulation. While B cells lacked expression of interferons in response to rhinovirus exposure, co-stimulation with rhinovirus and IFN-alpha upregulated pro-inflammatory cytokine expression suggesting a potential new function of B cells during virus infections. Asthma patients showed extensive upregulation and dysregulation of antiviral gene expression. CONCLUSIONS These findings add to the understanding of systemic effects of rhinovirus infections on B cell responses in the periphery, show potential dysregulation in patients with asthma, and might also have implications during infection with other respiratory viruses.","output":"Experimental rhinovirus infection induces an antiviral response in circulating B cells which is dysregulated in patients with asthma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Different skin manifestations of COVID\\\\19 are being reported.

METHODS: Seventy-nine LT recipients and 83 nontransplanted controls participated in this study. Questionnaires comprising the WHO-five well-being index (WHO-5), the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness Scale, and the preliminary COVID-19 Pandemic Mental Health Questionnaire (CoPaQ) were distributed among them. For the WHO-5 and UCLA Loneliness Scale, means of sum scores were compared between both groups, while a comparison on item level was conducted for the CoPaQ. RESULTS: The general well-being was similar in LT recipients and controls (WHO-5: 64.0  20.5% vs. 66.4  17.3%), while the UCLA Loneliness Scale indicated a higher level of perceived social isolation (1.90  0.51 vs. 1.65  0.53, p = 0.001).

TEP documentation was not standard within our trust up to 2018. We aimed to design and introduce a standardised TEP proforma and evaluate its use in older persons aged 80. Methods Data was obtained from patient notes and questionnaires within the Medicine for Older Persons department (MOP) from four PDSA cycles between 2018C2020. Cycle 1 was a service evaluation. Based on this data, a TEP form was created and approved for use in all adult patients. Cycles 2, 3 and 4 evaluated TEP after introduction of the proforma. Results There was a 239% increase in TEP after introduction of the proforma, compared to baseline (cycle 1: n = 14/47 [29.8%], cycle 2: n = 17/112 [15.2%], cycle 3: n = 30/97 [30.9%], cycle 4: n = 42/59 [71.2%]). The increase in TEP between cycles 3 and 4 coincided with the COVID-19 epidemic. Clinicians were more confident in actioning TEP based on the proforma, compared to those written in the notes (cycle 2: 83% confidence vs 54%, cycle 3: 100% vs 35%, Cycle 4: 98% vs none written in the notes).

Purpose: The aim of this study was to explore the efficacy of the Ephedra-Glycyrrhiza (EG) drug pair on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by network pharmacology and molecular docking. Methods: The main active compounds, target information, meridians and properties of EG were obtained through the TCMSP and ETCM databases. The targeted information of COVID-19 was acquired from the GeneCards database. EG drug pair applied diseases were analysed by DAVID and the drug-bank database, and visualized by Rstudio and Cytoscape 3.7.2. Then, we carried out targeted intersection of the EG drug pair and COVID-19 to map the compound-target-disease interactions and visualize them with Cytoscape 3.7.2 and Venny 2.1. In addition, the enrichment analysis of the GO and KEGG pathways were visualized with Rstudio and PathVisio software through the DAVID database. Finally, we carried out the molecular docking of the EG active compounds with M hydrolase (Mpro), spike protein (S protein) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and the binding modes between GE and the protein were verified via molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Results: : We identified 112 active EG compounds by network pharmacological analysis. Drug pair enrichment analysis demonstrated that these compounds may participate in the cAMP, PI3K-Akt, JAK-STAT and chemokine signalling pathways, which had a high correlation with respiratory system, nervous system, blood circulation system and digestive system related diseases. Pathway analysis between EG and COVID-19 showed that the key targets were TNF, IL2, FOS, ALB and PTGS2. They may regulate the PI3K-Akt signalling pathway and natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity to play roles in immune regulation, organ protection, antiviral, immune regulation, and organ protection as well as having antiviral effects.

Localization is a frequently discussed topic in mobile robotics research. Before a robot can start a task, it must know its current location on a map. The system proposed in this paper scans the obstacles and terrain around the robot by LiDAR to obtain a map of the environment and then uses the image recognition algorithm proposed in this paper to achieve the robot's location. This system can be applied to frontline medical robots, which can disinfect the environment or deliver medication, especially in the case of the COVID-19 epidemic, to help healthcare workers. The proposed localization algorithm is different from the traditional Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL), which uses a 2D LiDAR sensor with image recognition to complete the localization. By using a modified template matching technique, the local map is compared with the known global map to deduce the robot's position, which is more accurate than AMCL. In this study, an indoor environment is created using Gazebo 3D environment simulation software, and a robot with a 2D LiDAR sensor is used in this environment to conduct the experiment. We designed three scenarios to validate the proposed algorithm, one with simple terrain, the second scene will appear throughout the map with other scenes of similar terrain, and the third with long straight lines.

In this article, we explore how the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) criteria for mifepristone specifically impede family physicians ability to provide medication abortion in primary care settings. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted 56 qualitative interviews with a national sample of family physicians across the US who were not opposed to abortion. We examined how the REMS criteria for mifepristone impact family physicians ability to provide medication abortion. RESULTS: Of the 56 interviews conducted, 23 participants (41%) raised the REMS criteria as a barrier to providing medication abortion in primary care. These participants reported the REMS added a layer of bureaucratic complexity that made it difficult for family physicians to navigate, even when trained, to provide abortion care. These family physicians described 2 predominant ways the REMS impede their ability to provide medication abortion: (1) The REMS require substantial involvement of clinic administration, who can be unsupportive; (2) The complexity of navigating the REMS results in physicians and clinic administration in primary care viewing medication abortion as not worth the effort, since it is only a small component of services offered in primary care. CONCLUSION: Removing the REMS could simplify integration of medication abortion into primary care, which could meet patient preferences, improve access, and reduce abortion stigma. The FDAs revised REMS criteria may ease administrative burden but will likely maintain key barriers to integrating medication abortion into family physicians practice. IMPLICATIONS: Our study highlights that the REMS criteria are barriers to family physicians ability to integrate medication abortion into their primary care practices. The FDAs removal of in person dispensing criteria may provide some impetus for trained family physicians to integrate medication abortion into their scope of practice but the revised REMS criteria maintain key barriers to broader adoption.","output":"Exploring the impact of mifepristones risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) on the integration of medication abortion into US family medicine primary care clinics()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tujuan penelitian adalah untuk menggambarkan pengetahuan persepsi dan sikap masyarakat Sumatera Barat terhadap COVID-19.

METHODS: HCWs participating in regular SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antibody testing were invited for serological testing prior to first and second vaccination, and 4 weeks post-vaccination if receiving a 12-week dosing interval. Quantitative post-vaccination anti-spike antibody responses were measured using the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant assay (detection threshold: &#8805;50 AU/mL). We used multivariable logistic regression to identify predictors of seropositivity and generalized additive models to track antibody responses over time. RESULTS: 3570/3610 HCWs (98.9%) were seropositive >14 days post first vaccination and prior to second vaccination: 2706/2720 (99.5%) were seropositive after the Pfizer-BioNTech and 864/890 (97.1%) following the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines. Previously infected and younger HCWs were more likely to test seropositive post first vaccination, with no evidence of differences by sex or ethnicity. All 470 HCWs tested >14 days after the second vaccination were seropositive. Quantitative antibody responses were higher after previous infection: median (IQR) >21 days post first Pfizer-BioNTech 14 604 (7644-22 291) AU/mL versus 1028 (564-1985) AU/mL without prior infection (p < 0.001).

One strategy is to directly prioritize groups that are likely to experience medical complications due to COVID-19, such as older adults. A second strategy is to limit community spread by reducing importations, for example by vaccinating members of the mobile labour force, such as rotational workers. This second strategy may be appropriate for regions with low disease prevalence, where importations are a substantial fraction of all cases and reducing the importation rate reduces the risk of community outbreaks, which can provide significant indirect protection for vulnerable individuals. Current studies have focused on comparing vaccination strategies in the absence of importations, and have not considered allocating vaccines to reduce the importation rate. Here, we provide an analytical criteria to compare the reduction in the risk of hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) admission over four months when either older adults or rotational workers are prioritized for vaccination. Vaccinating rotational workers (assumed to be 6,000 individuals and about 1% of the Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) population) could reduce the average risk of hospitalization and ICU admission by 42%, if no community spread is observed at the time of vaccination, because epidemic spread is reduced and vulnerable individuals are indirectly protected. In contrast, vaccinating all individuals aged 75 and older (about 43,300 individuals, or 8% of the NL population) would lead to a 24% reduction in the average risk of hospitalization, and to a 45% reduction in the average risk of ICU admission, because a large number of individuals at high risk from COVID-19 are now vaccinated. Therefore, reducing the risk of hospitalization and ICU admission of the susceptible population by reducing case importations would require a significantly lower number of vaccines. Benefits of vaccinating rotational workers decrease with increasing infection prevalence in the community. Prioritizing members of the mobile labour force should be considered as an efficient strategy to indirectly protect vulnerable groups from COVID-19 exposure in regions with low disease prevalence.","output":"Rotational worker vaccination provides indirect protection to vulnerable groups in regions with low COVID-19 prevalence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 infection could cause severe acute respiratory syndrome, largely attributed to dysregulated immune activation and extensive lung tissue damage.

Results: Seventy-two patients were included in the analysis. A significant decrease in anxiety and depression levels was observed after patients were discharged from hospital. Two meaningful factors of the CIS were extracted based on factor analysis, namely health impact, and social impact. The change of social impact explained the 12.7 and 10.5% variance in the depression and anxiety symptom improvement, respectively. Conclusions: Change in negative appraisals, especially the appraisals related to COVID-19 social impact may play a vital role in the relief of psychological distress of infected patients. Therefore, a cognitive and social care perspective might be considered when promoting the mental health recovery and readjustment to society among COVID-19 patients.","output":"Negative Appraisals of the COVID-19 Social Impact Associated With the Improvement of Depression and Anxiety in Patients After COVID-19 Recovery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social media and the Internet have suffered from false messages and false news since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The intention is often to mislead readers and/or make them believe something that is not real. All that increases the need for automatic methods that can detect fake news in social media. In this paper, we proposed a classification model based on machine learning and deep learning algorithms to classify COVID-19 tweets into two classes using Apache Spark and the Python API Tweepy, the proposed idea uses the features of tweets to detect fake news. Experimental results show that the random forest algorithm gives best results with an accuracy equal to 79% and that the sentiment of tweets plays an important role in the detection of fake news. By applying the proposed model on our COVID-19 dataset, 67% of tweets are classified as REAL while 37% are classified FAKE. ?

Although the COVID-19 virus mechanisms of action and pathogenesis are still under extensive research, immune system effects are evident, leading, in many cases, to respiratory distress. Although apparent pollution reduction has been noticed by the population, environmental and human health impacts due to the increased use of plastic waste and disinfectants is concerning. One of the main routes of human exposure to pollutants is through drinking water. Thus, this point of view discusses some major contaminants in drinking water known to be immunotoxic, exploring sources and drinking water routes and emphasizing the known mechanisms of action that could likely compromise the effective immune response of humans, particularly raising concerns regarding people exposed to the COVID-19 virus. Based on a literature review, metals, plastic components, plasticizers, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances may display the potential to exacerbate COVID-19 respiratory symptoms, although epidemiological studies are still required to confirm the synergistic effects between these pollutants and the virus.","output":"Drinking water pollutants may affect the immune system: concerns regarding COVID-19 health effects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Funding and staff formerly dedicated to routine public health tasks (e.g., responding to communicable and non-communicable diseases, investigating foodborne outbreaks, conducting routine surveillance) and services (e.g., environmental health, substance abuse, maternal-child health) may no longer be available in many public health departments due to the COVID-19 response. The objective of this study was to assess the extent to which staffing for essential public health services has been redirected to the COVID-19 response. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study using a survey distributed through the Qualtrics platform. Individuals (N = 298) working in public health across governmental and academic public health departments in the U.S. during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic response were surveyed. Survey items measured multiple domains including professional experience (i.e., training, years of experience, content expertise, job functions, hours worked), mental and physical health status (i.e., generalized anxiety, depression, burnout), and career plans (i.e., pre-pandemic vs. current career plans). RESULTS: The total number of content expertise areas and programmatic functions covered by individual public health workers increased between January and September of 2020, with 26% (73 of 282) of respondents reporting an increase in both. The total number of respondents working in infectious disease and preparedness remained constant, while declines were reported in program evaluation (-36%) and health education (-27%) and increases were reported in disease investigation (+35%). CONCLUSIONS: The provision of many essential public health functions and tasks have been limited or eliminated while the U.S. public health workforce responds to the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings highlight opportunities for funding and professional development of public health systems, both during and after the COVID-19 response, to help ensure the continuity of essential public health services, staffing sustainability, and preparedness for future public health emergencies in the U.S.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 response on the provision of other public health services in the U.S.: A cross sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) can arise from unknown causes, as in idiopathic PF, or as a consequence of infections, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Results Median levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in adult COVID-19 patients were below normal range. Compared with patients with high HDL-C, patients with low HDL-C showed higher proportion of male (69.6% vs 45.6%, P = 0.004), higher levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) (median, 27.83 vs 12.56 mg/L, P = 0.000) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (median, 21.49 vs 18.81 U/L, P = 0.044), as well as higher proportion of severe events (37.0% vs 14.8%, P = 0.001).

It is also used to monitor progression of disease and assess benefit of treatment after peripheral vascular intervention (PVI). The Upper Midwest Region VQI has a unique balance of participation from vascular surgeons, interventional radiologists, and cardiologists performing PVI. We sought to identify the use of ABI and assess functional outcome of patients undergoing PVI for claudication. METHODS Review of the Upper Midwest Region VQI registry was performed to identify PVI done for claudication from native artery atherosclerotic occlusive disease in non-diabetic patients from 2010 to 2020. PVI performed in patients with infection, tissue loss, rest pain, bypass graft stenoses, and aneurysmal disease was excluded. Primary outcomes included ABI, ambulation status, and functional status pre- and post-PVI. RESULTS A total of 3787 patients (58.0% men, 42.0% female; mean age 68.4 years) who underwent 3830 procedures were identified. 2665 (69.5%) patients had ABI measured: 1803 (47.1%) patients had pre-PVI only, 190 (4.9%) patients had post-PVI only, and 862 (22.5%) patients had pre- and post-PVI ABI measured. 975 (25.5%) patients never had ABI performed. Statistical analysis of all 3787 patients found no change in ambulation (p = 0.33 - 0.95 for all comparisons) or in functional status (p = 0.42 - 0.61 for all comparisons), for all instances of ABI, or lack thereof. A significant number of patients who never had ABI measured decreased from full functional status pre-PVI to only being functional with light work post-PVI (p =0.015). CONCLUSIONS Despite Grade 1, level A evidence, ABI was utilized pre- and post-PVI in only 22.5% of patients undergoing PVI for claudication. Importantly, overall functional status was found to diminish significantly after PVI in those patients who never had an ABI performed. Accurately identifying patients with claudication from PAD with an ABI remains critically important before PVI. Given the lack of overall improvement in ambulation post-PVI noted in this study, identifying the patient who will benefit from PVI for claudication remains elusive.","output":"Ankle Brachial Index Use in Peripheral Vascular Interventions for Claudication."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus leading to serious respiratory disease and is spreading around the world at a raging speed.

METHODS: We performed a single-centered, retrospective, observational study of all SOT recipients with SARS-CoV-2 confirmed infection RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swab specimens who were admitted to the emergency department from March 25 to September 1, 2020. Glucocorticoid therapy was administered according to the criteria of the attending physician. We classified glucocorticoid dose as low dose therapy if the patient received dexamethasone 6 mg/day or methylprednisolone 40 mg/day, and a high dose if the patient received methylprednisolone 80C160 mg/day. Specimens collected within the first 48 hours were defined coinfection, while specimens collected after 48 hours were defined as hospital-acquired superinfection. RESULTS: Of a total of 43 SOT recipients with COVID-19, 17 (39%) required intensive care unit admission. 32 (74.4%) required glucocorticoid therapy: 13 received low dose and 19 high dose. 15 (34.8%) had secondary infections. A total of 12 (27.9%) presented hospital-acquired bacterial superinfections, mostly caused by P. aeruginosa, most of isolations were from respiratory tract cultures.

The major population we serve at Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center (KJMC) are underprivileged with many of them having multiple comorbidities. Methods: This is a retrospective study wherein patients, admitted from February 2020 to April 2020 with hyperglycemia, were selected and divided into 2 groups based on presence or absence of C-19. Data include demographics, comorbidities, blood glucose level, serum osmolality, serum bicarbonate, anion gap, acute kidney injury (AKI), serum creatinine, ICU admission, length of stay (LOS) and mortality. Data were analyzed using descriptive study and T-test. Results: 100 patients were included in the C-19 group (CG) and 88 patients were included in the Non C-19 group (NCG). Major comorbidities were similar in both groups including HTN, DM, CKD followed by ESRD. Mean age of patients (years) was 65.68 in CG and 61.17 in NCG. 61% were male in CG and 53.41% were male in NCG. 16% and 9% developed DKA and HHS in CG, and 13.64% and 6.82% developed DKA and HHS in NCG respectively. 15% in CG had combined DKA & HHS and 3.41% had same in NCG. Mean blood glucose level (mg/dl) was 541.6 in CG and 460.0 in NCG (p=0.03). Mean serum osmolality (mOsm/kg) was 335.7 (SD41.01) in CG and 317.1 (SD30.54) in NCG (p=0.01). Mean serum bicarbonate (mEq/L) was 17.73 (SD6.31) in CG and 21.46 (SD5.94) in NCG (p<0.0001). Mean anion gap was 17.93 (SD7.6) in CG and 13.10 (SD7.2) in NCG (p<0.0001). 56% in CG and 37% in NCG developed AKI respectively (p=0.01). Mean serum creatinine (mg/dl) was 4.22 in CG and 1.65 in NCG (p=0.004). 55% of CG were admitted to ICU and 34% of NCG were admitted to ICU (p=0.003). Median LOS (days) in discharged patients was 8 in CG and 5 in NCG (p=0.02). Mortality was 40% in CG and 3.41% in NCG (p<0.0001). 12 patients in CG and 2 patients in NCG developed new-onset diabetes. In the subset of DKA, interestingly, mean age (years) was 61.63 (SD17.73) in CG and 39.67 in NCG (SD13.39) (p=0.001). Conclusion: In our study, patients in the CG carry worse laboratory parameters, unfavorable clinical outcomes and strikingly higher mortality. We discovered increased incidence of new-onset diabetes and elderly DKA in CG. In an inner city population like ours, the burden of DM with significant social and health care disparities is quite severe. Diabetic patients with concurrent C-19 infection can have particularly negative outcomes and C-19 possibly damages the pancreatic islets resulting in acute hyperglycemic crisis.

METHODS Observe the clinical signs and symptoms of each patients; do laboratory examination periodically; and at last do Stat analysis of all the cases. RESULTS The first onset symptom of the 27 cases is high fever accompany with toxic symptom such as muscular soreness, headache, etc. The patient's condition may be most serious in the 2nd week. The amount of end-brush blood WBC decrease, especially the lymphocyte decrease more obviously. The amount of CD(4)(+) and CD(8)(+) decrease obviously is another important characteristic. The chest X-ray show pulmonary lesion in the 2nd day after onset of the illness, but 40.7% cases show positive change after 6 days onset. During the 7 - 12 days the pulmonary lesion become most serious. Seven cases are treated by steroid in the first 3 days when the chest X-ray is normal, but they become positive during 6 - 8 days of the course. Whether the state of the illness is serious or not seems no obvious relationship to when they are treated by steroid. And large dosage of steroid may inhibit the level of CD(4)(+) and CD8 (P < 0.05). Two severe cases present double infection after large dosage of steroid. CONCLUSION The course of a infectious atypical pneumonia is almost 3 weeks, the 1st week can be decided as early stage, the 2nd week is decided as fastigium, the 3rd week is decided as stage of recovery. During the fastigium, the disease transform very quickly, we need pay more attention to the patient. The CD(4)(+), CD(8)(+) and CD(3)(+) of SARS patient decrease obviously, it seems the immuno-function inhibited seriously.

Its rapid propagation and resistance to acaricides make it control difficult in the sub-region and Benin particularly. The aim of this work was to check its presence in wildlife and to confirm the possible role of reservoir wildlife may play in the propagation of the parasite. This will help to design more efficient control strategy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted from February to March 2017 in the National Parks of Benin (Pendjari and W Park) and wildfowls assembly and selling point in Benin. Ticks were manually picked with forceps from each animal after slaughtering by hunters then stored in 70 ethanol. Collected ticks were counted and identified in the laboratory using the identification key as described by Walker. RESULTS: Overall, seven species of ticks (Amblyomma variegatum, Boophilus decoloratus, Rm, Boophilus spp., Hyalomma spp., Rhipicephalus sanguineus, Rhipicephalus spp.) were identified on nine wild animal species sampled (Cane rat, wildcat, Hare, Doe, Cricetoma, Buffalo, Buffon Cobe, and Bushbuck and Warthog). The average number of ticks varies from 3 to 6 between animal species, 3 to 7 between localities visited, and 2 to 5 between tick species. However, these differences are statistically significant only for localities. Considering tick species and animal species, the parasite load of Rm and Rhipicephalus spp. is higher; the buffalo being more infested. The analysis of deviance reveals that the abundance of ticks observed depends only on the observed localities (p>0.05). However, the interactions between animal species and localities on the one hand and between animal and tick species on the other hand, although not significant, have influenced the abundance of ticks as they reduce the residual deviance after their inclusion in the model. CONCLUSIONS: This study reported the presence of Rm in wildlife of Benin and confirmed its role in the maintenance and spread of the parasites. It is, therefore, an important risk factor that we must not neglect in the epidemiological surveillance and ticks control strategies in the West African sub-region and particularly in Benin.","output":"Preliminary study on the tick population of Benin wildlife at the moment of its invasion by the Rhipicephalus microplus tick (Canestrini, 1888)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in drastic changes to life worldwide In Spain, the state of alarm caused the confinement of 47 million inhabitants, affecting every aspect of life This study analyzes the impact of such confinement on the health of men and women, as well as the effect on the practice of physical activity (PA) of both genders An ad hoc questionnaire was administered A total of 1046 people (48 57% men and 51 43% women) with an average age of 40 years (SD +/- 13 35) participated in this study For both genders, there was a significant decrease in quantity and intensity (p = 0 000) There was also an alteration in the type of PA practiced, shifting from cardiorespiratory exercise and muscular fitness to flexibility and neuromotor exercise (especially in women) The most popular way of practicing PA during the confinement was \\"autonomously\\" (statistically higher in men (M = 3 58) compared to women (M = 3 18)) and the most frequent format was \\"virtual\\" (statistically higher in women (M = 2 81) compared to men (M = 1 94) Confinement modifies the habits of PA practice, especially in men Both genders put their health and quality of life at risk by not following the PA guidelines of the health authorities World Health Organization (WHO) and American College of Sports Medicine ACSM) These conclusions highlight the importance of considering gender when designing programs and PA formats for the promotion of physical activity to reduce the existing gender divide","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 confinement on the habits of PA practice according to gender (male/female): Spanish case"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social isolation is closely linked to depression and falls in late life and are common among seniors. Although the literature has highlighted age-related variations in these three geriatric conditions, evidence on heterogeneities across older adult age categories is lacking. To address this gap, we present cross-sectional analyses using indicators of social isolation, depression, and falls of older adults constructed from the most recent Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data. An age-based understanding is critical to improve health interventions since health changes occur at a faster rate among seniors than in any other population subgroup. We included all adults 60 years and older (n = 113,233) in the 2018 BRFSS landline dataset and used the status of living alone, depressive disorder diagnosis, and fall incidences reported by these seniors to respectively create the social isolation, depression, and fall indicators. We conducted multivariable logistic regressions to compare findings on these indicators across the three age categories of 60C69, 70C79, and 80 and above after adjusting for a common set of covariates. Results indicate that the likelihood of seniors living alone and reporting depression is the highest among those 80 years and above. Conversely, the odds of depressed seniors reporting falls is the greatest among the 60C69 year olds.

RESULTS Immunomodulatory properties of the tuberculosis vaccine which protects against severe cases of tuberculosis and partly against other infections are indicated, including viral and respiratory infections. The BCG vaccine induces heterologous immunity and trained innate immunity. It was noted that in countries which maintain obligatory BCG vaccination COVID-19 incidence and mortality are lower than in countries that have stopped or never introduced BCG as mandatory vaccination. Most analysis confirmed this relationship, but they indicated the possible impact of other factors, such as genetics in the population, the type of strain from BCG vaccine, the level of health care and the wealth of a nation, the structure of migration, co-morbidities and a policy of introducing social distance. CONCLUSIONS At the moment, we do not have enough evidence to support or deny the hypothesis of COVID-19 reduction in incidence and mortality in countries maintaining obligatory BCG vaccination.

METHODS The study was carried out on 30 patients each with four similar facial SKs. Each lesion was assigned to be treated with cryosurgery, electrodesiccation, CO2 laser, and Er:YAG laser in a random fashion. Therapeutic results were evaluated 8 weeks after the interventions through clinical and dermatoscopic assessment. Treatment improvement criteria for each lesion included the texture of the lesion, severity of the pigmentation, and an overall assessment of the healing. The severity of burning, pain, erythema, and the duration of the erythema after the procedures were documented. A survey of the patients' satisfaction with the treatments was also performed. RESULTS In the assessment of overall lesion healing by two dermatologists, the improvement rate was significantly higher in the CO2, Er:YAG lasers and electrodesiccation group compared to the cryotherapy (p <0.001). However, the CO2 and Er:YAG laser and the electrodesiccation groups showed no significant difference (p> 0.05). Moreover, no significant difference was observed in post-treatment pigmentation and texture between the groups (p> 0.05). The pain and burning severity after the interventions were negligible in all four groups. Prolonged erythema was not observed in any of the cases; however, the duration of erythema in the Er:YAG laser group was significantly longer (p <0.001).

Home-based primary care (HBPC) provides such patients access to longitudinal medical care at home. The purpose of this study was to describe the challenges and adaptations by HBPC practices made during the first surge of the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Mixed-methods national survey. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: HBPC practices identified as members of the American Academy of Homecare Medicine (AAHCM) or participants of Home-Centered Care Institute (HCCI) training programs. METHODS: Online survey regarding practice responses to COVID-19 surges, COVID-19 testing, the use of telemedicine, practice challenges due to COVID-19, and adaptations to address these challenges. Descriptive statistics and t tests described frequency distributions of nominal and categorical data; qualitative content analysis was used to summarize responses to the open-ended questions. RESULTS: Seventy-nine practices across 29 states were included in the final analyses. Eighty-five percent of practices continued to provide in-person care and nearly half cared for COVID-19 patients. Most practices pivoted to new use of video visits (76.3%). The most common challenges were as follows: patient lack of familiarity with telemedicine (81.9%), patient anxiety (77.8%), clinician anxiety (69.4%), technical difficulties reaching patients (66.7%), and supply shortages including masks, gown, and disinfecting materials (55.6%). Top adaptive strategies included using telemedicine (95.8%), reducing in-person visits (81.9%), providing resources for patients (52.8%), and staff training in PPE use and COVID testing (52.8%).

A greater understanding of the relationship between functionally neutralising antibodies detected using microneutralisation assays and binding antibodies detected using scalable enzyme immunoassays (EIA) is needed in order to address protective immunity post-infection or vaccination, and assess EIA suitability as a surrogate test for screening of convalescent plasma donors. We assessed whether neutralising antibody titres correlated with signal cut-off ratios in five commercially available EIAs, and one in-house assay based on expressed spike protein targets. Methods Sera from individuals recovered from patients or convalescent plasma donors who reported laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=200), and negative control sera collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (n=100) were assessed in parallel. Performance was assessed by calculating EIA sensitivity and specificity with reference to microneutralisation. Results Neutralising antibodies were detected in 166 (83%) samples. Compared with this, the most sensitive EIAs were the Cobas Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (98%) and Vitros Immunodiagnostic Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (100%), which detect total antibody targeting the N and S1 antigens, respectively.

In this paper, we propose a joint deep learning model of 3D lesion segmentation and classification for diagnosing COVID-19, called DeepSC-COVID, as the first attempt in this direction. Specifically, we establish a large-scale CT database containing 1,805 3D CT scans with fine-grained lesion annotations, and reveal 4 findings about lesion difference between COVID-19 and community acquired pneumonia (CAP). Inspired by our findings, DeepSC-COVID is designed with 3 subnets: a cross-task feature subnet for feature extraction, a 3D lesion subnet for lesion segmentation, and a classification subnet for disease diagnosis.

While the COVID-19 pandemic reinforced recent trends in many countries to give access to green spaces more weight in political decision making, nature-based activities as a form of intervention for those with mental health problems constitute a very small part of patient pathways of care. Nature-based interventions, such as ecotherapy, are increasingly used as therapeutic solutions for people with common mental health problems. However, there is little data about the potential costs and benefits of ecotherapy, making it difficult to offer robust assessments of its cost-effectiveness. This paper explores the capacity for ecotherapy to be cost-effective as a healthcare intervention. Using a pragmatic scoping review of the literature to understand where the potential costs and health benefit lie, we applied value of information methodology to identify what research is needed to inform future cost-effectiveness assessments. We show that there is the potential for ecotherapy for people with mild to moderate common mental health problems to be cost-effective but significant further research is required. Furthermore, nature-based interventions such as ecotherapy also confer potential social and wider returns on investment, strengthening the case for further research to better inform robust commissioning.","output":"The Cost Effectiveness of Ecotherapy as a Healthcare Intervention, Separating the Wood from the Trees"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 has been a public health threat and a worldwide emergency for more than a year. Unfortunately, many questions concerning the pathophysiology, management, and long-term side effects remain unanswered, and novel aspects of the disease keep on emerging. Of concern to healthcare providers are the recent reported cases of reinfection. Serum coronavirus disease 2019 antibodies have been detected within a few days after onset of the disease. However, it remains unclear whether this immune response is universal, or whether it can lead to latent immunity. CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy 27-year-old white man presented with fever, chills, back pain, and other constitutional symptoms, 2 days after being exposed to coronavirus disease 2019 positive patients. His severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 polymerase chain reaction was positive, and his symptoms resolved over the next 2 weeks. One month after a confirmatory negative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 polymerase chain reaction, he was found to be ineligible for plasma donation as his anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 serology was negative. The patient redeveloped symptoms similar to his first infection 3 weeks after the negative serology test. He and his wife both tested positive via polymerase chain reaction. Their symptoms resolved over the next few days, and they had a negative polymerase chain reaction test 10 days after the positive polymerase chain reaction. CONCLUSION: While studies showed that anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 immunoglobulins start to develop early after infection, our healthy young patient's immune system failed to mount latent immunity against the virus. This left him, especially amid widespread social and medical misconceptions, vulnerable to reinfection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Our case disputes the timelines for immune response that were set and supported by research studies. Our case also raises questions regarding prioritizing vaccinating other individuals over those with prior infection.","output":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reinfection in a coronavirus disease 2019 recovered young adult: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction In the first weeks of the Covid-19 pandemic when healthcare systems in many areas were overstretched, we documented that hospital mortality in multiple myeloma (MM) patients infected by Sars-Cov-2 was 50% higher than in age matched Covid-19 patients without cancer. In the following months, the pressure on healthcare systems in Spain continued although it did not reach the extreme levels of the first weeks of the pandemic. In this study, we proposed to determine if the severity of Covid-19 outcomes in MM patients has changed over the first year of the pandemic. Patients and methods The Spanish MM Collaborative Group (Pethema-GEM) conducted a survey at national level on plasma cell disorder patients infected by SARS-Cov-2 between March 2020 and February 2021. Sixty-six (69%) out of 96 contacted healthcare centers, from all 17 regions in Spain, reported 502 patients. Data on Covid-19 acute and post-acute phase outcomes (hospitalization, oxygen requirements, severity of symptoms and mortality) were reported first in May 2020 (Martinez-Lopez et al, BCJ 2021) and updated in February 2021. In this study, we compared outcome occurrence between two study periods: P1, a period of extreme stress for the healthcare system in Spain, from March to mid-June 2020;and a second period, P2, up to mid-February 2021 with a sustained but lower burden on the national health care system. Results Among the 451 patients with plasma cell disorders and a Sars-Cov-2 infection documented with an rRT-PCR positive test, 377 (84%) were MM patients, 15 SMM (3%), 40 MGUS (9%) and 19 amyloidosis (4%). The number of MM weekly reported cases was 57% (95%CI, 48-65) lower in P2 (188 cases in 35 weeks) compared to P1 (189 cases in 15 weeks), p<0.001. The mean (SD) age and the proportion of men did not differ between P1 and P2, respectively 69.8 (10.9) vs 68.6 (11.0) years, p=0.6, and 53.3% vs 59.6%, p=0.2. MM patients with active or progressive disease at time of Covid-19 diagnosis were 24% in P1 and 34% in P2, p=0.05;patients on active treatment were more frequent in P1, 89%, than in P2, 79%, p=0.01. MM treatment was withheld in 78% and 82% of patients, p=0.4. Covid-19 treatment changed over time: MM inpatients received more remdesivir and corticoids in the second period (3% vs 31% p<0.001, and 49% vs 73%, p<0.001, respectively). In P1, 90% of the reported MM patients were hospitalized compared to 71% in P2, p<0.001. Thirty-one and 41% of patients did not require oxygen support during P1 and P2, respectively;non-invasive ventilation in 19% and 14%, and mechanical ventilation in 7% and 8%, p=0.12. Overall, acute clinical Covid-19 severity was reduced from P1 to P2: 75% to 51%, p<0.001: moderate/severe pneumonia was reduced from 68% to 36%, p<0.001 but severe distress syndrome increased from 7% to 15%, p=0.03. However, mortality in all reported patients was 30.7% in P1 vs 26.1% in P2, p=0.3;and no differences in mortality were observed in hospitalized patients, 32.2% in P1 and 35.3% in P2, p=0.6. We performed a multivariable adjustment with the predictors identified in our previous study (BCJ 2021) and confirmed that inpatient mortality was similar in both study periods, odds ratio (OR) 0.99 (95%CI 0.59-1.66). Independently of the study period, an increased mortality was observed in men (OR 1.81, 1.08-3.05), patients over 65 (OR 2.40, 1.33-4.36), and patients with active or progressive disease (OR 2.12, 1.24-3.62). The severity of Covid-19 clinical outcomes -besides mortality, was associated with increased age but not with active or progressive disease. Conclusions Although COVID-19 clinical severity has decreased over the first year of the pandemic in multiple myeloma patients, mortality remains high with no change between the initial weeks of the pandemic and the following months. Prevention and vaccination strategies should be strengthened in this vulnerable population, particularly in patients with active or progressive disease at time of Covid-19 diagnosis.

CryoEM-based structural analysis of the nanobodies in complex with spike revealed two distinct binding modes. The most potent nanobody, RBD-1-2G(NCATS-BL8125), tolerates the N501Y RBD mutation and remains capable of neutralizing the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant.

This review provides an overview of the technical challenges that should be addressed when designing single-cell transcriptomics experiments that focus on glomerulopathies. The isolation of glomerular cells from core needle biopsies for single-cell transcriptomics remains difficult and depends upon five major factors. First, core needle biopsies generate little tissue material and several samples are required to identify glomerular cells. Second, both fresh and frozen tissue samples may yield glomerular cells, although every experimental pipeline has different (dis)advantages. Third, enrichment for glomerular cells in human tissue prior to single-cell analysis is challenging as no effective standardized pipelines are available. Fourth, the current warm cell dissociation protocols may damage glomerular cells and induce transcriptional artefacts, which can be minimized by using cold dissociation techniques at a cost of less efficient cell dissociation. Finally, snRNA-seq methods may be superior to scRNA-seq in isolating glomerular cells, although its efficacy on core needle biopsies remains to be proven. The field of single-cell omics is rapidly evolving and the integration of these techniques in multi-omics assays will undoubtedly create new insights in the complex pathophysiology of glomerular diseases.","output":"Current Methodological Challenges of Single-Cell and Single-Nucleus RNA-Sequencing in Glomerular Diseases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Myocarditis and pericarditis are adverse events of special interest after vaccination for COVID-19.

Design: Systematic reviews and evidence reviews. Data sources: Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library were searched from October 2020 to January 10, 2022; reference lists and grey literature (to January 13, 2021). Review methods: Large (>10,000) or population-based/multisite observational studies and surveillance data (incidence and risk factors) reporting on confirmed myocarditis or pericarditis after COVID-19 vaccination; case series (n[]5, presentation, short-term clinical course and longer-term outcomes); opinions/letters/reviews/primary studies focused on describing or supporting hypothesized mechanisms. A single reviewer completed screening and another verified 50% of exclusions, using a machine-learning program to prioritize records. A second reviewer verified all exclusions at full text, extracted data, and (for incidence and risk factors) risk of bias assessments using modified Joanna Briggs Institute tools. Team consensus determined certainty of evidence ratings for incidence and risk factors using GRADE. Results: 46 studies were included (14 on incidence, 7 on risk factors, 11 on characteristics and short-term course, 3 on longer term outcomes, and 21 on mechanisms). Incidence of myocarditis after mRNA vaccines is highest in male adolescents and young adults (12-17y: range 50-139 cases per million [low certainty] and 18-29y: range 28-147 per million [moderate certainty]). For 5-11 year-old males and females and females 18-29 years of age, incidence of myocarditis after vaccination with Pfizer may be fewer than 20 cases per million (low certainty). There was very low certainty evidence for incidence after a third dose of an mRNA vaccine. For 18-29 year-old males and females, incidence of myocarditis is probably higher after vaccination with Moderna compared to Pfizer (moderate certainty). Among 12-17, 18-29 and 18-39 year-olds, incidence of myocarditis/pericarditis after dose 2 of an mRNA vaccine may be lower when administered []31 days compared to []30 days after dose 1 (low certainty). Data specific to males aged 18-29 indicated that the dosing interval may need to increase to []56 days to substantially drop incidence. For clinical course and short-term outcomes only one small series (n=8) was found for 5-11 year olds. In cases of adolescents and adults, the majority (>90%) of myocarditis cases involved 20-30 year-old males with symptom onset 2 to 4 days after second dose (71-100%). Most cases were hospitalized ([]84%) for a short duration (2-4 d). For pericarditis, data is limited but more variation has been reported in patient age, sex, onset timing and rate of hospitalization. Case series with longer-term (3 mo; n=38) follow-up suggest persistent ECG abnormalities, as well as ongoing symptoms and/or a need for medications or restriction from activities in >50% of patients. 16 hypothesized mechanisms are described, with little direct supporting or refuting evidence. Conclusions: Adolescent and young adult males are at the highest risk of myocarditis after mRNA vaccination. Pfizer over Moderna and waiting more than 30 days between doses may be preferred for this population. Incidence of myocarditis in children aged 5-11 may be very rare but certainty was low.

Although RT-PCR is the most reliable technique to detect ongoing infections, serological tests are frequently proposed as tools in heterogeneous screening strategies. OBJECTIVES: to analyse the performance of a screening strategy proposed by the local government of Tuscany (Central Italy), which first uses qualitative rapid tests for antibody detection, and then RT-PCR tests on the positive subjects. METHODS: a simulation study is conducted to investigate the number of RT-PCR tests required by the screening strategy and the undetected ongoing infections in a pseudo-population of 500,000 subjects, under different prevalence scenarios and assuming a sensitivity of the serological test ranging from 0.50 to 0.80 (specificity 0.98). A compartmental model is used to predict the number of new infections generated by the false negatives two months after the screening, under different values of the infection reproduction number. RESULTS: assuming a sensitivity equal to 0.80 and a prevalence of 0.3%, the screening procedure would require on average 11,167 RT-PCR tests and would produce 300 false negatives, responsible after two months of a number of contagions ranging from 526 to 1,132, under the optimistic scenario of a reproduction number between 0.5 to 1.

Following closely the growth dynamics of the disease is one of the pillars toward achieving that goal. Objective: We aimed at developing a simple framework to facilitate the analysis of the growth rate (cases/day) and growth acceleration (cases/day 2) of COVID-19 cases in real-time. Methods: The framework was built using the Moving Regression (MR) technique and a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The dynamics of the pandemic was initially modeled via combinations of four different growth stages: lagging (beginning of the outbreak), exponential (rapid growth), deceleration (growth decay), and stationary (near zero growth). A fifth growth behavior, namely linear growth (constant growth above zero), was further introduced to add more flexibility to the framework. An R Shiny application was developed, which can be accessed at https://theguarani.com.br/ or downloaded from https://github.com/adamtaiti/SARS-CoV-2. The framework was applied to data from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), which comprised 3,722,128 cases reported worldwide as of May 8th 2020. Results: We found that the impact of public health measures on the prevalence of COVID-19 could be perceived in seemingly real-time by monitoring growth acceleration curves. Restriction to human mobility produced detectable decline in growth acceleration within 1 week, deceleration within ~2 weeks and near-stationary growth within ~6 weeks. Countries exhibiting different permutations of the five growth stages indicated that the evolution of COVID-19 prevalence is more complex and dynamic than previously appreciated. Conclusions: These results corroborate that mass social isolation is a highly effective measure against the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2, as previously suggested. Apart from the analysis of prevalence partitioned by country, the proposed framework is easily applicable to city, state, region and arbitrary territory data, serving as an asset to monitor the local behavior of COVID-19 cases.","output":"Growth Rate and Acceleration Analysis of the COVID-19 Pandemic Reveals the Effect of Public Health Measures in Real Time"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Racial and ethnic differences in breast cancer occur by race/ethnicity in both incidence and mortality rates.

Incidence is lowest among Asian/Pacific Islander women, at 93.2 per 100,000.

Mortality rates for Asian/Pacific Islander women (11.5 per 100,000) are far lower than for Black and White women. When age is considered, additional differences between Black and White women appear, in part accounted for by types of breast cancer experienced. Women of other racial/ethnic groups and socioeconomic status have received less scientific attention. In this article, we provide a brief overview of the evidence for social determinants of breast cancer and argue that the current reliance on race over racism and ethnicity contributes to our inability to eliminate breast cancer disparities in the United States and elsewhere in the world.

Screening and diagnostic practices for GDM are inconsistent across the world. This narrative review includes data from 87 observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and aims to give an overview of the current evidence on screening strategies and diagnostic criteria for GDM. Screening in early pregnancy remains controversial and studies show conflicting results on the benefit of screening and treatment of GDM in early pregnancy. Implementing the one-step International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) screening strategy at 24C28 weeks often leads to a substantial increase in the prevalence of GDM, without conclusive evidence regarding the benefits on pregnancy outcomes compared to a two-step screening strategy with a glucose challenge test (GCT). In addition, RCTs are needed to investigate the impact of treatment of GDM diagnosed with IADPSG criteria on long-term maternal and childhood outcomes. Selective screening using a risk-factor-based approach could be helpful in simplifying the screening algorithm but carries the risk of missing significant proportions of GDM cases. A two-step screening method with a 50g GCT and subsequently a 75g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with IADPSG could be an alternative to reduce the need for an OGTT. However, to have an acceptable sensitivity to screen for GDM with the IADPSG criteria, the threshold of the GCT should be lowered from 7.8 to 7.2 mmol/L. A pragmatic approach to screen for GDM can be implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic, using fasting plasma glucose (FPG), HbA1c or even random plasma glucose (RPG) to reduce the number of OGTTs needed.

This study shows a pool testing method named Conditional Cluster Sampling (CCS) that utilizes soft computing and data analysis techniques to reduce the expense of total testing equipment. The proposed method also demonstrates its effectiveness compared to the traditional individual testing method. Firstly, according to patients symptoms and severity of their conditions, they are classified into four classes- Minor, Moderate, Major, Critical. After that Random Forest Classifier (RFC) is used to predict the class. Then random sampling is done from each class according to CCS. Finally, using Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) for 100 cycles, the effectiveness of CCS is demonstrated for different probability levels of infection.

RESULTS (1) Chest X-ray image: among 45 cases, 23 were common type: the time to appearance of unilateral patched shadow of the lung were 2 to 5 (2.9 +/- 1.0) days. The time to appearance of bilateral patched shadow of the lungs were 2 to 12 (6.9 +/- 2.5) days. The time to appearance of ground glass or consolidation in the lung were 6 to 19 (11.0 +/- 2.0) days. The time to the beginning of absorption of X-ray changes were 10 to 21 (15.0 +/- 4.1) days. The time for chest X-ray image to be absorbed completely were 18 to 46 (25.9 +/- 7.2) days. Twenty-two patients were severe type, in which the time to the appearance of ground glass of the lung were (9.0 +/- 3.2) days, with no significant difference when compared with common type (P < 0.05). However, the time to the beginning of absorption and complete absorption were (19.0 +/- 4.6) days (P = 0.009) and (36.0 +/- 8.1) days (P = 0.001), respectively.

The chlorophyll-a was used as bio indicators of nutrient contents related to the anthropogenic activities in the coast. The study was conducted in the Jakarta coast considering that this coast was surrounded by populated cities with total population equal to 16 million people. The chlorophyll-a was measured in mg/m3 and monitored using remote sensing data from January to April 2020 representing the period before and after the implementation of social distancing. The determinant environmental factor measured was sea surface temperature (0C). The study considered that there were reductions of levels and areas of chlorophyll-a in the coast. The chlorophyll-a levels were reduced from January to April (p<0.05). The chlorophyll-a levels for January, February, March, and April were 7.36 mg/m3 (95%CI: 6.34-8.37), 7.90 mg/m3 (95%CI: 7.32-8.47), 6.52 mg/m3 (95%CI: 5.37-7.66), and 4.21 mg/m3 (95%CI: 3.34-5.07) respectively.

METHODS: Five randomized controlled trials enrolling 212 participants were included. The mean difference (MD) was calculated as the effect size measurement. Meta-analyses were completed for each of the eight SF-36 domains. RESULTS: Relative to control groups, vibration training is more effective in improving five QOL domains: physical function (MD = 15.61, p < 0.001), physical role limitations (MD = 12.71, p = 0.001), general health (MD = 10.59, p < 0.001), social function (MD = 11.60, p < 0.001), and vitality (MD = 6.86, p = 0.002). Vibration training may not lead to greater improvements for the other three domains (MD = 0.13C3.25, p values = 0.21C0.96) than the control groups.

EDs are a frequent access point to the Portuguese health system. Previous studies have shown that patients may avoid visiting ED during the pandemic. This study aims to identify factors associated with avoidance of ED visits in Portugal during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We used data from a community-based survey, COVID-19 Barometer: Social Opinion, which includes healthcare utilisation, health status, and risk perception in Portugal from 11th April 2020 to 16th April 2021. We included respondents that reported having needed ED care. Data were collected on sociodemographics, health status (comorbidities, mental health), risk perception (COVID-19 and complications), level of trust in health services and self-assessment of the severity of the reason for ED visit. The outcome of interest was the decision to avoid ED care. We used logistic regression to identify factors associated with the decision to avoid ED. Results Preliminary data showed that 914 respondents reported needing ED care (74.8% female;mean age 43 years). From those, 224 (25%) decided to avoid ED care. ED visits avoidance was higher during lockdowns (28%). People reporting specific comorbidities (cardiac, autoimmune, respiratory) avoided ED more than those without them. Perception of no severe reason for ED visit, poor mental health, perception of higher risk of COVID-19 and complications, and low trust in health services response to the pandemic were associated with higher odds of ED visit avoidance. Conclusions People avoiding ED visits represented a considerable share. The decision to avoid ED visit was associated with clinical characteristics, but the perception of risk and assessment of the context and health system response also played a role in decision making.

Selective cerebral hypothermia applied early, prior to and during endovascular mechanical recanalization therapy, may be beneficial in the critical phase of reperfusion. We aimed to assess the feasibility of a new intracarotid cooling catheter in an animal model. MATERIALS AND METHODS Nine adult sheep were included. Temperature probes were introduced into the frontal and temporal brain cortices bilaterally. The cooling catheter system was introduced into a common carotid artery. Selective blood cooling was applied for 180 minutes. Systemic and local brain temperatures were measured during cooling and rewarming. Common carotid artery diameters and flow were measured angiographically and by Doppler sonography. RESULTS The common carotid artery diameter was between 6.7 and 7.3 mm. Common carotid artery blood flow velocities increased moderately during cooling and after catheter removal. Maximum cerebral cooling in the ipsilateral temporal cortex was -4.7C (95% CI, -5.1 to -4.0C). Ipsilateral brain temperatures dropped significantly faster and became lower compared with the contralateral cortex with maximum temperature difference of -1.3C (95% CI, -1.5 to -1.0C; P < .0001) and compared with systemic temperature (-1.4C; 95% CI, -1.7 to -1.0C; P < .0001).

As ligation, clipping, or suturing of blood vessels is time-consuming and numerous instrument changes are required, the primary aim of this randomized controlled trial was to assess whether LigaSure Impact? exhibits benefits over named conventional dissection techniques in patients undergoing pylorus-preserving partial pancreatoduodenectomy. METHODS This single-institution, randomized, superiority trial was performed between September 27, 2009, and February 24, 2012. Patients undergoing pylorus-preserving partial pancreatoduodenectomy were allocated to the study arms in a 1:1 ratio based on an unstratified block randomization with random block sizes to receive either dissection with LigaSure Impact? or conventional dissection. The primary endpoint was operation time. Secondary endpoints included peri- and postoperative morbidity and mortality, intraoperative blood loss, and length of hospital stay. To observe a time reduction of 40 min, 51 patients per arm were required. The primary analysis was the intention to treat. RESULTS The mean operation time did not differ between the Ligasure Impact? (308 min; SD: 56 min; range: 155-455 min) and the conventional dissection (318 min; SD: 90 min, range: 175-550 min) (p = 0.531). Moreover, LigaSure Impact? dissection did not show significant advantages over conventional dissection in terms of peri- and postoperative morbidity and mortality, intraoperative blood loss, or length of hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS The application of LigaSure Impact? dissection in pylorus-preserving partial pancreatoduodenectomy does not increase effectiveness and safety of dissection.

METHODS A total of 1732 males aged 16-24 years old in the placebo arm of a quadrivalent HPV vaccine trial were included in this analysis. Participants were enrolled from 18 countries in Africa, the Asia-Pacific region, Europe, Latin America, and North America. Subjects underwent anogenital examinations and sampling of the penis, scrotum, and perineal/perianal regions. RESULTS The incidence rate of any HPV DNA genotype 6, 11, 16, and/or 18 detection was 9.0 cases per 100 person-years. Rates of HPV DNA detection were highest in men from Africa. Median time to clearance of HPV genotypes 6, 11, 16, and 18 DNA was 6.1, 6.1, 7.7, and 6.2 months, respectively. Median time to clearance of persistently detected HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 DNA was 6.7, 3.2, 9.2, and 4.7 months, respectively. CONCLUSION The study results suggest that the acquisition of HPV 6, 11, 16, and/or 18 in males is common and that many of these so-called infections are subsequently cleared, similar to findings for women. Nevertheless, given the high rate of HPV detection among young men, HPV vaccination of males may reduce infection in men and reduce the overall burden of HPV-associated disease in the community.","output":"Incidence, clearance, and disease progression of genital human papillomavirus infection in heterosexual men."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding of cancer with the help of ever-expanding cutting edge technological tools and bioinformatics is revolutionizing modern cancer research by broadening the space of discovery window of various genomic and epigenomic processes. Genomics data integrated with multi-omics layering have advanced cancer research. Uncovering such layers of genetic mutations/modifications, epigenetic regulation and their role in the complex pathophysiology of cancer progression could lead to novel therapeutic interventions. Although a plethora of literature is available in public domain defining the role of various tumor driver gene mutations, understanding of epigenetic regulation of cancer is still emerging. This review focuses on epigenetic regulation association with the pathogenesis of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC). NMSC has higher prevalence in Caucasian populations compared to other races. Due to lack of proper reporting to cancer registries, the incidence rates for NMSC worldwide cannot be accurately estimated. However, this is the most common neoplasm in humans, and millions of new cases per year are reported in the United States alone. In organ transplant recipients, the incidence of NMSC particularly of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is very high and these SCCs frequently become metastatic and lethal. Understanding of solar ultraviolet (UV) light-induced damage and impaired DNA repair process leading to DNA mutations and nuclear instability provide an insight into the pathogenesis of metastatic neoplasm. This review discusses the recent advances in the field of epigenetics of NMSCs. Particularly, the role of DNA methylation, histone hyperacetylation and non-coding RNA such as long-chain noncoding (lnc) RNAs, circular RNAs and miRNA in the disease progression are summarized.","output":"Epigenetic Regulation in the Pathogenesis of Non-melanoma Skin Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become a major world health problem. All U.S. states have advised their cystic fibrosis (CF) populations to socially isolate. Major health care payors such as Medicare and most private insurance companies have agreed to reimburse health care providers for telemedicine and telephone visits. Methods: The CF adult team at the University of Virginia (UVA) transitioned from face-to-face clinics to multidisciplinary telemedicine clinics by using WebEx? (Cisco Systems, San Jose, CA), a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) compliant platform. Interventions: Patients were contacted before scheduled visits and triaged into: (1) patients eligible for the multidisciplinary telemedicine clinic, (2) patients to be seen in clinic urgently due to acute needs, and (3) stable patients who can be rescheduled at a later time. Ineligible patients for the telemedicine clinic due to lack of access to technology were followed up via telephone. Results: A total of 63 patients were scheduled to be seen in the UVA clinic over 4 weeks, 10 clinic days. Of these patients, 20 (32%) rescheduled their appointment. In addition, 2 patients (3%) were seen in clinic for acute needs and 38 (60%) were seen by the multidisciplinary team through telemedicine. Conclusions: In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, implementing a telemedicine clinic process that serves the needs of a multidisciplinary care team is paramount to preserving the CF care model. Through a systematic design and test process, a feasible and sustainable program was created that can be utilized by other multidisciplinary programs to adapt to their context.","output":"A Feasibility Study of Urgent Implementation of Cystic Fibrosis Multidisciplinary Telemedicine Clinic in the Face of COVID-19 Pandemic: Single-Center Experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the beginning of the current pandemic our journal has published a series of important mechanistic and clinical reports of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) aimed to keep our readership up-to-date on all relevant developments in this world-wide crisis (1).

A global background network was constructed after retrieving lncRNA-miRNA and miRNA-mRNA pairs from the lncRNASNP2, miRTarBase and StarBase databases. Based on gene expression profiles from ovarian granulosa cells from PCOS patients and controls in the GEOs GSE95728 dataset, the PCLMN was then constructed by applying hypergeometric testing. Using topological analysis, we identified 3 lncRNAs (LINC00667, AC073172.1 and H19) ranking within the top-ten gene lists for all three centrality measures. We then explored their subcellular localization, performed functional module analyses, and identified 4 sex hormone-related transcription factors as potential regulators of their expression. Significant associations with inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis-related processes and pathways were revealed for the key lncRNAs in our PCMLN.

The COVID-19 epidemic has expanded dramatically. The epidemic lockdown of COVID-19 affected air quality due to severe changes in human behavior. Recent research shows that air quality has improved during the COVID-19 pandemic due to social lockdown measures. Africa can avoid outbreaks of respiratory diseases, including COVID-19, with cleaner air. However, monitoring air pollution over the continent has required complex efforts to track air quality due to policies, borders, and the continent's nature. Now, satellite data can monitor air quality in cities and countries and bridge the gap in African countries without ground sensors. This paper examines the impact of lockdown on COVID-19 on air pollution in Africa. This study included measurements of the total column concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) from the tropospheric monitoring instrument (TROPOMI) on the Sentinel-5 precursor satellite. This study analyzed the global carbon dioxide concentration in Africa before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic from 15 March to 6 June 2019 and 2020. The results here indicate a small decrease in the CO levels because more than nine hundred million people in Africa depend on energy sources polluted for household uses, resulting from woodburning, kerosene, and charcoal. Many millions of people in Africa live in small crowded houses, bad ventilation and building materials. These dangers cause rising air pollution. ?

FS is a vital and indispensable technique that enables the model to perform faster, eliminate noisy data, remove redundancy, reduce overfitting, improve precision and increase generalization on testing data. While conventional FS techniques have been leveraged for classification tasks in the past few decades, they fail to optimally reduce the high dimensionality of the feature space of texts, thus breeding inefficient predictive models. Emerging technologies such as the metaheuristics and hyper-heuristics optimization methods provide a new paradigm for FS due to their efficiency in improving the accuracy of classification, computational demands, storage, as well as functioning seamlessly in solving complex optimization problems with less time. However, little details are known on best practices for case-to-case usage of emerging FS methods. The literature continues to be engulfed with clear and unclear findings in leveraging effective methods, which, if not performed accurately, alters precision, real-world-use feasibility, and the predictive model's overall performance.

In the past, medical students have often prepared for such exams through in-person peer-assisted learning (PAL), however, due to the recent Covid-19 pandemic, many in-person teaching sessions transitioned to online-based formats. There is currently a paucity of research on the utility of virtual PAL OSCE sessions and thus, we carried out a national pilot study to determine the effectiveness of virtual OSCE teaching via feedback from participants and examiners. Methods: A total of 85 students attended from 19 UK-based medical schools with eight students based internationally attended the series of online OSCE workshops delivered via Zoom ? . All students and examiners completed a feedback questionnaire at the end of each session regarding parameters, which included questions on pre-and post-workshop confidence in three OSCE domains: history-taking, communication and data interpretation. The five-point Likert scale was used to self-report confidence, and the results were analysed using the Mann-Whitney U test after assessing for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Results: Results from student feedback showed an increase in confidence for all three OSCE domains after each event (p<0.001) with 69.4% agreeing or strongly agreeing that online OSCE sessions could sufficiently prepare them for in-person exams. Questionnaire feedback revealed that 97.6% of students and 86.7% of examiners agreed that virtual OSCE teaching would be useful for preparing for in-person OSCE examinations after the pandemic. Conclusion: The majority of participants in the virtual OSCE sessions reported an improvement in their confidence in history-taking, communication and data interpretation skills. The majority of participants and examiners also reported that they found virtual OSCE sessions to be as engaging and as interactive as in-person teaching. This study has demonstrated that virtual OSCE workshops can serve as a valuable learning resource for students with the potential to be beneficial beyond the pandemic, however, further studies that directly compare academic outcomes between in-person and virtual OSCE teaching sessions are required.","output":"Assessing the utility of virtual OSCE sessions as an educational tool: a national pilot study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The study aim was to describe conditions seen 'out-of-hours' in equine practice. METHODS This was a retrospective case series of first opinion 'out-of-hours' cases seen at two equine practices between 2011 and 2013. Data were retrieved on case presentation, diagnostic testing, treatment administered and outcome, and diseases categorised using a systems-based coding system. A hierarchical logistic regression, formulated using a generalised linear model, was used to identify clinical variables associated with a binary outcome of 'critical' cases (required hospitalisation or euthanasia or died). RESULTS Data from 2602 cases were analysed. The most common reasons for 'out-of-hours' visits were colic (35 per cent, n=923/2620), wounds (20 per cent, n=511/2620) and lameness (11 per cent, n=288/2,620). The majority of cases required a single treatment (58 per cent, n=1475/2550), 26 per cent (n=656/2550) needed multiple treatments and 13 per cent (n=339/2550) were euthanased. Eighteen per cent (n=480/2602) of cases had a critical outcome.

After a half century of military dictatorship, a decade of much-lauded democratic opening (2011C20) prior to the coup had ushered in game-changing developments to the media landscape. Yet since the coup, the junta and its appointed State Administrative Council (SAC) have inflicted the kinds of brutalities in response to peaceful protesters that the military has used for decades with impunity against the countrys ethnic minorities, all justified, they claim, to ensure the rule of law and law and order. The SAC has also attempted complete control over Myanmars media, cutting off at various times nearly all internet and mobile access. This included Facebook, Twitter and other apps, thereby silencing the countrys independent media or forcing them into forms of self-censorship, hiding or exile, and allowing only a military-controlled narrative of unfolding events through military- and state-run media.

Patients were grouped according to the date of \\"patient 1's\\" diagnosis in Italy: preCOVID versus COVID. Clinico-pathological and outcome differences between the two groups were analyzed. RESULTS A total of 632 patients were included in the analysis (205 in the COVID group). The cT4 weighted ratios were higher in 2020 from April to September, with the greatest differences in May, August and September. The cM+ weighted ratio was significantly higher in July 2020.

For example, Internet of Drones (IoD), a new communication paradigm offering fundamental navigation assistance and access to information, has widespread applications ranging from agricultural drones in farming to surveillance drones in the COVID-19 pandemic. The increasingly prominent role of IoD in our society also reinforces the importance of securing such systems against various data privacy and security threats. Operationally, it can be challenging to adopt conventional off-the-shelf security products in an IoD system due to the underpinning characteristics of drones (e.g., dynamic and open communication channel). Therefore, in this paper we propose a lightweight and privacy-preserving mutual authentication and key agreement protocol, hereafter referred to as PMAP. The latter uses physical unclonable function (PUF) and chaotic system to support mutual authentication and establish a secure session key between communication entities in the IoD system. To be specific, PMAP consists of two schemes, namely: PMAPD2Z (that mutually authenticates drone and Zone Service Provider (ZSP) and establishes secure session keys) and PMAPD2D (that mutually authenticates drones and establishes secure session keys). In addition, PMAP supports conditional privacy-preserving so that the genuine identity of drones can only be revealed by trusted ZSPs. We evaluate the security of PMAP using AVISPA, as well as provide formal and informal security analysis to show the resilience of PMAP against various security attacks. We also evaluate the performance of PMAP through extensive experiments and compare its performance with existing AKA and IBE-Lite schemes, whose findings show that PMAP achieves better performance in terms of computation cost, energy consumption, and communication overhead.

To describe patient/parent anxiety regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection in this cohort. DESIGN: A prospective observational cohort study. SETTING: 46 centres across the UK between 16 March and 4 July 2020. A weekly online questionnaire based on the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections Consortium-WHO Case Report Form was used to collect participant reported data on symptoms, test results, National Health Service attendance, hospital admission and impact on daily life. PARTICIPANTS: 1490 immunocompromised children, defined as those requiring an annual influenza vaccination due to their underlying condition or medication. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of SARS-CoV-2-like symptoms and patient/parent anxiety score. RESULTS: Over 16 weeks during the first wave of the pandemic, no SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed in this large immunocompromised paediatric cohort (median age 11 years, 54.4% female). 110 symptomatic participants underwent a test for SARS-CoV-2; all were negative. 922 (67.4%) participants reported at least one symptom consistent with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection over the study period. 476 (34.8%) reported three or more symptoms. The most frequently reported symptoms included joint pain, fatigue, headache, nausea and muscle pain. SARS-CoV-2 testing during this period was performed on admitted patients only. 137 participants had their medication suspended or changed during the study period due to assumed COVID-19 disease risk. 62% reported high levels of anxiety (scores of 7C10 out of 10) at the start of the study, with anxiety levels remaining high throughout the study period.

RESULTS: The use of both the internet and mobile devices (smartphones, tablets) increased from 2009 to 2019: in 2009, 37.8% of the respondents used the internet, rising to 74.2% in 2019; however, people over 80 years old used these technologies less frequently. Although more and different internet resources were being used in 2019 than in 2009, the reasons given for not using the internet were similar and included security concerns, claims that using the internet is too complicated and the belief that learning to use it is too difficult. There has also been little change in the attitudes toward technology and the factors explaining internet use.

Anticipating the future widespread use of COVID-19 testing in dental offices, the authors wrote this article as a proactive effort to provide dental health care providers with current and necessary information surrounding the topic. METHODS: The authors consulted all relevant and current guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Food and Drug Administration, as well as online resources and review articles. RESULTS: Routine COVID-19 screening and triage protocols are unable to detect all infected people. With the advancements in diagnostic tools and techniques, COVID-19 testing at home or in the dental office may provide dentists with the ability to evaluate the disease status of their patients. At-home or point-of-care (POC) tests, providing results within minutes of being administered, would allow for appropriate measures and rapid decisions about dental patients' care process. In this review, the authors provide information about available laboratory and POC COVID-19 screening methods and identify and elaborate on the options available for use by dentists as well as the regulatory requirements of test administration. CONCLUSIONS: Dentists need to be familiar with COVID-19 POC testing options. In addition to contributing to public health, such tests may deliver rapid, accurate, and actionable results to clinical and infection control teams to enhance the safe patient flow in dental practices. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Oral health care must continue to offer safety in this or any future pandemics. Testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at the POC offers a control mechanism contributing to and enhancing the real and perceived safety of care in the dental office setting.","output":"Testing for COVID-19 in dental offices: Mechanism of action, application, and interpretation of laboratory and point-of-care screening tests"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Balancing selection is an important adaptive mechanism underpinning a wide range of phenotypes. Despite its relevance, the detection of recent balancing selection from genomic data is challenging as its signatures are qualitatively similar to those left by ongoing positive selection. In this study we developed and implemented two deep neural networks and tested their performance to predict loci under recent selection, either due to balancing selection or incomplete sweep, from population genomic data. Specifically, we generated forward-intime simulations to train and test an artificial neural network (ANN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN). ANN received as input multiple summary statistics calculated on the locus of interest, while CNN was applied directly on the matrix of haplotypes. We found that both architectures have high accuracy to identify loci under recent selection. CNN generally outperformed ANN to distinguish between signals of balancing selection and incomplete sweep and was less affected by incorrect training data. We deployed both trained networks on neutral genomic regions in European populations and demonstrated a lower false positive rate for CNN than ANN. We finally deployed CNN within the MEFV gene region and identified several common variants predicted to be under incomplete sweep in a European population. Notably, two of these variants are functional changes and could modulate susceptibility to Familial Mediterranean Fever, possibly as a consequence of past adaptation to pathogens. In conclusion, deep neural networks were able to characterise signals of selection on intermediate-frequency variants, an analysis currently inaccessible by commonly used strategies.","output":"Distinguishing between recent balancing selection and incomplete sweep using deep neural networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The use of large and diverse amounts of data (Big Data) can lead to the gaining of health-related insights.

OBJECTIVES: The study examines how experts in the field of health data analysis assess the potential of Big Data in health promotion and prevention, especially for research on vulnerable groups. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a Delphi study, experts were surveyed in two rounds using an online questionnaire to identify consensus and dissent on the potential of Big Data. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: From the experts point of view, Big Data holds potential for health promotion and prevention, especially in the clinical setting and in the personalization of health-related measures. People with rare diseases and older people could benefit from Big Data analyses, for example through faster diagnostic processes or personalized digital health applications.

In addition, the cytotoxicity of the drugs was evaluated. The findings showed that the combination of ketotifen with indomethacin (SJP-002C) or naproxen both reduce viral yield. Compared to ketotifen alone (60% inhibition at EC50), an increase in percentage inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 to 79%, 83% and 93% was found when co-administered with 25, 50 and 100 M indomethacin, respectively.

However, the effects of consecutive hypoxic culture on immunomodulatory function of the MSCs secretome are largely unclarified. Here, we intend to investigate the effects of consecutive hypoxia on therapeutic efficacy of conditioned medium derived from MSCs (MSCs-CM) in alleviating ALI. Human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) were consecutively cultured in 21% O(2) (Nor-MSCs) or in 1% O(2) (Hypo-MSCs) from passage 0. Their conditioned medium (Nor-CM and Hypo-CM respectively) was collected and administered into ALI models. Our findings confirmed that Hypo-MSCs exhibited increased proliferation ability and decreased cell senescence compared with Nor-MSCs. Consecutive hypoxia promoted UC-MSCs to secrete immunomodulatory cytokines, such as insulin-like growth factor 1(IGF1), IL10, TNF-stimulated gene 6(TSG6), TGF, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Both Nor-CM and Hypo-CM could effectively limit lung inflammation, promote efferocytosis and modulate anti-inflammatory polarization of lung macrophages in ALI models. Moreover, the effects of Hypo-CM were more potent than Nor-CM. Taken together, our findings indicate that consecutive hypoxic cultures could not only promote both proliferation and quality of UC-MSCs, but also enhance the therapeutic efficacy of their secretome in mitigating lung inflammation by promoting efferocytosis and anti-inflammatory polarization of macrophages.","output":"Secretome of Mesenchymal Stem Cells from Consecutive Hypoxic Cultures Promotes Resolution of Lung Inflammation by Reprogramming Anti-Inflammatory Macrophages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this data article, we provide a collection of 3,925,366 tweets and 18,413 online news around the online discussion about COVID-19 in Brazil The data from Twitter were collected through Twitterscraper Python library and we considered a set of keywords in Portuguese regarding to COVID-19 In order to facilitate the identification of tweets that have hashtags, media and retweets for researchers or data enthusiasts, we created three specific datasets for each of these categories The news on COVID-19 was collected from the UOL portal, the most popular Brazilian website All the data were gathered from January to May, 2020 These datasets can attract the attention from communities such as data science, social science, natural language processing, tourism, infodemiology, and public health","output":"A First Public Dataset from Brazilian Twitter and News on COVID-19 in Portuguese"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In less than 6 months, COVID-19 spread rapidly around the world and became a global health concern.

RESULTS: Of the 8288 results found, 39 studies were included for data extraction and analysis. Included articles were classified into one of three categories: research studies, review articles or clinical guidelines. Data extraction followed appropriate protocols depending on the classification of each article (e.g. PRISMA for review articles). Articles were assessed for risk of bias and certainty of evidence using the GRADE system. Six behaviours were identified as aerosol generating. These were classified into three categories: vegetative acts (coughing, breathing), verbal communication activities of daily living (speaking, loud voicing), and performance-based tasks (singing, sustained phonation). Certainty of evidence ranged from very low to moderate with variation in research design and variables. CONCLUSIONS: This body of literature helped to both identify and categorise the aerosol-generating behaviours involved in speech pathology clinical practice and confirm the low level of evidence throughout the speech pathology literature pertaining to aerosol generation.

The BCoV S protein plays a fundamental role in viral attachment and entry into the host cell, and is cleaved into two subunits termed S1 (amino terminal) and S2 (carboxy terminal). The present study describes a strategy for the sequencing of the BCoV S1 gene directly from fecal diarrheic specimens that were previously identified as BCoV positive by RT-PCR assay for N gene detection. A consensus sequence of 2681 nucleotides was obtained through direct sequencing of seven overlapping PCR fragments of the S gene. The samples did not undergo cell culture passage prior to PCR amplification and sequencing. The structural analysis was based on the genomic differences between Brazilian strains and other known BCoV from different geographical regions. The phylogenetic analysis of the entire S1 gene showed that the BCoV Brazilian strains were more distant from the Mebus strain (97.8% identity for nucleotides and 96.8% identity for amino acids) and more similar to the BCoV-ENT strain (98.7% for nucleotides and 98.7% for amino acids). Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the hypervariable region of the S1 subunit, these strains clustered with the American (BCoV-ENT, 182NS) and Canadian (BCQ20, BCQ2070, BCQ9, BCQ571, BCQ1523) calf diarrhea and the Canadian winter dysentery (BCQ7373, BCQ2590) strains, but clustered on a separate branch of the Korean and respiratory BCoV strains. The BCoV strains of the present study were not clustered in the same branch of previously published Brazilian strains (AY606193, AY606194). These data agree with the genealogical construction and suggest that at least two different BCoV strains are circulating in Brazil.","output":"Molecular analysis of the bovine coronavirus S1 gene by direct sequencing of diarrheic fecal specimens."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An update on the African swine fever (ASF) situation in the 10 affected Member States (MS) in the EU and in two neighbouring countries from the 1 September 2019 until the 31 August 2020 is provided. The dynamics of the proportions of PCR\\\\ and ELISA\\\\positive samples since the first ASF detection in the country were provided and seasonal patterns were investigated. The impact of the ASF epidemic on the annual numbers of hunted wild boar in each affected MS was investigated. To evaluate differences in the extent of spread of ASF in the wild boar populations, the number of notifications that could be classified as secondary cases to a single source was calculated for each affected MS and compared for the earliest and latest year of the epidemic in the country. To evaluate possible risk factors for the occurrence of ASFV in wild boar or domestic pigs, a literature review was performed. Risk factors for the occurrence of ASF in wild boar in Romanian hunting grounds in 2019 were identified with a generalised linear model. The probability to find at least one PCR\\\\confirmed ASF case in wild boar in a hunting ground in Romania was driven by environmental factors, wild boar abundance and the density of backyard pigs in the hunting ground area, while hunting\\\\related variables were not retained in the final model. Finally, measures implemented in white zones (ASF\\\\free zones that are geographically adjacent to an area where ASF is present in wild boar) to prevent further spread of ASF were analysed with a spatially, explicit stochastic individual\\\\based model. To be effective, the wild boar population in the white zone would need to be drastically reduced before ASF arrives at the zone and it must be wide enough. To achieve the necessary pre\\\\emptive culling targets of wild boar in the white zone, at the start of the establishment, the white zone should be placed sufficiently far from the affected area, considering the speed of the natural spread of the disease. This spread is faster in denser wild boar populations. After a focal ASF introduction, the white zone is always close to the infection hence pre\\\\emptive culling measures in the white zone must be completed in short term, i.e. in a few months.","output":"Epidemiological analysis of African swine fever in the European Union (September 2019 to August 2020)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and poses a great threat to epidemic control and prevention. The possibility of fecal-oral transmission has attracted increasing concern. However, viral shedding in feces has not been completely investigated. METHODS: This study retrospectively reviewed 97 confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients hospitalized at the First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, from January 19 to February 17, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 RNA in samples of sputum, nasopharyngeal or throat swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage and feces was detected by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTCPCR). Clinical characteristics and parameters were compared between groups to determine whether fecal RNA was positive. RESULTS: Thirty-four (35.1%) of the patients showed detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in feces, and 63 (64.9%) had negative detection results. The median time of viral shedding in feces was approximately 25 days, with the maximum time reaching 33 days. Prolonged fecal-shedding patients showed longer hospital stays. Those patients for whom fecal viral positivity persisted longer than 3 weeks also had lower plasma B-cell counts than those patients in the non-prolonged group [70.5 (47.3-121.5) per L vs. 186.5 (129.3-376.0) per L, P = 0.023]. Correlation analysis found that the duration of fecal shedding was positively related to the duration of respiratory viral shedding (R = 0.70, P < 0.001) and negatively related to peripheral B-cell counts (R = -0.44, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients who shed SARS-CoV-2 RNA in feces presented similar clinical characteristics and outcomes as those who did not shed SARS-CoV-2 RNA in feces. The prolonged presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids in feces was highly correlated with the prolonged shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the respiratory tract and with lower plasma B-cell counts.","output":"Characteristics of COVID-19 Patients With SARS-CoV-2 Positivity in Feces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Screening for COVID-19 exposure, coupled with engaged decision making to prioritize cancer treatment in parallel with reducing risk of exposure and infection, is crucial in the management of COVID-19 during cancer treatment. Following two reported case studies of imaging findings during daily computed tomography (CT) -based image guided radiotherapy scans, a call for submission of anonymized case reports was published with the objective of rapidly determining if there was a correlation between the onset of new pulmonary infiltrates seen during radiotherapy and COVID-19. We hereby report the results of the aggregate analysis. Methods Data of deidentified case reports for patients who developed biochemically confirmed COVID-19 during radiotherapy were submitted through an online portal. Information requested included a patients sex, age, cancer diagnosis and treatment, and COVID-19 diagnosis and outcome. Coplanar CT-based imaging was requested to demonstrate the presence or absence of ground glass opacities or infiltrates. Results A total of 7 reports were submitted from Turkey, Spain, Belgium, Egypt, and the United States. Results and imaging from the patients reported by Suppli et al. and McGinnis et al. were included for a total of 9 patients for analysis. All patients were confirmed COVID-19 positive using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based methods or nasopharyngeal swabs. Of the 9 patients analyzed, abnormalities consistent with ground glass opacities or infiltrates were observed in 8 patients. Conclusion This is the largest case series demonstrating the potential utility of CT-based image guidance during radiotherapy as a tool for identifying patients who need further workup for COVID-19. Considerations for reviewing image guidance for new pulmonary infiltrates, and immediate COVID-19 testing in patients who develop new infiltrates even without COVID-19 symptoms are strongly encouraged.","output":"Brief Report: New Pulmonary Infiltrates Observed on Computed Tomography Based Image Guidance for Radiotherapy Warrant Diagnostic Workup for COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fever screening based on infrared (IR) thermographs (IRTs) is an approach that has been implemented during infectious disease pandemics, such as Ebola and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. A recently published international standard indicates that regions medially adjacent to the inner canthi provide accurate estimates of core body temperature and are preferred sites for fever screening. Therefore, rapid, automated identification of the canthi regions within facial IR images may greatly facilitate rapid fever screening of asymptomatic travelers. However, it is more difficult to accurately identify the canthi regions from IR images than from visible images that are rich with exploitable features. In this study, we developed and evaluated techniques for multi-modality image registration (MMIR) of simultaneously captured visible and IR facial images for fever screening. We used free form deformation (FFD) models based on edge maps to improve registration accuracy after an affine transformation. Two widely used FFD models in medical image registration based on the Demons and cubic B-spline algorithms were qualitatively compared. The results showed that the Demons algorithm outperformed the cubic B-spline algorithm, likely due to overfitting of outliers by the latter method. The quantitative measure of registration accuracy, obtained through selected control point correspondence, was within 2.8  1.2 mm, which enables accurate and automatic localization of canthi regions in the IR images for temperature measurement.","output":"Free-Form Deformation Approach for Registration of Visible and Infrared Facial Images in Fever Screening ?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rapid response services provide opportunities for older people living with frailty to remain in their own homes during an episode of deteriorating health.

Here by analyzing the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of COVID-19 patients through single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq), we found that in severe (or critical) cases, there is remarkable expansion of TM4SF1+ and KRT5+ lung progenitor cells. The two distinct populations of progenitor cells could play crucial roles in alveolar cell regeneration and epithelial barrier re-establishment, respectively. In order to understand the function of KRT5+ progenitors in vivo, we transplanted a single KRT5+ cell-derived cell population into damaged mouse lung. Time-course single-cell transcriptomic analysis showed that the transplanted KRT5+ progenitors could long-term engrafted into host lung and differentiate into HOPX+ OCLN+ alveolar barrier cell which restored the epithelial barrier and efficiently prevented inflammatory cell infiltration. Similar barrier cells were also identified in some COVID-19 patients with massive leukocyte infiltration.

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 exerts this anti-IFN activity. We found that SARS-CoV-2 Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function.

Following the stay-at-home order in our county, imaging volumes at our institution decreased to approximately 46% of baseline volumes, similar to the experience of other radiology practices. Given the substantial differences in severity and timing of the disease in different geographic regions, estimating resumption of radiology volumes will be one of the next major challenges for radiology practices. We hypothesize that there are 6 major variables that will likely predict radiology volumes: (1) severity of disease in the local region, including potential subsequent waves of infection, (2) lifting of government social distancing restrictions, (3) patient concern regarding risk of leaving home and entering imaging facilities, (4) management of pent up demand for imaging delayed during the acute phase of the pandemic, including institutional capacity, (5) impact of the economic downturn on health insurance and ability to pay for imaging, and (6) radiology practice profile reflecting amount of elective imaging performed, including type of patients seen by the radiology practice such as emergency/inpatient/outpatient mix and sub-specialty types.

This manuscript presents a novel method that predicts whether a patient will need admission to the ICU and assess the risk of in-hospital mortality by training a deep learning model that combines a set of clinical variables and features in the Chest-X-Rays. METHODS This was a prospective diagnostic test study. Patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 2020 and January 2021 were included. This study was designed to build predictive models obtained by training convolutional neural networks for Chest-X-ray images using an artificial intelligence (AI) tool and a Random Forest analysis to identify critical clinical variables. Then, both architectures were connected and fine-tuned to provide combined models. RESULTS A total of 2552 patients were included in the clinical cohort. The variables independently associated with ICU admission were age, the fraction of inspired oxygen - FiO2 on admission, dyspnoea on admission, and obesity. Moreover, the variables associated with hospital mortality were age, the fraction of inspired oxygen - FiO2 on admission, and dyspnoea. When implementing the AI model to interpret the Chest-X-rays and the clinical variable identified by random forest, we developed a model that accurately predicts ICU admission (AUC:0.920.04) and hospital mortality (AUC:0.810.06) in patients with confirmed COVID-19.

In the present study, the SARS-CoV-2 virus is mechanically simulated to obtain its deformation and natural frequencies. The virus under analysis is modeled on a viscoelastic spherical structure. The theory of shell structures in mechanics is used to derive the governing equations. Whereas the virus has nanometric size, using classical theories may give incorrect results. Consequently, the nonlocal elasticity theory is used to consider the effect of interatomic forces on the results. From the mechanical point of view, if a structure vibrates with a natural frequency specific to it, the resonance phenomenon will occur in that structure, leading to the destruction of the structure. Therefore, it is possible that the protein chains of SARS-CoV-2 would be destroyed by vibrating it at natural frequencies. Since the mechanical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are not clearly known due to the new emergence of this virus, deformation and natural frequencies are obtained in a specific interval. Researchers could also use this investigation as a pioneering study to find a non-vaccine treatment solution for the SARS-CoV-2 virus and various viruses, including HIV.","output":"On the deformation and frequency analyses of SARS-CoV-2 at nanoscale"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Effective treatment for COVID-19 remains elusive, though urgently needed in the current pandemic.

Recently following SARS-CoV-2 infection, a new, multisystem disease (paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome, PIMS) with fever was recognized in children with shock and multiorgan failure. On of the first Hungarian cases will be described. A 15-year-old boy was admitted to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit with persistent high fever, diffuse abdominal pain, septic shock, multiple organ failure, gloves- and socks-shaped cutan exanthema, conjunctivitis and laboratory signs of inflammation. Some weeks preceding his admission, symptoms of mild SARS-CoV-2 infection were revealed. At admission, the SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antigen tests were negative, however, the presence of IgG antibody was shown. Following complex supportive intensive care along with internationally recommended immunoglobulin, aspirin and steroid treatment, the patient was completely cured without any sequalae. In children after SARS-CoV-2 infection, PIMS could occur mimicking Kawasaki syndrome. At this time, in children virus PCR or antigen tests are usually negative already, but the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody could prove the preceding disease. Due to the increasing number of SARS-CoV-2 infections, the occurrence of post-SARS-CoV-2 PIMS in childhood is expected to increase. For paediatric patients, in case of severe septic state and multiple organ failure, PIMS should be also considered, which may require intensive care and targeted therapy. As far as we know, the described case is one of the earliest cases of PIMS in Hungary.

This portion of the Pacific Arctic includes four Distributed Biological Observatory (DBO) sampling regions. In the Bering Strait area, passive acoustic data showed marked declines in gray whale calling activity coincident with unprecedented wintertime sea ice loss there in 2017-2019, although some whales were seen there during DBO cruises in those years. In the northern Bering Sea, sightings during DBO cruises show changes in gray whale distribution coincident with a shrinking field of infaunal amphipods, with a significant decrease in prey abundance (r = -0.314, p<0.05) observed in the DBO 2 region over the 2010-2019 period. In the eastern Chukchi Sea, sightings during broad scale aerial surveys show that gray whale distribution is associated with localized areas of high infaunal crustacean abundance. Although infaunal crustacean prey abundance was unchanged in DBO regions 3, 4 and 5, a mid-decade shift in gray whale distribution corresponded to both: (i) a localized increase in infaunal prey abundance in DBO regions 4 and 5, and (ii) a correlation of whale relative abundance with wind patterns that can influence epi-benthic and pelagic prey availability. Specifically, in the northeastern Chukchi Sea, increased sighting rates (whales/km) associated with an ~110 km (60 nm) offshore shift in distribution was positively correlated with large scale and local wind patterns conducive to increased availability of krill. In the southern Chukchi Sea, gray whale distribution clustered in all years near an amphipod-krill 'hotspot' associated with a 50-60m deep trough. We discuss potential impacts of observed and inferred prey shifts on gray whale nutrition in the context of an ongoing unusual gray whale mortality event. To conclude, we use the conceptual Arctic Marine Pulses (AMP) model to frame hypotheses that may guide future research on whales in the Pacific Arctic marine ecosystem.","output":"Changes in gray whale phenology and distribution related to prey variability and ocean biophysics in the northern Bering and eastern Chukchi seas."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: Although Singapore was one of the first countries outside of China to be affected by COVID-19, for the first 2.5 months since its first reported case on January 23, 2020, it remained one of the few nations with successful containment of spread of the pandemic with little mortality and zero intra-hospital transmissions, without instituting a major lockdown of the country. In times of an infectious epidemic where medical subspecialties lead the frontline, a surgeon's role becomes rather vague. However, the only obstacle that stands in between the surgeon and fighting in the frontline of an infectious disease outbreak, is the traditional perception of what a surgeon can do. By presenting the strategies employed by our institution and its surgical unit, which remains the epicenter of the COVID-19 fight in Singapore, together with our medical counterparts, we hope to be able to improve our practices to respond and prevent the pandemic from escalating further as a collective community of surgeons across the globe. OBSERVATIONS: Contingencies should be in place for prioritization of existing patients, triaging and treatment of suspected patients, infection control, manpower management and novel strategies for inter-disciplinary communications and education in a hospital's surgical unit during a pandemic. Working in a high risk environment with manpower and resource limitations for prolonged periods of time has effect on morale and affects surgeon burn-out. Transparent communication, avenues to address psychological needs of surgeons and leadership by example are key strategies in ensuring a sustainable fight against the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: With the varies strategies implemented, every surgical discipline and every surgeon should be unified and place their desire to operate aside. There should not be any differentiation between surgeon and physician, but instead, everyone has to work together as one united health care front battling the common enemy - COVID-19.","output":"A surgeon's role in fighting a medical pandemic: Experiences from the unit at the epicentre of COVID-19 in Singapore - A cohort perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to apply the advanced error-trend-seasonal (ETS) framework to forecast the prevalence and mortality series of COVID-19 in the USA, the UK, Russia, and India, and the predictive performance of the ETS framework was compared with the most frequently used autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The prevalence and mortality data of COVID-19 in the USA, the UK, Russia, and India between 20 February 2020 and 15 May 2020 were extracted from the WHO website. Then, the data subsamples between 20 February 2020 and 3 May 2020 were treated as the training horizon, and the others were used as the testing horizon to construct the ARIMA models and the ETS models. RESULTS: Based on the model evaluation criteria, the ARIMA (0,2,1) and ETS (M,MD,N), sparse coefficient ARIMA (0,2,(1,6)) and ETS (A,AD,M), ARIMA (1,1,1) and ETS (A,MD,A), together with ARIMA (2,2,1) and ETS (A,M,A) specifications were identified as the preferred ARIMA and ETS models for the prevalence data in the USA, the UK, Russia, and India, respectively; the ARIMA (0,2,1) and ETS (M,A,M), ARIMA (0,2,1) and ETS (M,A,N), ARIMA (0,2,1) and ETS (A,A,N), coupled with ARIMA (0,2,2) and ETS (M,M,N) specifications were selected as the optimal ARIMA and ETS models for the mortality data in these four countries, respectively. Among these best-fitting models, the ETS models produced smaller forecasting error rates than the ARIMA models in all the datasets. CONCLUSION: The ETS framework can be used to nowcast and forecast the long-term temporal trends of the COVID-19 prevalence and mortality in the USA, the UK, Russia, and India, and which provides a notable performance improvement over the most frequently used ARIMA model.

Immunologic mechanisms are thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of SMPP. Therefore, the use of systemic glucocorticoids may have beneficial effects. However, to date, the use of glucocorticoid therapy in SMPP is limited to small case series, and the glucocorticoid dosage for children with SMPP has not been established. METHODS Here, we used a meta-analysis method to collect data from randomized control trials of different doses of methylprednisolone in SMPP to assess the safety and efficacy of treatment with low- versus high-dose methylprednisolone in children with SMPP. RESULTS We included 13 Chinese randomized control trials that included 1049 children. The high- and low-dose groups were comprised of 524 and 525 children, respectively. The high-dose group was significantly more effective than the low-dose group in clinical efficacy [risk ratio = 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.23, 1.38), P < 0.05]. In addition, compared with low-dose methylprednisolone, high-dose methylprednisolone significantly shortened hospital stays and antipyretic therapy, pulmonary rales disappearance, cough disappearance and pulmonary shadow absorption times. There was no significant difference in adverse events between the high- and low-dose groups: risk ratio= 0.85, 95% CI (0.53, 1.36), P > 0.05.

STUDY DESIGN: Experimental study. METHODS: Fresh 172 RRP tissue samples from 12 patients were implanted onto chick embryo CAMs. Morphological and morphometric analysis of the experimental CAM and chorionic epithelium was performed. The microvascular network of the CAM with the RRP implant was investigated under the effect of fluoresceinated anionic dextran. The peculiarities of the clinical course of the disease were evaluated. RESULTS: The implanted RRP tissue samples survived on CAMs in 86% of cases, retaining their essential morphologic characteristics and proliferative capacity of the original tumor. Implants induced thickening of both the CAM and the chorionic epithelium, but none of the RRP implants crossed the basement membrane of the hosting CAM. A \\"crawling film\\" of acellular material with newly formed papilloma sprouts located on the outer chorionic epithelium of the CAM was detected.

Chest CT, laboratory results, and clinical conditions of patients were concurrently identified. Only the first chest CT findings of patients were reviewed by 50 physicians and they were asked about their opinions on the laboratory results and clinical conditions of patients. Data were then compared with the real-time data. The efficacy of the first chest CT findings in diagnosis and treatment guidance was analyzed. Results: The simultaneous laboratory analyses of patients receiving mechanical ventilation support due to moderate-severe ARDS found a C-reactive protein of >40 mg/L in 72%, D-dimer was >1000 ng/mL and ferritin was >500 ng/mL in 57%, and lymphocyte count <800 L in 50% of patients. While 53% of participants proposed that patients would be treated in the ICU, 28.2% suggested the patients be treated in inpatient care. A total of 60.2% of participants stated that the patients suffered from moderate-severe ARDS based on CT findings.

Methods: The sample group included 241 patients (age, 30.25  12.2 years) with 568 microimplants. They were divided into the post-use (microimplants removed immediately after use or treatment) and post-retention (microimplants removed during the retention period) removal groups. The removal torque in both groups was assessed according to sex, age, placement site and method, and microimplant size. Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression analyses were performed for evaluating variables influencing the removal torque. Results: The mean period of total in-bone stay of microimplants in the postretention removal group (1,237 days) was approximately two times longer than that in the post-use removal group (656.28 days). The removal torques in the post-retention removal group (range, 4-5 N cm) were also higher than those in the post-use removal group. The mandible and pre-drilling groups demonstrated higher placement and removal torques than did the maxilla and no-drilling groups, respectively. In the no-drilling post-use removal group, the placement torque and microimplant length positively correlated with the removal torque. In the post-retention removal group, unloading in-bone stay period and microimplant diameter positively correlated with the removal torque in the no-drilling and pre-drilling methods, respectively. Conclusions: The removal torques differed according to the orthodontic loading and removal time of microimplants. With prolonged retention of microimplants inserted using the no-drilling method, the removal torque was clinically acceptable and positively correlated with the unloading in-bone stay period.","output":"Influence of late removal after treatment on the removal torque of microimplants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic was a reminder of the importance of increasing connectivity amidst the accelerated rate of changes and disruptive events of our era.

The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on VAE rates and characteristics is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To compare the incidence, causes, and outcomes of VAE during the Covid-19 pandemic year vs pre-pandemic years and amongst ventilated patients with and without Covid-19. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study of mechanically ventilated adults at four academic and community hospitals in Massachusetts, we compared VAE incidence rates between March 1-August 31 for each of 2017-2020 (corresponding to the timeframe of the pandemic first wave in 2020) and among Covid-19 positive and negative patients in 2020. The medical records of 200 randomly selected patients with VAEs in 2020 (100 with Covid-19, 100 without) were analyzed to compare conditions precipitating VAEs in patients with vs without Covid-19. RESULTS: VAEs per 100 episodes of mechanical ventilation were more common in 2020 vs prior years (11.2 vs 6.7, p<.01) but the rate of VAEs per 1000 ventilator-days was similar (14.2 vs 12.7, p=.08). VAEs were more frequent in Covid-19 positive vs negative patients within 2020 (29.0 vs. 7.1 per 100 ventilator episodes, p<.01 and 17.2 vs 12.2 per 1000 ventilator days, p<.01). Compared to non-Covid-19 patients with VAEs, Covid-19 patients with VAEs had similar rates of infection-related ventilator-associated complications, longer median duration of mechanical ventilation (22 vs 14 days, p<.01), and similar in-hospital mortality (30% vs 38%, p=.15). Progressive ARDS accounted for 53% of VAEs in Covid-19 patients versus 14% amongst non-Covid-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: VAE rates per 100 episodes of mechanical ventilation and per 1000 ventilator days were higher amongst Covid-19 positive versus negative patients. Over 50% of VAEs in Covid-19 patients were caused by progressive ARDS versus less than 15% in patients without Covid-19.

Yet launching and implementing trials with the rigor necessary to produce convincing results is a complicated and time-consuming process. Balancing rigor and efficiency involves relying on designs that employ flexible features to respond to a fast-changing landscape, measuring valid endpoints that result in translational actions and disseminating findings in a timely manner. We describe the challenges involved in creating infrastructure with potential utility for shared learning. METHODS: We have established a shared infrastructure that borrows strength across multiple trials. The infrastructure includes an endpoint registry to aid in selecting appropriate endpoints, a registry to facilitate establishing a Data & Safety Monitoring Board, common data collection instruments, a COVID-19 dedicated design and analysis team, and a pragmatic platform protocol, among other elements. RESULTS: The authors have relied on the shared infrastructure for six clinical trials for which they serve as the Data Coordinating Center and have a design and analysis team comprising 15 members who are dedicated to COVID-19. The authors established a pragmatic platform to simultaneously investigate multiple treatments for the outpatient with adaptive features to add or drop treatment arms. CONCLUSION: The shared infrastructure provides appealing opportunities to evaluate disease in a more robust manner with fewer resources and is especially valued during a pandemic where efficiency in time and resources is crucial. The most important element of the shared infrastructure is the pragmatic platform. While it may be the most challenging of the elements to establish, it may provide the greatest benefit to both patients and researchers.","output":"Clinical trials in a COVID-19 pandemic: Shared infrastructure for continuous learning in a rapidly changing landscape"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Public health measures such as physical distancing and work-from-home initiatives have been implemented to slow the spread of COVID-19. These measures may also be associated with unhealthy lifestyle behaviors, which could be particularly problematic for those already at highest risk for losing years of healthy life due to chronic disease (i.e., 30C59-year-olds). The purpose of this paper is two-fold: (1) to provide an overview of Ontario adults health behaviors (i.e., physical activity, sedentary behaviors, and dietary intake), mental health, and well-being during the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic (AprilCJuly 2020); and (2) to explore the difference between physical activity and various health behaviors (i.e., well-being, mental health, and dietary intake). METHODS: As a part of a larger, longitudinal study, participants completed an online survey that included demographic information, the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire, Starting the Conversation, the Mental Health Inventory, and the Personal Wellbeing Index-Adult. Data analyses involved computing measures of central tendency and dispersion for demographic characteristics and tools followed by descriptive statistics. Separate independent t-tests were conducted to investigate the difference between physical activity status and well-being, mental health, and dietary intake. RESULTS: A total of 2157 Ontarians completed an online survey. Descriptive statistics indicated that respondents met physical activity and sedentary behavior guidelines, reported double the amount of recommended recreational screen time, practiced moderately healthy dietary behaviors, experienced mental health problems, and scored below normal in some well-being domains. CONCLUSION: As the end of the COVID-19 pandemic is currently unknown, its associated restrictions and society changes may influence adults behaviors in both the short- and longer-term. As such, our findings might provide immediate insight into the development of timely and evidence-informed health promotion and disease prevention strategies for Canadians, which could support adults health behaviors, mental health, and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic and other, future pandemics.","output":"Ontario adults health behaviors, mental health, and overall well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This practice report shares the experiences of on-campus students enrolled in their second or third year of undergraduate business studies at Charles Sturt University, Australia as they moved to online study during the COVID-19 shutdowns.

Efforts are needed to develop rapid and accurate diagnostic tools for extensive testing allowing for effective containment of the infection, via timely identification and isolation of SARS-CoV-2 carriers. Current gold standard nucleic acid tests require many separate steps that need trained personnel to operate specialist instrumentation in laboratory environments, hampering turnaround time and test accessibility, especially in low-resource settings. We devised an integrated on-chip platform coupling RNA extraction based on immiscible filtration assisted by surface tension (IFAST), with RNA amplification and detection via colorimetric reverse-transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), using two sets of primers targeting open reading frame1a (ORF1a) and nucleoprotein (N) genes of SARS-CoV-2. Results were identified visually, with a colour change from pink to yellow indicating positive amplification, and further confirmed by DNA gel electrophoresis. The specificity of the assay was tested against HCoV-OC43 and H1N1 RNAs. The assay based on use of gene N primers was 100% specific to SARS-CoV-2 with no cross-reactivity to HCoV-OC43 nor H1N1. Proof-of-concept studies on water and artificial sputum containing genomic SARS-CoV-2 RNA showed our IFAST RT-LAMP device to be capable of extracting and detecting 470 SARS-CoV-2 copies mL-1 within 1 h (from sample-in to answer-out).

Survey items also assessed patients perspective of their telehealth experience. We performed univariate analysis to assess for any relationship between patient satisfaction and demographic and disease specific factors, and also collected qualitative responses regarding telehealth. Results 170 unique responses were collected. 35.8% of patients were satisfied with telehealth. When stratified into satisfied (n=61) and unsatisfied (n=109), female patients were exclusively unsatisfied with their experience (100% unsatisfied vs male patients 30% unsatisfied, p<0.01). The groups were similar in terms of age, travel burden, and disease severity. Qualitative responses focussed on the patients concerns being able to adequately express their symptoms and functional limitations. Conclusions Patients attending outpatient spinal consultation via telehealth reported a satisfaction rate of 35.8%. Female patients were less likely to be satisfied with telehealth.

The COVID-19 pandemic is testing the mental stability of all of us, and hence it is crucial to recognize the vulnerable population and support them to prevent or minimize the catastrophe like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), emotional trauma, and suicides. In this context, the role of psychiatrists, psychotherapists, and other mental healthcare providers is indispensable.","output":"Treatment of Patients with Mental Illness Amid A Global COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected almost every country worldwide, including all 22 Arab countries. We have been following the COVID-19 pandemic in all Arab countries since it started. In this review, we aimed to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 in the Arab world for twelve months and to compare these findings with other most affected countries. Methods: : World Health Organization, Worldometer and Ministries of Health websites were used to search for COVID-19 data in all Arab countries. The period was from February 2020 to February 2021. The data was analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 23. Results: : The median age in all Arab countries was 26.25. As of March 01, 2021, the total confirmed cases of COVID-19 in all Arab countries were 4,259,756. Iraq, Morocco, Jordan, United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia (SA) have the highest reported cases with, 695,489, 483,766, 391,090, 390,453 and 377,383, respectively. The total number of deaths were 72,950 cases and were dominant in Iraq, followed by Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia and SA with 13,406, 10736, 8637, 8022 and 6494, respectively. In comparison with the topmost affected countries, the data obtained from COVID-19 confirmed cases showed that Arab countries are ranked fourth after USA, India, and Brazil. In terms of total deaths per million, Arab countries come in the second last, before India, with only 165 cases. Conclusion: The number of confirmed and death cases among all Arab countries trigger vital worries about morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, respectively. However, younger population in the Arab world may contribute to the less death cases of COVID-19 in comparison with the topmost affected countries.","output":"One-year review of COVID-19 in the Arab world"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The influenza pandemic of 1918-1920, which killed 50 000 Canadians, spurred the creation of a federal department of public health. But in the intervening century, public health at all levels has remained, as Marc Lalonde put it in 1988, the \\"poor cousin\\" in the health care system (Lalonde 1988, p. 77). Punctuated by sporadic investment during infectious disease crises, such as polio in the early 1950s, public health is less of a priority as the cost of tertiary health interventions rises. While public health potentially involves a broad range of interventions, this paper focuses on the history of public health interventions around infectious disease. COVID-19 has forced us to relearn the importance of maintaining basic infectious/communicable disease control capacity and revealed the cost of our failure to do so. It has also drawn our attention to the intersection between social inequality, racism, and colonialism and vulnerability to disease. In addition to investing in our capacity to contain disease outbreaks as they occur, we must plan now for how to achieve greater health equity in the future by addressing underlying economic and social conditions and providing meaningful access to preventive care for all. This is how we build a truly resilient society. Governments at all levels have recognized the importance of social factors in shaping health and illness for decades. But greater health equity will result only from genuine action on this knowledge. Action will arise from public advocacy in support of prevention, and a new level of engagement and collaboration between affected individuals and communities, public health experts, and governments.","output":"Beyond the COVID-19 crisis: building on lost opportunities in the history of public health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team (ICCRT) concluded in a series of high-profile reports that lockdown had been the most effective non-pharmaceutical intervention in 11 European countries during the initial phase of the corona pandemic.

We found that the ICCRT modified the assumptions made in their model as more data became available in a way that maintained the conclusion that lockdown was most effective. These observations suggest that modeling of non-pharmaceutical interventions during an ongoing pandemic must be interpreted with caution as sources of error can be found both in the technical execution of the modeling and the assumptions made.

These negative effects in response to modern critical care have received increasing attention, especially during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Based on experimental and clinical studies from our group, it has been hypothesized that the ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and the release of factors systemically play a significant role in the pathogenesis of CIM and VIDD. Our previous experimental/clinical studies have focused on gene/protein expression and the effects on muscle structure and regulation of muscle contraction at the cell and motor protein levels. In the present study, we have extended our interest to alterations at the metabolomic level. An untargeted metabolomics approach was undertaken to study two respiratory muscles (diaphragm and intercostal muscle) and lung tissue in rats exposed to five days controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV). Metabolomic profiles in diaphragm, intercostal muscles and lung tissue were dramatically altered in response to CMV, most metabolites of which belongs to lipids and amino acids. Some metabolites may possess important biofunctions and play essential roles in the metabolic alterations, such as pyruvate, citrate, S-adenosylhomocysteine, alpha-ketoglutarate, glycerol, and cysteine. Metabolic pathway enrichment analysis identified pathway signatures of each tissue, such as decreased metabolites of dipeptides in diaphragm, increased metabolites of branch-chain amino acid metabolism and purine metabolism in intercostals, and increased metabolites of fatty acid metabolism in lung tissue. These metabolite alterations may be associated with an accelerated myofibrillar protein degradation in the two respiratory muscles, an active inflammatory response in all tissues, an attenuated energy production in two respiratory muscles, and enhanced energy production in lung. These results will lay the basis for future clinical studies in ICU patients and hopefully the discovery of biomarkers in early diagnosis and monitoring, as well as the identification of future therapeutic targets.","output":"Metabolomic Profiling of Respiratory Muscles and Lung in Response to Long-Term Controlled Mechanical Ventilation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccine hesitancy and other COVID-19-related concerns and complaints in the Philippines are evident on social media. It is important to identify these different topics and sentiments in order to gauge public opinion, use the insights to develop policies, and make necessary adjustments or actions to improve public image and reputation of the administering agency and the COVID-19 vaccines themselves. This paper proposes a semi-supervised machine learning pipeline to perform topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and an analysis of vaccine brand reputation to obtain an in-depth understanding of national public opinion of Filipinos on Facebook. The methodology makes use of a multilingual version of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers or BERT for topic modeling, hierarchical clustering, five different classifiers for sentiment analysis, and cosine similarity of BERT topic embeddings for vaccine brand reputation analysis. Results suggest that any type of COVID-19 misinformation is an emergent property of COVID-19 public opinion, and that the detection of COVID-19 misinformation can be an unsupervised task. Sentiment analysis aided by hierarchical clustering reveal that 21 of the 25 topics extrapolated by topic modeling are negative topics. Such negative comments spike in count whenever the Department of Health in the Philippines posts about the COVID-19 situation in other countries.

Nipah virus can be transmitted via person-to-person contact, posing a high risk for epidemic outbreaks. However, a broadly applicable approach for human NiV outbreaks in field settings is lacking. METHODS: We engineered new antiviral lipopeptides and analyzed in vitro fusion inhibition to identify an optimal candidate for prophylaxis of NiV infection in the lower respiratory tract, and we assessed antiviral efficiency in 2 different animal models. RESULTS: We show that lethal NiV infection can be prevented with lipopeptides delivered via the respiratory route in both hamsters and nonhuman primates. By targeting retention of peptides for NiV prophylaxis in the respiratory tract, we avoid its systemic delivery in individuals who need only prevention, and thus we increase the safety of treatment and enhance utility of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The experiments provide a proof of concept for the use of antifusion lipopeptides for prophylaxis of lethal NiV.

However, novel hematological parameters derived from high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) have rarely been studied as indicators for the risk of poor outcomes in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Here, we aimed to assess the prognostic value of these novel biomarkers in COVID-19 patients and the diabetes subgroup. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study involving all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from January to March 2020 in five hospitals in Wuhan, China. Demographics, clinical and laboratory findings, and outcomes were recorded. Neutrophil to HDL-C ratio (NHR), monocyte to HDL-C ratio (MHR), lymphocyte to HDL-C ratio (LHR), and platelet to HDL-C ratio (PHR) were investigated and compared in both the overall population and the subgroup with diabetes. The associations between blood parameters at admission with primary composite end-point events (including mechanical ventilation, admission to the intensive care unit, or death) were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to compare the utility of different blood parameters. RESULTS: Of 440 patients with COVID-19, 67 (15.2%) were critically ill. On admission, HDL-C concentration was decreased while NHR was high in patients with critical compared with non-critical COVID-19, and were independently associated with poor outcome as continuous variables in the overall population (HR: 0.213, 95% CI 0.090C0.507; HR: 1.066, 95% CI 1.030C1.103, respectively) after adjusting for confounding factors. Additionally, when HDL-C and NHR were examined as categorical variables, the HRs and 95% CIs for tertile 3 vs. tertile 1 were 0.280 (0.128C0.612) and 4.458 (1.817C10.938), respectively. Similar results were observed in the diabetes subgroup. ROC curves showed that the NHR had good performance in predicting worse outcomes. The cutoff point of the NHR was 5.50. However, the data in our present study could not confirm the possible predictive effect of LHR, MHR, and PHR on COVID-19 severity. CONCLUSION: Lower HDL-C concentrations and higher NHR at admission were observed in patients with critical COVID-19 than in those with noncritical COVID-19, and were significantly associated with a poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients as well as in the diabetes subgroup.","output":"Prognostic Value of Leucocyte to High-Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol Ratios in COVID-19 Patients and the Diabetes Subgroup"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This comment highlights the major civil or commercial (mostly contract) law provisions in 24 judicial documents newly released by the Supreme Peoples Court or High Peoples Courts in China in response to the outbreak of COVID-19 and assesses the significance of key changes to the pre-pandemic law It concludes by noting the increased role of the doctrine of the change of circumstances and the contract purpose test, the emphasis placed on consensual solutions (by way of mediation and contract renegotiation), and the flexibility and relatively clearer guidance afforded to lower courts in their adjudication of disputes arising in connection with COVID-19","output":"COVID-19 in Civil or Commercial Disputes: First Responses from Chinese Courts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As COVID-19 spreads throughout the world without a straightforward treatment or widespread vaccine coverage in the near future, mathematical models of disease spread and of the potential impact of mitigation measures have been thrust into the limelight.

METHODS All patients receiving radiotherapy for H&N cancers between July 2019 and November 2019 at the University of Freiburg Medical Center who completed the first two follow-ups were included. HRQOL was assessed by the validated EQ-5D-5L questionnaire before radiotherapy, after therapy completion, and three and six months following radiotherapy. The changes from baseline to six months for HI and EQ VAS scores were recorded. RESULTS All 49 patients completed the questionnaires at all time points of data collection, yielding 196 total questionnaires. Twenty-eight patients (57.1%) received definitive, 20 (40.8%) adjuvant, and one 2.1%) patient palliative radiotherapy. The mean EQ-5D-5L index score of the overall population before radiotherapy, after radiotherapy, and three and six months following radiotherapy was 0.837 (standard deviation, SD 0.17), 0.828 (SD 0.16), 0.855 (SD 0.15), and 0.856 (SD 0.14) respectively.

Because nutritional profile can influence patients immunity, we focus our interest on resveratrol, a polyphenolic compound known for its immunomodulating and anti-inflammatory properties. We reviewed all the information concerning the different roles of resveratrol in COVID-19 pathophysiology using PubMed and Scopus as the main databases. Interestingly, we find out that resveratrol may exert its role through different mechanisms. In fact, it has antiviral activity inhibiting virus entrance in cells and viral replication. Resveratrol also improves autophagy and decreases pro-inflammatory agents expression acting as an anti-inflammatory agent. It regulates immune cell response and pro-inflammatory cytokines and prevents the onset of thrombotic events that usually occur in COVID-19 patients.

Studies have been conducted in the mouse due to their relatively higher transparency and long term patency of a chronic cranial window.

However, surgical craniotomies in the rat present challenges due to craniotomy closure by wound healing and diminished image quality due to inflammation, restricting most rat TPFM experiments to acute preparations. Long-term patency is enabled by employing sterile surgical technique, minimization of trauma with precise tissue handling during surgery, judicious selection of the size and placement of the craniotomy, diligent monitoring of animal physiology and support throughout the surgery, and modification of the home cage for long-term preservation of cranial implants. Immunohistochemical analysis employing the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule-1 (Iba-1) showed activation and recruitment of astrocytes and microglia/macrophages directly inferior to the cranial window at one week after surgery, with more diffuse response in deeper cortical layers at two weeks, and amelioration around four weeks post craniotomy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified children younger than 5 years who were evaluated for AHT with spine MRI. Abuse likelihood was determined a priori by expert consensus. We blindly reviewed spine MRIs and compared spinal injury, abuse likelihood, patient demographics, severity of brain injury, presence of retinal hemorrhages, and pattern of head injury between children with and without spine injury. RESULTS: Forty-five of 76 (59.2%) children had spine injury. Spine injury was associated with more severe injury (longer intensive care stays [P<0.001], lower initial mental status [P=0.01] and longer ventilation times [P=0.001]).

METHODS: The survey was available online from 29 June to 30 September 2009. The sample included academic staff, general staff and students of the University. RESULTS: A total of 2882 surveys were completed. Nearly all respondents (99.6%, 2870/2882) were aware of the Australian pandemic situation and 64.2% (1851/2882) reported either \\"no anxiety\\" or \\"disinterest.\\" Asian-born respondents were significantly (p < 0.001) more likely to believe that the pandemic was serious compared to respondents from other regions. 75.9% (2188/2882) of respondents had not made any lifestyle changes as a result of the pandemic. Most respondents had not adopted any specific behaviour change, and only 20.8% (600/2882) had adopted the simplest health behaviour, i.e. hand hygiene. Adoption of a specific behaviour change was linked to anxiety and Asian origin. Students were more likely to attend the university if unwell compared with staff members. Positive responses from students strongly indicate the potential for expanding online teaching and learning resources for continuing education in disaster settings.

Our goal was to consider the possibility of facilitating technical realization of the classical method of asymmetric color matching (ACM) developed by Moreland and Cruz (1959) for assessing appearance of color stimuli in the peripheral visual field (VF). We adopted the ACM method by employing two smartphones to implement matching procedure at various eccentricities. Although smartphones were successfully employed in vision studies, we are aware that some photometric parameters of smartphone displays are not sufficiently precise to ensure accurate color matching in foveal vision; moreover, certain technical characteristics of commercially available devices are variable. In the present study we provided evidence that, despite these shortages, smartphones can be applied for general and wide investigations of the peripheral vision. In our experiments, the smartphones were mounted on a mechanical perimeter to simultaneously present colored stimuli foveally and peripherally. Trying to reduce essential discomfort and fatigue experienced by most observers in peripheral vision studies, we did not apply bite bars, pupil dilatation, and Maxwellian view. The ACM measurements were performed without prior training of observers and in a wide range of eccentricities, varying between 0 and 95.

Therefore, the aim of this work was to conduct a systematic review regarding the PANPs that could be further studied as alternatives to prevent ARDS. Consequently, this work can pave the way to spread the use of PANPs on the prevention of ARDS in COVID-19-confirmed or -suspected patients. METHODS: The search strategy included scientific studies published in English from 2015 to 2020 that promoted the elucidation of anti-inflammatory pathways targeting ARDS by in vitro and/or in vivo experiments using PANPs. Then, 74 studies regarding PANPs, able to maintain or improve the pulmonary function, were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The PANPs may present different pulmonary anti-inflammatory pathways, wherein (i) reduction/attenuation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, (ii) increase of the anti-inflammatory mediators' levels, (iii) pulmonary edema inhibition and (iv) attenuation of lung injury were the most observed biological effects of such products in in vitro experiments or in clinical studies.

RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 41 years, with a male/female sex distribution of 143/384 (27.1%/72.9%). Type 2 diabetes in the pre-operative period was diagnosed in 31% of patients. The median pre-operative body mass index (BMI) was 44.6 kg/m(2) (range, 35C64). The mean operation time was 134 min for robotic RYGB, including the docking process. Early (< 30 days) complications included ileus (0.2%), atelectasis (0.2%), thromboembolic (0.2%) events, and surgical-site infection (0.2%). No leakage or bleeding of the gastrojejunal and jejunojejunal anastomoses were recorded. Oral food intake was begun at 1.8 days on average. The average hospital stay was 2 days. Despite a range of BMI values, operation times and gastrojejunal anastomosis times did not show significant differences. There were no significant differences in mean operation time or mean gastrojejunal anastomosis time over the years. CONCLUSIONS: The robotic approach is effective and safe for patients undergoing RYGB. This technique provides satisfactory results with short-term surgical outcomes. However, the real benefits of robotic RYGB should be further evaluated by well-conducted randomized trials. Even in difficult cases with higher BMI values, optimal operation times and similar operative efficiency can be obtained if a standard operation technique is applied.","output":"Robotic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: A Single Surgeons Experience with 527 Consecutive Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to examine the mental health of community-dwelling older adults as they adapted their everyday health behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to a telephone survey, 126 older adults described perceived changes in physical and mental health, and adaptations in their everyday health behaviors. Descriptive statistics, bivariate correlations, and multiple regressions revealed that participants experienced changes in mental and physical health, reduced health service access, lower social engagement, and increased coping behaviors. Greater negative social impact of the pandemic was associated with higher levels of COVID-19 distress. Reduced mental health was significantly related to reductions in health service access, health changes, and fewer adaptive coping behaviors. Adaptive coping behaviors were helpful, just as reduced health access and social contact added risk for mental health problems. Suggestions were provided for alleviating mental health needs by increasing social contact and engaging in adaptive coping behaviors.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on the Mental Health and Distress of Community-Dwelling Older Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 can affect the cardiovascular system yielding a wide range of complications, including acute myocardial injury.

METHODS This study was conducted in 3 tertiary care referral centers. Since September 2009, we have performed laparoendoscopic single-site surgery in 24 patients diagnosed with ovarian endometriomas. A control group of patients with similar diagnoses who underwent traditional operative laparoscopy during the same period was included (n = 28). In the laparoendoscopic single-site surgery group, a multichannel port was inserted into the peritoneum through a 1.5- to 2.0-cm umbilical incision. RESULTS Patients in the laparoendoscopic single-site surgery group were significantly older (P = .04) and had a higher body mass index (P = .005). Both groups were comparable regarding history of abdominal surgery, lateral pelvic side wall involvement, and cul-de-sac involvement. After we controlled for age and body mass index, the size of the resected endometriomas, duration of surgery, and amount of operative blood loss were comparable in both groups. When required, an additional 5-mm port was inserted in the right or left lower quadrant in the laparoendoscopic single-site surgery group to allow the use of a third instrument for additional tissue retraction or manipulation (10 of 24 patients, 41.6%). However, adhesiolysis was performed more frequently in the conventional laparoscopy group. The duration of hospital stay was <24 hours in both groups. No intraoperative complications were encountered. All incisions healed and were cosmetically satisfactory. CONCLUSION The laparoendoscopic single-site surgery technique is a reasonable initial approach for the treatment of endometriomas. In our experience, an additional side port is usually needed to treat pelvic side wall and cul-de-sac endometriosis that often accompanies endometriomas.","output":"Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery for management of ovarian endometriomas."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drawing on our experience of more than a decade of AI in academic research, technology development, industry engagement, postgraduate teaching, doctoral supervision and organisational consultancy, we present the 'CDAC AI Life Cycle', a comprehensive life cycle for the design, development and deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems and solutions.

Methods: We searched MEDLINE, the World Health Organizations Institutional Repository for Information Sharing, medRxiv, and vaccine manufacturer websites for studies that evaluated the emerging data on COVID-19 vaccine efficacy and effectiveness. Studies providing an estimate of the efficacy or effectiveness of a COVID-19 vaccine using disaggregated data against SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic disease, severe disease, death, or transmission were included. We extracted information on study population, variants of concern (VOC), vaccine platform, dose schedule, study endpoints, and measures of impact. We applied an evidence synthesis approach to capture a range of plausible and consistent parameters for vaccine efficacy and effectiveness that can be used to inform and explore a variety of vaccination strategies as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves. Results: Of the 602 articles and reports identified, 53 were included in the analysis. The availability of vaccine efficacy and effectiveness estimates varied by vaccine and were limited for VOCs. Estimates for non-primary endpoints such as effectiveness against infection and onward transmission were sparse. Synthesised estimates were relatively consistent for the same vaccine platform for wild-type, but was more variable for VOCs.

We found that the number of healthcare providers enrolling on a national PGHD platform increased significantly following the transition to telemedicine, and that the amount of PGHD transmission continued the upward trajectory that it was already experiencing, substantially outpacing the dramatic decline in overall encounters that occurred early in the pandemic. While adoption challenges persist, including questions about accuracy of PGHD, liability, reimbursement, and the potential for exacerbating disparities, these findings suggest an increasing willingness of patients and healthcare providers to use vital sign-related PGHD to supplement telemedicine encounters.

Summary Comparison of findings is hampered by the use of different methods to assess EBW. Nevertheless, in acute pancreatitis (AP) and PC, EBW, especially visceral obesity, presents a distinct risk factor and predictor of a negative outcome. Findings of a protective effect likely result from nonconsideration of fat distribution or other confounders. Regarding chronic pancreatitis (CP), few studies indicate lower incidence and a better outcome with higher body mass. However, there is insufficient evidence to confirm the existence of an obesity paradox. The precise mechanisms of how EBW affects the disease continuum require further elucidation but both common and disease-specific effects seem involved.

In the present study, we initially focused on the detection of recombinant porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) isolates by examining previously published data sets of ORF5 sequences (genotypes 1 and 2) obtained worldwide. We then examined full-length genome sequences in order to determine potential recombination breakpoints along the viral genome. For ORF5, 11 sets of genotype 1 sequences from different geographical areas, including 2 Asian, 1 American, and 7 European regions, and three sets of genotype 2, including sets from China, Mexico, and the United States, were analyzed separately. Potential recombination breakpoints were detected in 10/11 genotype 1 sets, including 9 cases in which the clustering of at least one isolate was different before and after the breakpoints. In genotype 2, potential breakpoints and different tree clustering of at least one strain before and after the breakpoint were observed in 2 out of 3 sets. The results indicated that most of the ORF5 data sets contained at least one recombinant sequence. When the full-length genome sequences were examined, both genotype 1 and 2 sets presented breakpoints (10 and 9, respectively), resulting in significantly different topologies before and after the breakpoints. Mosaic genomes were detected in genotype 1 sequences. These results may have significant implications for the understanding of the molecular epidemiology of PRRSV. IMPORTANCE PRRSV is one of the most important viruses affecting swine production worldwide, causing big economic losses and sanitary problems. One of the key questions on PRRSV arises from its genetic diversity, which is thought to have a direct impact on immunobiology, epidemiology, diagnosis, and vaccine efficacy. One of the causes of this genetic diversity is recombination among strains. This study provides evidence that recombinant PRRSV isolates are common in most of the countries with significant swine production, especially PRRSV genotype 1. This observation has implications in the proper characterization of PRRSV strains, in the future development of phylogenetic studies, and in the development of new PRRSV control strategies. Moreover, the present paper emphasizes the need for a deeper understanding of the mechanisms and circumstances involved in the generation of genetic diversity of PRRSV.","output":"Analysis of ORF5 and full-length genome sequences of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus isolates of genotypes 1 and 2 retrieved worldwide provides evidence that recombination is a common phenomenon and may produce mosaic isolates."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public health threats are increasingly triggered by events which span across international, national and state level jurisdictions.

Specifically, we analyzed how NDVI was influenced by the climatic water balance (i.e. Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index, SPEI), using monthly time-series extracted from 3,100 pixels of forest, categorized into ten forest types. The forests increased in leaf area index by 0.01 per year on average (from 1.7 in 2000 to 1.9 in 2017) but there was enormous variation among years related to climatic water balance. Forest types varied in response to drought events: those dominated by drought-avoiding species showed strong covariance between greenness and SPEI, while those dominated by drought-tolerant species showed weak covariance. Native forests usually recovered more than 80% of greenness within the 18 months and the remainder within 5 years, but plantations of Eucalyptus were less resilient. Management to increase the resilience of forests-a key goal of forestry in the Mediterranean region-appears to have had a positive effect: canopy greenness within protected forests was more resilient to drought than within non-protected forests. In conclusion, many of Spain's successional forests have been resilient to drought over the past 18 years, from the perspective of space.

Meanwhile there is little pull for automation from ecology-based, diversified farming realms. Noting this gap, we here explore the potential for robots to foster an agroecological approach to crop production. The research was situated in The Netherlands within the case of pixel cropping, a nascent farming method in which multiple food and service crops are planted together in diverse assemblages employing agroecological practices such as intercropping and biological pest control. Around this case we engaged with a variety of specialists in discussion groups, workshops, and design challenges to explore the potential of field robots to meet the multifaceted demands of highly diverse agroecological cropping systems. This generated a spectrum of imaginations for how automated tools mightor might notbe appropriately used, ranging from fully automated visions, to collaborative scenarios, to fully analogue prototypes. We found that automating agroecological cropping systems requires finding ways to imbue the ethos of agroecology into designed tools, thereby seeking to overcome tensions between production aims and other forms of social and ecological care. We conclude that a rethinking of automation is necessary for agroecological contexts: not as a blueprint for replacing humans, but making room for analogue and hybrid forms of agricultural work. These findings highlight a need for design processes which include a diversity of actors, involve iterative design cycles, and incorporate feedback between designers, practitioners, tools, and cropping systems.","output":"Automating Agroecology: How to Design a Farming Robot Without a Monocultural Mindset?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has become a global epidemic, posing an unpredictable threat to human health. In this study, we addressed the epidemic characteristics, driving factors, prevention and control measures of influenza A, a more common epidemic. In addition, we reviewed the global efforts on how to prevent and control influenza effectively and related scientific research achievements, which aims to provide experience and suggestions for the prevention and control of COVID-19. The results show that: (1) Influenza A is a seasonal epidemic, affected by climatic, social political, cultural factors and others. It is more contagious in low-temperature, low-humidity, densely populated environment. (2) The prevention and control of influenza A mainly includes seasonal influenza virus surveillance, influenza virus ecological studies, broad-spectrum neutralizing antibodies and universal vaccines, as well as the etiological assessment of influenza pandemic risk. Seasonal influenza virus surveillance is the core of public health policy formulation and follow-up scientific research. (3) Similar to influenza A, the prevalence of COVID-19 is affected by climate factors such as temperature, as well as social, political, cultural and other factors, which needs to draw the lessons from the mature experience, technologies and platforms of influenza. The combination of multiple actions, such as strengthening virus surveillance, conducting further research on virus ecology and etiological risk assessment and drug discovery is essential for early warning and prediction of the possible secondary wave of epidemics in the future. Our study will provide direct inspiration for the prevention, control, prediction and early warning of COVID-19 and other epidemics in the future.","output":"Epidemic situation, prevention, control of influenza A and its enlightenment for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Telerehabilitation has been considered a suitable alternative healthcare delivery system during the COVID-19 outbreak, and many studies have promoted its feasibility in delivering physical care to patients who live with pain and disability. Physiotherapists' perceptions and willingness are two key factors that influence the provision of remote physiotherapy. AIM: To investigate physiotherapists' perceptions of and willingness to use telerehabilitation in Kuwait during the COVID-19 pandemic and to explore the barriers that may hinder the use of telerehabilitation in this sector. METHODS: The following methods were used: (1) a cross-sectional survey and (2) face-to-face semi-structured interviews. In the cross-sectional survey, an electronic questionnaire was sent to 747 physiotherapists who were working in the governmental health sector. The questionnaire included four sections: perceptions of telerehabilitation, comfort with technology, willingness to use telerehabilitation, and barriers to using telerehabilitation. Six interviews were conducted with physiotherapy managers to explore the barriers and facilitators of telerehabilitation practice. DATA ANALYSIS: In this study, descriptive data analysis was conducted, and a cross-tabulation technique was used to find the associations between the variables, in which chi-square tests were used to identify the significance of the results, where p < 0.05. Thematic content analysis was used for the interviews. RESULTS: Only 273 completed questionnaires were received, giving a response rate of 36.5%. Most of the respondents (237; 86.8%) considered telerehabilitation a viable option to deliver healthcare to patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. In spite of the lack of information and communication technology (ICT) (156; 57.1%), 89% (243) of the respondents were willing to integrate telerehabilitation into their conventional practice, as cultural and social norms were not against the use of telerehabilitation systems. The results indicate that the more the physiotherapists used the internet and email in their work and the more comfortable they were with technology, the more willing they were to use telerehabilitation systems (p = 0.01). The physiotherapy managers reported that patients' privacy and the confidentiality of their data were considered barriers. CONCLUSION: In Kuwait, physiotherapists show overall positive perceptions towards and a willingness to use telerehabilitation to facilitate patients' access to physiotherapy services. There are several barriers to employing telerehabilitation. Accordingly, recommendations are suggested.","output":"Physiotherapists' perceptions of and willingness to use telerehabilitation in Kuwait during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Osteocytes are the main sensitive cells in bone remodeling due to their potent functional cell processes from the mineralized bone matrix to the bone surface and the bone marrow. Neighboring osteocytes communicate with each other by these cell processes to achieve molecular exchange through gap junction channels. Platelet-derived growth factor-AA (PDGF-AA) has been reported to enhance bone tissue remodeling by promoting cell proliferation, migration, and autocrine secretion in osteoid cell linage. However, the effect of PDGF-AA on intercellular communication between osteocytes is still unclear. In the present study, we elucidated that PDGF-AA could enhance the formation of dendritic processes of osteocytes and the gap junctional intercellular communication by promoting the expression of connexin43 (Cx43). This modulation process was mainly dependent on the activation of phosphorylation of Akt protein by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt (also known as protein kinase B, PKB) signaling. Inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling decreased the Cx43 expression induced by PDGF-AA. These results establish a bridge between PDGF-AA and cell-cell communication in osteocytes, which could help us understand the molecular exchange between bone cells and fracture healing.","output":"PDGF-AA promotes cell-to-cell communication in osteocytes through PI3K/Akt signaling pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with colorectal cancer undergoing elective surgery. METHODS: The medical records of patients with colorectal cancer who underwent elective surgery in our department during the COVID-19 pandemic (February 1 to May 31, 2020) were collected and analyzed. We compared the clinical data with colorectal cancer during the same 4-month period in 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients with colorectal cancer underwent elective surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was 66% of the number of patients that underwent the procedure during the same period in 2018 and 2019. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the proportion of patients without any digestive system symptoms decreased to 3% and severe clinical symptoms decreased by 20.9%. The proportion of right colon cancer decreased by 17.9%, while the proportion of rectal cancer increased by 52.2%, as compared with 2018 and 2019. The fraction of protective stoma was significantly higher than in 2018 (23.9% vs. 8.7%, p = 0.011). Compared with 2019, the average post-operative stay was significantly shorter than in 2018 (9.6  3.7 vs. 12.1  9.1, p = 0.015). Compared with 2019, the number of patients with perineural invasion (a feature of adverse prognosis) significantly increased (p = 0.009). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of patients undergoing elective surgery for colorectal cancer was reduced. However, the tumor stage of patients did not change substantially.

This study aimed to evaluate the demand for a COVID-19 vaccine in Ecuador by estimating individuals willingness to pay (WTP) for the vaccine, and by assessing the effect of vaccine attributes (duration of protection and efficacy) and individuals characteristics on this valuation. The sample used (N = 1,050) was obtained through an online survey conducted from April 2 to April 7, 2020. Two levels of vaccine efficacy (70% and 98%) and two levels of vaccine duration of protection (1 and 20 years) were considered. The willingness to pay estimates were obtained using a double-bounded dichotomous-choice contingent valuation format. Survey results show that a very large proportion of individuals (at least 97%) were willing to accept a COVID-19 vaccine, and at least 85% of individuals were willing to pay a positive amount for that vaccine. Conservative estimates of the average WTP values ranged from USD 147.61 to 196.65 and the median WTP from USD 76.9 to 102.5. Only the duration of protection was found to influence individuals WTP for the vaccine (p < 0.01). On average, respondents were willing to pay 30% more for a COVID-19 vaccine with 20 years of protection relative to the vaccine with 1 year of protection. Regression results show that WTP for the vaccine was associated with income, employment status, the perceived probability of needing hospitalization if contracting the virus causing COVID-19, and region of residence.","output":"The demand for a COVID-19 vaccine in Ecuador"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to identify possible risk factors for 1C90 day calf mortality in large Swedish dairy herds. Sixty herds with a herd size of 160 cows were visited once between December 2005 and March 2006. Thirty herds were known to have low mortality (LM) and 30 were known high mortality herds (HM). Upon the visit, data about housing and management was collected from interviews with personnel responsible for the calves. The herd status regarding the calves passive transfer (total protein), levels of -tocopherol, -carotene and retinol, and excretion of faecal pathogens (Cryptosporidium spp., Escherichia coli F5, rota and corona virus) was evaluated based on targeted sampling of high risk calf groups; in each herd, blood and faecal samples were collected from calves 1C7 and 1C14 days old, respectively. Similarly, the herd status regarding clinical respiratory disease in calves and history of respiratory virus exposure was evaluated based on lung auscultations and blood samplings of calves 60C90 days old. The median calf mortality risk (in calves 1C90 days of age) among HM herds was 9% (Range: 6C24%) and among LM herds 1% (Range: 0C2%). LM and HM herds were compared using five logistic regression models, covering potential risk factors within different areas: Disease susceptibility, Factors affecting the gastrointestinal tract, Factors related to transmission of infectious disease, Hygiene and Labour management. The percentage of calves, 1C7 days old, with inadequate serum concentrations of -tocopherol and -carotene were significantly higher in HM herds compared to LM herds and also associated with higher odds of being a HM herd (OR = 1.02; p = 0.023 and OR = 1.05; p = 0.0028, respectively). The variable Average number of faecal pathogens in the sampled target group was significantly associated with higher odds of being a HM herd (OR = 4.65; p = 0.015), with a higher average in HM herds. The percentage of calves with diarrhoea treated with antibiotics was significantly higher in HM herds and was associated with higher odds of being a HM herd (OR = 1.08; p = 0.021). The median age at death of calves in the age interval 1C90 days that died during a one-year period was significantly lower among HM herds (13 days) than in LM herds (24 days) (p = 0.0013) The results indicate that gastrointestinal disorders may be an important cause of calf mortality in large Swedish dairy herds.

Transportation, manufacturing industries, business and peoples movement came to almost a halt and sharp oil and gas prices reduction were observed. The impact of the pandemic for sub-Saharan countries like Ethiopia, which was already struggling with many economic and social welfare problems, is more evident than in other wealthy nations around the World. In Ethiopia, the general energy access rate is 44% and in healthcare facilities is only about 10%. Therefore, the response for the COVID-19 pandemic is challenging, since activities such as information sharing, communication with health centers, diagnosis and medical treatment require electricity access. This paper aims to assess the impact of the pandemic on energy access plans during and post-pandemic. The paper analyzed, the status of the current COVID-19 outbreak in Ethiopia, the energy access situation in health facilities, and the impacts of COVID-19 on energy access during and post-pandemic periods. Data related to the universal energy access plan of Ethiopia, the impact of energy access on healthcare services and the impact of the pandemic were reviewed for the assessment. The analysis indicates that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopian healthcare facilities and on the overall universal energy access plan is immense and to minimize the global impact short and long-term policy responses are identified and urgently recommended.

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are known to have an altered immune milieu which may be associated with a delay in viral clearance. Here, a cross-sectional observational study of 138 patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection at two large regional hospitals in Scotland, UK examined the median time to two consecutive negative nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 in an inpatient population. The median time from admission to the first of two consecutive negative nasopharyngeal swabs was 18 days (range = 1-44) in patients with CKD, compared with 11 days (range: 1-71) in patients without CKD (P = .0007). Multivariable linear regression analysis using explanatory variables of age, sex, SARS-CoV-2 disease severity, key comorbidities and renal function showed that declining estimated glomerular filtration rate was independently associated with prolonged time to viral clearance. Our data suggest that patients with CKD who are admitted to hospital with SARS-CoV-2 take longer to achieve sequential negative nasopharyngeal swab reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction results than those without CKD.

Patients suffering from it frequently turn to pharmacists instead of physicians in order to receive medical advice and treatment. We studied its treatment advised by pharmacists in Poland, as well as evidence for the efficacy of their recommendations by utilizing a self-developed questionnaire and a study of existing literature. METHODS: The data were collected by 27 pharmacists who worked in four large network community pharmacies in Lodz, Poland. The study took place from December 2019 to February 2020. Data were recorded only if the patient asked for pharmacy counselling for over-the counter (OTC) products due to common cold self-diagnosis and a product was sold. Pharmacists recommendations were compared with the results of a literature review of best evidence to determine appropriateness of the pharmacists decisions. RESULTS: In four out of five cases the pharmacists recommended products contained paracetamol. In addition, in one out of three patient encounters they advised nasal decongestant, inosines and/or OTC mucolytics. There was a significant relationship between fever and recommendation frequency of some analgesics, inosines, mucolytics and sore throat products (OR > 1, p < 0.05); rhinorrhea and recommendation frequency of paracetamol, inosines, anti-histamines and alpha-mimetics (OR > 1, p < 0.05); cough and recommendation frequency of paracetamol, inosines, mucolytics and sore throat products (OR > 1, p < 0.05); and fatigue and recommendation frequency of paracetamol, acetylsalicylic acid, inosines and sore throat products (OR > 1, p < 0.05). The pharmacist recommendations were based on patients symptoms, product price, pharmaceutical company promotion and the financial incentive. In many cases their recommendations were not in line with current best practice recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the most common rationale for pharmacist recommendation on anti-common cold treatment was to take a shotgun approach. Pharmacists commonly made recommendations for products that lack strong evidence for efficacy (i.e. anti-viral agents) and are potentially unnecessary, based on presentation of the symptom. Reasons for this situation include lack of training, lack of time to evaluate the patient, lack of awareness of evidence as well as drug company marketing and financial incentives (i.e. fulfilling sale plans and target sale bonuses).

To examine contraction efficiency, we estimated the metabolic cost of the cycles using established cost models. We found that for motor contractions in which the muscle was primarily active during shortening, greater muscle mass resulted in lower contraction efficiency, primarily due to lower mass-specific mechanical work per cycle. The addition of a tendon in series with the mass-enhanced muscle model improved the mass-specific work and efficiency per cycle with greater mass for motor contractions, particularly with a shorter excitation duty cycle, despite higher predicted metabolic cost.

METHODS: Using the online platforms LILACS, PUBMED and EMBASE, on 17- JUL-2020 a search was made for the terms COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 associated with sickle cell, thalassemia and hemoglobinopathy. RESULTS: There were 623 pediatric and adult patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) or beta thalassemia (BT) and COVID-19. Total mortality rate was 6.42%. No pediatric patient with BT has been described. So, our analysis focused on children and adolescents with SCD: there were 121 pediatric patients, one adolescent died, prophylactic anticoagulation was prescribed to six patients, 11.76% needed intensive care unit, blood transfusion was prescribed in 29.70%. Vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) and acute chest syndrome (ACS) were the main clinical manifestations in SCD. DISCUSSION: Pediatric patients with SCD and COVID-19 have a low mortality rate when compared to adults, although is higher than the global pediatric population with COVID-19 (0?0.67%). The comorbidities associated with age and the long-term complications inherent to hemoglobinopathies may contribute to the increased mortality outside the pediatric age group. In SCD the clinical manifestations, both in children and adults, are VOC and ACS, and there was increase in blood requirement. Pediatric SCD patients with COVID-19 need more intensive care unit than the global pediatric population (3.30%).

All have associations with human central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction. In infants and young children, the most common CNS phenomena are febrile seizures; in adults, non-focal abnormalities that may be either neurologic or constitutional. Neurotropism and neurovirulence are dependent in part on CNS expression of cell surface receptors mediating viral entry, and host immune response. In adults, CNS receptors for epidemic viruses are largely expressed on brain vasculature, whereas receptors for less pathogenic viruses are present in vasculature, brain parenchyma, and olfactory neuroepithelium, dependent upon viral species. Human coronaviruses can infect circulating mononuclear cells, but meningoencephalitis is rare. Well-documented human neuropathologies are infrequent and, for SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, can entail cerebrovascular accidents originating extrinsically to brain. There is evidence of neuronal infection in the absence of inflammatory infiltrates with SARS-CoV, and CSF studies of rare patients with seizures have demonstrated virus but no pleocytosis.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of vaccination schedule and type of vaccine, number of doses, and sex on the immune response. In a population of Italian medical students (8497 individuals born after 1980 with certificate of vaccination and quantitative measurement of antibodies against measles), the prevalence of positive antibodies to measles and antibody titer was measured. Vaccination schedule such as number of doses and vaccine type (measles alone or combined as measles, mumps and rubella (MMR)) and sex were the variables considered to influence the immune response. The vaccination schedule depends on the year of birth: students born before 1990 were prevalently vaccinated once and with measles vaccine alone (not as MMR). One dose of vaccine induces a significantly (p &lt; 0.0001) higher positive response and antibody titer than two doses, in particular when measles alone is used (p &lt; 0.0001). Females have a significantly higher percentage of positive response (p = 0.0001) than males but only when the MMR formulation was used. Multiple linear regression confirms that sex significantly influences antibody titer when only MMR is used, after one (p = 0.0002) or two (p = 0.0060) doses. In conclusion, vaccination schedule and, partially, sex influence immune response to measles vaccination.

METHODS: First, a B0 shimming protocol was selected for automation by comparing 3 widely used B0 algorithms (2 vendor protocols and FAST(EST)MAP). Next, voxel-based B0 and B1 calibrations were incorporated into the consensus-recommended semi-LASER sequence and combined with an automated VOI prescription tool, a recently developed method for automated voxel prescription. The efficiency of collecting single-voxel data from a clinical cohort (N = 40) with the automated protocol (calibration time and fraction of usable datasets) was compared with the nonautomated semi-LASER protocol (N = 35) whereby all prescan calibrations were executed manually in the academic hospital setting with rotating MR technologists in the neuroradiology unit. RESULTS: A multi-iteration FAST(EST)MAP protocol resulted in narrower water linewidths than vendor's B0 shim protocols for data acquired from 6 brain locations (p < 1e-5) and was selected for automation. The automated B0 and B1 calibrations resulted in a time saving of ~4.5 minutes per voxel relative to the same advanced protocol executed manually. All spectra acquired with the automated protocol were usable, whereas only 86% of those collected with the manual protocol were usable and spectral quality was more variable. CONCLUSION: The plug-and-play advanced MRS protocol allows automated acquisition of high-quality MRS data with high success rate and consistency on a clinical 3T platform.","output":"Plug-and-play advanced magnetic resonance spectroscopy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Meteorological and geophysical hazards will concur and interact with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) impacts in many regions on Earth. These interactions will challenge the resilience of societies and systems. A comparison of plausible COVID-19 epidemic trajectories with multi-hazard time-series curves enables delineation of multi-hazard scenarios for selected countries (United States, China, Australia, Bangladesh) and regions (Texas). In multi-hazard crises, governments and other responding agents may be required to make complex, highly compromised, hierarchical decisions aimed to balance COVID-19 risks and protocols with disaster response and recovery operations. Contemporary socioeconomic changes (e.g. reducing risk mitigation measures, lowering restrictions on human activity to stimulate economic recovery) may alter COVID-19 epidemiological dynamics and increase future risks relating to natural hazards and COVID-19 interactions. For example, the aggregation of evacuees into communal environments and increased demand on medical, economic, and infrastructural capacity associated with natural hazard impacts may increase COVID-19 exposure risks and vulnerabilities. COVID-19 epidemiologic conditions at the time of a natural hazard event might also influence the characteristics of emergency and humanitarian responses (e.g. evacuation and sheltering procedures, resource availability, implementation modalities, and assistance types). A simple epidemic phenomenological model with a concurrent disaster event predicts a greater infection rate following events during the pre-infection rate peak period compared with post-peak events, highlighting the need for enacting COVID-19 counter measures in advance of seasonal increases in natural hazards. Inclusion of natural hazard inputs into COVID-19 epidemiological models could enhance the evidence base for informing contemporary policy across diverse multi-hazard scenarios, defining and addressing gaps in disaster preparedness strategies and resourcing, and implementing a future-planning systems approach into contemporary COVID-19 mitigation strategies. Our recommendations may assist governments and their advisors to develop risk reduction strategies for natural and cascading hazards during the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: A literature search was performed in 9 databases on November 20, 2021. The relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was used to estimate the effect of pregnancy on COVID-19 outcomes. The I square value was used to assess heterogeneity, and the random or the fixed-effects model were adopted. Sensitivity and publication bias analyses were performed. RESULTS: This study included 8 published studies with 859,278 COVID-19 female patients. The incidences of fever and cough among pregnant women with COVID-19 were 19.07% and 28.79%, respectively. Pregnancy was associated with significantly increased risks of intensive care unit (ICU) admission (RR = 2.23, 95% CI = 1.58C3.16) and ventilation (RR = 2.13, 95% CI = 1.06C4.28), but was not associated with a statistically significant increase in mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that pregnant women with COVID-19 have a significantly higher probability of being hospitalized to the ICU and ventilation than non-pregnant women with COVID-19. To avoid these adverse outcomes, pregnant women should take precautions (for example, reduce going out, maintain social distance, and wear a mask) to avoid COVID-19 infection.

The DEAQ drew on current validated, published questionnaires for LEA, linked to the clinical outcomes of relative energy deficiency in sport (RED-S). Questions addressed recognised physiological indicators and consequences of LEA in the context of dance, together with psychological drivers and aetiological factors specific to dance training. LEA was quantified using a scoring system to include these characteristics. Results 247 responses to the DEAQ were analysed (225 female and 22 male), mean age 20.7 years (SD 7.9) with transition to full time training at 15.0 years (SD 7.9) and 85% practising ballet. Psychological, physiological and physical characteristics consistent with LEA were reported by 57% of the female dancers and 29% of male dancers, indicating a risk of RED-S. The unique nature of dance training, in terms of demands and environment, was found to be potentially influential in development of this situation. Less than a third (29%) of dancers were aware of RED-S. Conclusion This study found dancers to be a specific group of high-level exercisers displaying indicators of LEA and consequently at risk of developing the adverse clinical health and performance consequences of RED-S. Awareness of RED-S was low.

The purpose of the study was to assess whether participation in lifestyle activities is associated with moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), out-of-school vigorous physical activity (VPA), and sedentary behaviour in adolescents aged 10C15 years, with major demographic variables (sex, age, socioeconomic status) being taken into account. METHODS: Data from a research project linked to the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey collected in 2017 in the Czech Republic was used. The sample consisted of 679 participants (303 of them girls) and was selected by quota sampling. Chi-square tests were used to assess differences in involvement in lifestyle activities according to sex, grade, and socioeconomic status. Ordinal and linear regression models were used to analyse the associations of participation in lifestyle activities and selected energy balance-related behaviours. RESULTS: Participation in lifestyle sport activities was significantly associated with a higher level of physical activity (MVPA and out-of-school VPA) after adjustment for sociodemographic factors, as was participation in organized sport. No significant associations were shown for sedentary behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents participating in lifestyle sport activities report being more physically active and, in case of doing multiple such activities concurrently, also spending less time sitting than their peers not involved in lifestyle sport activities. As such, lifestyle sport activities seem to represent a feasible way of increasing overall PA level in adolescent population.

Mortality depends on two factors: the case fatality rate and the case incidence. We combine a cohort-based model that determines case fatality rates along with a modified logistic model that evaluates the case incidence to determine the number of deaths in all the US states over time; the model is also able to include the impact of interventions. Both models yield exceptional goodness-of-fit. The model predicted a range of death outcomes (79k to 246k) all of which are considerably greater than the figures presented in mainstream media.

This study aims to investigate in-hospital mortality, its clinical risk factors and the accuracy of the existing scoring system in predicting in-hospital mortality. METHODS: An observational prospective cohort study involving PTB patients with ARF in tertiary hospital, between January 2017 and December 2018, was conducted. The in-hospital mortality was predicted using the National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2), quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) and CRB-65. Regression models were run to analyze the clinical risk factors for in-hospital Mortality. Sensitivity and specificity of scoring systems were calculated using a Wilson score interval. RESULTS: A total of 111 subjects were included. Most of subjects were hypoxemic type respiratory failure (68.5%), advanced lesions (62.2%), new cases (70.3%) and pneumonia co-infection (72.1%) patients. Invasive mechanical ventilation was utilized for 29.73% of cases. There were 53 (47.75%) in-hospital mortality cases and its risk factors were intensive phase treatment (3.34 OR; CI95% 1.27C8.78), P/F ratio < 100 (OR 4.30; CI 95% 1.75C10.59) and renal insufficiency (4.09 OR; CI95% 1.46C11.49).

This study aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on psychological health, sexual function, and quality of life (QoL) in Iranian pregnant and lactating women and compare the results with non-pregnant/non-lactating women. METHOD: This comparative cross-sectional study was carried out on pregnant and lactating women, with non-pregnant/non-lactating women from May to Jun 2020. Patients were asked to complete three questionnaires: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), and Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12). One-way ANOVA was used to reveal the statistical differences between the three groups. RESULT: The mean age of patients was 20.81  5.92 years old. The mean (SD) score of HADS in pregnant, lactating and non-pregnant / non-lactating women were 12.11 (6.72), 11.98 (8.44) and 9.38 (6.2) respectively, and the results showed that the scores in pregnant, lactating women were higher than non-pregnant / non-lactating women (P < 0.001).

Its biosynthesis is severely reduced in mouse models of Huntington's disease. One possible mechanism is a diminished nuclear translocation of the transcription factor sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP2) and, consequently, reduced activation of SREBP-controlled genes in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Here we evaluated the efficacy of a gene therapy based on the unilateral intra-striatal injection of a recombinant adeno-associated virus 2/5 (AAV2/5) targeting astrocytes specifically and carrying the transcriptionally active N-terminal fragment of human SREBP2. Robust hSREBP2 expression in striatal glial cells in R6/2 Huntington's disease mice activated the transcription of cholesterol biosynthesis pathway genes, restored synaptic transmission, reversed Drd2 transcript levels decline, cleared mutant Huntingtin aggregates and attenuated behavioral deficits. We conclude that glial SREBP2 participates in Huntington's disease brain pathogenesis in vivo and that AAV-based delivery of SREBP2 to astrocytes counteracts key features of the disease.","output":"SREBP2 gene therapy targeting striatal astrocytes ameliorates Huntington's disease phenotypes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Proper positioning and attachment play a key role in exclusive breastfeeding.

To prioritize the action points to improve the poor breastfeeding practices according to the viewpoint of the staff nurses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A hospital-based mixed-methods study was carried out in Puducherry for 6 months. In quantitative phase, 99 postnatal mothers were interviewed consecutively and breastfeeding techniques were observed based on Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative and Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illness guidelines. In qualitative phase, 45 staff nurses ranked the action points to improve the poor breastfeeding practices. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were employed. Mean rank and Kendalls' Concordance Coefficient were calculated for the ranked data. RESULTS: About 28.3% and 27.3% of mothers demonstrated improper positioning and poor attachment, respectively. Young mothers, housewives, <10 days old infants, and failure to receive breastfeeding counseling were associated with poor breastfeeding techniques. Poster displays, healthcare workers' training, targeted counseling, and assistance were the priority action points suggested by the staff nurses. CONCLUSION: Maternal age, maternal occupation, infants' age, and breastfeeding counseling influenced breastfeeding techniques.

Owing to the mechanism of backfiltration/internal filtration, middle molecules are dragged by the convective forces, and no substitution solution is needed. The HCO dialyzer is applied in septic patients with acute kidney injury requiring continuous kidney replacement therapy. The immune response is modulated thanks to the removal of inflammatory mediators. Another current application for the HCO dialyzer is in hematology, for patients on HD secondary to myeloma-kidney, since free light chains are more efficiently removed with the HCO membrane, reducing their deleterious effect on the renal tubules. In its turn, the MCO dialyzer is used for maintenance HD patients. A myriad of clinical trials published in the last three years consistently demonstrates the ability of this membrane to remove uremic toxins more efficiently than the high-flux membrane, an evolutionary disruption in the HD standard of care.

A diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis was associated with a lower odds of hospitalisation (OR = 0.09, 95%CI 0.02 to 0.32). CONCLUSION: Increasing age, comorbidity burden, and glucocorticoid use were associated with hospitalisation, while a diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis was associated with lower odds of hospitalization.","output":"Predictors of Hospitalisation in Patients with Rheumatic Disease and COVID-19 in Ireland: data from the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance registry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Switzerland responded to the first COVID-19 wave fairly successfully by employing both public health and economic measures During the state of emergency, the federal government made a firm decision to flatten the infection curve and to protect especially at-risk populations During the lockdown period, the focus of the political debate shifted from health to the economy as the Federal Council (i e , the national executive) started to prepare for the country's reopening While government still had full power due to the emergency situation defined under national epidemic law, the shift in the debate also meant a shift in the way that the government made decisions Switzerland is a power-sharing consociational democracy with strong neo-corporatist features While the executive untypically relied heavily on health experts within and outside the administration during the lockdown, the reopening strategy shows clear features of Swiss neo-corporatism, including the resurgence and influence of the traditional big economic vested interests over the government's approach to decision making","output":"Switzerland's COVID-19 policy response: Consociational crisis management and neo-corporatist reopening"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 outbreak has been accompanied by a massive infodemic, however, many vulnerable individuals such as illiterate or low-literate, older adults and rural populations have limited access to health information.

The current study was aimed to investigate COVID-19s awareness of the illiterate population of Pakistan. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among illiterate Pakistanis of ages  18 years through a convenient sampling approach. The study participants were interviewed face to face by respecting the defined precautionary measures and all data were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 22 (IBM, Armonk, NY). RESULTS: The mean age of the study participants (N = 394) was 37.2  9.60 years, with the majority being males (80.7%). All participants were aware of the COVID-19 outbreak and television news channels (75.1%) were the primary source of information.

As a result, disaster response has been suboptimal and in many instances hampered by lack of planning, education and training, information, and communication. METHODS The Resource-Poor Settings panel developed five key question domains; defining the term resource poor and using the traditional phases of the disaster cycle (mitigation/preparedness/response/recovery). Literature searches were conducted to identify evidence to answer the key questions in these areas. Given a lack of data on which to develop evidence-based recommendations, expert-opinion suggestions were developed, and consensus was achieved using a modified Delphi process. RESULTS The five key questions were as follows: definition, capacity building and mitigation, what resources can we bring to bear to assist/surge, response, and reconstitution and recovery of host nation critical care capabilities. Addressing these led the panel to offer 33 suggestions. Because of the large number of suggestions, the results have been separated into two sections: part I, Infrastructure/Capacity in the accompanying article, and part II, Response/Recovery/Research in this article. CONCLUSIONS A lack of rudimentary ICU resources and capacity to enhance services plagues resource-poor or constrained settings. Capacity building therefore entails preventative strategies and strengthening of primary health services. Assistance from other countries and organizations is often needed to mount a surge response. Moreover, the disengagement of these responding groups and host country recovery require active planning.

It is important to study comfort, but also to study the extraction of particles expelled during a sneeze phenomenon. Particles are studied with particular importance due to the panorama that we experience today with the pandemic situation. The Sars-Cov-2 virus is still a subject of study in several areas, especially due to its easy form of contagion. The study of the behavior of water particles expelled through the mouth facilitates the perception of risk, as well as preventive measures to be adopted. Method: For the study, numerical simulation was used, namely the Ansys ? program. For this, a mannequin was modeled inside a 15 m 2 room, whose HVAC system incorporates an insufflation grid and an extraction grid. The mannequin has an associated respiratory cycle and during the same period it suffers a sneeze period expelling water particles. Results: Due to the obtained PMV, the thermal comfort of the occupant cannot be ensured, having to adopt a greater diffusion of the inflated air.

Currently, there is no specific viral protein-targeted therapeutics. The Nucleocapsid (N) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is necessary for viral RNA replication and transcription. The C-terminal domain of N protein (CTD) involves in the self-assembly of N protein into a filament that is packaged into new virions. In this study, the CTD (PDB ID: 6WJI) was targeted for the identification of possible inhibitors of oligomerization of N protein. Herein, multiple computational approaches were employed to explore the potential mechanisms of binding and inhibitor activity of five antiviral drugs toward CTD. The five anti-N drugs studied in this work are 4E1RCat, Silmitasertib, TMCB, Sapanisertib, and Rapamycin. Among the five drugs, 4E1RCat displayed highest binding affinity (-10.95 kcal/mol), followed by rapamycin (-8.91 kcal/mol), silmitasertib (-7.89 kcal/mol), TMCB (-7.05 kcal/mol), and sapanisertib (-6.14 kcal/mol). Subsequently, stability and dynamics of the protein-drug complex were examined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Overall, drug binding increases the stability of the complex with maximum stability observed in the case of 4E1RCat. The CTD-drug complex systems behave differently in terms of the free energy landscape and showed differences in population distribution. Overall, the MD simulation parameters like RMSD, RMSF, Rg, hydrogen bonds analysis, PCA, FEL, and DCCM analysis indicated that 4E1RCat and TMCB complexes were more stable as compared to silmitasertib and sapanisertib and thus could act as effective drug compounds against CTD.

Until now, a detailed investigation of the structure of FCR and the interaction among its constituent elements is lacking. This study aims to investigate the phenomenon of FCR by means of network analysis in Chinese cancer patients. METHODS: This is a multi-center, cross-sectional study that included 996 cancer patients from southern China. All participants were assessed by the 7-item Chinese version Fear of Cancer Recurrence Scale (FCR-7). Multivariate logistic regression, and network analyses were conducted. Central symptoms (nodes) in the FCR network were identified. RESULTS: Among the 996 patients, 543 (54.52%) reported moderate FCR, and 137 (13.76%) reported high FCR. Chemotherapy (OR = 2.954, P = 0.016), and childhood severe illness experience (OR = 2.331, P = 0.016) were positively associated with high FCR, while higher monthly income (OR = 0.403, P = 0.046) was negative associated with high FCR. The node #FCR2 (Worried/anxious about recurrence) was the most central node within the FCR network (Strength = 1.190), while node #FCR6 (Examining for physical signs) was the least central node (Strength = 0.373). The edge FCR1-FCR2 (Afraid-Worried/anxious) was the thickest and most saturated edge in the network. After controlling for age and gender, an almost identical network was obtained with respect to edges magnitude and strength. CONCLUSION: Fear of recurrence is a frequently reported issue among Chinese cancer patients. Patients with chemotherapy and childhood severe illness experience were more vulnerable and should be particularly monitored. Compared to behavioral component (i.e., body checking, overscreening and overtreatment) and cognitive component (i.e., intrusions), emotional component (i.e., worry/anxious) is more central to identify FCR and might be potential targets for further interventions.","output":"Fear of Recurrence in Chinese Cancer Patients: Prevalence, Correlates, and Network Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic started late 2019 and currently continues unabated The lag-time for developing vaccines means it is of paramount importance to be able to quickly develop and repurpose therapeutic drugs Protein-based biosensors allow screening to be performed using routine molecular laboratory equipment without a need for expensive chemical reagents Here we present a biosensor for the 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease from SARS-CoV-2, comprising a FRET-capable pair of fluorescent proteins held in proximity by a protease cleavable linker We demonstrate the utility of this biosensor for inhibitor discovery by screening 1280 compounds from the Library of Pharmaceutically Active Compounds collection The screening identified 65 inhibitors, with the 20 most active exhibiting sub-micromolar inhibition of 3CLpro in follow-up EC50 assays The top hits included several compounds not previously identified as 3CLpro inhibitors, in particular five members of a family of aporphine alkaloids that offer promise as new antiviral drug leads","output":"High-Throughput Screening for Inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 Protease Using a FRET-Biosensor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease (COVD-19) outbreak has overburdened the surveillance of severe acute respiratory infections (SARIs), including the laboratory network This study was aimed at correcting the absence of laboratory results of reported SARI deaths METHODS: The imputation method was applied for SARI deaths without laboratory information using clinico-epidemiological characteristics RESULTS: Of 84,449 SARI deaths, 51% were confirmed with COVID-19 while 3% with other viral respiratory diseases After the imputation method, 95% of deaths were reclassified as COVID-19 while 5% as other viral respiratory diseases CONCLUSIONS: The imputation method was a useful and robust solution (sensitivity and positive predictive value of 98%) for missing values through clinical &amp;epidemiological characteristics","output":"Imputation method to reduce undetected severe acute respiratory infection cases during the coronavirus disease outbreak in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Volatility is unnerving, and the current COVID-19 crisis has certainly put many advisers to the test while many work to do right by investors, compound capital, and protect purchasing power in the face of maximum uncertainty Most are applying all of the past lessons-learned to a scenario one has never experienced before, and no one knows what will happen That said, times like these serve as a catalyst to check in, rebalance, and reallocate portfolios, so it is a good time to revisit the discussion on active versus passive, noting there is a broad spectrum of approaches that escape this simple bifurcation of investment ideologies Market dislocations can present tactical opportunities, but many will only know with the benefit of hindsight which moves pay off, and which don't","output":"Exploring the Gray Zone Between Active and Passive"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During pandemics, regular service provisioning processes in medical care may be disrupted.

We describe trends in the mortality risk among residents of care homes compared to private homes. METHODS: On behalf of NHS England we used OpenSAFELY-TPP to calculate monthly age-standardised risks of death due to all causes and COVID-19 among adults aged >=65 years between 1/2/2019 and 31/03/2021. Care home residents were identified using linkage to Care and Quality Commission data. FINDINGS: We included 4,340,648 people aged 65 years or older on the 1st of February 2019, 2.2% of whom were classified as residing in a care or nursing home. Age-standardised mortality risks were approximately 10 times higher among care home residents compared to those in private housing in February 2019: comparative mortality figure (CMF) = 10.59 (95%CI = 9.51, 11.81) among women, and 10.87 (9.93, 11.90) among men. By April 2020 these relative differences had increased to more than 17 times with CMFs of 17.57 (16.43, 18.79) among women and 18.17 (17.22, 19.17) among men. CMFs did not increase during the second wave, despite a rise in the absolute age-standardised COVID-19 mortality risks. INTERPRETATION: COVID-19 has had a disproportionate impact on the mortality of care home residents in England compared to older residents of private homes, but only in the first wave. This may be explained by a degree of acquired immunity, improved protective measures or changes in the underlying frailty of the populations. The care home population should be prioritised for measures aimed at controlling COVID-19.

It can be categorized as an IoT-based device which can monitor heart rate, room temperature, humidity, air quality, nostril temperature, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) using an ESP8266 microcontroller and different sensors. All data will be sent to Firebase via Wi-Fi and then to patients and doctors via mobile applications and websites, respectively. Doctors can access this data via a website and instruct patients based on their specific needs. An ESP8266 microcontroller, a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, a MAX30100 pulse and SpO2 sensor, a MQ-135 air quality sensor, and an LM-35 temperature sensor have been used for the proposed system in this research. This system uses an efficient way to store all the data and information about the patient. It also carries their various test reports. The data is preserved in a proper way, which will help the patient or doctor retrieve any information in a smooth and swift manner. The software part of the system is divided into two parts. One of them is a mobile application that was designed by the Android Studio. The second one is the website, and it is also divided into two parts. HTML (hypertext markup language), CSS (cascading style sheets), and JavaScripts are designed for the front end of the website, and PHP (hypertext preprocessor) is used for the backend of the website. The device is tested on seven different real human test subjects, and the accuracy of that device is state of the art. It can measure the heart rate of a person along with their oxygen saturation with accuracy. Also, this device calculates the humidity properly as it changes the moment wet towels are put near the sensors and far from the sensors. It also shows the proper air quality as it has been tested with smoke to measure the extreme difference in the air quality. This system also has video calling and prescription features. Using this system, patients can consult with the doctor and get a prescription. Using this system, the vital physiological parameters of the remote patients can be measured and monitored. Any hospital or diagnostic center can be more efficient and organized by using a system. And patients are also freed from the hustle as they do not need to go and visit the doctor over and over again. The system is designed in such a way that it can look after the particular needs of a typical hospital or a diagnostic center and is able to provide easy and efficient storage of information related to patients.","output":"Internet of Things- (IoT-) Based Real-Time Vital Physiological Parameter Monitoring System for Remote Asthma Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objetivos Analisar comparativamente as caractersticas relativas aos gastos dispensados em sade para tratamento de pacientes internados por Linfoma n?o-Hodgkin antes e durante a pandemia de Covid-19.

For the general public, although their physical health may not be directly affected, their mental health may be affected by stress, anxiety, and social panic caused by COVID-19. Controlling the pandemic should focus on not only physical health but also mental health. For the general public, mental health is even more important, as good mental health at the individual level can form a positive social mentality conducive to pandemic prevention and control. Therefore, it is important to assess mental health during the pandemic, and analyze risk and protective factors. Methods: A self-compiled COVID-19 Social Mentality Questionnaire was used to conduct an online survey. A total of 16,616 participants responded, with 13,511 valid questionnaires. Results: Results showed that 10.7% of participants rated their mental health as \\"worse than usual\\" during the pandemic, and there were gender, age, and educational differences. Social support was positively correlated with pandemic-related knowledge and self-efficacy, and could indirectly predict mental health. Pandemic-related knowledge was positively correlated with self-efficacy and mental health, and risk level was negatively correlated with mental health. Hierarchical regression analysis showed that pandemic-related knowledge played a partial mediating role in the relationship between social support and self-efficacy, while self-efficacy played a complete mediating role in the relationship between social support and mental health. Logistic regression analysis showed that risk level moderated the relationship between self-efficacy and mental health. Conclusions: Social support can increase pandemic-related knowledge, thus improving self-efficacy and maintaining/promoting mental health. High risk levels can undermine the role of self-efficacy in promoting mental health. Therefore, in the fight against the COVID-19, people need to support and cooperate with each other, to improve self-efficacy and reduce risk, thus maintaining and promoting mental health.","output":"Antecedents of Public Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Mediation of Pandemic-Related Knowledge and Self-Efficacy and Moderation of Risk Level"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a negative effect on mental health and subjective psychological wellbeing.

Encoded closest to the 5' terminus of this locus is the first papain-like proteinase (PLP-1) (S. C. Baker et al., J. Virol. 67:6056-6063, 1993; H.-J. Lee et al., Virology 180:567-582, 1991). This cysteine proteinase is responsible for the in vitro cleavage of p28, a polypeptide that is also present in MHV-A59-infected cells. Cleavage at a second site was recently reported for this proteinase (P. J. Bonilla et al., Virology 209:489-497, 1995). This new cleavage site maps to the same region as the predicted site of the C terminus of p65, a viral polypeptide detected in infected cells. In this study, microsequencing analysis of the radiolabeled downstream cleavage product and deletion mutagenesis analysis were used to identify the scissile bond of the second cleavage site to between Ala832 and Gly833. The effects of mutations between the P5 and P2' positions on the processing at the second cleavage site were analyzed. Most substitutions at the P4, P3, P2, and P2' positions were permissive for cleavage. With the exceptions of a conservative P1 mutation, Ala832Gly, and a conservative P5 mutation, Arg828Lys, substitutions at the P5, P1, and P1' positions severely diminished second-site proteolysis. Mutants in which the p28 cleavage site (Gly247 / Val248) was replaced by the Ala832 / Gly833 cleavage site and vice versa were found to retain processing activity. Contrary to previous reports, we determined that the PLP-1 has the ability to process in trans at either the p28 site or both cleavage sites, depending on the choice of substrate. The results from this study suggest a greater role by the PLP-1 in the processing of the replicase locus in vivo.","output":"Characterization of a second cleavage site and demonstration of activity in trans by the papain-like proteinase of the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain A59."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The \\"gold\\" standard radiological method for the diagnosis of the lung findings in COVID-19 patients is known to be the chest high-resolution computed tomography However, in a mass casualty scenario, as in times of COVID-19 epidemics, in which emergency departments, intensive care units, and whole hospitals are massive overcrowded and continue to change their original configuration, a more rapid, flexible, and performant diagnostic approach is required Moreover, the high contagiousness of these patients and the risk of transporting critical patients make chest computed tomography (CT) a limited option for them Lung ultrasonography, a rapid, reliable, bedside, nonradiating and repeatable examination, with its sensitivity closed to chest CT and much higher than the chest X-ray for COVID patients, has proved to be in COVID-19 pandemic as crucial diagnostic and monitoring tool of patients with acute respiratory failure It could be performed in the prehospital setting, in the emergency department (as part of the diagnostic approach), up to the normal wards and the intensive care unit The aim of this article is to describe the central role of LUS in the management of COVID-19 critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, as valid diagnostic and monitoring point-of-care technique","output":"Lung ultrasound in COVID-19 critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is a recently identified coronavirus that causes the respiratory disease known as COVID-19.

This is increasingly relevant in the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia, particularly since the introduction of the common carp (Cyprinus carpio). This invasive species now occupies up to 90% of fish biomass, with hugely detrimental impacts on native fauna and flora. To address the ongoing impacts of carp, cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3) has been proposed as a potentially effective biological control. Crucially, however, it is unknown whether CyHV-3 and other cyprinid herpesviruses already exist in the Murray-Darling. Further, little is known about those viruses that naturally occur in wild freshwater fauna, and the frequency with which these viruses jump species boundaries. To document the evolution and diversity of freshwater fish viromes and better understand the ecological context to the proposed introduction of CyHV-3, we performed a meta-transcriptomic viral survey of invasive and native fish across the Murray-Darling Basin, covering over 2,200 km of the river system. Across a total of 36 RNA libraries representing 10 species, we failed to detect CyHV-3 nor any closely related viruses. Rather, meta-transcriptomic analysis identified 18 vertebrate-associated viruses that could be assigned to the Arenaviridae, Astroviridae, Bornaviridae, Caliciviridae, Coronaviridae, Chuviridae, Flaviviridae, Hantaviridae, Hepeviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Picornaviridae, Poxviridae, Reoviridae and Rhabdoviridae families, and a further 27 that were deemed to be associated with non-vertebrate hosts. Notably, we revealed a marked lack of viruses that are shared among invasive and native fishes sampled here, suggesting that there is little virus transmission from common carp to native fish species. Overall, this study provides the first data on the viruses naturally circulating in a major river system and supports the notion that fish harbour a large diversity of viruses with often deep evolutionary histories. Author Summary The ongoing invasion of the common carp in the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia, has wreaked havoc on native freshwater ecosystems. This has stimulated research into the possible biological control of invasive carp through the deliberate release of the virus cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3). However, little is known on the diversity of viruses that naturally circulate in wild freshwater fauna, whether these viruses are transmitted between invasive and native species, nor if CyHV-3 or other cyprinid herpesviruses are already present in the basin. To address these fundamental questions we employed meta-transcriptomic next-generation sequencing to characterise the total assemblage of viruses (i.e. the viromes) in three invasive and seven native fish species cohabiting at 10 sites across 2,200 km of the river system. From this analysis we identified 18 vertebrate-associated viruses across 14 viral families, yet a marked lack of virus transmission between invasive and native species. Importantly, no CyHV-3 was detected. This study shows that freshwater fish harbour a high diversity and abundance of viruses, that viruses have likely been associated with fish for millennia, and that there is likely little direct virus transmission between introduced and native species.","output":"Metagenomic sequencing reveals a lack of virus exchange between native and invasive freshwater fish across the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We demonstrate an integrated micro-optofluidic platform for real-time, continuous detection and quantification of airborne microorganisms.

In particular, the pandemic substantially influenced financial markets and we can observe that some markets or instruments vary in stability since they have been affected in the different degree. In the paper, we present the problem of stability of stock markets during the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the low number of works related to CEE countries during the pandemic, we analyze the Warsaw Stock Exchange, which is one of the most important markets in the CEE. Our main goal was to find how various industries represented by stock market indices have reacted to the COVID-19 shock and consequently which sectors turned out to keep stability and remained resistant to the pandemic. In our investigation, we use two clustering methods: the K-means and the Ward techniques with the criterion of maximizing the silhouette coefficient and six indicators describing stability in terms of profitability, volume, overbought/oversold conditions and volatility. The results of the research present that during the pandemic it was possible to identify 5 clusters of sector indices in the short term and 4 in the medium term. We found that the composition of the clusters is quite stable over time and that none of the obtained clusters can be univocally considered the most or the least stable taking into account all the analyzed indicators.

We aimed to establish whether blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration was associated with COVID-19 risk, and whether it explained the higher incidence of COVID-19 in black and South Asian people. METHODS: UK Biobank recruited 502,624 participants aged 37-73 years between 2006 and 2010. Baseline exposure data, including 25(OH)D concentration and ethnicity, were linked to COVID-19 test results. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed for the association between 25(OH)D and confirmed COVID-19, and the association between ethnicity and both 25(OH)D and COVID-19. RESULTS: Complete data were available for 348,598 UK Biobank participants. Of these, 449 had confirmed COVID-19 infection. Vitamin D was associated with COVID-19 infection univariably (OR = 0.99; 95% CI 0.99-0.999; p = 0.013), but not after adjustment for confounders (OR = 1.00; 95% CI = 0.998-1.01; p = 0.208).

It typically presents with isolated psychiatric symptoms (e.g. depressed mood) at first and neurological abnormalities (e.g. seizures, movement disorders) only develop later. Thus, there is a high risk of overlooking NMDAR-E in patients with preexisting psychiatric illness due to symptom overlap in the prodromal period of the disease when treatment is most effective. Although rare, concomitant or sequential development of a demyelinating disorder is increasingly recognized as an associated disease entity (overlap syndrome), with immediate diagnostic and therapeutic implications. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a patient with a borderline personality disorder (BPD), which developed NMDAR-E and an overlapping demyelinating disorder with anti-Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) -IgG positivity. The initial clinical presentation with predominantly affective symptoms (e.g. mood lability, anxiety, depressed mood) lead us to suspect an exacerbation of the BPD at first. However, acute changes in premorbid behavior, newly developed psychotic symptoms and memory deficits lead us to the correct diagnosis of an AE, which was further complicated by the development of a demyelinating disorder. As a result of impaired illness awareness and psychosis, diagnostic and treatment was difficult to carry out. The symptoms completely remitted after treatment with methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 5 days and 5 cycles of plasma exchange. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous awareness for neuropsychiatric clinical warning signs in patients with a pre-diagnosed psychiatric disorder is important for a timely diagnosis. Therefore, we believe that the diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm provided here, for the first time specifically addressing patients with preexisting psychiatric illness and integrating overlap syndromes, can be a useful tool. Moreover, in order to timely perform diagnostics and treatment, judicial approval should be obtained rapidly.","output":"Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis and overlapping demyelinating disorder in a 20-year old female with borderline personality disorder: proposal of a diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm for autoimmune encephalitis in psychiatric patients case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Physical activity (PA) is important for health.

Risk assessment was classified as no risk, low, medium and high risk contact according to the \\"Algorithm of Assessment of Health Workers with COVID-19 Contact\\" of the Ministry of Health. The relationship between the risk levels of the participants and their demographic and workplace characteristics and their usage of personal protection were evaluated. Mean, standard deviation, percentage, chi-square and ANOVA tests were used in the analysis of the data. The average age of the healthcare workers was determined as 34.4  7.6 years. It was determined that 56.2% of those who had contact were female, 62.9% were married and 17.5% had an additional disease. It was determined that 45.6% of the risky contacts were nurses, 18.4% were supportive personnel and 16.9% were doctors. While 46.5% of the contacts were found as medium, 28.0% low, 17.1% high risk and 8.4% risk free. 38.2% of risky contacts occurred while working in internal/surgical clinics. While 66.0% of the employees had risky contact during patient care and treatment, 25% had risky contact with colleagues in social settings. High-risk contact was higher in social relations between employees. The source of the contact was a colleague in 73.2% of the employees. The average age of high-risk employees was smaller than those of low-risk. While 54.5% of the employees wore surgical masks during contact, 67.8% of the patients did not have a mask. Of 555 employees followed, 37 (6.7%) were diagnosed as COVID-19; 48.6% of the patients were nurses and 18.9% were doctors.

Unprotected contact of the employees with each other in the workplace was identified as an important risk source. Inadequate use of personal protective equipment by healthcare workers led to an increase in medium and high risk contacts. The use of masks by patients and their relatives during the health service delivery and the proper use of personal protective equipment by healthcare professionals will reduce the risk. With the physical improvement of the rest areas of the employees and the arrangement of the breaks, the risky contact between colleagues in the social areas will be reduced.","output":"[Assessment of COVID-19 Risky Contact of Healthcare Workers in an University Hospital]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated mitigation measures are highlighting resiliency and vulnerability of food systems with consequences for diets, food security, and health outcomes.

We support it is critical to adopt a food environment typology framework based on the different types of food environments that people have access to in order to examine how their relationship with food environments shift with disruptions such as COVID-19 and, ultimately impact diets and food security. Here, we provide an overview of applying a food environment typology framework for developing and implementing a rapid tool to evaluate the effects of COVID-19 on interactions people have with their food environments. This tool was developed on the basis of a preliminary case study with smallholder farmers in China that generated a set of key hypotheses. We modified the tool in order to be applicable to diverse contexts in low-, middle-, and high-income countries.

We analyze online survey data from the nationally representative Understanding America Study (UAS) covering the period of March 10-31st 2020 (sample size: 6,585). Mental health is assessed by the validated PHQ-4 instrument for measuring symptoms of depression and anxiety. About 29% (CI:27.4-.30.4%) of the US adult population reported some depression/anxiety symptoms over the study period, with symptoms deteriorating over the month of March. Worsening mental health was most strongly associated with concerns about the economic consequences of the pandemic, while concerns about the potential implications of the virus for respondents own health and social distancing also predicted increases in symptoms of depression and anxiety during the early stages of the pandemic in the US, albeit less strongly. Our findings point towards the possibility of a major mental health crisis unfolding simultaneously with the pandemic, with economic concerns being a key driving force of this crisis. These results highlight the likely importance of economic countermeasures and social policy for mitigating the impact of Covid-19 on adult mental health in the US over and above an effective public health response.","output":"Predictors of mental health during the Covid-19 pandemic in the US: Role of economic concerns, health worries and social distancing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has substantially impacted maternity care provision worldwide. Studies based on modelling estimated large indirect effects of the pandemic on services and health outcomes. The objective of this study was to prospectively document experiences of frontline maternal and newborn healthcare providers. METHODS: We conducted a global, cross-sectional study of maternal and newborn health professionals via an online survey disseminated through professional networks and social media in 12 languages. Information was collected between 24 March and 10 April 2020 on respondents background, preparedness for and response to COVID-19 and their experience during the pandemic. An optional module sought information on adaptations to 17 care processes. Descriptive statistics and qualitative thematic analysis were used to analyse responses, disaggregating by low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) and high-income countries (HICs). RESULTS: We analysed responses from 714 maternal and newborn health professionals. Only one-third received training on COVID-19 from their health facility and nearly all searched for information themselves. Half of respondents in LMICs received updated guidelines for care provision compared with 82% in HICs. Overall, 47% of participants in LMICs and 69% in HICs felt mostly or completely knowledgeable in how to care for COVID-19 maternity patients. Facility-level responses to COVID-19 (signage, screening, testing and isolation rooms) were more common in HICs than LMICs. Globally, 90% of respondents reported somewhat or substantially higher levels of stress. There was a widespread perception of reduced use of routine maternity care services, and of modification in care processes, some of which were not evidence-based practices. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial knowledge gaps exist in guidance on management of maternity cases with or without COVID-19. Formal information-sharing channels for providers must be established and mental health support provided. Surveys of maternity care providers can help track the situation, capture innovations and support rapid development of effective responses.","output":"Voices from the frontline: findings from a thematic analysis of a rapid online global survey of maternal and newborn health professionals facing the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Solid organ transplants (SOTs) are life-saving interventions, recently challenged by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SOTs require a multistep process, which can be affected by COVID-19 at several phases. METHODS. SOT-specialists, COVID-19-specialists, and medical ethicists designed an international survey according to CHERRIES guidelines. Personal opinions about continuing SOTs, safe managing of donors and recipients, as well as equity of resources allocation were investigated. The survey was sent by e-mail. Multiple approaches were used (corresponding authors from Scopus, websites of scientific societies, COVID-19 webinars). After the descriptive analysis, univariate and multivariate ordinal regression analysis was performed. RESULTS. There were 1819 complete answers from 71 countries. The response rate was 49%. Data were stratified according to region, macrospecialty, and organ of interest. Answers were analyzed using univariate-multivariate ordinal regression analysis and thematic analysis. Overall, 20% of the responders thought SOTs should not stop (continue transplant without restriction); over 70% suggested SOTs should selectively stop, and almost 10% indicated they should completely stop. Furthermore, 82% agreed to shift resources from transplant to COVID-19 temporarily. Briefly, main reason for not stopping was that if the transplant will not proceed, the organ will be wasted. Focusing on SOT from living donors, 61% stated that activity should be restricted only to urgent cases. At the multivariate analysis, factors identified in favor of continuing transplant were Italy, ethicist, partially disagreeing on the equity question, a high number of COVID-19-related deaths on the day of the answer, a high IHDI country. Factors predicting to stop SOTs were Europe except-Italy, public university hospital, and strongly agreeing on the equity question. CONCLUSIONS. In conclusion, the majority of responders suggested that transplant activity should be continued through the implementation of isolation measures and the adoption of the COVID-19-free pathways. Differences between professional categories are less strong than supposed.","output":"Solid Organ Transplantation During COVID-19 Pandemic: An International Web-based Survey on Resources Allocation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to collect and identify airborne bacteria in Norway, Sweden and Finland and to compare three different technologies for identifying collected airborne bacterial isolates: the gold standard method 16S rDNA sequencing, MALDI-TOF MS using the MALDI Biotyper 2.0 and the MIDI Sherlock(?) Microbial Identification System (MIDI MIS system). Airborne bacteria were collected during three different periods from May to October 2009 using air sampling directly on agar plates. A total of 140 isolates were collected during three sampling campaigns, and 74 % (103) of these isolates were analyzed by all three methods. The dominant genera in Norway and Finland were the gram-positive bacteria Bacillus and Staphylococcus, whereas the gram-negative bacterium Acinetobacter was the dominant genus in Sweden. Using 16S rDNA sequencing, MALDI-TOF MS and MIDI MIS analysis, 83, 79 and 75 %, respectively, of the isolates were identified and assigned to order or higher taxonomic levels. In this study, the MALDI-TOF MS combining with the MALDI Biotyper 2.0 classification tool was demonstrated to be a fast and reliable alternative for identifying the airborne bacterial isolates. These studies have increased knowledge about the airborne bacterial background in outdoor air, which can be useful for evaluating and improving the operational performance of biological detectors in various environments.

The immune response of pregnant women to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and the interplay of how the maternal immune response affects the neonatal passive immunity have not been studied systematically. OBJECTIVE: We characterized the serologic response in pregnant women and studied how this serologic response correlates with the maternal clinical presentation and with the rate and level of passive immunity that the neonate received from the mother. STUDY DESIGN: Women who gave birth and who tested positive for immunoglobulin M or immunoglobulin G against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 using semiquantitative detection in a New York City hospital between March 22, 2020, and May 31, 2020, were included in this study. A retrospective chart review of the cases that met the inclusion criteria was conducted to determine the presence of coronavirus disease 2019 symptoms and the use of oxygen support. Serology levels were compared between the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients using a Welch 2 sample t test. Further chart review of the same patient cohort was conducted to identify the dates of self-reported onset of coronavirus disease 2019 symptoms and the timing of the peak immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G antibody levels after symptom onset was visualized using local polynomial regression smoothing on log2-scaled serologic values. To study the neonatal serology response, umbilical cord blood samples of the neonates born to the subset of serology positive pregnant women were tested for serologic antibody responses. The maternal antibody levels of serology positive vs the maternal antibody levels of serology negative neonates were compared using the Welch 2 sample t test. The relationship between the quantitative maternal and quantitative neonatal serologic data was studied using a Pearson correlation and linear regression. A multiple linear regression analysis was conducted using maternal symptoms, maternal serology levels, and maternal use of oxygen support to determine the predictors of neonatal immunoglobulin G levels. RESULTS: A total of 88 serology positive pregnant women were included in this study. The antibody levels were higher in symptomatic pregnant women than in asymptomatic pregnant women. Serology studies in 34 women with symptom onset data revealed that the maternal immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G levels peak around 15 and 30 days after the onset of coronavirus disease 2019 symptoms, respectively. Furthermore, studies of 50 neonates born to this subset of serology positive women showed that passive immunity in the form of immunoglobulin G is conferred in 78% of all neonates. The presence of passive immunity is dependent on the maternal antibody levels, and the levels of neonatal immunoglobulin G correlate with maternal immunoglobulin G levels. The maternal immunoglobulin G levels and maternal use of oxygen support were predictive of the neonatal immunoglobulin G levels. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that maternal serologies correlate with symptomatic maternal infection, and higher levels of maternal antibodies are associated with passive neonatal immunity. The maternal immunoglobulin G levels and maternal use of oxygen support, a marker of disease severity, predicted the neonatal immunoglobulin G levels. These data will further guide the screening for this uniquely linked population of mothers and their neonates and can aid in developing maternal vaccination strategies.","output":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 serology levels in pregnant women and their neonates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dalam perkembangan kasus COVID-19 di Indonesia wilayah DKI Jakarta dan Jawa Timur menjadi penyumbang tertinggi yang menjadikan semua area dalam provinsi ini dikategori sebagai zona merah.

Species diversity must reflect species compatibility and complementarity to manage the complexity in polyculture systems. There is a need for the implementation of innovative strategies that facilitate sustainable aquaculture development, enhance profitability, improve resilience, and support conservation and environmental protection. An aquaculture development scenario must look beyond the economic profitability and strategize aquatic food production systems to attain food and nutrition security and benefits for all stakeholders. ABSTRACT: Intensified agrochemical-based monoculture systems worldwide are under adoption to meet the challenge of human population growth and the ever-growing global demand for food. However, this path has been opposed and criticized because it involves overexploitation of land, monoculture of few species, excessive input of agrochemicals, and adverse impacts on human health and the environment. The wide diversity among polyculture systems practiced across the globe has created confusion over the priority of a single strategy towards sustainable aquaculture development and safer products. Herein, we highlight the significance of polyculture and integrated aquaculture practices in conveying the successful transition of the aquaculture industry towards sustainable development. So far, the established thought is that the precise selection of aquatic species and a focus on compatible and complementary species combinations are supposed to facilitate rapid progress in food production with more profitability and sustainability. Therefore, the advantages of species diversification are discussed from an ecological perspective to enforce aquaculture expansion. This account asserts that a diverse range of aquaculture practices can promote synergies among farmed species, enhance system resilience, enable conservation, decrease ecological footprints, and provide social benefits such as diversified income and local food security.","output":"Advantage of Species Diversification to Facilitate Sustainable Development of Aquaculture Sector"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) booster vaccination has been proposed in response to the new challenges of highly contagious variants, yet few studies have examined public acceptance of boosters. This study examined public acceptance of COVID-19 booster vaccination and its influencing factors by using the data from a self-administered online cross-sectional survey conducted in June 2021 in China. Multiple logistic analysis was used to examine the influencing factors of booster acceptance based on the health belief model (HBM). Among 1145 respondents, 84.80% reported to accept COVID-19 booster vaccination. Having COVID-19 vaccination history, perceiving high benefits and low barriers to booster vaccination, being younger (18C30 vs. 41C50), having a lower education level, being employed, and belonging to priority groups for vaccination were associated with increased odds of booster acceptance. The primary reason for refusing booster vaccination was concern about vaccine safety. The vast majority (92.8%) of respondents reported an annual willingness to pay between 0 and 300 CNY (0C46.29 USD) if the booster was not free. Our findings suggest that the acceptance rate of booster vaccination is relatively high in China, and the HBM-based analysis reveals that more efforts are needed to increase perceived benefits and reduce perceived barriers of vaccination to design effective and proper vaccination extension strategies when boosters become widely recommended.","output":"Public Perceptions and Acceptance of COVID-19 Booster Vaccination in China: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted obstetric anesthesiologists to reconsider the ways in which basic anesthesia care is provided on the Labor and Delivery Unit Suggested modifications include an added emphasis on avoiding general anesthesia, a strong encouragement to infected individuals to opt for early neuraxial analgesia, and the prevention of emergent cesarean delivery, whenever possible Through team efforts, adopting these measures can have real effects on reducing the transmission of the viral illness and maintaining patient and caregiver safety in the labor room","output":"What obstetricians should know about obstetric anesthesia during the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial of the Ad5-vectored COVID-19 vaccine was done in a single centre in Wuhan, China. Healthy adults aged 18 years or older, who were HIV-negative and previous severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection-free, were eligible to participate and were randomly assigned to receive the vaccine at a dose of 1  10(11) viral particles per mL or 5  10(10) viral particles per mL, or placebo. Investigators allocated participants at a ratio of 2:1:1 to receive a single injection intramuscularly in the arm. The randomisation list (block size 4) was generated by an independent statistician. Participants, investigators, and staff undertaking laboratory analyses were masked to group allocation. The primary endpoints for immunogenicity were the geometric mean titres (GMTs) of specific ELISA antibody responses to the receptor binding domain (RBD) and neutralising antibody responses at day 28. The primary endpoint for safety evaluation was the incidence of adverse reactions within 14 days. All recruited participants who received at least one dose were included in the primary and safety analyses. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04341389. FINDINGS: 603 volunteers were recruited and screened for eligibility between April 11 and 16, 2020. 508 eligible participants (50% male; mean age 397 years, SD 125) consented to participate in the trial and were randomly assigned to receive the vaccine (1  10(11) viral particles n=253; 5  10(10) viral particles n=129) or placebo (n=126). In the 1  10(11) and 5  10(10) viral particles dose groups, the RBD-specific ELISA antibodies peaked at 6565 (95% CI 5752C7492) and 5710 (4676C6973), with seroconversion rates at 96% (95% CI 93C98) and 97% (92C99), respectively, at day 28. Both doses of the vaccine induced significant neutralising antibody responses to live SARS-CoV-2, with GMTs of 195 (95% CI 168C227) and 183 (144C233) in participants receiving 1  10(11) and 5  10(10) viral particles, respectively. Specific interferon  enzyme-linked immunospot assay responses post vaccination were observed in 227 (90%, 95% CI 85C93) of 253 and 113 (88%, 81C92) of 129 participants in the 1  10(11) and 5  10(10) viral particles dose groups, respectively. Solicited adverse reactions were reported by 183 (72%) of 253 and 96 (74%) of 129 participants in the 1  10(11) and 5  10(10) viral particles dose groups, respectively. Severe adverse reactions were reported by 24 (9%) participants in the 1  10(11) viral particles dose group and one (1%) participant in the 5  10(10) viral particles dose group.

This study focuses on understanding the factors that influence consumers buying behaviour and model these factors to understand the causal relationship using partial least square-structural equation modelling. An online survey which was carried out between 30 March 2020 and 18 April 2020. A total of 367 responses were collected during this period. Findings of the study indicate that economic nationalism, lockdown sentiments and sustainable approach (LSSA), and product-specific ethnocentric behaviour (PSEB) tendency significantly influence the willingness to buy countrys own brands and products. Present study results reveal that during pandemic consumers have realized the importance of hygiene products, environment-friendly products, regional (local) products, and satisfaction beyond shopping;these factors determine their willingness to buy Indian brands (WBIB)/made-in-India products. Further, post lockdown and post COVID era, consumers feel that buying Indian-made products and encouraging others to buy them would impact and revive the Indian economy constructively. It was also found that the influence of factors such as economic nationalism, LSSA, and PSEB on the WBIB is mediated by attitude towards foreign products.

The IFNL4-G genotype, which encodes functional IFN-4 protein, is associated with a poor treatment response. In the present study, we investigated the induction and biological effects of IFN-4 in HCV-infected hepatocytes and their association with responsiveness to IFN-. We also studied the effects of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment on IFN-4 expression and IFN- responsiveness. HCV infection induced IFN-4 expression at mRNA and protein levels in primary human hepatocytes (PHHs). In hepatoma cells, IFNL4 gene transfection or recombinant IFN-4 protein treatment robustly increased the protein levels of ISG15 and USP18 in an IFNLR1-dependent manner and potently blocked IFN- signalling. The ISG15/USP18-mediated IFN- unresponsiveness was demonstrated by transfection of siRNAs targeting ISG15 and/or USP18. This potent IFN-4 effect was related to prolonged ISG expression after IFNL4 gene transfection. DAA treatment of HCV-infected PHHs reduced the expression of IFN-s, including IFN-4, and restored IFN- responsiveness.

Since ZNF proteins are immensely implicated in the development of several tumors including malignant tumors of the brain, here we explored the pathological role of ZNF554 in gliomas. We examined the expression of ZNF554 at mRNA and protein levels in normal brain and gliomas, and then we searched for genome-wide transcriptomic changes in U87 glioblastoma cells transiently overexpressing ZNF554. Immunohistochemistry of brain tissues in our cohort (n = 62) and analysis of large TCGA RNA-Seq data (n = 687) of control, oligodendroglioma, and astrocytoma tissues both revealed decreased expression of ZNF554 towards higher glioma grades. Furthermore, low ZNF554 expression was associated with shorter survival of grade III and IV astrocytoma patients. Overexpression of ZNF554 in U87 cells resulted in differential expression, mostly downregulation of 899 genes. The \\"PI3K-Akt signaling pathway\\", known to be activated during glioma development, was the most impacted among 116 dysregulated pathways.

This downturn prompted concern among transit managers and planners interested in service-side interventions to reverse the decline. However, relatively little is known about changes in the demand for public transit and how shifts in demand-side factors have affected patronage. Drawing on California data from the 2009 and 2017 National Household Travel Surveys, we quantify demand-side changes as a function of two factorschanges in ridership rates of various classes of transit riders (rate effects) and changes in the composition of those rider classes (composition effects). Statewide, we find that while shifts in the population composition were in some cases associated with lower levels of ridership, the largest declines in transit patronage were associated with falling ridership rates. Specifically, those with limited automobile access and Hispanic travelers rode transit far less frequently in 2017 compared to 2009.

We estimated the odds ratios (OR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) using adjusted logistic regression models. Results: Of the 8,177 students, 12.8% reported depressive symptoms, 25.6% anxiety, 8.7% insomnia, and 10.6% reported impulsive tracts, with higher proportions among females than males. Mental health symptoms were positively associated with caring for a person at home, a poor housing quality, and a worsening in working performance. Among males compared with females, a poor housing quality showed a stronger positive association with depressive symptoms and impulsivity, and a worsening in the working performance was positively associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms. In addition, the absence of private space was positively associated with depression and anxiety, stronger among males than females.

From an occupational safety & health (OSH) perspective, understanding how adaptations and behaviour changes have impacted workers is relevant to how organisations can preserve the health of their workers when adapting to future health emergencies. METHODS: Semi-structured qualitative focus groups were conducted during April/May 2021. Participants were Irish OSH practitioners. Participants volunteered from industrial sectors (public & private) as defined by the Central Statistics Office. Participants (n = 60) partook in one of sixteen, two-hour focus groups (4-6 participants per focus group) with each comprising four themes for discussion: organisational preparedness; organisational impacts; worker impacts; and the future of OSH. Thematic analyses were performed using NVivo. RESULTS: Most participants started developing adaptation measures in February/March 2020. Organisations with an international presence started developing adaptation measures earlier. As OSH professionals, most participants felt personally prepared for the challenges induced by the pandemic but did not anticipate the impact it had on their workload. Nearly all participants indicated that isolation, loneliness, fear, and anxiety had a negative impact on their co-workers' mental health. Many OSH practitioners indicated that their co-workers had responded well to the pandemic, and that positive behaviour changes and new adaptation measures had been sustained from the first wave through the third wave of the pandemic in Ireland. CONCLUSIONS: Workplace mental health evaluations and worker wellbeing initiatives must be prioritised post-pandemic. OSH will need to re-evaluate its relationship with organisational human resources in the future. KEY MESSAGES: Irish OSH practitioners responded well to the challenge presented by COVID-19 to protect their co-workers and maintain organisational continuity. COVID-19 has had a negative impact on the mental health of Irish workers as they respond to preserve their organisations operations. This will need to be addressed by organisations post-pandemic.","output":"COVID-19 workplace impacts - Irish OSH professionals experience and observations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Entry of the -coronavirus porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) requires specific proteases to activate spike (S) protein for the membrane fusion of the virion to the host cell following receptor binding. Herein, PEDV isolate 85-7 could proliferate and induce cellCcell fusion in a trypsin independent manner on Vero cells, and eight homologous mutation strains were screened by continuous proliferation in the absence of trypsin on Vero cells. According to the whole genome sequence comparative analysis, we identified four major variations located in nonstructural protein 2, S, open reading frame 3, and envelope (E) genes, respectively. Comparative analyses of their genomic variations and proliferation characteristics identified a single mutation within the S2 cleavage site between C30 and C40 mutants: the substitution of conserved arginine (R) by a glycine (G) (R895G). This change resulted in weaker cellCcell fusion, smaller plaque morphology, higher virus titer and serious microfilament condensation. Further analysis confirmed that this mutation was responsible for optimal cell-adaptation, but not the determinant for trypsin-dependent entry of PEDV. Otherwise, a novel variation (16C20 aa deletion and an L25P mutation) in the transmembrane domain of the E protein affected multiple infection processes, including up-regulation of the production of the ER stress indicator GRP78, improving the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8, and promoting apoptosis. The results of this study provide a better understanding of the potential mechanisms of viral functional proteins in PEDV replication, infection, and fitness.

Medical imaging modalities such as radiography play an important role in the fight against COVID-19. Deep learning (DL) techniques have been able to improve medical imaging tools and help radiologists to make clinical decisions for the diagnosis, monitoring and prognosis of different diseases. Computer-Aided Diagnostic (CAD) systems can improve work efficiency by precisely delineating infections in chest X-ray (CXR) images, thus facilitating subsequent quantification. CAD can also help automate the scanning process and reshape the workflow with minimal patient contact, providing the best protection for imaging technicians. The objective of this study is to develop a deep learning algorithm to detect COVID-19, pneumonia and normal cases on CXR images. We propose two classifications problems, (i) a binary classification to classify COVID-19 and normal cases and (ii) a multiclass classification for COVID-19, pneumonia and normal. Nine datasets and more than 3200 COVID-19 CXR images are used to assess the efficiency of the proposed technique. The model is trained on a subset of the National Institute of Health (NIH) dataset using swish activation, thus improving the training accuracy to detect COVID-19 and other pneumonia. The models are tested on eight merged datasets and on individual test sets in order to confirm the degree of generalization of the proposed algorithms. An explainability algorithm is also developed to visually show the location of the lung-infected areas detected by the model. Moreover, we provide a detailed analysis of the misclassified images. The obtained results achieve high performances with an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.97 for multi-class classification (COVID-19 vs. other pneumonia vs. normal) and 0.98 for the binary model (COVID-19 vs. normal).

Intraoperative autologous blood salvage and donation was performed in cases associated with significant hemoperitoneum. RESULTS Six cases of ovarian bleeding with ruptured corpus luteal cyst, three cases of adnexal torsion with corpus luteal cyst, and one case each of ruptured heterotopic ampullary pregnancy and heterotopic tubal stump isthmic pregnancy after salpingectomy were managed. For ruptured corpus luteal cyst, hemostasis was achieved by removal of hematoma followed by suturing. For adnexal torsion, detorsion with cyst aspiration was performed in two cases and detorsion alone was performed in one case. For ruptured heterotopic ampullary pregnancy, unilateral salpingectomy was performed. For ruptured heterotopic tubal stump isthmic pregnancy after salpingectomy, removal of the expelled villous tissue followed by hemostatic coagulation was performed. In five cases associated with massive hemoperitoneum, intraoperative autologous blood salvage and donation were performed to avoid homologous blood transfusion.

Here, we show that RIN13 is a nucleus-localized protein, and functions in the nucleus. Overexpression of RIN13 leads to autoimmunity with high accumulation of salicylic acid (SA), constitutive expressions of pathogenesis-related genes, enhanced resistance to virulent pathogen, and dwarfism. In addition, genetic and transcriptome analysis show that SA-dependent and SA-independent pathways are both required for RIN13-mediated disease resistance with EDS1/PAD4 complex as an integration point. RIN13-induced dwarfism was rescued completely by either mutant pad4-1 or eds1-2 but partially by snc1-r1, a mutant of the TNL gene SNC1, suggesting the involvement of EDS1/PAD4 and SNC1 in RIN13 functioning. Furthermore, transient expression assays indicated that RIN13 promotes the nuclear accumulation of PAD4.

METHODS: We included adult treated hypertensives who performed an HBP monitoring (duplicate sitting BP readings in the morning, afternoon, and evening for 4 days, Omron HEM-705CP-II), laboratory measurements, transthoracic echocardiogram and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity. We selected HBPV indices from three different calculation approaches: coefficient of variation (CoV), difference between maximum and minimum BP (MMD), and morning BP increase (MI), and evaluated their correlation with left ventricular mass index, relative wall thickness (RWT), ejection fraction, arterial stiffness and estimated glomerular filtration rate through a correlation matrix. For those variability indices significantly associated with HMOD, we constructed multiple linear regression models to determine independent predictors of HBPV. RESULTS: We included 204 patients, mean age 67.2 ( 13.8) years, 64% female. CoV and MMD for systolic BP showed the greatest correlation with HMOD.

To identify cellular proteins that interact with nsp1 and assist its function, we isolated host proteins proximal to nsp1 in human epithelial kidney cells by using a fusion protein, nsp1-BioID2. These isolated proteins are identified using mass spectroscopy and verified by western blot. Also, we are using computer-based modeling to predict the binding sites of these nsp1-interacting proteins. Methods and Results By comparing protein complexes, we identified a large group of proteins including ribosomal proteins that are likely involved in host shutoff. In addition to the ribosomal proteins, factors implicated in the stress granule formation and RNA processing are identified and verified. We have tested these interactions in multiple mutants that are known to affect the host shutoff activity of nsp1. Surprisingly, none of the mutations in the structured region of nsp1 disrupts any of these mutations. Conclusions BioID-mediated tagging of the host proteins proximal to nsp1 allows us to identify multiple pathways modulated by nsp1.","output":"The Impact of Mutations on the Functions of Nonstructural Protein 1 of SARS Coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent literature has reported a high percentage of asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic cases in subjects with COVID-19 infection This proportion can be difficult to quantify;therefore, it constitutes a hidden population This study aims to develop a proof-of-concept method for estimating the number of undocumented infections of COVID-19 This is the protocol for the INCIDENT (Hidden COVID-19 Cases Network Estimation) study, an online, cross-sectional survey with snowball sampling based on the network scale-up method (NSUM) The original personal network size estimation method was based on a fixed-effects maximum likelihood estimator We propose an extension of previous Bayesian estimation methods to estimate the unknown network size using the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm On 6 May 2020, 1963 questionnaires were collected, 1703 were completed except for the random questions, and 1652 were completed in all three sections The algorithm was initialized at the first iteration and applied to the whole dataset Knowing the number of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases is extremely important for reducing the spread of the virus Our approach reduces the number of questions posed This allows us to speed up the completion of the questionnaire with a subsequent reduction in the nonresponse rate","output":"Using Social Networks to Estimate the Number of COVID-19 Cases: The Incident (Hidden COVID-19 Cases Network Estimation) Study Protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper reflects on the context of lockdown in a global pandemic, where entire populations have experienced severe curtailments of the opportunity to exercise agency.

METHODS This retrospective study included 330 patients suspected of having COVID-19 from March 15 to April 16, 2020. We examined 306 patients upon initial presentation using both CT and real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR). The diagnostic performance of CT was calculated using rRT-PCR as a reference. Clinical and laboratory data, CT characteristics, and lesion distribution were assessed for patients with a confirmed diagnosis via rRT-PCR. RESULTS A total of 250 patients were finally diagnosed with COVID-19. Clinical and laboratory findings included myalgia or fatigue (76%), fever (64.8%), dry cough (60.8%), elevated levels of C-reactive protein (86.4%), procalcitonin (62%), and D-dimer (58.2%), increased neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (54.8%), and lymphopenia (34%). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the initial CT scan were 90.4% (95% IC, 86%-93%), 64.2% (95% IC, 50%-76%), 91.8% (95% IC, 88%-94%), and 60% (95% IC, 49%-69%), respectively. The percentage of patients diagnosed on the initial rRT-PCR test was 51.6% (n=129). Most frequent CT characteristics of COVID-19 in the subgroup of rRT-PCR-positive patients were multiple lesion (97.4%, n=220), followed by bilateral involvement (88.5%, n=200), peripheral distribution (74.3%, n=168), ground-glass opacity (GGO) (69.2%, n=157), subpleural curvilinear opacity (41.6%, n=104), and mixed GGOs (27.6%, n=67). CONCLUSION rRT-PCR may produce initial false negative results. For this reason, typical CT findings for COVID-19 should be known especially by radiologists. We suggest that patients with typical CT findings but negative rRT-PCR results should be isolated, and rRT-PCR should be repeated to avoid misdiagnosis.","output":"Diagnostic performance of low-dose chest CT to detect COVID-19: A Turkish population study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We developed a mathematical model to quantify the number of tests required to stop the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Methods We conducted a serologic survey of firefighters in Los Angeles, California, USA, in October 2020. Individuals were classified as seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 if they tested positive for immunoglobulin G, immunoglobulin M, or both. We compared demographic and contextual factors for seropositivity. Results Of 713 participants, 8.9% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Seropositivity was not associated with gender, age, or race/ethnicity. Furthermore, firefighters who worked in zip codes with lower income or higher share of minority population did not have higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Seropositivity was highest among firefighters who reported working in the vicinity of Los Angeles International Airport, which had a known outbreak in July 2020. Conclusions Seroprevalence among firefighters was no higher than seroprevalence in the general population, suggesting that workplace safety protocols, such as access to PPE and testing, can mitigate increased risk of infection at work.

The recent achievements in the resolution achieved in cryo-electron microscopy coupled with improvements in computational methodologies have accelerated the analysis of structures and properties of proteins. However, the detailed interaction between AAs has not been fully elucidated. Herein, we present a de novo method to evaluate inter-amino acid interactions based on the concept of accurately evaluating the amino acid bond pairs (AABP). The results obtained enabled the identification of complex 3d long-range interconnected AA interacting network in proteins. The method is applied to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We show that although nearest-neighbor AAs in the primary sequence have large AABP, other nonlocal AAs make substantial contribution to AABP with significant participation of both covalent and hydrogen bonding. Detailed analysis of AABP in RBD reveals the pivotal role they play in sequence conservation with profound implications on residue mutations and for therapeutic drug design.

In this single-centre study, we evaluated the laparoscopic approach of excision of the urachus leaving the umbilicus untouched. METHODS Twenty-one patients were operated on for persisting symptomatic urachal anomalies between 1998 and 2011. Patients included 8 males and 13 females (mean 28.5 years, range 15-72 years). Patients' histories, surgical data and demographic data were prospectively collected and analysed. During follow-up, patients were evaluated using the total body image and cosmesis questionnaire (BIQ). RESULTS Excision of the urachus was carried out in 18 cases in a laparoscopic three-trocar technique and in 3 cases using single-site surgery. In all cases, the infected umbilicus was left untouched. Mean surgical time of all procedures was 55.7 min (31-106 min). Histopathology confirmed an urachal anomaly in all cases. The former discharging or infected umbilicus healed without any complications. Sixteen patients could be included for the BIQ. Total body image score after surgery was 5.49 with a score of 5.0 being the most satisfactory result possible. The total cosmetic score was 21.37 close to the maximum score of 24. CONCLUSIONS The laparoscopic treatment of urachal anomalies using a three-trocar technique or the single-site surgery technique is both safe and effective.

Methods: Expressional profiling from two public datasets (GSE36961 and GSE141910) of human HCM and healthy control cardiac tissues was obtained from the GEO database. After data preprocessing, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were then screened between HCM and healthy control cardiac tissues in parallel. Gene Ontology, pathway functional enrichment, and gene set enrichment analysis were performed using DAVID and GSEA application. The compositional patterns of immune and stromal cells in HCM and control cardiac tissues were estimated based on the merged data using xCell. ProteinCprotein interaction (PPI) network and module analyses were constructed by STRING and Cytoscape applications. Gender-based expressional differences analyses were also conducted to explore gender differences in HCM. GSE130036 and clinical samples were used for verification analyses. Results: A total of 310 DEGs were identified. Upregulated DEGs were mainly enriched in adhesion and apoptotic process in the biological process. As for the downregulated DEGs, inflammatory response, innate immune response, phagosome, and JAK-STAT signaling pathway were highly enriched. Immune infiltration analyses suggested that the scores of macrophages, monocytes, DC, Th1, Treg, and plasma cells in the HCM group were significantly decreased, while CD8(+) T cells, basophils, fibroblasts, and platelets were significantly enriched. Module analyses revealed that STAT3, as the hub genes in HCM together with LYVE1(+)CD163(+) macrophages, may play a key role in the pathogenesis of HCM while there were no obvious gender differences in the HCM samples from selected datasets. Verification analyses performed on GSE130036 and clinical samples showed a strong positive correlation (Spearman correlation = 0.7646) and a good co-localization relationship between LYVE1 and CD163, suggesting the potential function of LYVE1(+)CD163(+) macrophages in maintaining the homeostasis of cardiac tissue.

There is limited data describing the course of liver injury occurrence in patients with different disease severity, and the causes and risk factors are unknown. We aim to investigate the incidence, characteristics, risk factors, and clinical outcomes of liver injury in patients with COVID-19. Methods: This retrospective observational study was conducted in three hospitals (Zhejiang, China). From January 19, 2020 to February 20, 2020, patients confirmed with COVID-19 (18 years) and without liver injury were enrolled and divided into non-critically ill and critically ill groups. The incidence and characteristics of liver injury were compared between the two groups. Demographics, clinical characteristics, treatments, and treatment outcomes between patients with or without liver injury were compared within each group. The multivariable logistic regression model was used to explore the risk factors for liver injury. Results: The mean age of 131 enrolled patients was 51.2 years (standard deviation [SD]: 16.1 years), and 70 (53.4%) patients were male. A total of 76 patients developed liver injury (mild, 40.5%; moderate, 15.3%; severe, 2.3%) with a median occurrence time of 10.0 days. Critically ill patients had higher and earlier occurrence (81.5 vs. 51.9%, 12.0 vs. 5.0 days; p &lt; 0.001), greater injury severity (p &lt; 0.001), and slower recovery (50.0 vs. 61.1%) of liver function than non-critically ill patients. Multivariable regression showed that the number of concomitant medications (odds ratio [OR]: 1.12, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05C1.21) and the combination treatment of lopinavir/ritonavir and arbidol (OR: 3.58, 95% CI: 1.44C9.52) were risk factors for liver injury in non-critically ill patients. The metabolism of arbidol can be significantly inhibited by lopinavir/ritonavir in vitro (p &lt; 0.005), which may be the underlying cause of drug-related liver injury. Liver injury was related to increased length of hospital stay (mean difference [MD]: 3.2, 95% CI: 1.3C5.2) and viral shedding duration (MD: 3.0, 95% CI: 1.0C4.9). Conclusions: Critically ill patients with COVID-19 suffered earlier occurrence, greater injury severity, and slower recovery from liver injury than non-critically ill patients.

With the mutation of the virus, the severity of the disease in this vulnerable group may vary in different waves of COVID-19 subtypes. The aim of this study is to define the demographic, clinical, laboratory, and mortality results of pregnant COVID-19 patients according to three time frames (March to December 2020, January to June 2021, and July to November 2021). Materials and methods The data of patients admitted to the ICU between March 23, 2020, and November 30, 2021, were retrospectively scanned. Pregnant patients with SARS-CoV-2 PCR test positivity or pregnant patients with COVID-19 who have a negative PCR test but symptoms of COVID-19 and radiological findings consistent with COVID-19 on thorax CT who need intensive care were included in the study. The patients were divided into three groups according to the dates when the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Turkey reported the variants of COVID-19 in Turkey. The nonvariant type was dominant in the first period (March to December 2020), alpha and beta variants were dominant in the second period (January to June 2021), and the delta variant appeared in the last period (July to November 2021). Demographic, clinical, and laboratory findings at the first admission to the ICU and mortality rates of the patients were recorded. Results PCR test was performed in all 109 patients, of whom 101 were PCR test positive. In other eight patients, despite the negative PCR test, thorax CT findings were typical of COVID-19 pneumonia, and other bacterial and viral agents were also excluded. The mean age of the patients was 30.53 years, the mean APACHE II score was 9.68, and the mean gestational age was 28.55 weeks. Around 72.5% of the patients were in the third trimester. Of the 101 PCR-positive patients, 20.2% were delta variants, 16.5% alpha or beta variants, and 63.3% were of unknown variants. Five of the patients were vaccinated. The most common symptom was dyspnea (94.5%), and the most common comorbidity was hypothyroidism (9.17%). Invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) was needed in 44.95% of pregnant patients. The distribution of pregnant patients admitted to the ICU according to the periods March to December 2020, January to June 2021, and July to November 2021 was 16.5%, 21.1%, and 62.4%, respectively (p<0.001). Two groups of patients were compared: those that survived versus those that deceased. Variables predicting mortality were APACHE score, IMV requirement, length of stay in the ICU, prone positioning, Anakinra treatment, and ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenator) requirement, which were significantly higher in the deceased group than in the living group (p<0.001, p<0.001, p=0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001, and p=0.001, respectively). There was no significant difference between the patients' age, gestational age, variants, treatments other than Anakinra, and the number of patients admitted to the ICU in the three periods (p=0.667, p=0.174, p=0.904, and p=0.605, respectively).In the multiple logistic regression analysis for mortality, high APACHE II score and IMV requirement were found as risk factors for mortality.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to create a granular NPI data set at the county level and then analyze the relationship between NPI policies and changes in reported COVID-19 cases. METHODS: Using a standardized crowdsourcing methodology, we collected time-series data on 7 key NPIs for 1320 US counties. RESULTS: This open-source data set is the largest and most comprehensive collection of county NPI policy data and meets the need for higher-resolution COVID-19 policy data. Our analysis revealed a wide variation in county-level policies both within and among states (P<.001). We identified a correlation between workplace closures and lower growth rates of COVID-19 cases (P=.004). We found weak correlations between shelter-in-place enforcement and measures of Democratic local voter proportion (R=0.21) and elected leadership (R=0.22).

The aim of this research is to quantify the impact of the pandemic on an interventional radiographers wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Ethical approval was obtained.at the outset of this study. An explanatory sequential mixed methods approach, using questionnaires and interviews, was used to explore and evaluate interventional radiographers wellbeing; physical, mental and social. An electronic self-administered questionnaire was administered to interventional radiographers and a semi-structured interview was conducted on two respondents. RESULTS: Responses were received from 40 interventional radiographers. Physical, mental and social wellbeing of interventional radiographers deteriorated since the onset of COVID-19. All forms of wellbeing were negatively impacted during the pandemic with mental wellbeing (82.5%) the most impacted, closely followed by physical (75%) and social wellbeing (50%). Half of responding interventional radiographers reported being highly stressed while working during COVID-19. Physical activity levels decreased, caffeine consumption increased and consumption of a healthy diet decreased. Almost all interventional radiographers (95%) had anxiety about passing the virus onto family or friends and 60% of noted a deterioration in relationship with friends. Three key themes identified included the importance of teamwork, the physical demand and mental impacts of working in interventional radiology during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative effect on interventional radiographers wellbeing.

There is no licensed antiviral treatment for either of the two abovementioned viruses. Bearing in mind that the antiviral effect of indole alkaloids has been reported for other arboviral models, the present study proposed to evaluate the antiviral in vitro and in silico effects of four indole alkaloids on infections by these two viruses in different cell lines. METHODS: The antiviral effects of voacangine (VOAC), voacangine-7-hydroxyindolenine (VOAC-OH), rupicoline and 3-oxo voacangine (OXO-VOAC) were evaluated in Vero, U937 and A549 cells using different experimental strategies (Pre, Trans, Post and combined treatment). Viral infection was quantified by different methodologies, including infectious viral particles by plating, viral genome by RT-qPCR, and viral protein by cell ELISA. Moreover, molecular docking was used to evaluate the possible interactions between structural and nonstructural viral proteins and the compounds. The results obtained from the antiviral strategies for each experimental condition were compared in all cases with the untreated controls. Statistically significant differences were identified using a parametric Students t-test. In all cases, p values below 0.05 (p < 0.05) were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: In the pre-treatment strategy in Vero cells, VOAC and VOAC-OH inhibited both viral models and OXO-VOAC inhibited only ZIKV; in U937 cells infected with CHIKV/Col, only VOAC-OH inhibited infection, but none of the compounds had activity in A549 cells; in U937 cells and A549 cells infected with ZIKV/Col, the three compounds that were effective in Vero cells also had antiviral activity. In the trans-treatment strategy, only VOAC-OH was virucidal against ZIKV/Col. In the post-treatment strategy, only rupicoline was effective in the CHIKV/Col model in Vero and A549 cells, whereas VOAC and VOAC-OH inhibited ZIKV infection in all three cell lines. In the combined strategy, VOAC, VOAC-OH and rupicoline inhibited CHIKV/Col and ZIKV/Col, but only rupicoline improved the antiviral effect of ZIKV/Col-infected cultures with respect to the individual strategies. Molecular docking showed that all the compounds had favorable binding energies with the structural proteins E2 and NSP2 (CHIKV) and E and NS5 (ZIKV). CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that indole alkaloids are promising antiviral drugs in the process of ZIKV and CHIKV infection; however, the mechanisms of action evaluated in this study would indicate that the effect is different in each viral model and, in turn, dependent on the cell line.

Methods We did a retrospective observational cohort study at 13 hospitals within the Hackensack Meridian Health network (NJ, USA). We included patients (aged 18 years) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who needed support in the ICU. We obtained data from a prospective observational database and compared outcomes in patients who received tocilizumab with those who did not. We applied a multivariable Cox model with propensity score matching to reduce confounding effects. The primary endpoint was hospital-related mortality.

Findings Between March 1 and April 22, 2020, 764 patients with COVID-19 required support in the ICU, of whom 210 (27%) received tocilizumab. Factors associated with receiving tocilizumab were patients' age, gender, renal function, and treatment location. 630 patients were included in the propensity score-matched population, of whom 210 received tocilizumab and 420 did not receive tocilizumab. 358 (57%) of 630 patients died, 102 (49%) who received tocilizumab and 256 (61%) who did not receive tocilizumab. Overall median survival from time of admission was not reached (95% CI 23 daysCnot reached) among patients receiving tocilizumab and was 19 days (16C26) for those who did not receive tocilizumab (hazard ratio [HR] 071, 95% CI 056C089; p=00027). In the primary multivariable Cox regression analysis with propensity matching, an association was noted between receiving tocilizumab and decreased hospital-related mortality (HR 064, 95% CI 047C087; p=00040). Similar associations with tocilizumab were noted among subgroups requiring mechanical ventilatory support and with baseline C-reactive protein of 15 mg/dL or higher. Interpretation In this observational study, patients with COVID-19 requiring ICU support who received tocilizumab had reduced mortality. Results of ongoing randomised controlled trials are awaited.

The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 has been recognized as a valuable target of antivirals. However, the cell-free SARS-CoV-2 RdRp biochemical assay requires the conversion of nucleotide prodrugs into the active triphosphate forms, which regularly occurs in cells yet is a complicated multiple-step chemical process in vitro, and thus hinders the utility of this cell-free assay in the rapid discovery of RdRp inhibitors. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 exoribonuclease provides the proof-reading capacity to viral RdRp, thus creates relatively high resistance threshold of viral RdRp to nucleotide analog inhibitors, which must be examined and evaluated in the development of this class of antivirals. Here, we report a cell-based assay to evaluate the efficacy of nucleotide analog compounds against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and assess their tolerance to viral exoribonuclease-mediated proof-reading. By testing seven commonly used nucleotide analog viral polymerase inhibitors, Remdesivir, Molnupiravir, Ribavirin, Favipiravir, Penciclovir, Entecavir and Tenofovir, we found that both Molnupiravir and Remdesivir showed the strong inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, with EC50 value of 0.22 M and 0.67 M, respectively. Moreover, our results suggested that exoribonuclease nsp14 increases resistance of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp to nucleotide analog inhibitors. We also determined that Remdesivir presented the highest resistance to viral exoribonuclease activity in cells. Therefore, we have developed a cell-based SARS-CoV-2 RdRp assay which can be deployed to discover SARS-CoV-2 RdRp inhibitors that are urgently needed to treat COVID-19 patients.","output":"A cell-based assay to discover inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 RNA dependent RNA polymerase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main goal of this correlational study is to examine the changes in the amount and type of physical activity of students of various study programs during the coronavirus pandemic.

Our study aimed to identify risk factors (demographic and behavioral) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection among college students. We used data from a survey administered to students at a southern university in the US. The survey had a total of 765 respondents and this study included the 679 (88.8%) who responded about their SARS-CoV-2 infection status. We examined associations between population characteristics and reported SARS-CoV-2 infection and calculated prevalence ratios along with 95% confidence intervals. SARS-CoV-2 infection was 2.5 times more likely among current users of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) compared to those who do not use ENDS (95% confidence interval [CI]: (1.76-3.4)) and 2.8 times more likely among those who reported a high frequency of binge drinking compared to those who did not report binge drinking (95% CI: (1.81-4.36)). Current high frequency ENDS users were 2.76 (1.79-4.25) more likely to report SARS-CoV-2 infection than non-users. Current low frequency users of ENDS were 2.27 (1.53-3.37) times more likely to report SARS-CoV-2 infection than nonusers. A trend analysis among ENDS use frequency and SARS-CoV-2 infection was statistically significant, showing a significant dose response with increasing ENDS use.

For this reason, this study aims to review the recent advancements in mechanical fault diagnosis and fault prognosis in the manufacturing industry using machine learning methods. For this systematic review, we searched Web of Science, ACM Digital Library, Science Direct, Wiley Online Library, and IEEE Xplore between January 2015 and October 2021. Full-length studies that employed machine learning algorithms to perform mechanical fault detection or fault prognosis in manufacturing equipment and presented empirical results obtained from industrial case-studies were included, except for studies not written in English or published in sources other than peer-reviewed journals with JCR Impact Factor, conference proceedings and book chapters/sections. Of 4549 records, 44 primary studies were selected. In 37 of those studies, fault diagnosis and prognosis were performed using artificial neural networks (n = 12), decision tree methods (n = 11), hybrid models (n = 8), or latent variable models (n = 6), with one of the studies employing two different types of techniques independently. The remaining studies employed a variety of machine learning techniques, ranging from rule-based models to partition-based algorithms, and only two studies approached the problem using online learning methods. The main advantages of these algorithms include high performance, the ability to uncover complex nonlinear relationships and computational efficiency, while the most important limitation is the reduction in model performance in the presence of concept drift. This review shows that, although the number of studies performed in the manufacturing industry has been increasing in recent years, additional research is necessary to address the challenges presented by real-world scenarios.","output":"Machine learning techniques applied to mechanical fault diagnosis and fault prognosis in the context of real industrial manufacturing use-cases: a systematic literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic has created an extreme pressure on the global healthcare services.

Demographic and clinical characteristics and patient outcomes were investigated using machine learning tools to identify key biomarkers to predict the mortality of individual patient. A nomogram was developed for predicting the mortality risk among COVID-19 patients. Lactate dehydrogenase, neutrophils (%), lymphocyte (%), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and age (LNLCA)-acquired at hospital admission-were identified as key predictors of death by multi-tree XGBoost model. The area under curve (AUC) of the nomogram for the derivation and validation cohort were 0.961 and 0.991, respectively. An integrated score (LNLCA) was calculated with the corresponding death probability. COVID-19 patients were divided into three subgroups: low-, moderate-, and high-risk groups using LNLCA cutoff values of 10.4 and 12.65 with the death probability less than 5%, 5-50%, and above 50%, respectively.

The effect of this change on other cannabinoid end-points is still unknown, an observation surprising since thermo-TRPs are targeted by phytocannabinoids with often sub-micromolar affinity. To fill this gap, the ,-dimethylheptyl analogues of the five major phytocannabinoids [CBD (1a), (8)-THC (6a), CBG (7a), CBC (8a) and CBN (9a)] were prepared by total synthesis, and their activity on thermo-TRPs (TRPV1-4, TRPM8, and TRPA1) was compared with that of one of their natural analogues. Surprisingly, the DMH chain promoted a shift in the selectivity toward TRPA1, a target involved in pain and inflammatory diseases, in all investigated compounds. A comparative study of the putative binding modes at TRPA1 between DMH-CBC (8b), the most active compound within the series, and CBC (8a) was carried out by molecular docking, allowing the rationalization of their activity in terms of structureCactivity relationships.

Unfortunately, HFOV has limited monitoring of ventilation parameters and mechanical parameters of the respiratory system, which makes it difficult to adjust the continuous distension pressure (CDP) according to the individual patients airway status. Airway resistance Raw is one of the important parameters describing the mechanics of the respiratory system. The aim of the presented study was to verify in vitro whether the resistance of the respiratory system Rrs can be reliably determined during HFOV to evaluate Raw in pediatric and adult patients. An experiment was performed with a 3100B high-frequency oscillator, a physical model of the respiratory system, and a pressure and flow measurement system. The physical model with different combinations of resistance and compliance was ventilated during the experiment. The resistance Rrs was calculated from the impedance of the physical model, which was determined from the spectral density of the pressure at airway opening and the spectral cross-density of the gas flow and pressure at airway opening. Rrs of the model increased with an added resistor and did not change significantly with a change in compliance. The method is feasible for monitoring respiratory system resistance during HFOV and has the potential to optimize CDP settings during HFOV in clinical practice.","output":"Assessment of Respiratory System Resistance during High-Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation Based on In Vitro Experiment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In July 2019, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) initiated a major review of its health technology evaluation methods to update its methods guide.

Historically, few patients with high-risk AML achieved deep and durable remission with conventional chemotherapy; however, newer agents might be more effective in achieving MRD-negative remission. CPX-351 (dual-drug liposomal encapsulation of daunorubicin/cytarabine at a synergistic ratio) demonstrated MRD-negativity rates of 36-64% across retrospective studies in adults with newly diagnosed high-risk AML and 84% in pediatric patients with first-relapse AML. Venetoclax (BCL2 inhibitor) demonstrated MRD-negativity rates of 33-53% in combination with hypomethylating agents for high-risk subgroups in studies of older adults with newly diagnosed AML who were ineligible for intensive therapy and 65% in combination with chemotherapy in pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory AML. However, there is no consensus on optimal MRD methodology in AML, and the use of different techniques, sample sources, sensitivity thresholds, and the timing of assessments limit comparisons across studies.

This article points out, drawing on both of these theoretical discourses, that we must carefully structure emergency powers over the administration of courts taking care to maintain the realization of the principles of judicial independence and judicial accountability, which in emergencies necessitates a clear separation of the power to declare a state of emergency from the power to curtail court operations due to the emergency.

Our data showed that eight compounds (nafamostat mesylate (NM), loganin, fluvastatin sodium, atorvastatin calcium, lovastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin calcium, and pitavastatin calcium) and three compounds (NM, elesclomol, and simvastatin) increased the proportions of NK cells and CD3(+) T cells that expressed IFN- among PBMCs cultured with IL-12 and IL-15, respectively.

To achieve this goal, we observed the morphology, water droplet absorption, thermal (differential scanning calorimetry), mechanical, and airborne particle filtering capabilities, and also the microbial activities of a PCL cloth, to evaluate whether it is suitable to act as a filter in a face mask. We have produced a polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofiber cloth after electrospinning it onto a drum for 3 and 10 min, referred to hereafter as PCL-3 and PCL-10, respectively.

However, PCL-10 nanofiber membranes show pores with an average diameter of 1.42  0.34 m.

However, both PCL cloths contact angle values were lower compared to the control. The produced PCL cloths showed a lower water droplet absorption compared to the control. Thermal studies found that PCL is stable in extreme conditions and no plasticizing effect occurs due to the presence of a solvent.

Accumulating evidence suggests that immunotyping can indicate the comprehensive immune status in tumors and their immune microenvironment, which is closely associated with therapeutic response and vaccination potential. The aim of this study was to identify potent antigens in PAAD for mRNA vaccine development, and further distinguish immune subtypes of PAAD to construct an immune landscape for selecting suitable patients for vaccination. METHODS: Gene expression profiles and clinical information of 239 PAAD datasets were extracted from ICGC, and RNA-Seq data of 103 samples were retrieved from TCGA. GEPIA was used to calculate differential expression levels and prognostic indices, cBioPortal program was used to compare genetic alterations, and TIMER was used to explore correlation between genes and immune infiltrating cells. Consensus cluster was used for consistency matrix construction and data clustering, DAVID was used for functional annotation, and graph learning-based dimensional reduction was used to depict immune landscape. RESULTS: Six overexpressed and mutated tumor antigens associated with poor prognosis and infiltration of antigen presenting cells were identified in PAAD, including ADAM9, EFNB2, MET, TMOD3, TPX2, and WNT7A. Furthermore, five immune subtypes (IS1-IS5) and nine immune gene modules of PAAD were identified that were consistent in both patient cohorts. The immune subtypes showed distinct molecular, cellular and clinical characteristics. IS1 and IS2 exhibited immune-activated phenotypes and correlated to better survival compared to the other subtypes. IS4 and IS5 tumors were immunologically cold and associated with higher tumor mutation burden. Immunogenic cell death modulators, immune checkpoints, and CA125 and CA199, were also differentially expressed among the five immune subtypes. Finally, the immune landscape of PAAD showed a high degree of heterogeneity between individual patients. CONCLUSIONS: ADAM9, EFNB2, MET, TMOD3, TPX2, and WNT7A are potent antigens for developing anti-PAAD mRNA vaccine, and patients with IS4 and IS5 tumors are suitable for vaccination.","output":"Identification of tumor antigens and immune subtypes of pancreatic adenocarcinoma for mRNA vaccine development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper highlights issues, challenges, and lessons learnt from implementing a speech-language therapy teleclinic service delivery model by the Speech Sciences Program, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) during the wake of the recent COVID-19 pandemic.

Herein, we assessed the serological response against the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a large population working in one institution of the Paris conurbation. We set up two high-throughput and sensitive methods to assess SARS CoV-2 Nucleoprotein and Spike protein-specific IgG response along with a pseudo-neutralization assay in sera. We studied 1847 participants who also answered a web-based survey on clinical symptoms. Methods and Results In May-July 2020, 11% (95% CI: 9.7-12.6) of serums were positive for IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 N and S protein and 9.5% (CI:8.2-11.0) were pseudo-neutralizer. The prevalence of immunization was 11.6% (CI:10.2-13.2) considering positivity in at least one assays. In 5% (CI:3.9-7.1) of RT-qPCR positive individuals, no systemic IgGs were detected. Among immune individuals, 21% had been asymptomatic. Anosmia and ageusia occurred in 52% of the IgG-positive individuals and in 3% of the negative ones. In contrast, 30% of the anosmia-ageusia cases were seronegative suggesting that the true prevalence of infection may reach 16.6%. In sera obtained 4-8 weeks after the first sampling anti-N and anti-S IgG titers and pseudo-neutralization activity declined by 31%, 17% and 53%, respectively with half-life of 35, 87 and 28 days, respectively. Conclusions The population studied being not particularly exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection is representative of active workers in the Paris conurbation, suggesting that the current epidemiological models may underestimate the true prevalence of infection.

In this review, the authors reveal practical aspects that are important during the COVID-19 pandemic with regards to the safe delivery of cardiac anesthesia. Timing for operations of the cardio-vascular system may be well programmed in most cases. Hence, the level of priorities must be defined for any single patient. The postponement of surgery may be convenient for most cases, if it is made in the best interest of the patient. The preanesthetic evaluation should be attentive of the respiratory history of the patient. Cardiac anesthesia always implies some respiratory monitoring; hence the existing clinical situation of the patient's respiratory system should be clear. In case of emergency surgery, the patient should be treated as if they potentially have or are at risk for the virus. In the case of a COVID-19 confirmed or suspected patient, attention must be made to preserve operating room and team integrity. The machineries are to be draped with plastic to simplify the disinfection after the operation. Perioperative management of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients must strictly follow the most relevant international guidelines.

As no cure has been developed for COVID-19 disease yet, Italy has adopted restrictive measures to avoid the spread of the virus, causing different psychological reactions (e.g., stress, anxiety) that lead people to change lifestyle and in particular the consumer orientation toward food. In addition, the COVID-19 emergency had also affected the Italian economy, causing an 11.3% decrease in GDP (gross domestic product). All these changes gave rise to a sense of instability, but it is known that new possibilities may arise in these situations. In particular, the pandemic could be the turning point to make consumers aware of the close link between human health and the ecosystems, supporting the One Health perspective and enhancing the orientation to consumer sustainable food products. However, little is known about how the psychological reactions to COVID-19 emergency have affected the consumers' intention to purchase sustainable food products. In order to answer these questions, a representative sample of 1,004 Italian citizens, extracted by stratified sampling, answered an online survey between May the 12th and 18th 2020. The data were analyzed using ANOVA and contingency tables. The results show that during phase one of COVID-19 disease about 30% of the sample reported that have frequently (often and always) consumed the certified sustainable food products and about 20% of the sample have intention to increase the consumption of them in the next 6 months, percentages that increase among those who feel more vulnerable regarding the risk contagion. Moreover, the psychological impact of the COVID-19 emergency has led to a change in consumers' attitudes, increasing the interest in animal and environmental issues and in human health. These aspects seem to drive the future intention of purchasing sustainable food products. This research highlights how the psychological reactions to the health emergency have changed the consumers' attitudes toward sustainability issues, leading them to follow a more sustainable diet that is recognized as a way to preserve human health, environmental preservation, and animal welfare for present and future generations.","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 Outbreak in Italy on the Sustainable Food Consumption Intention From a One Health Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about an urgent need for effective treatment, while conserving vital resources such as intensive care unit beds and ventilators.

CASE SUMMARY: A 72-year-old woman was admitted to the intensive care unit for mechanical ventilation because of respiratory insufficiency secondary to COVID-19 viral pneumonia. Seven days after admission, she developed new negative T-waves and a prolonged QTc interval on electrocardiography (ECG). Troponin levels were mildly elevated. Echocardiography showed a poor left ventricular systolic function with apical ballooning consistent with the diagnosis Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Seven days afterwards, the ECG and troponin levels normalized. Echocardiography showed improvement of left ventricular systolic function, however with persistent hypokinesia of the apical segments. Coronary artery disease was excluded using coronary computed tomography angiography. The patient was discharged home and follow-up echocardiography after 3 months showed normal contractility of the apical myocardial segments, with normalization of the left ventricular systolic function, as expected in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 caregivers should be aware of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy as complication of COVID-19, since regular use of QT-prolonging drugs combined with prolongation of the QTc interval in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy may lead to life-threatening arrhythmias. Furthermore, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy may lead to acute heart failure and even cardiogenic shock. Frequent ECG monitoring of COVID-19 patients therefore is of paramount importance and timely echocardiography should be obtained when ECG abnormalities or haemodynamical problems occur.","output":"Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in COVID-19: a case report.

METHODS: Linked pseudonymised records for asymptomatic residents in Liverpool who received a LFT for COVID-19 between 6th November 2020 to 31st January 2021 were accessed using the Combined Intelligence for Population Health Action resource. Bayesian Hierarchical Poisson Besag, York, and Molli models were used to estimate ecological associations for uptake and positivity of testing. FINDINGS: 214 525 residents (43%) received a LFT identifying 5192 individuals as positive cases of COVID-19 (1.3% of tests were positive). Uptake was highest in November when there was military assistance. High uptake was observed again in the week preceding Christmas and was sustained into a national lockdown. Overall uptake were lower among males (e.g. 40% uptake over the whole period), Black Asian and other Minority Ethnic groups (e.g. 27% uptake for Mixed ethnicity) and in the most deprived areas (e.g. 32% uptake in most deprived areas). These population groups were also more likely to have received positive tests for COVID-19. Models demonstrated that uptake and repeat testing were lower in areas of higher deprivation, areas located further from test sites and areas containing populations less confident in the using Internet technologies.

Furthermore, the viral spike protein expresses an RGD motif, suggesting that cell surface integrins may be attachment co-receptors. However, using infectious SARS-CoV-2 requires a biosafety level 3 laboratory (BSL-3), which limits the techniques that can be used to study the mechanism of cell entry. Here, we UV-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 and fluorescently labeled the envelope membrane with octadecyl rhodamine B (R18) to explore the role of integrin activation in mediating both cell entry and productive infection. We used flow cytometry and confocal fluorescence microscopy to show that fluorescently labeled SARS-CoV-2R18 particles engage basal-state integrins. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Mn2+, which activates integrins and induces integrin extension, enhances cell binding and entry of SARS-CoV-2R18 in proportion to the fraction of integrins activated. We also show that one class of integrin antagonist, which binds to the I MIDAS site and stabilizes the inactive, closed conformation, selectively inhibits the engagement of SARS-CoV-2R18 with basal state integrins, but is ineffective against Mn2+-activated integrins. At the same time, RGD-integrin antagonists inhibited SARS-CoV-2R18 binding regardless of integrin activity state. Integrins transmit signals bidirectionally: inside-out signaling primes the ligand binding function of integrins via a talin dependent mechanism and outside-in signaling occurs downstream of integrin binding to macromolecular ligands. Outside-in signaling is mediated by G13 and induces cell spreading, retraction, migration, and proliferation. Using cell-permeable peptide inhibitors of talin, and G13 binding to the cytoplasmic tail of an integrins {beta} subunit, we further demonstrate that talin-mediated signaling is essential for productive infection by SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Integrin activation is an essential component of SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Deep learning technology has been widely used in edge computing.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Retrospective analysis of 87 patients from a prospective thrombectomy registry. Collateral status on CTA source images was categorized into good, moderate, and poor with the Tan and Miteff scores by two-blinded readers. Association between CTA collateral status and successful recanalization was investigated with univariate regression analysis. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyse the association between collateral score and favourable clinical outcome (mRS 0-2) and death at follow-up. RESULTS Mean age was 72.5 years and baseline median NIHSS score was 15. Patients with poor collaterals on Tan score had a significant higher mortality compared with moderate or good collaterals during a mean follow-up period of 5.2 months (85.7% vs. 30.6% vs. 25.7%, P<0.001). Univariate logistic regression analysis did not show a significant association between Tan score (OR 1.681, 95% CI 0.683-4.140) and successful recanalization. Higher age (OR 1.067, 95% CI 1.013-1.124; P=0.015) and lower Tan score (OR 0.421, 95% CI 0.192-0.922; P=0.031) were independent predictors of death at follow-up on multivariate analysis. The Miteff collateral score could be assessed only in 65 of the 87 patients and the Tan collateral score had a higher interrater reliability. CONCLUSIONS Poor collaterals on CTA were associated with a very high rate of fatal outcome in anterior circulation stroke patients despite a high rate of successful recanalization with stent retrievers.","output":"The association between collateral status, recanalization and long term outcome in stroke patients treated with stent retrievers - Are there indications not to perform thrombectomy based on CT angiography?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Public health guidelines have recommended that elective medical procedures, including deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery for Parkinson's disease (PD), should not be scheduled during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic to prevent further virus spread and overload on health care systems However, delaying DBS surgery for PD may not be in the best interest of individual patients and is not called for in regions where virus spread is under control and inpatient facilities are not overloaded Methods: We administered a newly developed phone questionnaire to 20 consecutive patients with PD who received DBS surgery in Ruijin Hospital in Shanghai during the COVID-19 pandemic The questionnaire was designed to gather the patients experiences and perceptions on the impact of COVID-19 on their everyday activities and access to medical care Results: Most of the patients felt confident about the preventive measures taken by the government and hospitals, and they have changed their daily living activities accordingly Moreover, a large majority of patients felt confident obtaining access to regular and COVID-19-related health care services if needed Routine clinical referral, sense of security in the hospital during the outbreak, and poor control of PD symptoms were the three main reasons given by patients for seeking DBS surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has considerably impacted medical care and patients lives but elective procedures, such as DBS surgery for PD, do not need to be rescheduled when the health care system is not overloaded and adequate public health regulations are in place","output":"Deep Brain Stimulation for Parkinsons Disease During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Patient Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Remdesivir is an antiviral agent that has shown broad-spectrum activity, including against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Clinical trials investigating the role of remdesivir in coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) reported conflicting results. This study aimed to systematically review the best available evidence and synthesize the results. Several electronic databases were searched for candidate studies up to 12 October 2020. Studies eligible for meta-analysis were selected based on the inclusion criteria. Primary outcomes are the recovery and mortality rates, while secondary outcomes are the safety profile of remdesivir. The main effective measures are the rate ratio (RR) and rate difference (RD). Four clinical trials and one observational study were included. Remdesivir treatment for 10 days increased the recovery rate on day 14 by 50% among severe Covid-19 patients (RR = 1.5, 95%CI = 1.33-1.7), while on day 28 it was increased by 14% among moderate and severe Covid-19 patients (RR = 1.14, 95%CI = 1.06-1.22). Additionally, remdesivir decreased the mortality rate on day 14 by 36% among all patients (RR = 0.64, 95%CI = 0.45-0.92) but not on day 28 (RR = 1.05, 95%CI = 0.56-1.97).

Remdesivir reduced serious adverse effects by absolute 6% and no significant Grade 3 or 4 adverse effects were reported. At this early stage of the pandemic, there is evidence that remdesivir can be safely administered for hospitalized Covid-19 patients.

Although many synthetic heterocycles, such as 4-thiazolidinone (4-TZD), have been synthesized, their potential applications have not yet been fully investigated. However, many researchers have reported relevant results that can be a basis for the search for new potential drugs. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxic, cytostatic, and antibacterial effects of certain 4-thiazolidinone-based derivatives, Les-3166, Les-5935, Les-6009, and Les-6166, on human fibroblasts (BJ), neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y), epithelial lung carcinoma (A549), and colorectal adenocarcinoma (CACO-2) cell lines in vitro. All tested compounds applied in a concentration range from 10 to 100 M were able to decrease metabolic activity in the BJ, A549, and SH-SY5Y cell lines. However, the action of Les-3166 was mainly based on the ROS-independent pathway, similarly to Les-6009. In turn, Les-5935 and Les-6166 were able to promote ROS production in BJ, A549, and SH-SY5Y cells, compared to the control. Les-3166, Les-6009, and Les-6166 significantly increased the caspase-3 activity, especially at the concentrations of 50 M and 100 M. However, Les-5935 did not induce apoptosis. Only Les-5935 showed a minor cytostatic effect on SH-SY5Y cells. Additionally, the antibacterial properties of the tested compounds against P. aeruginosa bacterial biofilm can be ranked as follows: Les-3166 > Les-5935 > Les-6009. Les-6166 did not show any anti-biofilm activity. In summary, the study showed that Les-5935, Les-6009, and Les-6166 were characterized by anticancer properties, especially in the human lung cancer cell.

However, the effect of stent design on long-term durability of carotid artery stenting (CAS) is unknown. We compared the medium- to long-term risk of restenosis and ipsilateral stroke between patients treated with open-cell stents versus closed-cell stents in the ICSS (International Carotid Stenting Study). Methods- Patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis were randomized to CAS or endarterectomy and followed with duplex ultrasound for a median of 4.0 years. We analyzed data from patients with completed CAS procedures, known stent design, and available ultrasound follow-up. The primary outcome, moderate or higher restenosis (50%) was defined as a peak systolic velocity of >1.3 m/s on ultrasound or occlusion of the treated internal carotid artery and analyzed with interval-censored models. Results- Eight hundred fifty-five patients were allocated to CAS. Seven hundred fourteen patients with completed CAS and known stent design were included in the current analysis. Of these, 352 were treated with open-cell and 362 with closed-cell stents. Moderate or higher restenosis occurred significantly less frequently in patients treated with open-cell (n=113) than closed-cell stents (n=154; 5-year risks were 35.5% versus 46.0%; unadjusted hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.53-0.88). There was no significant difference in the risk of severe restenosis (70%) after open-cell stenting (n=27) versus closed-cell stenting (n=43; 5-year risks, 8.6% versus 12.7%; unadjusted hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.37-1.05). The risk of ipsilateral stroke beyond 30 days after treatment was similar with open-cell and closed-cell stents (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.35-1.75). Conclusions- Moderate or higher restenosis after CAS occurred less frequently in patients treated with open-cell stents than closed-cell stents.

In Europe, this is of particular relevance with ageing populations living with non-communicable diseases, multi-morbidity and frailty. Published estimates of Years Lived with Disability (YLD) from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study help to characterise the extent of these effects. Our aim was to identify the countries across Europe that have populations at highest risk from COVID-19 by using estimates of population age structure and YLD for health conditions linked to severe illness from COVID-19. METHODS: Population and YLD estimates from GBD 2017 were extracted for 45 countries in Europe. YLD was restricted to a list of specific health conditions associated with being at risk of developing severe consequences from COVID-19 based on guidance from the United Kingdom Government. This guidance also identified individuals aged 70 years and above as being at higher risk of developing severe health consequences. Study outcomes were defined as: (i) proportion of population aged 70 years and above; and (ii) rate of YLD for COVID-19 vulnerable health conditions across all ages. Bivariate groupings were established for each outcome and combined to establish overall population-level vulnerability. RESULTS: Countries with the highest proportions of elderly residents were Italy, Greece, Germany, Portugal and Finland. When assessments of population-level YLD rates for COVID-19 vulnerable health conditions were made, the highest rates were observed for Bulgaria, Czechia, Croatia, Hungary and Bosnia and Herzegovina. A bivariate analysis indicated that the countries at high-risk across both measures of vulnerability were: Bulgaria; Portugal; Latvia; Lithuania; Greece; Germany; Estonia; and Sweden. CONCLUSION: Routine estimates of population structures and non-fatal burden of disease measures can be usefully combined to create composite indicators of vulnerability for rapid assessments, in this case to severe health consequences from COVID-19. Countries with available results for sub-national regions within their country, or national burden of disease studies that also use sub-national levels for burden quantifications, should consider using non-fatal burden of disease estimates to estimate geographical vulnerability to COVID-19.","output":"Population vulnerability to COVID-19 in Europe: a burden of disease analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anesthesia providers are at risk for contracting COVID-19 due close patient contact. Proper personal protective equipment (PPE) use is critical to providing a safe environment and to minimize the risk of contagion. During the COVID-19 Pandemic, a series of supply chain issues, constant changes in PPE use policy, and higher demand for PPE led to shortages in PPE, specifically N95 masks and face shields. Implementation of decontamination protocols successfully allowed N95 mask reuse but, required masks to be unsoiled. Face shields not only act as a barrier against the soiling of N95 face masks, they also serve as more effective eye protection from respiratory droplets over standard eye shields. The University of Nebraska Medical Center produced face shields using a combination of 3D printing and assembly with commonly available products. Approximately 112 face shields were constructed and made available for use in 72 hours. Importantly, we created and implemented a simple but effective decontamination protocol, which allowed reuse of the face shields. These methods were successfully implemented for in-house production of face shields used at Tripler Army Medical Center (Tripler AMC, Hawaii). The effectiveness of the decontamination protocol was evaluated using the average log(10) reduction in colony counts for Escherichia coli ATCC 8937 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA).

The aim of this study was to estimate the proportion of acute cerebrovascular disease (CVD) among COVID-19 patients and evaluate their clinical and radiological characteristics in comparison with non-COVID-19 CVD. Materials and Methods: In a retrospective study, COVID-19 patients whom presented with CVD in Assiut and Aswan University Hospitals were compared with non-COVID-19, CVD patients, admitted to Qena University Hospital, prior to the pandemic. The following data were collected: clinical history and presentation, risk factors, comorbidities, brain imaging (MRI or CT), chest CT, and some laboratory investigations. Results: Fifty-five (12.5%) of the 439 patients with COVID-19 had acute CVD. Of them, 42 (9.6%) had ischemic stroke while 13 patients (2.9%) had hemorrhagic CVD. In the 250 cases of the non-COVID-19 group, 180 had ischemic stroke and 70 had hemorrhagic stroke. A large proportion of patients with COVID-19 who presented with ischemic stroke had large vessel occlusion (LVO), which was significantly higher than in non-COVID-19 patients with CVD (40 vs. 7.2%, P < 0.001). Comorbidities were recorded in 44 (80%) cases. In COVID-19 ischemic stroke patients, risk factors [hypertension and ischemic heart disease (IHD)] and comorbidities (hepatic and renal) were significantly higher than those in nonCCOVID-19 patients.

METHOD: A total of 54 patients with pustular psoriasis were randomly divided into control group (n = 14) and study group (n = 40). MTX was used in the control group, and different doses of acitretin were used in the study group, which were divided into low-dose group (n = 13), medium-dose group (n = 13), and high-dose group (n = 14). Symptom relief time, recurrence rate, GPPASI improvement rate, treatment response rate, BSA, DLQI score, and TLR7 and CXCL16 levels were compared among four groups. RESULT: The erythema, fever, and pustules disappeared in the low-dose group, the medium-dose group, and the high-dose group for a shorter time than control group, and it is shortest for the high-dose group. The low-dose, medium-dose, and high-dose groups had relatively lower recurrence rates at 1 month and 3 months (P < 0.05). The improvement rates of GPPASI50 of the four groups (the control group, low-dose group, medium-dose group, and high-dose group in turn) were 71.4%, 78.3%, 80.2%, and 80.8%; GPPASI75 of the four groups were 73.5%, 74.3%, 79.4%, and 80.9%; and GPPASI90 were 12.9%, 13.1%, 13.4%, and 13.8%. After treatment, the BSA and DLQI scores of the four groups were reduced. The BSA and DLQI scores of the study group decreased more significantly, and the high-dose group had the most significant improvement (P < 0.05). The incidence of adverse reactions in the four groups was 16.2%, 8.1%, 10.3%, and 14.7%, respectively. The high-dose group had a higher incidence of adverse reaction than the low-dose group (P < 0.05). The effective rates of treatment of the four groups were 69.1%, 86.9%, 88.2%, and 91.9%, respectively. The study group had higher treatment efficiency than the control group, and the high-dose group had the highest treatment efficiency (P < 0.05). After treatment, the level of serum TLR7 and CXCL16 was significantly reduced, but which in the study group decreased more significantly (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The clinical effect of a high dose of acitretin on pustular psoriasis is remarkable. It can reduce the recurrence rate and improve the quality of life and clinical symptoms.

The stagnation was considered as the most impactful in human history. Surprisingly, the incident also revealed that the education sector was most vulnerable and yet resilient. Schools that have been implementing e-learning/online learning/blended or flexible learning prior to the pandemic mostly survived and were able to adapt to the new normal while those heavily relied on face-to-face classes delivery suffered the most. Readiness and responsiveness were the two key factors for educational institutions to survive. Readiness here included not merely the preparation of e-learning and teaching resources but also the stakeholders' learning and teaching practices, habits and willingness. Schools' timely responses and decision making on the changes of policies, curricula, timetabling as well as choosing the appropriate learning and teaching platforms were equally important. This study looked specifically into one of Hong Kong largest vocational and professional education and training (VPET) institute's learning and teaching policy and students' online learning experience in response to the outbreak of the pandemic. The institute also experienced the closed down of campuses and classes suspension due to the social unrest in Hong Kong in 2019. This paper first reviewed the contingency policy followed by a study on the implementation of online learning and teaching activities during the pandemic. A questionnaire survey was then conducted to 1,381 full-time and 193 part-time students on their online learning experience for the enhancement of the online learning and teaching practices and future planning. Results of the study showed that online learning experience varied amongst students from different learning programmes. This study also found that part-time students had a more satisfying online learning experience and were more adaptable to online learning than full-time students.

Methods: We developed a decision-analytic Markov model of COVID-19 to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a booster strategy (administered 3 months after 2nd dose) in those aged []16 years in Australia from a healthcare system perspective. The willingness-to-pay threshold was chosen as A$ 50,000. Findings: Compared with 2-doses of COVID-19 vaccines without a booster, Australia's booster strategy would incur an additional cost of A$0.88 billion but save A$1.28 billion in direct medical cost and gain 670 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in 180 days of its implementation. This suggested the booster strategy is cost-saving, corresponding to a benefit-cost ratio of 1.45 and a net monetary benefit of A$0.43 billion. The strategy would prevent 1.32 million new infections, 65,170 hospitalisations, 6,927 ICU admissions and 1,348 deaths from COVID-19 in 180 days. Further, a universal booster strategy of having all individuals vaccinated with the booster shot immediately once their eligibility is met would have resulted in a gain of 1,599 QALYs, a net monetary benefit of A$1.46 billion and a benefit-cost ratio of 1.95 in 180 days.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our retrospective, observational study was performed in a university ICU from March to June 2020 (first wave) and from September 2020 to January 2021 (second wave). In first wave, patients received bundle 1 including early invasive ventilation, hydroxychloroquine, cefotaxime and azithromycin. In second wave, bundle 2 included non-invasive oxygenation support and dexamethasone. The main outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included ICU and hospital length of stay, ICU supportive therapies, viral clearance and antimicrobial resistance emergence. RESULTS: 129 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were admitted to our ICU. Thirty-five were treated according to bundle 1 and 76 to bundle 2. In-hospital mortality was similar in the two groups (23%, p = 1). The hospital (p = 0.003) and ICU (p = 0.01) length of stay and ventilator-free days at 28 days (p = 0.03) were significantly reduced in bundle 2. Increasing age, vasopressor use and PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 125 were associated with in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of our study, changes in therapeutic bundles for SARS-Cov-2 ICU patients might have no effect on in-hospital mortality but were associated with less exposure to mechanical ventilation and reduced hospital length of stay.","output":"Management of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in intensive care unit: An observational retrospective study comparing two bundles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the pandemic, significant bed occupancy rates were reached in the intensive care units of many hospitals.

Significant evidence suggests that the role of the parent nucleoside GS-441524 in the clinical outcomes of RDV could be largely underestimated. We performed an in vitro and in vivo drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics (DMPK) assessment to examine the potential of RDV, and particularly GS-441524, as oral drugs. In our in vitro assessments, RDV exhibited prohibitively low stability in human liver microsomes (HLMs, t(1/2) = 1 min), with the primary CYP-mediated metabolism being the mono-oxidation likely on the phosphoramidate moiety. This observation is poorly aligned with any potential oral use of RDV, though in the presence of cobicistat, the microsomal stability was drastically boosted to the level observed without enzyme cofactor NADPH. Conversely, GS-441524 showed excellent metabolic stability in human plasma and HLMs. In further in vivo studies in CD-1 mice, GS-441524 displayed a favorable oral bioavailability of 57%.

Because respiratory system static compliance (CRS) is mostly affected by the volume of the baby lung, the ratio VT/CRS (i.e. the driving pressure, P) may potentially help tailoring interventions on VT setting. RECENT FINDINGS Driving pressure is the ventilatory variable most strongly associated with changes in survival and has been shown to be the key mediator of the effects of mechanical ventilation on outcome in the acute respiratory distress syndrome. Observational data suggest an increased risk of death for patients with P more than 14 cmH2O, but a well tolerated threshold for this parameter has yet to be identified. Prone position along with simple ventilatory adjustments to facilitate CO2 clearance may help reduce P in isocapnic conditions. The safety and feasibility of low-flow extracorporeal CO2 removal in enhancing further reduction in VT and P are currently being investigated. SUMMARY Driving pressure is a bedside available parameter that may help identify patients prone to develop VILI and at increased risk of death. No study had prospectively evaluated whether interventions on P may provide a relevant clinical benefit, but it appears physiologically sound to try titrating VT to minimize P, especially when it is higher than 14 cmH2O and when it has minimal costs in terms of CO2 clearance.","output":"Should we use driving pressure to set tidal volume?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 disease causes various neurological disorders.

We present a novel surgical technique for successful management of intraluminal gastric GISTs that minimizes deformation of the stomach regardless of tumor location. MATERIALS AND METHODS The operating surgeon handles the tumor by holding tissue surrounding the tumor and performs seromyotomy using an ultrasonically activated device along the outer edge of the tumor. The tumor gradually protrudes like an extraluminal tumor as the seromyotomy proceeds. When seromyotomy along the tumor comes up to the point where the tumor sufficiently turns over the gastric serosa, the tumor looks like a pedunculated extraluminal GIST. Two seromuscular sutures are applied to close the exfoliated seromuscular layer. The tips of two seromuscular sutures are held and then pulled up toward the ventral side so that the staple line is aligned in line with the minor axis of the stomach. Finally, complete tumor removal with minimal seromuscular resection is accomplished by applying a linear stapler. RESULTS All patients resumed oral ingestion on the day after surgery and showed no signs of anastomotic constriction or obstruction. CONCLUSIONS Our laparoscopic procedure for gastric GISTs is simple and allows us easy and precise removal of the tumor and closure of the gastric wall with minimum necessary resection, regardless of the location and growth form of the tumors.","output":"A novel technique to minimize deformation of the stomach in laparoscopic partial gastrectomy for intraluminal gastric GISTs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study documents students' experiences during the Emergency Online Transition of Spring 2020 in a Spanish language program at a large public university in the United States.

Among presented data, we were surprised to see that serum albumin (ALB) concentrations during hospitalization did not significantly predict patient death at the multivariate analysis (MA), even if 86.6% of patients showed ALB values <35 g/L, i.e. the lower reference limit. In a similar COVID-19 population enrolled in our national reference center for infectious diseases, we recently analysed a group of common biochemistry tests, including ALB, as major predictor of COVID-19 severity (2). Although the patient rate showing an ALB <35 g/L was quite similar (89%) to that of Hundt's study, at MA low ALB concentrations remained significantly associated (P=0.003) with higher odds of death, ALB values &#8804;18 g/L giving a positive likelihood ratio of 12.2 for predicting in-hospital death. In terms of absolute ALB levels in the respective populations, it is however somewhat difficult to compare our results with those of Hundt et al. as the authors do not mention the methodology used to determine ALB in their hospital network. It is known that immunoturbidimetric assays for ALB determination, such as the one in use in our institution, are specific for the ALB measurement contrary to nonspecific colorimetric methods, which are in use in the majority of U.S. healthcare institutions, also reacting with proteins other than ALB (3). The well-known lack of specificity of the latter methods, especially at low ALB and high globulin (including \\"acute phase reactants\\") concentrations, i.e. the typical COVID-19 situation, may have influenced the Hundt's results. Figure 1 depicts ALB distribution in our COVID-19 patients showing that even survivors displayed a median (interquartile range) [28 g/L (25-32)] quite lower that patients with severe COVID-19 enrolled by Hundt et al. Therefore, we cannot exclude that the inability of ALB to predict death in the Hundt's study was due to spuriously higher ALB values measured with non-specific methods in the evaluated COVID-19 patients. The accuracy of ALB methods may become critical in COVID-19 cases, where ALB is decreased but acute-phase proteins are increased, and thus use of immunological assays should be preferred in this condition (4).","output":"Letter to the Editor: Serum Albumin in COVID-19: A Good Example in Which Analytical and Clinical Performance of a Laboratory Test Are Strictly Intertwined"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Staple-line bleeding and leakage are the most common serious complications of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.

These workers may still be confronted with late effects of cancer (treatment) possibly affecting their work ability. As little is known about the guidance of this group, the aim of this study was to explore the experiences and ideas of managers and professionals about the guidance of these workers in the case of late effects of cancer (treatment). Given the positive associations with work ability of the job resources autonomy, social support by colleagues and an open organisational culture found in several quantitative studies, these job resources were also discussed. Further ideas about the influences of other factors and points of attention in the guidance of this group of workers were explored. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with managers (n = 11) and professionals (n = 47). Data-collection was from November 2019 to June 2020. The data were coded and analysed using directed content analyses. RESULTS: The late effects of cancer or cancer treatment discussed were physical problems, fatigue, cognitive problems, anxiety for cancer recurrence, and a different view of life. The self-employed have less options for guidance but may struggle with late effects affecting work ability in the same way as the salaried. Late effects may affect work ability and various approaches have been described. Autonomy, social support of colleagues and an open organisational culture were regarded as beneficial. It was indicated that interventions need to be tailor-made and created in dialogue with the worker. CONCLUSIONS: Especially with respect to cognitive problems and fatigue, guidance sometimes turned out to be complicated. In general, the importance of psychological safety to be open about late effects that affect work ability was emphasized. Moreover, it is important to take the perspective of the worker as the starting point and explore the possibilities together with the worker.

Since its emergence, COVID-19 has been outbreaking rapidly worldwide, where the virus has so far caused the death of hundreds of thousands and infected more than a million, what has been called a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). According to the WHO-Coronavirus disease 2019 Situation Report-142, by June 10, 2020, there are 7,145,539 confirmed cases and 408,025 deaths. There is an urgent need to develop a suitable specific medicine against this novel coronavirus; therefore, scientists and researchers around the world are making great efforts endeavoring to discover an efficient specific medication for COVID-19 treatment. Given the similarity of the novel coronavirus with previous epidemic viruses, namely, the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), previously tested drugs could potentially work against the novel coronavirus. In this narrative review, we aim to summarize and discuss the effectiveness of current Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine options for COVID-19 treatment based on the overview of the scientific literature. Some Western medicines including remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and arbidol, as well as some traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) such as Qingfei Paidu decoction, Yupingfeng, Lianhua Qingwen, and TCM injections have revealed a relative activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, in observational studies, and in clinical trials. However, further extensive studies and clinical trials including double-blind and randomized clinical trials, with a higher number of patients, are necessary to confirm the activity of these medicines. There are several ongoing trials conducted on the drugs of COVID-19, and the results are urgently needed to make a suitable treatment recommendation.","output":"Advances in the treatment of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine: a narrative review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Hospital incident command (IC) systems facilitate emergency preparedness and response and are currently being used nationally during the COVID-19 pandemic. Electronic safety reporting systems provide real-time awareness from frontline staff on critical emerging patient safety issues. During an IC, some of the traditional structures for patient safety and risk identifying, investigating and escalating safety events change. We sought to develop an approach for integrating real-time patient safety event notification and response within our COVID- 19 IC structure. METHODS: A report was designed to curate daily COVID-19 related safety reports (SRs) and a team consisting of IC leadership, patient safety and risk management was assembled. A new process for identification, notification, escalation, communication and resolution of COVID-19 related SRs was developed and iterated through virtual huddles and emails. This process was deployed within a one-week period and tested over a three-week period. RESULTS: From 3/10/2020 to 4/10/2020, we identified 310 COVID-19 related safety reports, ranging from one to thirty per day. Key themes identified: 22.6% potential exposures to COVID-positive employees or patients, 22.3% about PPE, and 20.0% on screening procedures. Events were examined for the presence of potential systems problems and when discovered, systems improvements were implemented locally and systematically. CONCLUSION: A simple, virtual safety reporting process can identify real-time patient safety risks pertaining to COVID-19 and drive local and system-level improvement efforts through IC, during times of crisis. This model of a modified safety reporting and resolution through IC can be applied to other health systems and emergencies.","output":"Rapid-Cycle Improvement During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Using Safety Reports to Inform Incident Command"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There has been an increasing number of COVID-19 patients around the world. Since some patients developed with gastrointestinal bleeding, our study focused on the clinical features and gastroscopic findings of these patients, and factors associated with occult gastrointestinal bleeding. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective, observational study, we collected 368 COVID-19 patients who performed fecal or gastric occult blood from Wuhan Tongji Hospital, Jin Yin-tan Hospital, and Wuhan Union Hospital between February 1, 2020 and March 6, 2020. Clinical features were compared between patients with or without occult gastrointestinal bleeding, and gastroscopic findings of seven patients were described. Logistic regression analyses were performed to explore the factors associated with occult gastrointestinal bleeding. RESULTS: In total, 43 (11.7%) patients presented occult gastrointestinal bleeding, whereas 35 (81.4%) of severe cases. CRP level, prothrombin time and D-dimer were higher, while lymphocyte count and albumin levels were decreased in patients with occult gastrointestinal bleeding. Gastroscopy in seven COVID-19 patients showed mucosal congestion, erosion or scattered bleeding at different sites. Albumin levels (OR, 0.856 [95% CI 0.793C0.924]; p < 0.001), prothrombin time (OR, 1.267 [1.089C1.475]; p = 0.002) on admission and severe disease (OR, 4.157 [1.765C9.791]; p = 0.001) were independent factors associated with GIB in COVID-19 patients, while antiviral drugs and glucocorticoid therapy were not associated with it.

Data from different testing sites indicates different rates of positivity. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) allows for semi-quantitative estimates of viral load as time to crossing threshold (Ct) is inversely related to viral load. Objectives The objective of our study was to evaluate SARS-CoV2 RNA loads between paired nasopharyngeal (NP) and deep lung (endotracheal aspirate or BAL) samples from critically ill patients. Methods SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results were retrospectively reviewed for 51 critically ill patients from 5 intensive care units in 3 hospitals ; Addenbrookes Hospital Cambridge (3 units), Royal Papworth Cambridge (1 unit), and Royal Sunderland Hospital (1 unit). At the times when paired NP and deep lung samples were obtained, one patient had been on oxygen only, 6 patients on non-invasive ventilation, 18 patients on ECMO, and 26 patients mechanically ventilated. Results Results collected showed significant gradient between NP and deep lung viral loads. Median Ct value was 29 for NP samples and 24 for deep lung samples. Of 51 paired samples, 16 were negative (below limit of detection) on NP swabs but positive (above limit of detection) on deep lung sample, whilst 2 were negative on deep sample but positive on NP (both patients were on ECMO). Conclusions It has been suggested that whilst SARS-CoV1 tends to replicate in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV2 replicates more vigorously in the upper respiratory tract. These data challenge that assumption. These data suggest that viral migration to, and proliferation in, the lower respiratory tract may be a key factor in the progression to critical illness and the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Factors which promote this migration should be examined for association with severe COVID-19. From a practical point of view, patients with suspected severe COVID-19 should have virological samples obtained from the lower respiratory tract where-ever possible, as upper respiratory samples have a significant negative rate.","output":"Paired nasopharyngeal and deep lung testing for SARS-CoV2 reveals a viral gradient in critically ill patients: a multi-centre study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this progress report an overview is given on the use of the organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) as a biosensor for impedance sensing of cell layers. The transient OECT current can be used to detect changes in the impedance of the cell layer, as shown by Jimison et al. To circumvent the application of a high gate bias and preventing electrolysis of the electrolyte, in case of small impedance variations, an alternative measuring technique based on an OECT in a current-driven configuration is developed. The ion-sensitivity is larger than 1200 mV V-1 dec-1 at low operating voltage. It can be even further enhanced using an OECT based complementary amplifier, which consists of a p-type and an n-type OECT connected in series, as known from digital electronics. The monitoring of cell layer integrity and irreversible disruption of barrier function with the current-driven OECT is demonstrated for an epithelial Caco-2 cell layer, showing the enhanced ion-sensitivity as compared to the standard OECT configuration. As a state-of-the-art application of the current-driven OECT, the in situ monitoring of reversible tight junction modulation under the effect of drug additives, like poly-l-lysine, is discussed.

Referral rates fell by 93 per cent over seven weeks, from a mean of 5.4 to 0.4 per day. Reductions were seen in referrals from both primary care (89 per cent) and the accident and emergency department (93 per cent). Presentations of otitis externa and epistaxis fell by 83 per cent, and presentations of glandular fever, tonsillitis and peritonsillar abscess fell by 67 per cent. CONCLUSION: Coronavirus disease 2019 has greatly reduced the number of referrals into secondary care ENT. The cause for this reduction is likely to be due to patients increased perceived risk of the virus presence in a medical setting.

Our previous results indicated that the mouse-adapted phenotype maps to the Lansing viral capsid. To further define regions of the capsid that are specifically involved in the infection of mice, antigenic variants resistant to neutralization with monoclonal antibodies were selected, and their mouse neurovirulence was studied. The monoclonal antibodies used were directed against antigenic site 1, an immunodominant loop of capsid polypeptide VP1 located on the virion surface. Ten of twenty-two variants selected had lower intracerebral neurovirulence in mice when compared to the parental virus. Four of the ten antigenic variants with reduced neurovirulence were temperature sensitive (ts) for replication in HeLa cells, while the remaining six variants replicated in HeLa cells as well as the parent virus. Two ts+ variants that were studied had a reduced ability to replicate in the mouse brain. There was no difference in the histopathology and pattern of involvement in the central nervous system of one variant compared to the parent virus. In three variants, reduction of neurovirulence correlated with specific amino acid substitutions at positions 100 and 101 of VP1, located within antigenic site 1. The is phenotype in three variants was associated with a single amino acid deletion at position 105. Virus recovered from the brain of paralyzed mice that had been inoculated with the antigenic variants was characterized to identify the virus causing disease. In most cases, brain isolates resembled the inoculated virus in neurovirulence and amino acid sequence at the antigenic site. Virus recovered from brains of paralyzed mice that had been inoculated with the is variants was either ts+ or cold sensitive, and had become more neurovirulent.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Inclusion of 102 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by positive real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on throat swabs underwent chest CT (53 men and 49 women, 15-79 years old, 84 cases with mild and 18 cases with severe disease). The CT-SS was defined by summing up individual scores from 20 lung regions; scores of 0, 1, and 2 were respectively assigned for each region if parenchymal opacification involved 0%, less than 50%, or equal or more than 50% of each region (theoretical range of CT-SS from 0 to 40). The clinical and laboratory data were collected, and patients were clinically subdivided according to disease severity by the Chinese National Health Commission guidelines. RESULTS: The posterior segment of upper lobe (left, 68/102; right, 68/102), superior segment of lower lobe (left, 79/102; right, 79/102), lateral basal segment (left, 79/102; right, 70/102) and posterior basal segment of lower lobe (left, 81/102; right, 83/102) were the most frequently involved sites in COVID-19.

The aim of the study to assess primary health care (PHC) physicians knowledge and adherence regarding Saudi Ministry of Health guidelines regarding MERS-CoV. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was followed to include 85 PHC physicians in Abha city. An interview questionnaire has been designed by the researcher that was used to assess knowledge and practices of PHC physicians regarding diagnosis and management of MERS-CoV. It includes personal characteristics, the MERS-CoV knowledge assessment questionnaire, and practices related to adherence toward guidelines regarding MERS-CoV. RESULTS: PHC physicians knowledge gaps regarding MERS-CoV included protected exposure (32.9%), highest seasonal incidence of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia (60%), relation between incidence of MERS-CoV and overcrowding (62.4%), case fatality of MERS-CoV cases (63.5%), and collecting specimens from MERS-CoV patients (64.7%). The knowledge of PHC physicians about MERS-CoV was poor among 5.9%, good among 63.5%, and excellent among 30.6%. Personal protective equipment to be used when seeing suspected cases of MERS-CoV infection were mainly the mask (94.1%), gloves (78.8%), the gown (60%), goggles (31.8%), and the cap (22.4%). All participants stated that the most important standard precaution that should be applied when seeing a case of MERS-CoV infection is hand washing, whereas 97.6% stated that the most important respiratory precaution to prevent transmission of respiratory infections in PHC setting when seeing a case of MERS-CoV infection is masking and separation of suspected MERS-CoV patients, and 81.2% stated that upon exit from the room of a MERS-CoV patient, the physician should remove and discard personal protective equipment. PHC physicians knowledge about MERS-CoV differed significantly according to their nationality (P = 0.038), with non-Saudi physicians expressing higher percent of excellent knowledge than Saudi physicians (40% and 20%, respectively). Those who attended continuing medical education (CME) activities had significantly higher percent of excellent knowledge than those who did not attend a CME activity (55.6% and 23.9%, respectively, P = 0.011).

This study was conducted to investigate whether proximity to railway stations, a proxy for utilization, was associated with higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection across small-areas of the Lisbon Metropolitan Area (Portugal). Methods: The number of SARS-CoV-2 confirmed infections from March 2 until July 5, 2020 at the parish-level was obtained from the National Epidemiological Surveillance System. A Geographic Information System was used to estimate proximity to railway stations of the six railway lines operating in the area.

Results: Between May 2 and July 5, 2020, there were a total of 17,168 SARS-CoV-2 infections in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, with wide disparities between parishes. Overall, parishes near any of the railway stations of the Sintra line presented significantly higher SARS-CoV-2 infection rates (RR = 1.42, 95%CI 1.16, 1.75) compared to parishes located farther away from railway stations, while the opposite was observed for parishes near other railway stations (Sado and Fertagus lines), where infection rates were significantly lower than those observed in parishes located farther away from railway stations (RR = 0.66, 95%CI 0.50, 0.87).

The most frequent procedure was fracture reduction (50/60, 83.3%). Procedures were successfully completed for 59 (98.3%) of 60 patients. The initial dose of etomidate associated with adequate sedation was 0.2 mg/kg intravenously administered for 33 (66.7%) of 50 patients requiring fracture reduction and for 6 (60.0%) of 10 patients receiving a procedure other than fracture reduction. Respiratory depression was noted in 9 (16.4%) of 55 patients, and oxygen desaturation was noted in 23 (39.0%) of 59 patients. Of 58 patients, 21 (36.2%) experienced a respiratory adverse event requiring brief intervention including oxygen supplementation, stimulation, and/or airway repositioning. No patient experienced a significant adverse respiratory event, defined as positive pressure ventilation. Median time to discharge-ready was 21 minutes. CONCLUSIONS For short-duration painful emergency department procedures, etomidate 0.2 mg/kg intravenously administered after fentanyl was associated with effective sedation, successful procedural completion, and readily managed respiratory adverse events in children.","output":"Etomidate for short pediatric procedures in the emergency department."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tsai and colleagues used Medicare claims data to examine the characteristics and medical spending of older adults diagnosed with COVID-19 from April through December 2020.

The main chemical species of PM2.5 all decreased with the reductions ranging from 0.85 g m-3 (chloride) to 9.86 g m-3 (nitrate) (p < 0.01). Positive matrix factorization model indicated that the mass contributions of seven PM2.5 sources all decreased. However, their contribution percentages varied from -11.0% (industrial processes) to 8.70% (secondary inorganic aerosol). Source contributions of PM2.5 transported from potential geographical regions showed reductions with mean values ranging from 0.22 to 4.36 g m-3.

The barriers to rapid and transparent information sharing are numerous. While governments must be held accountable for delaying or withholding information, in many cases non-compliance may be a rational response to real and perceived risks rather than a problem of technical incapacity or a lack of political commitment.

Many cities have established designated fever clinics to triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients with similar symptoms. However, given the limited availability of the nucleic acid test as well as long waiting time for both the test and radiographic examination, the quarantine or therapeutic decisions for a large number of mixed patients were often not made in time. We aimed to identify simple and quickly available laboratory biomarkers to facilitate effective triage at the fever clinics for sorting suspected COVID-19 patients from those with COVID-19-like symptoms. Methods: We collected clinical, etiological, and laboratory data of 989 patients who visited the Fever Clinic at Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan, China, from Jan 31 to Feb 21. Based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection, they were divided into two groups: SARS-CoV-2-positive patients as cases and SARS-CoV-2-negative patients as controls. We compared the clinical features and laboratory findings of the two groups, and analyzed the diagnostic performance of several laboratory parameters in predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection and made relevant comparisons to the China diagnosis guideline of having a normal or decreased number of leukocytes (&#8804;9a?5 109/L) or lymphopenia (<1a?1 109/L). Findings: Normal or decreased number of leukocytes (&#8804;9a?5 109/L), lymphopenia (<1a?1 109/L), eosinopenia (<0a?02 109/L), and elevated hs-CRP (&#8805;4 mg/L) were presented in 95a?0%, 52a?2%, 74a?7% and 86a?7% of COVID-19 patients, much higher than 87a?2%, 28a?8%, 31a?3% and 45a?2% of the controls, respectively. The eosinopenia produced a sensitivity of 74a?7% and specificity of 68a?7% for separating the two groups with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0a?717. The combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP yielded a sensitivity of 67a?9% and specificity of 78a?2% (AUC=0a?730). The addition of eosinopenia alone or the combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP into the guideline-recommended diagnostic parameters for COVID-19 improved the predictive capacity with higher than zero of both net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). Interpretation: The combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP can effectively triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients attending the fever clinic with COVID-19-like initial symptoms. This finding would be particularly useful for designing triage strategies in an epidemic region having a large number of patients with COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases while limited medical resources for nucleic acid tests and radiographic examination.

Additionally, the RT-LAMP based assay can be used to detect single-site differences in target genes using two one-step displacement (OSD) probes targeting wild-type and mutant S genes. The fluorescence intensity of the OSD probe is only related to the template sequence, rather than the concentration of the templates.

METHODS AND RESULTS: ZnO NPs were synthesized through an ecofriendly approach using leaves extract of W. coagulans and characterized through various spectroscopic approaches i.e. fourier transform infrared spectroscopic (FTIR), UV-visible spectroscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy. The antibacterial effect of W. coagulans leaf extract and ZnO NPs alone and in combination was tested in vitro and in vivo against bacterial wilt pathogen in tomato plants. The results showed that combine application of leaf extract and ZnO NPs inhibited in vitro growth of R. solanacearum more than applying alone.

Hospital workers are at high risk of mental illness, such as anxiety and depression. Furthermore, they also face many social stresses, such as deterioration of human relations and income reduction. Apart from mental illness, these social stresses can reduce motivation and lead to voluntary absenteeism, which contribute to a collapse of medical systems. Thus, for maintaining medical systems, it is crucial to clarify risk factors for both mental illness and increased social stress among hospital workers. However, little attention has been paid to factors affecting social stress, and thus, we aimed to address this gap. METHODS: In this cross-sectional survey of 588 hospital workers, the levels of anxiety, depression, and social stress were assessed using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and Tokyo Metropolitan Distress Scale for Pandemic (TMDP). Multiple regression analyses were conducted to identify the demographic variables affecting these problems. RESULTS: Older age and female sex were common risk factors for anxiety, depression, and social stress. Moreover, occupational exposure to COVID-19 and hospital staff other than doctors/fewer non-work days were risk factors for increased anxiety and depression, respectively. Furthermore, living with families/others was a risk factor for increased social stress during this pandemic.

More recent researches on SARS-COV-2 suggests the entry of the virus into the host cell using the host entry factors like TMPRSS-2, TMPRSS-4 and ACE-2 in the oral tissues. The spike proteins of the SARS COV-2 attaches to the ACE-2 and TMPRSS2 of the salivary gland. Saliva provides the lubrication of the oral cavity, initiation of digestion and provides immunity in host. A complete research of all the articles was done using databases like: SCOPUS, PUBMED, EMBASE and WEB OF SCIENCE. In case of SARS CoV-2, the salivary glands act as reservoir for the virus. Intake of these viruses present in infectious saliva droplets found in the air would lead to the transmission of infection to an individual.

There is however a need for greater coordination, with limited resources and the shifting global nature of the pandemic resulting in a proliferation of research projects underpowered and unable to achieve their aims. Methods: The UK Collaborative on Development Research (UKCDR) and Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness (GloPID-R), two funder coordination groups have collaborated to develop a live database of funded research projects across the world relating to COVID-19. Drawing data continually from their members and further global funding bodies, as of 15 th January 2021 the database contains 7,778 projects, funded by 101 funders, taking place across 136 countries representing an investment of at least $3.8 billion. To our knowledge it is one of the most comprehensive databases. The database is aligned to the World Health Organisation (WHO) Global Research Roadmap: 2019 Novel Coronavirus. It is being used by the WHO, governments and multi-lateral policy makers, research funders and researchers. This living mapping review aims to supplement the database by providing an open accessible and frequently updated resource summarising the characteristics of the COVID-19 funded research portfolio. Both descriptive and thematic analysis will be presented and updated frequently to aid interpretation of the global COVID-19 funded research portfolio. Results: In this version three analysis we provide an updated detailed descriptive analysis of the database (three months after version two) and focus our thematic analysis on research gaps, research areas in need of coordination, study populations and research locations (with a focus on resource-limited countries).

DC EXO are eobiotic, meaning they are well-tolerated by the host; moreover, they can be custom-tailored for immune-regulatory or -stimulatory functions, thus presenting attractive opportunities for immune therapy. Previously we documented the efficacy of immunoregulatory DCs EXO (regDCs EXO) as immunotherapy for inflammatory bone disease, in an in-vivo model. We showed a key role for encapsulated TGF?1 in promoting a bone sparing immune response. However, the on- and off-target effects of these therapeutic regDC EXO and how target signaling in acceptor cells is activated is unclear. In the present report, therapeutic regDC EXO were analyzed by high throughput proteomics, with non-therapeutic EXO from immature DCs and mature DCs as controls, to identify shared and distinct proteins and potential off-target proteins, as corroborated by immunoblot. The predominant expression in regDC EXO of immunoregulatory proteins as well as proteins involved in trafficking from the circulation to peripheral tissues, cell surface binding, and transmigration, prompted us to investigate how these DC EXO are biodistributed to major organs after intravenous injection. Live animal imaging showed preferential accumulation of regDCs EXO in the lungs, followed by spleen and liver tissue. In addition, TGF?1 in regDCs EXO sustained downstream signaling in acceptor DCs. Blocking experiments suggested that sustaining TGF?1 signaling require initial interaction of regDCs EXO with TGF?1R followed by internalization of regDCs EXO with TGF?1-TGF?1R complex. Finally, these regDCs EXO that contain immunoregulatory cargo and showed biodistribution to lungs could downregulate the main severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) target receptor, ACE2 on recipient lung parenchymal cells via TGF?1 in-vitro.

Through document and thematic analysis on a Brazilian professional football club's youth academy program, we promoted a dialogue between the process of adaptation to remote theoretical-tactical teaching with the learning theory proposed by Hodkinson and collaborators. The main theme of analysis of this study was the remote structure of the theoretical-tactical learning and physical training. Challenged with the need to transpose face-to-face activities into a learning culture based on remote communication, the U15 team coaching staff created a process to prescribe physical training, and to teach and discuss football tactical issues with young players during the period of social isolation. This perspective article shows that it is possible for sports institutions to create programs for the development of young athletes within the social isolation/distancing context, considering both theoretical-tactical learning and physical training processes. The adaptation to remote environments as structures for the learning culture seems a challenge, but is also a good alternative for young players to develop their interpretation and perception of football theoretical-tactical issues.","output":"What Will We Do?

This spectrum of hyperinflammation in COVID-19 is commonly referred to as cytokine storm syndrome (CSS). Areas covered: Medline and Google Scholar were searched up until 15th of August 2020 for relevant literature. Evidence supports a role of dysregulated immune responses in the immunopathogenesis of severe COVID-19. CSS associated with SARS-CoV-2 shows similarities to the exuberant cytokine production in some patients with viral infection (e.g.SARS-CoV-1) and may be confused with other syndromes of hyperinflammation like the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in CAR-T cell therapy. Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha have emerged as predictors of COVID-19 severity and in-hospital mortality. Expert opinion: Despite similarities, COVID-19-CSS appears to be distinct from HLH, MAS, and CRS, and the application of HLH diagnostic scores and criteria to COVID-19 is not supported by emerging data. While immunosuppressive therapy with glucocorticoids has shown a mortality benefit, cytokine inhibitors may hold promise as 'rescue therapies' in severe COVID-19. Given the arguably limited benefit in advanced disease, strategies to prevent the development of COVID-19-CSS are needed.","output":"Coronavirus disease 2019: investigational therapies in the prevention and treatment of hyperinflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused recurring and major outbreaks in multiple human populations around the world.

Depending on the immune status of the affected individual early disease control can be reached by a robust type-I-interferon (type-I-IFN) response restricting viral replication. If type-I-IFN upregulation is impaired, patients develop severe COVID-19 that involves profound alveolitis, endothelitis, complement activation, recruitment of immune cells, as well as immunothrombosis. In patients with proper initial disease control there can be a second flare of type-I-IFN release leading to post-COVID manifestation such as chilblain-like lesions that are characterized by thrombosis of small vessels in addition to an inflammatory infiltrate resembling lupus erythematosus (LE). Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2 invades pneumocytes and endothelial cells by acting on angiotensin-II-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). It is hypothesized, that viral uptake might downregulate ACE2 bioavailability and enhance angiotensin-II-derived pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic state. Since ACE2 is encoded on the X chromosome these conditions might also be influenced by gender-specific regulation. Taken together, SARS-CoV-2 infection affects the vascular compartment leading to variable thrombogenic or inflammatory response depending on the individual immune response status.","output":"Molecular mechanisms of vasculopathy and coagulopathy in COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel series of indolylthiosemicarbazides (6aC6g) and their cyclization products, 4-thiazolidinones (7aC7g), have been designed, synthesized and evaluated, in vitro, for their antiviral activity against a wide range of DNA and RNA viruses. Compounds 6a, 6b, 6c and 6d exhibited notable antiviral activity against Coxsackie B4 virus, at EC(50) values ranging from 0.4 to 2.1 g/mL. The selectivity index (ratio of cytotoxic to antivirally effective concentration) values of these compounds were between 9 and 56. Besides, 6b, 6c and 6d also inhibited the replication of two other RNA viruses, Sindbis virus and respiratory syncytial virus, although these EC(50) values were higher compared to those noted for Coxsackie B4 virus. The SAR analysis indicated that keeping the free thiosemicarbazide moiety is crucial to obtain this antiviral activity, since the cyclization products (7aC7g) did not produce any antiviral effect.","output":"Synthesis and antiviral properties of novel indole-based thiosemicarbazides and 4-thiazolidinones"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two different sarbecoviruses have caused major human outbreaks in the last two decades1,2. Both these sarbecoviruses, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, engage ACE2 via the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD)2C6. However, binding to ACE2 orthologs from humans, bats, and other species has been observed only sporadically among the broader diversity of bat sarbecoviruses7C11. Here, we use high-throughput assays12 to trace the evolutionary history of ACE2 binding across a diverse range of sarbecoviruses and ACE2 orthologs. We find that ACE2 binding is an ancestral trait of sarbecovirus RBDs that has subsequently been lost in some clades. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time that bat sarbecoviruses from outside Asia can bind ACE2. In addition, ACE2 binding is highly evolvable: for many sarbecovirus RBDs there are single amino-acid mutations that enable binding to new ACE2 orthologs. However, the effects of individual mutations can differ markedly between viruses, as illustrated by the N501Y mutation which enhances human ACE2 binding affinity within several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern12 but severely dampens it for SARS-CoV-1. Our results point to the deep ancestral origin and evolutionary plasticity of ACE2 binding, broadening consideration of the range of sarbecoviruses with spillover potential.","output":"ACE2 binding is an ancestral and evolvable trait of sarbecoviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late 2020, as soon as the approval of the first vaccines against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) became foreseeable in line with the normative political goal of providing comparable living conditions to all residents of Germany irrespective of where they live, the German national governments national vaccination strategy called for the widespread establishment of COVID-19 vaccination centers. As the vaccination program has been rolled out, difficulties in accessing vaccination centers have been reported. Against this background, the paper considers the questions whether, where and for whom spatial inequalities in COVID-19 vaccination center accessibility in Germany might exist. Such an understanding might help to prepare for future situations when adequate disaster response requires, similar to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government to quickly reach great parts of the population in an efficient manner. To approach this question, we examine the accessibility by the means of transport foot, bicycle, car and public transport at small scale based on an accessibility model from the point of view of the households. We found that in contrast to the common belief COVID-19 vaccination center accessibility or inaccessibility in Germany does not seem to be a spatial phenomenon cheating non-rural regions and discriminating rural regions as anticipated, it is instead strongly dependent on peoples individual mobility capabilities in both rural and urban areas.","output":"Accessibility of COVID-19 Vaccination Centers in Germany via Different Means of Transport"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease, named COVID-19, emerged in China in December 2019, and has rapidly spread around the world. It is clearly urgent to fight COVID-19 at global scale. The development of methods for identifying drug uses based on phenotypic data can improve the efficiency of drug development. However, there are still many difficulties in identifying drug applications based on cell picture data. This work reported one state-of-the-art machine learning method to identify drug uses based on the cell image features of 1024 drugs generated in the LINCS program. Because the multi-dimensional features of the image are affected by non-experimental factors, the characteristics of similar drugs vary greatly, and the current sample number is not enough to use deep learning and other methods are used for learning optimization. As a consequence, this study is based on the supervised ITML algorithm to convert the characteristics of drugs. The results show that the characteristics of ITML conversion are more conducive to the recognition of drug functions. The analysis of feature conversion shows that different features play important roles in identifying different drug functions. For the current COVID-19, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine achieve antiviral effects by inhibiting endocytosis, etc., and were classified to the same community.

DESIGN AND SETTING: A cross-sectional online survey. PARTICIPANTS: Full-time nursing and non-nursing undergraduate students. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) were used to determine the emotional status in the COVID-19 pandemic among nursing and non-nursing students. Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) was used to measure the emotion regulation strategies and the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ) was used to evaluate the coping methods among nursing and non-nursing students. RESULTS: In total, 746 students including 366 nursing students and 380 non-nursing students participated in the survey. Compared with the non-nursing students, a significant decrease was noticed in GAD-7 score (p<0.01) and PHQ-9 (p<0.01) in the nursing students. The cognition re-evaluation score in the nursing students was significantly lower than that of the non-nursing students (p<0.05). In the nursing students, the score of anxiety was positively correlated with ERQ expression inhibition (p<0.01) and SCSQ negative coping (p<0.01), while the score of depression was also positively correlated with ERQ expression inhibition (p<0.01) and SCSQ negative coping (p<0.01). There was a negative correlation between SCSQ and the scores of anxiety (p<0.05) and depression (p<0.05). In the non-nursing students, the anxiety score was positively correlated with the SCSQ negative coping (p<0.01), while the depression score was positively correlated with the ERQ expression inhibition (p<0.01) and SCSQ negative coping (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 affected the emotional status of nursing and non-nursing students. The emotional status was correlated with the emotional regulation and coping methods. Staff involved in the nursing professionals should pay attention to the psychological status of the nursing and non-nursing students, and give moderate psychological interference in the presence of COVID-19.","output":"Emotional states and coping methods in nursing and non-nursing students responding to COVID-19: a cross-sectional study in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To investigate the dynamic evolution of image features of COVID-19 patients appearing as a solitary lesion at initial chest CT scan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-two COVID-19 patients with solitary pulmonary lesion from three hospitals in China were enrolled from January 18, 2020 to March 18, 2020. The clinical feature and laboratory findings at first visit, as well as characteristics and dynamic evolution of chest CT images were analyzed. Among them, the CT score evaluation was the sum of the lung involvement in five lobes (0-5 points for each lobe, with a total score ranging from 0 to 25). RESULTS: 22 COVID-19 patients (11 males and 11 females, with an average age of 40.7  10.3) developed a solitary pulmonary lesion within 4 days after the onset of symptoms, the peak time of CT score was about 11 days (with a median CT score of 6), and was discharged about 19 days. The peak of CT score was positively correlated with the peak time and the discharge time (p < 0.001, r = 0.793; p < 0.001, r = 0.715). Scan-1 (first visit): 22 cases (100%) showed GGO and one lobe was involved, CT score was 1.0/1.0 (median/IQR). Scan-2 (peak): 15 cases (68%) showed crazy-paving pattern, 19 cases (86%) showed consolidation, and 2.5 lobes were involved, CT score was 6.0/12.0. Scan-3 (before discharge): ten cases (45%) showed linear opacities, none had crazy-paving pattern, and 2.5 lobes were involved, CT score was 6.0/11.0. Scan-4 (after discharge): three cases (19%) showed linear opacities and one lobe was involved, CT score was 2.0/5.0. CONCLUSION: The chest CT features are related to the course of COVID-19 disease, and dynamic chest CT scan are helpful to monitor disease progress and patients' condition. In recovered patients with COVID-19, the positive CT manifestations were found within 4 days, lung involvement peaking at approximately 11 days, and discharged at about 19 days. The patients with more severe the lung injury was, the later the peak time appeared and the longer the recovery time was. Although the lesion was resolved over time, isolation and reexamination were required after discharge.","output":"Dynamic changes on chest CT of COVID-19 patients with solitary pulmonary lesion in initial CT"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inter-sectoral volatility linkages in the Chinese stock market are understudied, especially asymmetries in realized volatility connectedness, accounting for the catastrophic event associated with the COVID-19 outbreak In this paper, we examine the asymmetric volatility spillover among Chinese stock market sectors during the COVID-19 pandemic using 1-min data from January 2, 2019 to September 30, 2020 In doing so, we build networks of generalized forecast error variances by decomposition of a vector autoregressive model, controlling for overall market movements Our results show evidence of the asymmetric impact of good and bad volatilities, which are found to be time-varying and substantially intense during the COVID-19 period Notably, bad volatility spillover shocks dominate good volatility spillover shocks The findings are useful for Chinese investors and portfolio managers constructing risk hedging portfolios across sectors and for Chinese policymakers monitoring and crafting stimulating policies for the stock market at the sectoral level","output":"Asymmetric volatility spillover among Chinese sectors during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To discuss the emotional labor in pediatric nursing considering the repercussions of COVID-19 in childhood and adolescence.
